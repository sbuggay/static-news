This was during the heyday of BBSes, when he joined our small team at Mustang Software after Mustang bought Qmodem. John moved to Bakersfield California (with his family, including OP!) to be with us. John left a few years later due to I think business differences with management.<p>John was personable and full of joy. He always loved a good joke. I remember the parties (not wild, we were pretty tame back then) we would have around the pool at his place. He was generous with his time.<p>The story of Qmodem itself was a bit different. Qmodem for DOS was a one-man shareware business and was John&#x27;s pride and joy. It was clear that he poured everything into that program. It was finely tuned and just worked. Times were changing though, and people were calling for a Windows version. Unfortunately, John was not interested in learning Windows programming, so Scott Hunter (now at Microsoft), Dan Horn, and I built Qmodem for Windows. It was good, but it really never had the same level of polish that John&#x27;s work did. It was &quot;Qmodem&quot; in name only.<p>After John left Mustang he also left Bakersfield and I lost touch with him. I&#x27;m sure he continued to make the people around him smile. Thank you for your time and contributions, John.</div><br/><div id="42553056" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42553056" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">geocrasher</span><span>|</span><a href="#42552719">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42553295">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42553056">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42553056">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In the mid 1990&#x27;s, as a teen, I once was hired to cold call a bunch of software companies to contribute to some non-profit, and I recall calling Mustang Software.<p>That was 30 years ago.

Just reading the word &quot;QModem&quot; gave me an instant flashback to my youth. QModem was my gateway to the outside world.<p>I grew up way out in the country. I was the 80s and I was pretty isolated from technology and didn&#x27;t even know anyone who cared about it at first. I started tinkering with our home PC, and I finally purchased a modem and figured out how to connect to BBSs. This changed my life. I had many sleepless nights as teenager, connecting everywhere I could. QModem was like a fancy car that drove me anywhere I wanted to go.<p>I became obsessed with learning and tweaking things. AT commands, autoexec.bat, QModem scripting. Whatever I could figure out to get maximum performance and fast download speeds. Because of Qmodem, I could download games, text files, and even talk with other people. This moment in time defined my future. I knew right then what I wanted to do with my life.<p>I owe thanks to your father and what he built for my wonderful career, and 40 years of enjoying technology. Without something as easy to learn and reliable as QModem, who knows what path my life would have taken.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42553343" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42553343" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mericson</span><span>|</span><a href="#42552702">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42552389">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42553343">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42553343">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">John helped get me and my college roommate started with Linux system administration and web development three decades ago. We both grew up in in the town in Iowa where John lived, and my roommate had met him around the time we went to college in the mid nineties. We were both nerdy engineering majors who had gotten exposed to Unix through our college dial-up shell accounts, and we had managed to scavenge together enough computer parts — an old 386 motherboard, a discarded hard drive that just needed a molex connector soldered back onto it, a spare floppy drive — to assemble a computer just barely capable of running Linux.<p>I remember lugging it all over to John’s basement where he helped us install Slackware Linux from a giant stack of 5 1&#x2F;4 floppies he had.<p>Later, when John was running up a dial-up ISP in town, he let us park that server at his ISP, so we had a full Linux server of our own connected to a T1 with its own public IP address, and where we had root access and could experiment with running our own web and email servers and other such things. Back then in dial-up days, having a Linux server of our own on the Internet seemed unbelievable, and I will always be deeply appreciative to John for that opportunity.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42552389" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42552389" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bwann</span><span>|</span><a href="#42553343">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42552205">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42552389">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42552389">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Qmodem was my favorite comm program during the BBS days, and it still is today when working with vintage computers. It was just nice to use. Its scripting language was the first I used and I find myself wishing there was a Linux comm program with scripting that worked that well. Long distance calls were expensive so I used a Qmodem script to call BBSs each morning to download my email before school.<p>Just the last several months I&#x27;ve been using Qmodem scripting to make thousands of modem calls over VoIP to test downloads to see which models and ATAs work best.<p>After I jumped back into the vintage BBS world I&#x27;ve been keeping an eye out for anything Qmodem. I recently just picked up a Qmodem manual on ebay that I wanted to scan and archive, because it&#x27;s pretty rare to see.<p>Not too long ago I saw where John had posted to a FB group he was working on a new DOS version of Qmodem, my first interaction with him.

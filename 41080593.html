obvious reasons. But I like Arendt&#x27;s picture of it as an uncomfortable
inner tension when we simultaneously see what what we want to be (or
should morally do), and an alternative path set out by habit and
company.<p>To me, will is a very important component in security, it&#x27;s that
tense feeling you get just before you;<p><pre><code>  - decide the video conference with your boss urging you to transfer
    $1m into a Swiss account might not be as it seems, and pull the
    plug (risking being fired)

  - walk out of the shop that stubbornly refused to take cash (risking
    social embarrassment)

  - refuse a significant discount in exchange for giving personal
    information (taking financial loss on principle)

  - tell someone in a more authoritative position, no you won&#x27;t be
    joining them via Teams&#x2F;Zoom because of its security risks (risking
    unpopularity)

What we find in cybersecurity incident autopsies is that people say &quot;I
knew X wasn&#x27;t right. All my spidery feelings and heckles were on red
alert, but I didn&#x27;t <i>act</i>, and I don&#x27;t know why.&quot;<p>So in another piece I wrote;<p><pre><code>    Our culture is now about to split into two camps; the normative
    and the secure. Instead of &quot;the haves and have-nots&quot;, there will
    be &quot;the will, and the will-nots&quot;. Those who will compromise and
    those who will not compromise security. Those who choose security
    over convenience. Those who choose security against the nagging
    &quot;advice&quot; of corporations and governments to adopt a weaker
    position favourable to &quot;markets&quot;.</code></pre></div><br/><div id="41091471" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41091471" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vinnyvichy</span><span>|</span><a href="#41089978">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41090287">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41091471">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41091471">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks!

The will is the appetite of the intellect, oriented toward the good (real or apparent), and so one cannot just will <i>anything</i>, but rather, only of the things that the intellect first apprehends. (Of course, the will can also turn the intellect away from things we&#x27;d rather not know or have due awareness of, and this is the essence of the evil act; an act of self-blinding in order to move the will toward what we know we should not choose.) So freedom is in choosing or willing the good, what one ought, and for that, as the article notes by way of Augustine, we need the right habits, and this is what we call virtue. Here, the virtue of being able to choose the good is prudence. And since freedom classically understood is found in the ability to will the good, only a virtuous person is free. Compare this with the liberal (as in Hobbes, Locke, Mill) notion of freedom as the absence of external limitation. It becomes apparent what lunacy that is, as choosing anything but the good is, again to draw from Augustine, nothing short of the worst kind of slavery, a slavery to passions and vice. Thus, this modern notion of &quot;authenticity&quot; is, frankly, total bullshit, and a completely destructive notion at that.</div><br/><div id="41091415" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41091415" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vinnyvichy</span><span>|</span><a href="#41090287">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41091058">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41091415">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41091415">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The giant pachyderm in the room of modernism (arguably <i>the largest</i> pachyderm):<p>any post-liberal program of self-moderation needs to account for the magic of intragenerational QoL improvements (even if we restrict ourselves to considering only the inner life).<p>We can all go Greek, Latin, Pali, or Classical Chinese in search of questions and answers, but those civilizations didn&#x27;t have either mass literacy or tech.<p>Once upon a time (last century) we had to contend with the Eastern Bloc&#x27;s moral positioning, but since the end of That no one who suggests putting personal growth (of the psychological kind) ahead of the economic one has been taken seriously.<p>(And this is why @nonrandomstring above gets upvoted, even though I like your post better)</div><br/></div></div><div id="41091058" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41091058" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">motohagiography</span><span>|</span><a href="#41090287">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41091415">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41091058">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41091058">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I also got the sense the way authentic self was presented was kind of morally nullifying, a variation that reduced to &quot;do what thou wilt,&quot; where the animal chaos is the true self, instead of the active exercise of choosing good. What Arendt was clearly onto has been said elsewhere as something along the lines of, nothing short of indefatigable exertion can induce the habit of virtue, where she notes Augustine emphasized it was this regular exercise of virtue that would render the soul pure, where Heidegger appears to be taking it for granted as a base state we need to strip away our experiences to find.<p>I&#x27;ve been down both roads and have spent a lot of time alone in the woods at night to find the fears that only exist without others around, and really, it&#x27;s dwelling on the past. The search for Heideggers authentic self is a substitute for engaging the present and the real. Worse, it&#x27;s neutralizing. If you want prevail over hell, it&#x27;s other people, and engagement the necessary condition.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

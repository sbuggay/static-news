A lot of domestic power that gets contributed to the grid never leaves the neighborhood. These things aren&#x27;t always as clear cut.<p>The key to lower prices on the grid is more flexible and localized pricing. Power suppliers don&#x27;t like this because it favors cheaper sources of power that push their more expensive legacy generation out of the market. But it would create price incentives for demand and supply to align better.<p>A good example is the UK, which has national energy pricing and a lot of excess wind power in Scottland that is often being curtailed at the same time gas plants further south need to power up to power local demand there. End result: the Scottish pay the same high rate even though they are literally discarding energy they don&#x27;t know what to do with. If they had local energy pricing, their rates would go down a lot because they have a lot of wind power most of the time.<p>And further south, people would either invest in local power generation (instead of far away in Scottland) or actually relocate data centers and other energy intensive businesses to where the power is cheap. As opposed to e.g. Slough.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

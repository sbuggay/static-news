The narrative covers people and events from early 20th century discoveries leading to the science of nuclear fission, through the Manhattan Project and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&quot;<p>Possibly the best book that I have ever read.

This is often fairly stable, and can be further controlled with moderating systems (e.g., control rods, circulating water, or neutron reflectors which <i>increase</i> neutron flow).  There&#x27;s also the matter of &quot;prompt&quot; vs. &quot;delayed&quot; neutrons.  The first, prompt neutrons, are emitted immediately following a fission event, the latter occur after some delay, from milliseconds to minutes or longer.  The ratio of prompt to delayed neutrons also matters in controlling a nuclear reaction.<p>A nuclear reaction at criticality is <i>not</i> a bomb, at least not necessarily.  What it <i>is</i> however is <i>sustained</i>, which is to say that the nuclear reaction will continue unless circumstances change.<p>A nuclear bomb, and specifically a <i>fission</i> bomb, requires not only a <i>critical</i> mass but a <i>supercritical</i> one, with a large amount of the material going critical at once.  The challenge for the engineer is that nuclear reactions release <i>so</i> much energy that the explosive material itself can be blown apart before enough of it has time to react.  So the trick is to transition between subcritical and supercritical masses <i>quickly</i>.<p>For Uranium-235, the reaction is slow enough that a &quot;bullet-style&quot; design is sufficient.  A supercritical mass is arranged in two pieces, which are separated until detonation is desired, at which point one (usually smaller) mass is shot into the other, like a bullet down a gun-barrel.  Plutonium-239 is so fissile that this would result in premature criticality and only a small fraction of the material would fission before being blown apart.   Instead, an <i>implosion</i> design is used, in which a subcritical mass of plutonium is surrounded by explosive charges which, when detonated, compress the core sufficiently that it <i>does</i> achieve criticality, and the much larger nuclear explosion follows.<p>The Uranium bullet-style device was considered sufficiently reliable that it was not tested.  The Hiroshima bombing was the first detonation of this style of weapon.  The Trinity test was to confirm the theory of a plutonium implosion-style design, and Nagasaki saw the <i>second</i> explosion of such a weapon.<p>In the case of the Hiroshima (uranium) bomb, about 1 g of matter was converted to energy, and about 660 g of a total fissile mass of ~51 kg actually reacted, or about 1.3% of the total mass.  Essentially the bomb was already coming apart before any more material could engage in fission.

The Soviet Union wanted to stripmine East Germany for reparations. Before the end of WW2, the Soviet Union had received large amounts of military aid from the Allies. After WW2 Europe continued to receive aid in the form of the Marshall Plan, which provided heavy discounts on US exports and loans that were mostly forgiven later on.<p>West Germany&#x27;s economic boom was in part due to the German government expecting to have to pay the loans back in full and thus setting up a public fund that provided credit to businesses and the rebuilding effort rather than paying them out as direct subisidies to industry. When the loans were eventually forgiven this created a massive windfall. The successor program to the Marshall Plan was explicitly tied to &quot;defeating communism&quot; and focused on military development, which resulted in West Germany rearming despite earlier decisions that the country should be demilitarized. This change of plan was extremely controversial within West Germany and debates around the military involvement of Germany continues to this day.<p>In East Germany on the other hand, the rebuilding effort happened despite the Soviet Union not with the help of it. Reparations continued even after a lot of the industry had been dismantled and shipped to Eastern Europe while the isolation from Western Europe provided limited opportunities for export and the scarcity of resources meant a lot of early industry was built to provide for the population rather than trade.<p>Given the conditions, East Germany performed remarkably well, although of course it had a despotic government that would literally shoot its own citizens rather than allow them to leave for greener pastures. The US was also extremely hands-off on West German politics after the immediate occupation era. Presumably a major factor was that the US didn&#x27;t have as much skin in the game as its European allies whereas e.g. France literally had been occupied by Germans during the war, resulting in much stronger resentment.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that one of the plans for post-war Germany by the Western allies was full deindustrialization to a greater extent than what the Soviet Union ended up implementing with the explicit goal of turning Germany into an agrarian state incapable of forming a military for the forseeable future. This became less interesting as the divisions between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies became clearer but it wasn&#x27;t entirely unlikely.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41196537" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41196537" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cgh</span><span>|</span><a href="#41186855">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41189240">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41196617">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41198011">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41196537">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41196537">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That is deeply disingenuous.

The reparations were a bigger concern in the early interwar period and hamstrung the Weimar government but a big problem was that although Weimar Germany was formally a democratic republic following the deposition of the Emperor, a lot of its institutions were still monarchists and saw the social democrats as traitors, hoping for a restoration of the monarchy.<p>For example while especially in the build-up to 1933 a lot of the political violence and murders came from the political right and especially the NSDAP, German courts would repeatedly rule the attackers &quot;not guilty&quot; if the victims were on the political left because they did it &quot;out of the love for their country&quot; (i.e. the monarchy). Even the &quot;rise to power&quot; of the NSDAP was a de-facto legal process following the passing of the Enabling Act, co-signed by the conservative Christian &quot;center party&quot; which saw the NSDAP as a tool to defeat communism, believing that Adolf Hitler would use his power to restore the Emperor to the throne and transfer his power to him.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to tell how things would have played out without the crippling reparations but given Germany&#x27;s actual history I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s plausible that Weimar Germany would have been stable without it even if it was something that fueled the political right&#x27;s narrative of betrayal. Germany simply did not have a history of democracy to build on.<p>I think one of the most genius moves following WW2 was to fully dismantle Prussia by restructuring Germany. This was more than a cession of territories, even the parts of Prussia that remained part of Germany were dissolved and integrated into new subdivisions without a clear one-to-one mapping. In modern Germany the strongest remaining notion of Prussia is a general idea of &quot;everything north of Bavaria&quot; mostly present in Bavaria (notably one of the states that remained unchanged after the restructuring - a mistake in my opinion). Prussian identity was inseparable from militarism and a sense of supremacy, even without the formal monarchy.<p>Another possible move would have been to strip German royalty and nobility of its titles and claims like in France but this would have never been supported by the European monarchies like Britain, which often had strong dynastic ties to these families.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41187123" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41187123" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">UIUC_06</span><span>|</span><a href="#41186855">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41187491">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41187120">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41187123">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41187123">[21 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; They took the lessons from Versailles<p>what lessons?

  Selden mentions another critique of the nuclear bombing, which he says the U.S. government effectively suppressed for twenty-five years, as worth mention. On 11 August 1945, the Japanese government filed an official protest over the atomic bombing to the U.S. State Department through the Swiss Legation in Tokyo

Richard makes the argument – going back to the atomic bomb versus the Soviet invasion – he says that the bomb was essential to convince Hirohito to surrender. But that it was the Soviet invasion that convinced the generals of all those armies in China and other parts of East Asia to surrender. Because there was genuine concern, both among American officials and Japanese officials, that the emperor’s order to surrender would not be obeyed by generals in East Asia, who had huge armies and who could’ve fought on for a very long time at enormous cost to everybody. Richard makes the argument that once the Soviets came in, then the generals out in the field, who were outraged by the idea of surrendering, knew they couldn’t defeat the Soviets. So they went along with it. It’s a very interesting argument that I think makes a very sensible separation of what the impact of the bomb was and the impact of the Soviet invasion.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ahf.nuclearmuseum.org&#x2F;voices&#x2F;oral-histories&#x2F;j-samuel-walkers-interview&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ahf.nuclearmuseum.org&#x2F;voices&#x2F;oral-histories&#x2F;j-samuel...</a><p>Further:<p>&gt; <i>Walker: […] Those are the positions. And as I, and a lot of others, argue – I’m certainly not alone – they’re both seriously flawed. The traditional view because Truman did not face a stark choice between the bomb and an invasion. The invasion was not going to begin until on or around November 1, and a lot of could’ve happened between August and November of 1945. Also the view that if an invasion had been necessary, it would’ve cost hundreds of thousands of lives: there’s simply no contemporaneous evidence that supports that argument. It was made after the war as a means to justify the use of the bomb against a really small number of critics, who in the late ‘40s, early ‘50s, were saying that perhaps the bomb wasn’t necessary. It’s also beyond question that the invasion was not inevitable. I mean, the idea that Truman had to use the bomb because if he didn’t the only other option was an invasion is simply wrong. So, the traditional view in its pure form, that Truman used the bomb to avoid an invasion, simply doesn’t hold up.</i><p>&gt; <i>Kelly: In the view of the revisionists.</i><p>&gt; <i>Walker: No, in the view of those of us who are somewhere in between. What I argue is that Truman used the bomb for the reasons he said he did, to end the war as quickly as possible. No one in a position of authority or knowledge, and certainly not his chief and military advisors, told him in the summer of 1945 that if you don’t use the bomb, an invasion is inevitable and it’s going to cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Estimates for lives lost that were projected by military experts in the summer of 1945 were far less than that, and the numbers are far from hard evidence. But there’s no evidence whatsoever that he was ever told that hundreds of thousands of lives would be the cost of an invasion of Japan. That was something that came about later.</i><p>&gt; <i>My argument is that Truman didn’t have to be told that an invasion would cost hundreds of thousands of lives. He knew it was going to cost a lot of lives, tens of thousands, if an invasion was necessary. He also knew that even without an invasion, the war was still going on. Okinawa had been defeated in late June of 1945, so we had one month when there weren’t any major battlefronts between the end of the Battle of Okinawa and the end of the war, which is July 1945.</i><p>&gt; <i>In that month, about 775 American soldiers and Marines were killed in combat. About another 2,300 or 2,400 died from other causes, disease, wounds, accidents, whatever. So, you had 3,000 soldiers and Marines who were killed in the month of July of 1945 without any major battlefronts.</i><p>&gt; <i>You also had sailors being killed. The sinking of the U.S.S. Indianapolis occurred July 28 [misspoke: July 30], 1945, just a horrific event, in which a Japanese submarine attacked and sank the U.S.S. Indianapolis. Of the 1100 [misspoke: 1200] crewmembers, 880 died, either from the explosion of the ship or were stranded in water for a very long time and either died from exposure or from sharks. Just a horrific story.</i><p>&gt; <i>As long as the war was going on, that was going to happen, and that’s what Truman and his advisors were concerned about. No one had to tell them that the alternative to using the bomb was saving far fewer lives. That number of 3,200 or 3,300 who died in July, that’s just soldiers and Marines, so you have sailors on top of that. That was plenty of reason to use the bomb if it had a chance to end the war as quickly as possible.</i><p>* <i>Ibid</i></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41187572" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41187572" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">petermcneeley</span><span>|</span><a href="#41187081">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41187505">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41187725">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41187710">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41187572">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41187572">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Chomsky claims there was a bombing after the two atomic bombings.

The mass firebombing campaigns of the entire last couple years of the war against Japanese cities, using completely conventional weapons, had already killed possibly as many as 700,000 people with hardly any allied leader batting an eye, or the U.S. public for that matter. Given this mentality, and the subsequent lack of an apology for those conventional bombings, what would have made the atomic bombings deeply unique? (except for the nature of the bombs themselves).<p>Let&#x27;s not also forget that Japan itself did everything possible to make the use of atomic bombs seem reasonable, having promised repeatedly that it would fight even in the face of horrendous casualties both for its own people and the forces of any invading army. Given the absolutist stance of Japanese forces in the field previous to those last weeks, fighting until every last man is dead and killing as many civilians as they could in the process, on directives and mentalities instilled directly from Tokyo, it&#x27;s not hard to see why the Americans took seriously the idea of an unimaginable bloodbath in any potential invasion of the home islands.<p>Just look at the battles of Okinawa, in which the local forces encouraged their own local civilians to commit mass suicide as they lost the island, or the battle of Manilla, in which the knowingly losing Japanese just kept fighting, butchering, raping and burning the city solely for the sake of doing so.</div><br/><div id="41189811" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41189811" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">impossiblefork</span><span>|</span><a href="#41187817">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41188421">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41198756">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41189811">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41189811">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, but the people making those threats aren&#x27;t the people who were killed.

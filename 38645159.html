The difference in the skillsets and their commonality was massive, yet the pay was significantly worse for the mainframe work despite it being a rare skillset in a high value industry.  I remembered when I was in this job that guys who worked on trading desk backend code were far better compensated while working in easier development environments on less esoteric codebases, the mainframe folks were the lowest paid of the developers at that company, at every level of seniority.

Not related to the main story here - I&#x27;m the first programmer in my family - but my great-grandfather was born in 1865 and lived a long life, he was blind for his last 30 or 40 years but had a phenomenal memory. A neighbor had the insight to use one of the very first tape recorders, just after WW2, together with my father who was a boy at that time, to record my great-grandfather&#x27;s stories about what he did in life. When my father retired he cobbled together a working tape recorder from two or three old ones, and copied the stories over to cassette, and later to CD.  I listened to one of those recordings the other day - my great-grandfather told about how when he as a young boy, approximately around 1872-1873, he met a very old man who told about how he had learned the origin of the name of where they (he and my great-grandfather) lived, from another man when <i>he</i> was a boy. That origin turned out to be very different from what everyone these days are guessing, but immensely more plausible.  Brought to me from the 18th century, via my great-grandfather.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38646227" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38646227" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ca_tech</span><span>|</span><a href="#38645997">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38646362">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38647057">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38646227">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38646227">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would highly encourage anyone who has even thought about doing this; do it.

static one.

The biggest difference between them and the relational model, is they didn&#x27;t have a query language like SQL, they offered a procedural API for processing one record at a time and manually navigating the links from table to table. Network model was standardised by CODASYL-the same committee which invented COBOL, with the result that they became particularly popular with COBOL applications.<p>The most famous network model database is probably Broadcom&#x27;s IDMS (previously known as CA IDMS), which nowadays only runs on IBM and Fujitsu mainframes, but in past decades was supported on other mainframe and minicomputer platforms as well. Oracle also offers a CODASYL network model database for OpenVMS, which it got from Digital when it bought Rdb.<p>Graph databases have something in common with the historical network model, but some significant differences (1) graph databases have much more flexible schemas (defining arbitrary properties on a node as opposed to a rigid structure of fixed format record types), (2) graph databases generally have a query language with support for graph traversal operations, as opposed to the procedural API the network data model offered.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38647933" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38647933" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">boilerupnc</span><span>|</span><a href="#38646103">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38647626">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38647933">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38647933">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Recently announced, there’s also now a generative AI tool to assist developers with their COBOL modernization journey to Java [0].

Historically, many banks used CSC Hogan (now DXC Hogan)-and while many have moved away from it, some are still on it. Hogan runs on IBM mainframes (z&#x2F;OS), and is written in COBOL and CICS. Basic stuff like savings accounts is supported by the vendor-provided COBOL code, but Hogan sites often end up writing their own custom COBOL code to support their own unique requirements.<p>&gt; I surprised banks don&#x27;t have a domain-specific language (DSL) to describe their businesses.<p>There is a long history of 4GL&#x27;s being used in banking, going back decades. In prior decades, many of these 4GLs worked by generating COBOL code. Some of them were general-purpose, and used across many industries; others were exclusively used in banking. But, even those exclusively used in banking, rarely (to my knowledge) contained domain-specific banking features, and as such I&#x27;m not sure they really count as DSLs.<p>To give a specific example, FIS Global&#x27;s core banking platform, Profile, is written in MUMPS (actually the open-source variant GT.M). Due to how horrid MUMPS is as a language, they created their own higher-level object-oriented language which compiles to MUMPS, called PSL (Profile Scripting Language), and gradually rewrote their banking platform in it. An old version of PSL was open-sourced over 10 years ago on Sourceforge, if anyone wants to look at it. [0] I don&#x27;t think PSL itself has anything really banking-specific in it per se, but as is inevitable with a language developed to support a single application, the boundary between the language and the application is a little blurry, and you&#x27;ll find a lot of banking-specific stuff in the open source release (possibly included by accident), especially inside the binary GT.M database dump it ships with.<p>I think the areas in which truly domain-specific languages are strongest in finance - such as modelling financial contracts - are generally the furthest away from the COBOL legacy.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourceforge.net&#x2F;projects&#x2F;pip&#x2F;files&#x2F;PIP&#x2F;V0.2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourceforge.net&#x2F;projects&#x2F;pip&#x2F;files&#x2F;PIP&#x2F;V0.2&#x2F;</a> see also more easily digestible (somewhat improved) Git mirror at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;YottaDB&#x2F;DBMS&#x2F;YDBPIP&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;YottaDB&#x2F;DBMS&#x2F;YDBPIP&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="38650098" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38650098" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ravenstine</span><span>|</span><a href="#38647626">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38652252">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38648061">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38650098">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38650098">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s an interesting idea, but I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s the least bit surprising.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38648061" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38648061" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dan-robertson</span><span>|</span><a href="#38647626">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38650098">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38646444">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38648061">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38648061">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What domain do you think COBOL was made for?<p>Basically the only things computers were worth it for back then were scientific calculations and bookkeeping.

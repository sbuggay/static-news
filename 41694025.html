As JN Findlay argued, there is no substantial difference between Godel and Hegel&#x27;s logic in terms of incompleteness: it is likely that, although the only philosophy which Godel ever adopted was Phenomenology, he would himself not have had any issues with the comparison. It is the &quot;identity of non-identity,&quot; its not that you &quot;encounter&quot; the other, its the recognition that the other is <i>already contained</i> in what is non-other; which is to say, in a manner that Godel expressed far more clearly, that all logical systems, all systematic programs, contain elements that cannot be contained in the system, and the discreteness of the world only comes when those elements come to a head, when people are forced to, for Hegel, fight in a conflict to resolve, at the level of the Idea itself, what they cannot be certain of: this is why, science, what you&#x27;d think is objective and independent, depends on massive political and social forces: and if the Israeli&#x27;s, for instance, could not fight their wars, it would be the proof that ideology of faith is more powerful than the ideology of the world, of technological power. The &quot;truth&quot; of a missile only becomes apparent when it hits its target, just in the same way that one cannot know, here on HN especially, how <i>others</i> will think of their comment, until they post it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41694229" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41694229" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sharkjacobs</span><span>|</span><a href="#41694319">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41694454">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41694229">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41694229">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Plato’s Republic was more fun and engaging than other foundational philosophy texts I read as an undergraduate because the dialogue format made me want to interrupt Socrates in way that I don’t usually experience when I read things that I disagree with.

For this to work as intended, things like human cells (we can kill cells to save a human being) or societies like nation states (we can destroy or mutilate states to save a human being) have to be considered lesser than individual humans.<p>But it gives rise to Russell-type paradox of how to include as many humans as possible without creating contradictions. (A similar problem is with democracy, it cannot be instituted or destroyed democratically.) These logical problems seem to come from the fact that you need some axioms at all. In the same way, you can be &quot;dogmatic in your non-dogmatism&quot;.<p>I also think if you accept the universalist moral position above, the questioning and distrust towards experts (authorities) becomes obvious conclusion. Authorities asking for humans to be killed or harmed (for example, going to a war) need to provide a strong justification.<p>I also consider it very doubtful that the moral universalism was first invented by &quot;Western civilization&quot; or &quot;enlightenment&quot;. Yeah, somebody was first, but it&#x27;s not that a difficult idea. What might be new is the universal acceptance of it, but I am not so sure when I look around.<p>However, in practice, the Russell-style paradox is rarely a problem. Yeah, there are edge cases like dolphins, or intellectually disabled people, but mostly we can figure it out.</div><br/><div id="41694799" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41694799" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">082349872349872</span><span>|</span><a href="#41694429">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41694766">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41694799">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41694799">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>[moral relativism is] not that a difficult idea</i><p>Eg Aristotle (ca 300BC): <i>Some people think that all rules of justice are merely conventional, because whereas a law of nature is immutable and has the same validity everywhere, as fire burns both here and in Persia, rules of justice are seen to vary.</i><p>I&#x27;d guess it was common over the last 10k years for educated and&#x2F;or travelled people to be aware that their neighbours had different* dogmas, and in pre-colonial times (when it was far more likely that these neighbours were similarly located on the tech tree) the parochialism of colonialists (&quot;Whatever happens, we have got &#x2F; The Maxim gun, and they have not.&quot;) would not have been as facile.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.perseus.tufts.edu&#x2F;hopper&#x2F;text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1134b" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.perseus.tufts.edu&#x2F;hopper&#x2F;text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%...</a><p>* Tacitus seems to have written <i>De origine et situ Germanorum</i> partly as an objective description of germans, and partly as a subjective reproach of his Roman compatriots; during the XIX (which established many of the tropes we&#x27;ve inherited as &quot;common knowledge&quot;) the germans flipped this around: germans and french were in superpower conflict, and as the french —with a significant advantage in language— had laid claim to inheriting the (centralised) Roman tradition, the germans retorted by digging up all the old arguments the (decentralised) greeks had made along the lines of &quot;maybe the Romans have all the money, but we&#x27;ve got all the culture&quot;.<p>(cf <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hanns_Johst#Schlageter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hanns_Johst#Schlageter</a> ; τὰ πάντα ῥεῖ καὶ οὐδὲν μένει )</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41694766" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41694766" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">avazhi</span><span>|</span><a href="#41694429">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41694464">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41694766">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41694766">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">“Answer truthfully.

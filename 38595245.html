It can vary. Deal with it. To believe otherwise is to think management fully understands the work ahead of time. This is not usually the case. To a lesser extent, even the devs might not know. Overscheduling and underscheduling happen all the time. Things catch on fire. You have to work accordingly. Some days you can stop early. It&#x27;s not entirely in the hands of the workers. You won&#x27;t know until you start.<p>What matters more is a reliable result done on time and everyone is happy with the effort required to achieve that. That&#x27;s a complex balance to achieve across the whole team. You need everyone recognizing the long term benefits of a job well done and they need to feel comfortable with their part of it.<p>Working slowly after hours with no promise of getting much if anything concrete done is a deep joy for some of us. I sometimes need to play with my work to know what I&#x27;m doing tomorrow. It&#x27;s often outside the scope of what I&#x27;m being asked to do, yet vital to a successful project instead of a mediocre one full of garbage decisions smoothed over by management lies and stress 
on the whole team to maintain.<p>What world does one want to live in? Build it and enjoy. That&#x27;s where productivity, happiness, and ease come from.

Combine that with the pip culture and visa issues, and your statement above about being &quot;no more stressed than anyone else&quot; is just ridiculous<p>Expecting people to work at 1AM, romanticizing them as &quot;heroes&quot;... that&#x27;s not a normal culture. That&#x27;s not a healthy lifestyle for the employee and can lead to long term health consequences. And it never applies to everyone equally, because why would you call them &quot;heroes&quot; in the first place<p>It&#x27;s one thing if management expects it, it&#x27;s another thing if I as an employee choose to trade 4 daytime hours for 4 nighttime hours because I know I can be more productive at that time.

I worked at a pretty tiny startup in college where I regularly talked with the CEO and worked directly for one of the VPs. They were great and from start to finish it&#x27;s been my most positive work experience, since I felt like one of the team. Dare I say it even felt a bit like a family (well, the CEO and VP were a husband-wife team and I was a college kid at the time).<p>Then I switched to a company that billed itself as having a startup culture but really couldn&#x27;t because of turf wars between layers of irrelevant middle management, never mind regular tone-deaf decisions from upper management and repeated bad bets from them that lead to multiple layoffs. The work itself is actually more interesting than what I was doing at the real startup, but the mismanagement has pushed me into a mindset of mostly only giving them what I&#x27;m contractually obligated to, with rare exceptions for smaller projects that I feel I can have a greater direct impact on. I would hazard a guess that management in that company is actually a net negative because if it wasn&#x27;t for all the bad politics there, I&#x27;d probably be just as happy to give them extra time because like you say the work is fun and interesting. And I know a couple other guys there who -were- regularly giving extra time until they got repeatedly personally burned by management.</div><br/><div id="38598660" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38598660" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">watwut</span><span>|</span><a href="#38596817">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38598454">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38597507">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38598660">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38598660">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; a company that billed itself as having a startup culture but really couldn&#x27;t because of turf wars between layers of irrelevant middle management, never mind regular tone-deaf decisions from upper management and repeated bad bets<p>Honestly, that sounds like typical startup to me.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38597507" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38597507" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">matrix87</span><span>|</span><a href="#38596817">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38597424">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38598454">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38598474">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38597507">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38597507">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I initially thought above comment was about on call because of the &quot;things catch on fire part&quot;, I guess not<p>&gt; where extra hours are silently worked prevents being forced to pick up the slack that shouldn&#x27;t be there in the first place.

After hours is the only time I can focus and get deep work done myself. This is something I&#x27;d really like to improve, but I&#x27;m really not sure how. I&#x27;ve tried creating discussion groups and many other approaches to make knowledge transfer more efficient. However, the real issue is company growth. A huge recent period of growth has meant a focus on training people. This is only the kind of thing I could defend against if I were 1-2 ranks higher in the company, and honestly, this lack of longterm growth planning is one of the reasons I would leave my company.<p>One approach I&#x27;ve been thinking of experimenting with is saving everything I say, and using an LLM with my custom knowledge base to answer a question. I actually think a borg-like communication structure in a company could be really efficient. If every communication was publicly available, and we used ML to make that information consistent and to answer queries, I think you could achieve coherence with a company much faster, move as a unit much faster, and get a lot more done.<p>However, it&#x27;s still a pipe dream at this point due to the context length limits. The actual amount of important context at a company is many times what a model can keep in mind now. As models get bigger, or if a group can run multiple models many times to make the company info widely consistent, it would be much better.<p>For instance imagine now, 30 people at your company work on one project, and 50 people work on another. They might take a slightly different definition for a term, and do work which is ultimately counterproductive to each other. Usually, it takes a conflict arising to resolve this, and people are long stuck with the mutually-incorrect definition. If an ML algorithm can look at everything both groups are saying and point out inefficiencies, I think you could get more cohesion, especially before problems get big enough to be a drain.<p>That being said, this type of system is more of a pipe dream, and I don&#x27;t think it will be feasible for a few more years. In the meantime, I&#x27;m struggling how to balance communication with work. Advice appreciated.</div><br/><div id="38596232" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38596232" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">twodave</span><span>|</span><a href="#38596044">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38597951">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38596232">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38596232">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I ran into this problem after a promotion and some company growth left me over a much larger footprint of our engineering department than I was used to. I ended up making a couple rules for myself and establishing a couple new routines, which all have helped:<p>âHandbookingâ - this is something I learned from reading about Gitlab and ended up adopting for my department. If itâs important, it goes into the handbook. If itâs not, then I probably donât need to know it anyway. This alone took a lot of burden off me (people only ping me now if something is missing from the handbook or if they didnât understand it, both of which are signals that the handbook needs work).<p>Office hours - I donât do this consistently, but when I feel like the interruptions are still too frequent Iâll just post some office ours in our dev channel and tell people they can bother me in a few 2-hour blocks that week. Otherwise I sit there and livestream whatever work it is that Iâm doing for whomever is interested in that sort of thing.<p>Trusting - I found much of my increased stress was a lack of faith in others to do a passable job of things, so Iâd burden myself with them.

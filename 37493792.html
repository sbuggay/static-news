I used to play rain and ocean waves to get my kids to fall asleep. To my surprise, I turned off the sound when they fell asleep but the waves were still crashing on the shore. I assumed the neighbors were playing it for their children as well.<p>The same thing the next day, I thought the neighbors had just left their noise machine on all day. At night it became louder and I went outside to check if I was the only one bothered by the noise. I finally asked my wife, she said she hadn&#x27;t noticed it. Thought she was going deaf. It was starting to really bother me, it was as if they had dialed the sound to 11.<p>I went outside, and surprisingly I saw a neighbor looking out as well. I went back in, plugged my earphones and played an audiobook. Unfortunately I chose a Lord of the rings rendition with sound effects.<p>I got up in the middle of the night, and noticed that the sound was just as loud in the bathroom as in the bedroom. Kitchen and living room, all the same. Whether I covered my ears or not, it all sounded just the same. I laughed to myself.<p>I still spent several weeks of sleepless nights until it went away on it&#x27;s own.

Maybe Tiny desk concerts are for you. Stadium shows need volume. Every show needs some amount of volume to create an experience for that genre of music. Back then I had to haul hundreds of pounds of gear in a van to create that sound for my band and now I&#x27;d just have to bring a suitcase and plug in to the house system.  These days on stage is pretty quiet and the bands all have in-ear monitors but you have to move a lot of decibels to create an experience for any genre. It was behind the band on stage then and killed your ears and now it can be in front of the band and just point at the audience and I think it&#x27;s better for everyone. It&#x27;s always a physical experience and the sound volume is part of it. Have you ever been at a show where your favorite band was playing your favorite song and people are talking over the band and thought that was kind of annoying? Somewhere in between is a range of venues and experiences. Yes, it&#x27;s bad for your ears but you&#x27;re not going to sit around in a quiet lounge by yourself. Live music is loud. Yes it&#x27;s probably too loud. My ears are fucked. Thanks for your comment! Sounds like you have a lot of useful insight for the whole concert industry. Have you run sound at a show? Sounds like you are qualified to hand out ear plugs and that&#x27;s about it.

Now I wonder where that comes from. However, technically to find the frequency in question you could take a white noise generating sound source and connect that to an EQ with an audible dB boost in a narrow range and sweep that through the entire frequency range until you tune it to match the noise in your ear. To create a filtered noise track you could apply a high pass filter and a low pass filter in combination to &quot;bracket&quot; that range and create a narrow band of noise.

And it is true they sometimes tend toward being architecturally bland or downright ugly.<p>They have so many other advantages that they don&#x27;t need to be attractive, and developers hate to pay for anything they don&#x27;t need.<p>Also, this moment where they&#x27;re breaking out and popping up like weeds to fill pent-up demand is an awkward moment, design-wise, because you need a lot of new designs quickly without a long history to look back on and draw from. Compare that to high-rise office buildings or single family homes, where you have a century and more of variations in countless different styles, where you have not only countless iconic examples but decades&#x27; worth of reaction to many of them. Some of the 5-over-1 buildings going up now will turn out to be iconic, style-defining precedents. Most will be trash, but will still serve the functional purpose.<p>Personally, I love seeing these go up near me.

I think there are a very small number of places where this works, as a cool marker of identity and difference, like (maybe) Santa Fe. Even there I&#x27;m not sure if residents like it, or if it&#x27;s just the tourists who think it&#x27;s historic and cute. But for most places it just makes things bland and depressing. At first glance it&#x27;s kinda cool when a university enforces a style guide that visually distinguishes its campus from its environs, but it quickly turns sad when you realize the art museum looks exactly like the biology building, which looks exactly like the business school, which looks exactly like the campus health services.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40724433" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40724433" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">notatoad</span><span>|</span><a href="#40721144">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40721300">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40721560">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40723920">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40724433">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40724433">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">the reality is that most of these 5-over-1 buildings are the result of bylaws meant to do exactly that, by forbidding anything deemed &quot;ugly&quot;.

And predictably the result is cliché and repetitive. There is probably even some kind of curtain wall system off the shelf for it too. Off course, there is, obviously.<p>Around here (and likely across america) you see the same facade features again and again -probably because they are off the shelf and picked out of a catalog. (of course they are, but the degree to which they are is the silly part of it. There is ZERO creativity in them.)<p>Actually this is to the point where one naive building here went so faaaaar out of their way to look different (while within budget) that it looks absurd.

Chicago is a mid-rise city.  Examples which are considered attractive and historic and nobody complains about them... but they aren&#x27;t timber frame over concrete podium, they&#x27;re brick or stone on all floors. Which is of course often too expensive to do now.

I think it is actually?)<p>Here&#x27;s a very typical generic Chicago example, which possibly has had it&#x27;s ground floor facade replaced at some point in an uninspired way, but you can see the masonry on the upper floors (only 3-over-1) which would be an absolute premium luxury build today, and the building has plenty of character even though it&#x27;s not being used for especially high-rent purposes at the moment: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@41.9654135,-87.6587315,3a,75y,2.88h,111.88t&#x2F;data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sS3BGfbQt_wzMUdk1zWomPg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205409&amp;entry=ttu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@41.9654135,-87.6587315,3a,75y,2...</a><p>Here&#x27;s a new construction (past 20 years anyway) 4-over-1 that is all brick... pretty boring and generic.

You just don&#x27;t see walk-in businesses in most places because they&#x27;re not economically viable any more.  Here in Tokyo, it&#x27;s completely different: those tiny, independent businesses are everywhere.  I&#x27;m not completely sure on why this is, but part of it is probably the car dependency (causing things like minimum parking rules), but even in places where the business can ignore parking requirements, it seems rent and labor costs are way too high.  Part of this might be from the terrible healthcare system and skyrocketing housing costs.  Whatever the reasons, over here it seems to be quite common for people to open small shops and run them by themselves, and that&#x27;s not something I see in America any more.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40721622" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40721622" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TulliusCicero</span><span>|</span><a href="#40721050">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40721527">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40724885">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40721941">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40721622">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40721622">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m aware it can happen, but there are ways to deal with vacant storefront space too.

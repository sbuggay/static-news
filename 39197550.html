The purpose of the H1-B is to allow companies to hire foreigners with special skills that can&#x27;t be found amongst US citizens.<p>So why not just grant H1-Bs to the companies that are willing to pay their talent the most?<p>Let any company apply and list a salary which they have to agree to pay for at least two years, and then just issue them highest salary first until they hit the quota for the year.  No country based quotas or any other kind.  Just straight up salary.  And make the visa transferrable if another company wants to take it over after say the first two years at the same or better salary.<p>If people are so skilled then they must be valuable, right?  This would be good for both the employee and the country, bringing in the most highly paid people.<p>The only ones that would get hurt in this process are the companies that abuse the system to underpay people and then get them beholden to the company.</div><br/><div id="39200858" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39200858" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tivert</span><span>|</span><a href="#39198032">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39198206">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39200858">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39200858">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; So why not just grant H1-Bs to the companies that are willing to pay their talent the most?<p>As others have pointed out, you&#x27;re assuming highest salary == most valuable, but what your idea will lead to is a bunch of talented people working on new ways to get people to click ads or write yet-another trading algorithm.<p>IMHO, you&#x27;d fix the H1-B program by doing two things:<p>1. Eliminate the requirement that the visa-holder have a sponsor past the start date, so the they can quit immediately and take a different job if they are underpaid or the working conditions are poor.  That will eliminate any potential exploitation enforced by the program.<p>2. Limit the sponsors to legitimate US-based companies who will employ the workers for in-house work.  Working out a precise definition may be hard, but it should be possible because it&#x27;s pretty clear when we see it.

You know undocumented workers cannot vote, right? Hell, you know documented, legal, residents also cannot vote? The only people who get to vote in US elections are US citizens.<p>Demographics shifts obviously help the modern DNC, for the same reason it helped the GOP a century ago: Conservatism is definitionally rooted in having minimal demographic variance (be it race, gender, religion, or whatever), so if you have two parties one of which says &quot;only this group matters&quot; and the other says &quot;more than that one group matters&quot;, then increasing the demographic variation will always favor the latter, because for anyone not in the ideal conservative demographic will see that party as actively targeting them.<p>It&#x27;s also important to be careful when saying &quot;look at elections from the past&quot;, because a lot of laws were passed in many countries in the late 20th century to address a variety of biased laws that impacted the voting power of targeted blocks. In the US there was redlining which prevented specific demographics from voting in specific areas of the country, coupled with extensive gerrymandering this allows large scale disenfranchisement that is still being undone by the courts today, even though redlining itself became &quot;illegal&quot; in the 80s. There are a wide array of actions that occurred in the states you&#x27;re talking about through the decades you referenced and onwards to now, that both made it possible for demographics to shift where previously people were functionally banned, and to reduce the disenfranchisement of demographics that were already present. None of that resulted in &quot;illegal immigrants&quot; impacting elections though, because again, non-citizens cannot vote in US elections (even though they pay taxes in the country that produced &quot;no taxation without representation&quot;).<p>As an additional note, because of US government representation being determined by total population, and not &quot;legal voters&quot; the abuse of biased law enforcement is hits multiple times: first off victims of that bias lose representation, but then regions that get prisons get increased voting power. If you&#x27;re in a region with 1000 people, but have a prison that has 5000 prisoners, then you get the congressional representation that comes from 6000 people, but only 1000 of them get to vote. Again, prisoners should be able to vote. Felons should be able to vote. Ex-cons should be allowed to vote. If there are enough of those groups to impact election outcomes, then it&#x27;s a reasonable assumption that law enforcement is being used as a tool to restrict voting rights (Something that multiple people from the Nixon and Reagan administrations have explicitly stated was the reason for how the &quot;war on drugs&quot; was set up).</div><br/><div id="39198926" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39198926" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nostromo</span><span>|</span><a href="#39198032">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39198621">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39198299">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39198926">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39198926">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">While migrants can’t vote in national elections, they are counted in the census (California has an additional four or five seats in congress just from illegal immigration, for example).<p>Secondly, the children of illegal immigrants are citizens and can vote.

To be clear, there was no Congressional will for racially equitable immigration at the time. They wanted to keep the immigration system white without having to have the words &quot;white race&quot; in the text of the bill. So instead they changed the system to heavily favor family sponsorship, under the idea that white people would just keep sponsoring other white people and that would keep the system white.<p>Now, it&#x27;ll probably be a shock to you, but these family sponsorship visas actually make America&#x27;s immigrant pool way <i>less</i> white. It may not feel like it if you&#x27;re trying to get an immigrant visa on an employment basis, but America is actually one of the easiest countries to immigrate to if you have relatives here. Other developed countries are far more selective and bureaucratic.<p>The trick is to recognize that nobody agrees on what part of the system is actually broken. The DNC said the quiet part out loud[0], but the GOP has been thinking for decades that immigration was just a way to dilute Republican voters. A good chunk of the GOP thinks the problem is that it&#x27;s too easy to immigrate and we need to become like Japan[1]. Another chunk doesn&#x27;t care about immigrants, but they want to end illegal immigration by any means necessary. The DNC wants, at a minimum, immigration amnesty with a path to citizenship[3]. And then you have business interests that maximally exploit immigrants, legal or otherwise.

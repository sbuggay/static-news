No amount of new facts about the event will convince them. They are using numerology and QAnon baking techniques to try and make sense of the election, not rational logic.<p>Trust is the wrong word. Trust is earned and is based on evidence, exposure, and time. I have trust in the election system because I have read the legal challenges, I understand what parts of the election system are networked, I have entertained the possibility of some of the 2020 fraud claims, I volunteered in the 2022 election as a poll worker, and I have looked at the reputation&#x2F;trustworthiness of the people bringing challenges to the election.<p>What these people have is <i>faith</i> that the election was fraudulent — faith is the conviction in something unseen. They are convinced they are victims without being able to show anything except hypotheticals.<p>I might agree with your statement if the same group of people who supposedly perpetrated the fraud were the ones who removed the videos. Eg. Police officers who refuse to take written complaints about police violence within their department. But YouTube, Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc are not part of the election system. Those companies are allowed to treat their property how they like; the YouTube ToS has nothing to do with trustworthiness of an election run in 50 states across 3300 counties.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36174428" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36174428" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">watwut</span><span>|</span><a href="#36174411">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36174527">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36174568">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36174428">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36174428">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They are not criticism, they are outright lies.

Once you have separate the generic role of &quot;developer&quot; into &quot;developer, operations, and security&quot;, you&#x27;ve likely specified all sorts of details about <i>how</i> those roles need to be done.  When you combine them back into DevSecOps, all the details remain, and you have one person doing 3x the work instead of one person doing the work 3x more efficiently.  To effectively go backwards, you have to <i>relax constraints</i>, and let that one person exercise their judgment about <i>how</i> to do the job.<p>A corollary is that org size can never decrease, only increase.  As more employees are hired, jobs become increasingly specialized.  Getting rid of them means that <i>that job function is simply not performed</i>, because at that level of specialization, the other employees cannot simply adjust their job descriptions to take on the new responsibilities.

Basically DevOps is a great idea under certain circumstances and works well for specific people in that role. Realistically if you take a top talent engineer they can likely step into any of the three roles or even some others and be successful. Having the synergy of one person being responsible for the boundary between two roles then makes your ROI on that person and that role skyrocket.<p>And then you evangelize this approach and every other company wants to follow suit but they don’t really have top talent in management or engineering or both (every company claims to hire top talent which obviously cannot be true). So they make a poor copy of what the best organizations were doing and obviously it doesn’t go well. And the thing is that they’ve done it before.

Do you know <i>what else</i> are they doing? Booking their own business travels. Reconciling and reporting their own expenses. Reporting their own hours, broken down by business categories. Managing their own vacation days. Managing their own meetings. Creating presentations on their own, with graphics they made on their own. Possibly even doing 80% of work on lining up purchases from third parties. And a bunch of other stuff like that.<p>None of these are part of their job descriptions - in fact, all of these are actively distracting and disproportionally compromise the workers&#x27; ability to do their actual jobs. All of these also used to have dedicated specialists, that could do it 10x as efficiently, for fraction of the price.<p>My hypothesis is this: those specialists like secretaries, internal graphics departments, financial staff, etc. they all were <i>visible on the balance sheet</i>. Eliminating those roles does not eliminate the need for their work to be done - just distributes it to everyone in pieces (in big part thanks to self-serve office software &quot;improving&quot; productivity). That slows everyone down across the board disproportionally, but the beancounters only see the money saved on salaries of the eliminated roles - the slowdown only manifests as a fuzzy, generic sense of loss of productivity, a mysterious costs disease that everyone seems to suffer from.<p>I say it&#x27;s not mysterious; I say that there is no productivity gain, but rather productivity loss - but because it turns the costs from legible, overt, into diffuse and hard to count, it&#x27;s easy to get fooled that money is being saved.</div><br/><div id="41472518" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41472518" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sgt101</span><span>|</span><a href="#41468219">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41472391">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41469421">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41472518">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41472518">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And yet we are told that competition will determine that capital and talent will flow towards that most efficient organisations over time. Thus, surely organisations that eschewed this practice would emerge and dominate?<p>So, either capitalism doesn&#x27;t work, or your thesis isn&#x27;t quite right...<p>I have two other counters to offer, first we have seen GDP per capita gradually increasing in major economies for the last 50 years (while the IT revolution has played out). There have been other technical innovations over this time, but I believe that GDP per capita has more than quadrupled in G8 economies. The USA and Canada have, at the same time, enjoyed a clear extra boost from fracking and shale extraction, and the USA has arguably enjoyed an extra extra boost from world dominance - but arguably.<p>The second one is simple anecdote. Hour for hour I now can do far more in terms of development than I did when I was a hard core techie in the 90&#x27;s and 2000&#x27;s. In addition I can manage and administer systems that are far more complex than those it took teams of people to run at that time (try running a 10gb size db under load on oracle 7 sitting on top of spinning rust and 64mb ram store for fun) I can also manage a team of 30&#x27;s expenses, timesheets, travel requests and so on that again would have taken a person to do. I can just do these things and my job as well and I do it mostly in about 50 hrs a week. If I wasn&#x27;t involved in my people&#x27;s lives and happy to argue with customers to get things better I could do it in 40 hrs regularally, for sure. But I put some discretion in.<p>My point is - we are just more productive. It is hard to measure, and anecdote &#x2F; &quot;lived experience&quot; is a bad type of evidence, but I think it&#x27;s clearly there. This is why then accountants have been able to reorganise modern business organisations to use fewer people to do more. Have they destroyed value while doing this - totally - but they have managed to get away with it because 7&#x2F;10 they have been right.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve suffered from the 3&#x2F;10 errors.

Yeah, I lean towards this too. Signals I use now to determine good software usually are things that look auxiliary because I&#x27;m actually looking for things that tell me the dev is passionate and &quot;having fun.&quot; Like easter eggs, little things like it looks like they took way too much time to make something unimportant pretty (keeping doing this devs. I love it and it&#x27;s appreciated. Always makes me smile ^_^). But I am also sympathetic, because yeah I also get tons of issues opened that should have been a google search or are wildly inappropriate. Though I try to determine if these are in good faith because we don&#x27;t get wizards without noobs, and someone&#x27;s got to teach them.<p>But it all makes me think we forgot what all of this is about, even &quot;the economy.&quot; Money is supposed to be a proxy for increasing quality of life. Not even just on a personal level. I&#x27;m happy that people can get rich doing their work and things that they&#x27;re passionate about but I feel that the way current infrastructures are we&#x27;re actively discouraging or handcuffing people who are passionate. Or that we try to kill that passion. Managers, let your devs &quot;have fun.&quot; Reign them in so that they don&#x27;t go too deep of rabbit holes and pull too far away, but coding (like any engineering or any science) is (also) an art. When that passion dies, enshitification ensues.<p>For a concrete example: I&#x27;m wildly impressed that 99.9 times I&#x27;m filling out a forum that includes things like a country or timezone that my country isn&#x27;t either autoselected or a copy isn&#x27;t located at the top (not moved! copied!). It really makes me think that better than chasing leet code questions for interviews you ask someone to build a simple thing and what you actually look for is the details and little things that make the experience smoother (or product better). Because it is hard to teach people to about subtly, much harder than teaching them a stack or specific language (and if they care about the little things they&#x27;ll almost always be quicker to learn those things). Sure, this might take a little more work to interview people and doesn&#x27;t have a precise answer, but programs don&#x27;t have precise answers either. And given how long and taxing software interviews are these days I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if slowing down actually ends up speeding things up and saving a lot of money.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41470608" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41470608" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">NortySpock</span><span>|</span><a href="#41468219">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41468788">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41469491">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41469664">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41470608">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41470608">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; my laundry app (that I must use) takes minutes to load<p>Do they have a place to mail your complaints?

Writing software is an iterative process, and LLMs currently used are not good enough for that, because they need not only to answer the questions, but at the very minimum to start asking questions: &quot;why do want to do that ?&quot; &quot;do you prefer this or that&quot;, etc., so that they can actually extract all the specification details that the user happily didn&#x27;t even know he needed before producing an appropriate output.

Microsoft has a study for their own internal product use, and wants to show its efficacy. 
The results aren’t as broadly successful as one would hope.<p>Accenture is the kind of company that cooperates and co-markets with large orgs like Microsoft. With ~300 devs in the pool they hardly move the population at all, and they cannot be assumed to be objective since they are building a marketing&#x2F;consulting division around AI workflows.<p>The third anonymous company didn’t actually have a randomized controlled trial, so it is difficult to say how one should combine their results with the RCTs. Additionally, I am sure that more than one large technology company went through similar trials and were interested in knowing the efficacy of them. That is to say, we can assume other data exist than just those included in the results.<p>Why did they select these companies, from a larger sample set? Probably because Microsoft and Accenture are incentivized by adoption, and this third company was picked through p-hacking.<p>In particular, this statement in the abstract is a very bad sign:<p>&gt; Though each separate experiment is noisy, combined across all three experiments<p>It is essentially an admission that individually, the companies don’t have statistically significant results, but when we combine these three (and probably only these three) populations we get significant results.

In raw numbers in table 1, there seem to be exactly zero effects from the use of CoPilot. Through the use of their regression model -- which introduces other predictors such as developer-fixed and week-fixed effects -- they somehow get an estimated effect of +54%(!) from CoPilot in the number of PRs. But the standard deviations are so far through the roof that the +54% is statistically insignificant within the population of 3000 devs.<p>Also, they explain the introduction of the week fixed effect as a means of controlling for holidays etc., but to me it sounds like it could also introduce a lot of unwarranted flexibility into the model. But this is a part where I don&#x27;t understand their methodology well enough to tell whether that&#x27;s a problem or not.<p>I generally err towards the benefit of the doubt when I don&#x27;t fully understand or know something, which is why I focused more on the presentation of the results than on criticizing the study and its methodology in general.

A task that isn&#x27;t too hard, but following a tutorial or just &quot;reading the docs&quot; isn&#x27;t particularly helpful given it takes a few different tools (mount, umount, fstab, blkid, mdadm, fdisk, lsblk, mkfs) and along the way things might not follow the exact steps from a guide.

Which is really to say not that the elevator operator was wiped out, but that <i>everyone</i> became the elevator operator. Thus, by the transitive properties of supply and demand, the value of operating an elevator declined to nothing.<p>Said hysteria was built on the same idea. After all, LLMs themselves are just compilers for a programming language that is incredibly similar to spoken language. But as the programming language is incredibly similar to the spoken language that nearly everyone already knows, the idea was that everyone would become the metaphorical elevator operator, &quot;wiping out&quot; programming as a job just as elevator operators were &quot;wiped out&quot; of a job when operating an elevator became accessible to all.<p>The key difference, and where the hysteria is likely to fall flat, is that when riding in an elevator there isn&#x27;t much else to do but be the elevator operator. You may as well do it. Your situation would not be meaningfully improved if another person was there to press the button for you. When it comes to programming, though, there is more effort involved. Even when a new programming language makes programming accessible, there remains a significant time commitment to carry out the work.

It&#x27;s also frequently subtly wrong in ways that a newer dev wouldn&#x27;t catch, which requires me to stop and tweak most things it generates in a way that a less experienced dev probably wouldn&#x27;t know to.

This is the real issue here and the only real way to measure it is using Justice Potter&#x27;s test (I know it when I see it), and requires an expert evaluator. In other words, tech debt. Which is something we&#x27;re seeing a growing rise in, all the fucking enshitification.<p>So I don&#x27;t think that study here contradicts [0], in fact I think they&#x27;re aligned. But I suspect people who are poor programmers (or non programmers) will use this at evidence for what they want to see. Believing naive things like lines of code, number of commits&#x2F;PRs, etc are measures of productivity rather than hints of measure. I&#x27;m all for &quot;move fast and break things&quot; as long as there&#x27;s time set aside to clean up the fucking mess you left behind. But there never is. It&#x27;s like we have businesses ADHD. There&#x27;s so much lost productivity because so much focus is placed on short term measurements and thinking. I know medium and long term thinking are hard, but humans do hard shit every day. We can do a lot better than a shoddy study like this.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41453300">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41453300</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41469873" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41469873" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zombiwoof</span><span>|</span><a href="#41468680">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41469556">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41469873">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41469873">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I sometimes wonder if LeetCode killed the Software Star</div><br/></div></div><div id="41469556" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41469556" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gibsonf1</span><span>|</span><a href="#41469873">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41467817">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41469556">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41469556">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, but what about all the bugs created and time to debug?</div><br/></div></div><div id="41467817" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41467817" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">einpoklum</span><span>|</span><a href="#41469556">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41465894">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41467817">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41467817">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Reminds me of a situation I&#x27;ve been in a few times already:<p><pre><code>   Dev: Hey einpoklum, how do I do XYZ?

Comfortable people would never challenge this policy with critical thinking, and it requires special interest to look at locally run language models, even just to choose which one to run.<p>Many developers have not advocated for more RAM on their company issued laptop to run better LLMs.<p>and I haven&#x27;t seen any internal language model that the company is running in their intranet.

Interestingly, I&#x27;d suggest the introductory material has a subtle empathy gap that can be summarised with the &quot;Regardless of how careful we are to frame what we say, there is a strong chance that it will be misinterpreted&quot; comment.<p>That applies to everyone. It is a rare and skillfull person who can get a new point into a conversation. Spend any time at all watching how political debates evolve and it is quite clear that pushing a conversation from equilibrium to equilibrium is remarkably challenging to do and often comes under heavy social attack. There are also hints coming out of the world of the therapists where there are a stunning number of people who don&#x27;t know how to express their thoughts to save themselves.<p>At a personal level the standard neurotypical strategy is not to say anything new, or anything that hasn&#x27;t been pre-vetted by something else with higher status. So the problem autistic people tend to run into is that they aren&#x27;t repeating what someone influential said in a similar context and that is an inherently high-risk strategy. Careful framing can&#x27;t possibly lead to a safety. Autistic people may act in socially inappropriate ways, but the mistake is to assume other people are good communicators. They aren&#x27;t, they are subtly limited by fairly strict guiderails and can&#x27;t express&#x2F;process a lot of concepts independently from the herd.</div><br/><div id="40853799" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40853799" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RF_Savage</span><span>|</span><a href="#40853247">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40842955">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40853799">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40853799">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Even further summarized by Osmo A.

I will answer as if you were serious :P<p>To clarify what I understood from the article:<p>Autism is independent of cognitive mapping based communication styles, but it definitely makes difficulties in communication more intense especially when all communication styles are lumped into the same bucket. When considering neurotypical people, the way language is processed (left brian vs right brain) is often based on the &quot;default&quot; for the language. Here is an oversimplification of two languages, but the &quot;default&quot; seems to fit:<p>- American Sign Language is a visual and idea based language that tends to have more &quot;weaver&quot; right brain, &quot;no point&quot; communications. The Grammar focuses on &quot;what and How&quot;.<p>- English is a auditory and command based language that tends to have more &quot;concluder&quot; left brain, &quot;get to the point&quot; communications. The grammar focues on &quot;Who did it and why&quot;<p>Improv classes increase &quot;creative pathways&quot; in the right brain. Others who are more right brained, may engage in &quot;planning and resource allocation classes&quot; to stimulate language usage in the left brain. Ability to &quot;get to the point&quot; and ability to &quot;creatively improv&quot; are both crucial skills, and by default as we speak english, the average person in class may need more &quot;improv&quot; classes to be successful. (you are an individual and not equal to &quot;average&quot;, so this doesn&#x27;t quite apply to you)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40847935" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40847935" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aleph_minus_one</span><span>|</span><a href="#40852830">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40854194">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40847935">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40847935">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Weaver communication style described in the article reminds me of the &quot;Die Katagnetten&quot; acts in the former German comedy TV show &quot;Bullyparade&quot;.<p>Here a YouTube compilation of these acts (requires good understanding of German):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=q7RFX7hwLvI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=q7RFX7hwLvI</a></div><br/><div id="40852341" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40852341" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vinnyvichy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40847935">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40854194">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40852341">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40852341">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Wow that series was clearly not just three very clever LSTMs chained to one another.<p>(Ignoring the laugh track, for the moment)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40854194" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40854194" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">surfingdino</span><span>|</span><a href="#40847935">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40852596">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40854194">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40854194">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Weavers are a small minority of communicators, and they do not communicate with a destination in mind.<p>I would question &quot;small minority&quot;.

The archetypical &#x27;weaver&#x27; conversation is introduced as the exchange of apparently disconnected facts, with each as an invitation for an interlocutor to add a fact that <i>they perceive</i> as connected to the previous one. However, if you replace <i>facts</i> with <i>scandalous stories</i>, you get the structure of gossip. The purpose of a gossip conversation is not necessarily to communicate information, but to strengthen the social bonds between interlocutors.<p>2. The &#x27;Peak Weaver&#x27; conversation could do with a little more commentary. Not being familiar with any of the references quoted, I can&#x27;t discern the structure of this conversation: how does each quote follow from its predecessor?<p>3. I can only recall one such &#x27;Peak Weaver&#x27; conversation in my life, but at the time, I felt it was more of a game to say as much as possible as obscurely as possible. However, we did have an audience at the time, which may have affected the dynamic.<p>4. This entire passage could very well be describing me:<p>&gt; I have a theory about Weaver communication and the specific ways that some brains are configured. Weavers tend to be good at memorizing things that resonate with them, like song lyrics, lines from movies or books (sometimes even whole movies), and other large pieces of information.<p>The author and his daughter seem to have a humanities bias. As someone with a hard sciences bias, I can easily memorise amusing anecdotes, but also the behaviour of complex systems. When I was a teacher, my colleagues expressed genuine <i>concern</i> of the but-you-can&#x27;t-do-that variety about my ability to speak for 10 minutes about something without notes.<p>&gt; My daughter is definitely a Weaver. Others have remarked on her memory and how with each person she knows, she will remember little “things” they had as points of interaction that were in some way meaningful. She remembers and brings up things from the past, and I know the response she’s hoping for. She wants them to build on those moments of connection and weave a tapestry of relatedness together.<p>For me, this is often about <i>things</i> and <i>ideas</i> rather than <i>moments</i>.

Or that weavers do have goals in mind, but want to achieve them via implicitly asking people to reciprocate their unstated and more specific motivations.<p>For example, the author suggests that to ask about someone else&#x27;s day, &quot;weavers&quot; might say &quot;I stubbed my toe.&quot; If their conversational partner reciprocates with the same motivation, the quality of each person&#x27;s day will surface in the conversation. From what I know, some part of this might fall under the so-called &quot;double empathy problem.&quot; I&#x27;m not an expert, however.<p>From the outside, neurotypical view, it&#x27;s hard to know what to make of this. There is probably no way to describe or theorize about different sub-types of communication styles (or the underlying dimensional differences without coming up with straw-person arguments and using oddly abstract language. For the author to take this idea further, they&#x27;d have to convince neurotypical people how weaving is different from how neurotypical (?) people frequently engage in extended riffs.

[... Rest of blog post...]<p>LLM Output:<p>Hacker News Comment<p>&gt; Summary: Terra Vance&#x27;s article identifies two communication styles within the neurodivergent community: Concluders, who aim to make a point, and Weavers, who build interconnected conversational tapestries without a fixed endpoint. This distinction can cause misunderstandings and conflicts but recognizing and accommodating these differences can enhance mutual understanding and relationships.<p>&gt; Insightful Analysis: This distinction between Concluders and Weavers is a fascinating lens through which to view communication breakdowns, especially within neurodivergent communities. It underscores the importance of neurodiversity and the need for broader societal understanding and accommodation of different communication styles. This could have profound implications not just for personal relationships but also in professional settings, where miscommunications can lead to significant consequences. Moreover, it challenges the conventional view of communication effectiveness, suggesting that what is often seen as a lack of social skills may simply be a different, equally valid way of interacting. This perspective could foster more inclusive environments and help reduce the stigma faced by neurodivergent individuals.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40850919" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40850919" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xnyan</span><span>|</span><a href="#40842530">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40850072">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40853000">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40850919">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40850919">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What do you think is the goal of the commenter&#x27;s behavior on hackernews?

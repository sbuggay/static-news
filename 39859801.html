Every. Single. Time. Of course, I have some independent confirmation that the proofs weren&#x27;t easier than in any of my other work (e.g. my coauthors and I had to work just as hard to get them), but this led to having to resubmit them to less prestigious journals than the ones which normally published my work.<p>I gave up on this approach, and realize now that the opposite is more likely to be rewarded: out of  18 eventually-published papers, I only managed to piss off the referees enough for a revise&#x2F;resubmit decision once, and I really went out of my way to keep the proofs vague that time.<p>Of course, I had a largely unremarkable career in a somewhat niche subfield: I&#x27;m sure there are levels where (a), (b), and more importantly the sheer speed required to get a result out are bigger incentives.

Use the style needed to get the paper accepted. Then, add a supplementary or appendix of the paper that is written for the human graduate student. Put in worked out examples, further details on the proof. Most times, it will just get through, and you will have accomplished your goal.<p>If the journal demands you remove the appendix or supplementary, just remove it from the published manuscript. Then add it to your ArXiv submission.</div><br/><div id="39861047" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39861047" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">saithound</span><span>|</span><a href="#39860423">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39860866">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39861215">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39861047">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39861047">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is good advice, but for a very different problem.<p>1. The problem in math is not that the way the &quot;orthodoxy&quot; insists on presenting things in a suboptimal way, but that if the reviewers find a good explanation of your result, they&#x27;ll recommend that you publish in a lower-ranked venue than your result would ordinarily merit (at least unless you solved a famous problem). So researchers are incentivized to make the presentations of the proofs as opaque as possible. You can see this in conference and workshop talks (which tend to happen pre-publication in math), in many fields speakers always avoid presenting _any_ proofs. Putting better explanations in an appendix, which the referees can read, simply wouldn&#x27;t help.<p>2. Being easy-to-understand at first is actively punished, but even being easy-to-understand in the long run is not rewarded. You can always write an explanatory blog post after the publication decision has been made, but you won&#x27;t put effort into writing one if you don&#x27;t gain anything from it. This applies even more to the people in the example, who wrote on a typewriter in the 1970s. There were no blogs, and it was much harder to get an appendix through because page limits were physical limits, and the act of writing was much more onerous before the age of computers and LaTeX. There was no point to doing it given that it was actively discouraged.</div><br/><div id="39861411" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39861411" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">abdullahkhalids</span><span>|</span><a href="#39860423">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39861047">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39861591">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39861411">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39861411">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think this is fair criticism.

Physicists are quite a lot less grouchy than mathematicians, and there is a lot less of your point 1 in Physics.<p>That said, to present in &quot;high impact&quot; journals, you do have to write your results in some grand fashion where it is the greatest thing since sliced bread. But the results, not the proofs. Then again, the difficult theorem proving papers are rarely published in high impact journals.<p>Also, I have seen quite a number of papers where the arxiv submission is more updated&#x2F;expanded than the published version.

Good article. As a non-academic, it is cool to see the idea of “what makes a good paper” explored.
A lot of the concepts mentioned seem to hold up really well in theory but ultimately just seem like stylistic differences, to me.
Academic writing can have an international audience and perhaps “just being technical” has advantages.

All of the extra fluffiness means I have to do two translations - from the fluffy part to the actual maths and then back again - each time to understand what he is getting at.<p>In my opinion, great maths writing is both rigourous and engaging. I would use &quot;Calculus&quot; by Michael Spivak as an example. It&#x27;s really lovely to read but also concise and elegant and the beauty of (and love for) the maths comes through on every page. The author isn&#x27;t trying to turn it into a short story and it&#x27;s not padded out with additional rhetorical bullshit like &quot;And now we come to a key player: the group of deck transformations.&quot; That sentence makes me want to puke just a little bit.<p>But all of the above is a matter of opinion.  This, for me is a <i>hard nope</i>:<p><pre><code>   This may require “watering down” the results being described — stating corollaries or special cases instead of the full theorems in their maximal generality.

Like when people give you Fermat&#x27;s little theorem[1] and they say a^p is congruent with a mod p but that is equivalent to saying if p does not divide a then a^(p-1) congruent with 1 (which is the one you&#x27;re going to actually use most of the time).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fermat&#x27;s_little_theorem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fermat&#x27;s_little_theorem</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39860195" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39860195" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bedobi</span><span>|</span><a href="#39861344">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39861043">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39860195">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39860195">[16 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m no mathematician, so I only took basic school math, but I hated every moment of it.

They believe 90% of their students are too stupid to understand things, while this is just a convinient explaination for their own failures. I once was convinced of being that student.<p>I met <i>one</i> kid that I couldn&#x27;t teach anything because he would forget things I told him 15 minutes befoee. He was a refugee from Afghanistan and severely traumatized.<p>The truth is that we should look to the best when teaching and we would be stupid if we didn&#x27;t. And the best are people like 3blue1brown. If your class falls significantly below such a level of clarity and engagement it will suck. During my own math education I had teachers that left out the most fundamental applications. E.g. something like an integral has clear applications, it is a new super power with which you can solve new problems — yet all we did was learning a receipe and solving abstract problems. The fact that it was a super power was something I had to figure out myself, later.<p>And this was common. I even was lucky because I had a good physics teacher who managed to being up a lot of what we learned in math and give it a more practical feel, but most of my friends from other schools were not so lucky.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39861043" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39861043" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">js8</span><span>|</span><a href="#39860195">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39861043">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39861043">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">IMHO it&#x27;s even worse.

Practical value of MVT is that we can apply it in the process of describing a solution, i.e. an algorithm. But if you have a SAT algorithm that can somehow inherently apply a finite instance of MVT, you no longer need to know what MVT is.<p>And this is at the heart of P vs NP question, how to solve SAT, and once we understand that, all the math that is about solving equations (i.e. that of practical value) will become very boring. Kinda like when a game becomes solved with a computer.<p>(This reminds me of Chomsky and Norvig debate on the machine learning and nature of understanding. I wouldn&#x27;t think I would take Norvig&#x27;s position, yet here we are.)<p>Addendum: I am also not arguing that computers writing proofs are a necessity for this, but rather efficiently (as possible) solving SAT instances. You don&#x27;t need to state a hypothesis (and thus prove it) for an infinite number of cases to solve practical problems.<p>I am also not judging value of math - yeah, it is fun. All I am saying it inherently has a human dimension in the sense we don&#x27;t need it (assuming we have an efficient SAT solver) to solve practical problems.</div><br/><div id="39861446" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39861446" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seanhunter</span><span>|</span><a href="#39861043">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39861204">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39861446">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39861446">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Most equations that can be solved can already be solved symbolically by things like mathematica or numerically by a grab-bag of numerical techniques that every maths, engineering and physics student learns at some point.

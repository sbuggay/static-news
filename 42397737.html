Someone said that &quot;x86 cannot have acquire&#x2F;release semantics&quot;, because by default x86 has total store order (TSO).<p>My question: What stops Intel or AMD from providing an opt-in weaker memory model? Or what would the programming model look like for new programs that wanted to abandon TSO for better performance? Would it just be weak order prefixes for existing memory-altering instructions? Would you need a process-wide bit to weakly order the whole program? Would that affect loaded libraries (including OS-provided libraries) too?

An x86 store is not only a release store, but it has an additional property that could be called of being an &quot;initial store&quot;, i.e. a store that is guaranteed to be performed before all subsequent stores.<p>An x86 load is not only an acquire load, but it has an additional property that could be called of being a &quot;final load&quot;, i.e. a load that is guaranteed to be performed after all prior loads.<p>The research paper that has introduced the concepts of acquire loads and release stores (in May 1990) was mistaken.

The Arm Aarch64 acquire barrier has the confusing mnemonic DMB.LD, apparently inspired by the x86 LFENCE, which is also an acquire barrier, not a load barrier, despite its confusing mnemonic.<p>(a load barrier guarantees that all prior loads are performed before all subsequent loads; an acquire barrier guarantees that all prior loads are performed before all subsequent loads <i>and</i> stores; such memory barriers are stronger than necessary; the weaker ordering properties provided by the 4 kinds of ordered loads and stores are sufficient)</div><br/></div></div><div id="42403628" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42403628" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kmeisthax</span><span>|</span><a href="#42401501">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42403078">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42403754">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42401686">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42403628">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42403628">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For those watching along at home, we&#x27;re talking about these two comments from dragontamer:<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27753913">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27753913</a><p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27762749">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27762749</a><p>I interpreted dragontamer&#x27;s comment to mean &quot;x86 does not have relaxed stores&quot;, not &quot;x86 does not have a strong memory model&quot;.

My assumption is that no hardware provides memory ordering exactly as weak as consume, so I shouldn&#x27;t bother asking for it, since it&#x27;ll just get strengthened to acquire on any chip that matters.<p>You have it wrong here.<p>So the basic idea behind release&#x2F;consume comes from an observation that, on all hardware not named Alpha [1], there is no hardware fence needed to guarantee that a load happens-before another load that is data-dependent on the first load. So the C++ committee decided to add a memory model that would preserve this guarantee. A consume load is exactly like an acquire load, but only for other loads that are data-dependent on that load as opposed to all loads in general. So whereas an acquire load requires a fence on pretty much every hardware not x86 or SPARC in TSO mode, a consume load would only require a fence on Alpha.<p>For various reasons, data-dependency isn&#x27;t a property that compilers are in the position of guaranteeing, which means every compiler ended up implementing consume as the stronger acquire instead, defeating its entire design goal of eliminating unnecessary fences. There have been a couple of attempts within the committee to try to find a path that would let something like consume by tweaking the necessary data dependence definitions, but none of them have swayed the implementers, so the current state is that they&#x27;ve given up and let consume die.<p>Of particular note is that release&#x2F;consume is not designed to <i>support</i> the Alpha memory model; in fact, it&#x27;s quite the opposite: it&#x27;s designed to support everybody <i>but</i> Alpha, since for Alpha (and essentially only Alpha), release&#x2F;consume is not usefully weaker than release&#x2F;acquire. Instead, the people who benefit are the PPCs and the ARMs of the world, for whom release&#x2F;consume is a better approximation of their native memory model and would allow many fences to be omitted.<p>[1] Actually, some accelerator hardware might have memory models as weak as Alpha here, but I&#x27;m far less familiar with memory models as they apply to accelerators.</div><br/><div id="42406274" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42406274" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kmeisthax</span><span>|</span><a href="#42401501">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42403869">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42404365">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42406274">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42406274">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So, just to confirm my own (new) understanding now:<p>Consume is &quot;I want to read data from a pointer, please do not reorder loads that go through the pointer&quot;<p>and Acquire is &quot;I want to read data from a pointer, please do not reorder loads that happen after this one, *whether or not they go through the same pointer&quot;<p>there&#x27;s no relation to the Alpha aside from it being the only processor that needs a barrier for Consume<p>and for whatever reason compilers don&#x27;t or can&#x27;t do the dependency tracking that would let them take advantage of the weaker guarantees of Consume, so in practice it just becomes Acquire?</div><br/></div></div><div id="42404365" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42404365" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gpderetta</span><span>|</span><a href="#42401501">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42403869">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42406274">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42401686">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42404365">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42404365">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you!

So now they either have some outdated dependencies they&#x27;ll never update or had to re-write it back into something else.<p>Even without silverlight concerns, most .net places I&#x27;ve worked have very much been legacy focused. This might be my own culture fit at interviews so I end up with places with lots of legacy of course.<p>But these giant legacy systems already have a plethora of mixed web technologies from ASP.net webforms, asp.net MVC, through .net core MVC, and many others. The willingness to add another different technology into the mix isn&#x27;t relished.<p>For small companies, the cost of migrating older projects to new technologies is a significant burden which gets ignored for as long as it can be reasonably done so.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38361085" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38361085" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smokel</span><span>|</span><a href="#38361132">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38361085">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38361085">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A lot of people seem to think that front-end and back-end developers are intrinsically different people.  This would be the reason why full-stack frameworks (Kotlin for JavaScript, Scala.js, JavaScript backends, and now Blazor) never really take off.<p>I find this rather strange.  I can understand that people specialize, but it&#x27;s not like typical application front-end or back-ends are rocket science and require a PhD or something.  I have seen back-end developers create ugly, near unusable, user interfaces, and I have seen front-end developers write Hello, World!s that would deadlock.  However, if both would take some time to pick up a few hints here and there, would they not turn into proficient full-stack developers?<p>Am I this misguided?  Or is there another reason for these full-stack frameworks to never get the traction they deserve?</div><br/><div id="38361161" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38361161" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">superb_dev</span><span>|</span><a href="#38361085">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38361143">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38361161">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38361161">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Some people just don’t enjoy front end work, and vice versa</div><br/></div></div><div id="38361143" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38361143" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">huytersd</span><span>|</span><a href="#38361085">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38361161">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38361143">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38361143">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah and then why don’t devs learn to administer their own databases as well. While they’re at it, writing some QA test cases can’t be all that hard. Continuous integration is pretty straightforward to set up so that as well. To be fair, it’s rather formulaic to come up with UI designs as well. Also security, load balancing and requirement docs just take a little dabbling to learn.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

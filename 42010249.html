Massive risk reduction by getting these systems all under 1 roof. We found a lot of issues with the original data. We automated the lineage generation, data quality, data integrity, etc. We developed a frame work that made everything batteries included. Transformations were done as linear set of SQL steps or a DAG of sql steps if required. You could do more complicated things in reusable plugins if needed. We had a rock solid old school scheduler application also. We had thousands of these jobs.  We had an automated data comparison tool that cataloged old data and ran the original code vs the new code on the same set of data.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s impossible to pull off but it was a hard project for sure.

That led to our CEO being personally yelled at by a <i>much</i> larger CEO, and our CEO (to his credit) didn&#x27;t blame us (we&#x27;d raised the alarms that the bills were estimates and not auditable) but did say &quot;this can never happen again, I trust you, do whatever needs to happen to make sure this never happens again.&quot;<p>And once we had #1 solid and tight, we were able to leverage that solid auditable data to generate solid dashboard numbers that <i>always</i> squared with what showed on the bill.</div><br/><div id="42031416" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42031416" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RHSman2</span><span>|</span><a href="#42030101">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42030487">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42031306">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42031416">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42031416">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A CEO worth working for</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42029336" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42029336" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">iamthepieman</span><span>|</span><a href="#42030101">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42031857">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42029336">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42029336">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I do not use this term to refer to myself.

My use of code is essentially a shim between an SFTP client and SQL Server in this scenario. Maybe ~200 lines to connect, locate the files, run the bulk load operation, and then invoke the merge commands. Most of the fun bits are in the actual merge scripts.<p>Once your data is safely inside the database (temporary load tables or otherwise), there really isn&#x27;t a good excuse for pulling it out and playing a bunch of circus tricks on it. Moving and transforming data <i>within</i> the RDBMS is infinitely more reliable than doing it with external tooling. Your ETL code should be entirely about getting the data safely into the RDBMS. It shouldn&#x27;t even be responsible for testing new&#x2F;deleted&#x2F;modified records. You really want to use SQL for that.<p>You&#x27;ll also be able to recruit more help if everything is neatly contained within the SQL tooling. In my scenario, business analysts can look at the merge commands and quickly iterate on the data pipeline if certain customers have weird quirks. They cannot do the same with some elaborate set of codebases, microservices, etc.<p>One specific thing that really sold me on this path was seeing how CTEs and views can make the T part of ETL 10000000x easier than even the fanciest code helpers like LINQ.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42029300" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42029300" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">parpfish</span><span>|</span><a href="#42028821">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42030517">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42029907">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42029300">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42029300">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">data engineer gives data science a run for their money when it comes to ambiguous job expectations.<p>I’ve seen it mean anything from “distributed computing expert” to “knows SQL”</div><br/><div id="42029451" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42029451" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">marcosdumay</span><span>|</span><a href="#42028821">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42029300">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42030103">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42029451">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42029451">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; to “knows SQL”<p>There are still ways to go.

Not &#x27;how to write software&#x27;, that&#x27;s been done; I mean all the forms of engineering around software&#x2F;information systems. In my dream, I write the books, everyone reads them, and starts doing their jobs right.<p>But then I remember, I, a person arrogant enough to believe he knows how to do things right, still can&#x27;t get shit done right. Maybe if I were a one-man company, I could &#x27;do everything right&#x27;, and feel good about the result. But I depend on an entire company of people to do the right thing, in the right way, at the right time. That&#x27;s hard even with the best people. No company is made up of the best people. It&#x27;s always a mix of the best, worst, and in-between.<p>Strangely, a company can put out a decent product, despite the company being a tire fire. This is some comfort when you get older. You realize that everything being shit is okay, as long as the bills are paid. I have PTSD from when the thing that paid the bills was on fire, every week, for years. Lately at every job I have, I internally panic and scream at how horrible everything is. Because I&#x27;m haunted by what <i>might</i> happen. But it&#x27;s not happening yet. So I muffle the screams, smile and nod along with the stand-up-meeting-cum-status-update.<p>The sad thing is, I forget that it&#x27;s okay that the stand-up is shit. I forget that I&#x27;m still getting a fat paycheck just to sit in meetings that could have been an e-mail. I forget that, despite the company bleeding cloud costs [no savings plans, RIs, serverless, right-sizing, etc], we seem to be making a profit. Despite the terrible designs, bad process, ineffective leadership, absentee management, lack of security, and all the rest, the bottom line is fine. The shit is fine. Currently, and probably for the unforeseeable future.<p>I get craftsmanship. I&#x27;m a crappy woodworker. I enjoy making things well, and getting better at it. But our jobs are not fine woodworking. Our jobs are construction. We are banging rusted nails into shitty, twisted, racked, cupped, knotty-ass studs. If we&#x27;re <i>lucky</i>. Yeah, this building is going to be shit. But somebody&#x27;s still going to pay for it. And there&#x27;ll be another job after. If we really wanted fine woodworking, we never would have taken this job, and we know it. We&#x27;d be struggling to sell a cabinet that took us two 80+ hour weeks, too tired to appreciate its beauty, too defeated by flaws only we notice.<p>So let&#x27;s stop beating ourselves up. Let&#x27;s stop beating each other up. We don&#x27;t, can&#x27;t, won&#x27;t, find meaning in this monument to mediocrity. No comfort from the pain zone. No pride to take home. But we are paying the bills, with more left over than most have. No broken backs and long hours. No lack of health care, no abuse from customers or the public. Not even that big a worry about job security. We are the lucky ones. We are blessed with a golden shovel. So let&#x27;s do like those blue collar laborers we often idolize, and get to this annoying, bloody awful work that we are blessed with.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42029650" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42029650" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">halfcat</span><span>|</span><a href="#42031800">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42031276">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42029650">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42029650">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What’s the solution to wrangling these data projects?<p>The author’s experience is not far off from my own.<p>1. Any solution in place can only be understood by the person who created it<p>2. <i>”No, we can’t change that because then we’d have to validate everything from scratch again”</i><p>And therefore, as the author says:<p>&gt; <i>”we&#x27;ll continue with the work instead of fixing the critical production error”</i><p>I’m honestly not sure how to address it either. With traditional software dev we’d write tests, incorporate those into CI&#x2F;CD, and start to course correct. We can use sample data to validate the code does what we think it does and that we didn’t break it.<p>But in these data projects, it’s not only the code that’s changing, but the data is also a moving target. You can write a test with sample data, but tomorrow your data might change because someone in sales added a custom field to the CRM, or IT upgraded the accounting software and all of the unique IDs changed, or someone upgraded their Excel version, or whatever.<p>And your code that works on the sample data needs to handle all of this, which obviously it can’t. You can try to validate the data somehow, check the schema, check if the number of rows hasn’t doubled or halved, and so forth, and then stop it from importing until you look into it, but also you can’t stop inbound data because an exec has a meeting in a few hours and expects their report to be updated.<p>I heard something about “data contracts” that’s supposed to address this, but it sounds like the next in a long line of buzz words intended to get management to buy another data product.<p>Has anyone worked in this kind of project that went well?</div><br/><div id="42031435" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42031435" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ludicity</span><span>|</span><a href="#42029650">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42029988">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42031435">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42031435">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Author here, and also executive director at Hermit Tech now where we do things like this. Your approach has the core of how I&#x27;d go about it. The contract stuff is legit, though you don&#x27;t need to buy a product for it.<p>The thing that is hard at big organizations isn&#x27;t that executives need the data for meetings. The issue right now is that many organizations are already 3-4 years into building their analytics platforms, and Chief Data Officers worldwide are trying to prevent their role from disappearing. They&#x27;re already very much &quot;Mom, we have CTO at home&quot; in many companies, as evidenced by the fact they&#x27;re usually reporting to the CTO or CFO.<p>So at this stage, they&#x27;ve already told the business that the platform is &quot;ready&quot;, and they are onboarding data sources. With no way to measure data quality, the only thing visible at the organization level is number of data sources onboarded. The fastest way to onboard data sources is to have good CI&#x2F;CD and a solid developer environment, but this would probably result in slowdown for 1 - 2 months even if you had executive backing to bulldoze all objections from the IT department.<p>That&#x27;s the sort of thing I can commit my team to as a business owner, but most executives don&#x27;t have the nerve to slow delivery down and aren&#x27;t losing money out of their pocket due to the inefficiency - I get to talk with a lot of them due to the blog&#x27;s success these days, and many of them really are just employees with more status, with the same incentives. And to make it worse, the loss of nerve is actually understandable, because the type of team that would build something this bad will also waste those two months then still deliver slowly! But most people aren&#x27;t thinking in terms this complex, and yes, I know it isn&#x27;t that complex.<p>I&#x27;m expecting to pick up some work in this area at larger orgs in a few years when these leaders rotate out and new leaders rotate in and go &quot;what the hell IS this?&quot;, but for now we&#x27;re mostly aimed at helping smaller places do it right from day one.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42029988" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42029988" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">3np</span><span>|</span><a href="#42029650">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42031435">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42031276">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42029988">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42029988">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;We should add a single-source-of truth validation microservice that we put in front of all insertions, putting failing messages on a separate queue&quot;<p>And on it goes.</div><br/><div id="42030049" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42030049" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Liquix</span><span>|</span><a href="#42029650">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42029988">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42031276">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42030049">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42030049">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;927&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;927&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42031276" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42031276" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">erulabs</span><span>|</span><a href="#42029650">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42030076">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42031276">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42031276">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a regular old “platform engineer” I fight to ignore “data platform” tasks.

I’ll get you a chart, we’ll move on. If you want “a data analytics platform to enable blah blah blah” I’m out, I can’t do it. My eyes won’t focus, my hands stop moving.<p>Developers sometimes tell me stuff like “Kubernetes is too complex”, “jeez React is a pain”. I send those quotes to my friends stuck writing 195 step DAGs to transform log files from s3 into s3 so they can eventually land in s3 - ah yes but they’re parquet somewhere in between, and that matters for some reason.

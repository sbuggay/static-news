They aren’t being “drilled” to learn “mama.” They have actual needs in an actual social context and attend to nuanced details of that context to make complex statistical inferences about the world, their perceptions, and their body. Mostly subconsciously.<p>Yes, there are specific areas where drilling can help us accelerate or catch up. Many kids seem to need explicit phonetics instruction in order to make the leap to reading words. Phonological speech interventions are often drill-like. Practicing musical scales does make you more fluent in improvisation. Drilling the mechanics of a repertoire piece frees your mind to focus on higher-order expression and interpretation. They’re valuable, they have a place.<p>But this is just a small slice of learning. It’s disproportionately important for passing tests (And getting hired at tech companies!), which to me is the crux of the issue.<p>If I had to reformulate OP’s argument to something I can get behind, it would be more about deliberate practice or “putting in the reps.” This is also often boring, and differentiates highly successful people from average performers. But it’s a broader and more purposeful set of activities than “memorization” would imply.</div><br/><div id="41123562" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41123562" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">josephg</span><span>|</span><a href="#41119684">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41121032">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41123562">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41123562">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; We do this mainly because experts suck at empathizing with learners and fail to understand that the symbol has meaning for them but not for the learner.<p>I hear you; but teaching deep expertise is really hard. We can use your example of a child learning their first language. They will really understand it. But people are famously, hilariously terrible at teaching their native tongue. We know how to conjugate, and how to use verbs and adverbs and all the rest. But it’s all intuitive - we have no symbolic understanding of it. If that’s the case, we can’t explain it in words.<p>Here’s a weird fact: if you look around the room you’re in now, I bet you know what it would feel like on your tongue to lick everything you see. We probably learned that in the “put everything in your mouth” baby phase.<p>You are an expert. But if you wanted to, how would you teach that? I think the learner would just have to go lick a lot of things for themself.<p>I believe a lot of real learning is actually like that. When I taught programming, I think I was a frustrating teacher. My students would ask things like “what’s the best way to structure this program?” And I would say “I don’t know. Let’s brainstorm a few ways then you should pick at least one and try writing it like that. Figure it out in code.” I think you become great at programming by licking all the programs you can find. Same with music and art and languages (go have conversations with native speakers).<p>There is only so much the best teacher can teach. Sometimes you just have to walk around licking things.</div><br/><div id="41126769" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41126769" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">edanm</span><span>|</span><a href="#41119684">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41123562">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41126883">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41126769">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41126769">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Here’s a weird fact: if you look around the room you’re in now, I bet you know what it would feel like on your tongue to lick everything you see.

I think the learner would just have to go lick a lot of things for themself.<p>Actually, I don&#x27;t agree with that. If I look around the room I&#x27;m in now, there are a LOT of different objects, and I can imagine what they&#x27;d feel like on my tongue, even though I&#x27;ve never physically licked the vast majority of those types of objects. To give a couple of examples: a partly used candle, the &quot;lighting&quot; side of a matchbox, guitar strings, lightbulbs, new bike inner tube. The reason I can imagine how they would feel, despite never having actually licked them, is that in our early years we&#x27;re just exploring the world and building a mental model. We stop licking everything quite early when we figure out the class of things that&#x27;s generally food, but by that point we&#x27;ve learned how to correlate the sense of feelings we get from our tongue with the sense of feelings we get from our fingers, because we also touch all those items a lot with our fingers. With enough examples, we become pretty good at pattern matching across senses, so e.g. I can look at an object, from the shadows see that it&#x27;s bumpy, and have a pretty good idea what it&#x27;d feel like if I rubbed it with my fingertips or even licked it, or if it&#x27;s glass, plastic, metal, fabric, I&#x27;d know it&#x27;d produce different feelings ranging from differences in friction, thermal conductivity, etc.<p>That&#x27;s quite a lot of text, but the TLDR is that we don&#x27;t need to lick everything to have a pretty good idea of how it&#x27;d feel on the tongue, just enough to have a general idea of the properties of different classes of materials. Given that most babies stop licking&#x2F;chewing everything before they&#x27;ve reached nursery age, it&#x27;s clear that for objects we encounter in later life it&#x27;s not the licking per-se that matters for this &quot;skill&quot;, but whether we&#x27;ve learned to associate the senses.<p>I guess taste is a bit different, but my default would just be to assume that most objects are tasteless unless they also have an odour.</div><br/><div id="41127203" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41127203" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">withinboredom</span><span>|</span><a href="#41119684">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41127193">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41126883">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41127203">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41127203">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I feel like you totally missed the point and then reiterated exactly what they said in another way.</div><br/><div id="41127220" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41127220" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ralferoo</span><span>|</span><a href="#41119684">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41127203">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41126883">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41127220">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41127220">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not really.

That is what you want to build, memory itself is mostly redundant compared to those models, as those models lets you easily rediscover information but memory doesn&#x27;t let you parse problems.<p>Memorizing something implies there is a piece of information you can later recall. If there is nothing to recall such as with tacit skills then you don&#x27;t learn it by memorizing, you learn it by practice and thinking and theorizing until it &quot;clicks&quot;.<p>A computer can remember everything trivially, but it hasn&#x27;t built any models based on the information so all that information is useful. The same happens in our head, the value isn&#x27;t in the memory it is in the structures you built as an answer to that memory. The memory itself is a red herring, don&#x27;t chase it, chase the understanding.<p>So for example, I have made a model in my head that parses electronic circuit problems for me, with that I don&#x27;t need any formulas as it does the work. There is no memory tied to that model, it just solves things, there is nothing to recall, nothing to write down etc, it isn&#x27;t a piece of information it is an active skill I have built. Saying otherwise is like saying that you memorize how to move your arm, no that is you building up intuition and reflexes, that isn&#x27;t what we call memorizing.<p>You can call that a pattern matcher, you can&#x27;t recall one of your heads pattern matchers. Pattern matchers can be tied to recall, but pattern matchers can also solve problems for you by themselves without ever invoking any memory. Pattern matchers are much more powerful than memories since they can solve a whole slew of similar problems while memories just solves one thing, so there is no need to go memory -&gt; pattern matcher, you can go instantly to pattern matcher without ever commiting anything to memory.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41122242" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41122242" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jjk166</span><span>|</span><a href="#41119684">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41121032">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41122771">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41121442">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41122242">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41122242">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; There are questions like max takeoff weight, fuel burn rate, max dive speeds, etc. Stuff a pilot had better know or he&#x27;s a dead pilot.<p>You don&#x27;t want a pilot who is creative when it comes to max takeoff weight.<p>Obviously there are good reasons to memorize certain things, creativity just isn&#x27;t one of them.</div><br/><div id="41122422" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41122422" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">coldtea</span><span>|</span><a href="#41119684">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41122242">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41126382">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41122422">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41122422">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;<i>You don&#x27;t want a pilot who is creative when it comes to max takeoff weight.</i><p>In certain combat situations, or when smuggling coke across South and Central America, you certainly do.</div><br/><div id="41123070" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41123070" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lambda</span><span>|</span><a href="#41119684">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41122422">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41126382">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41123070">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41123070">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Gravity works just as well if you&#x27;re in combat or smuggling coke.

You and I do this also, though it’s less novel and flexible and therefore maybe less salient. I think we place too much value on structured or synthetic learning as “real” learning when in fact it’s often extremely inefficient compared to our natural learning tendencies.<p>There’s a spectrum of structure, starting with what we choose to pay attention to, to an open-ended “study time,” to guided classroom activities, to timed math drills. Flashcards are at the extreme reductivist end of that spectrum. I suspect we like them because they’re easy to understand, uniform, predictable, and convenient to create and use. Creating more effective learning opportunities and supports is substantially harder, but generally worthwhile IMO.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41120442" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41120442" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nickburns</span><span>|</span><a href="#41119684">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41119939">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41122240">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41120804">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41120442">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41120442">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; A young child has basically nothing but figuring out what&#x27;s going around him</i><p>Right—not simply memorizing what&#x27;s happening around them.

I just figure taste is especially important in creative endeavors. That&#x27;s definitely the case for programming! Memorization in programming gives us architecture astronauts and design-pattern soup rather than elegant code.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I do think that it is useful and important to have a good mental model of what expertise is and how you can develop it. Memorization might be a <i>component</i> of this, but it&#x27;s going to be a <i>small</i> component at most. I expect that realistic practice with fast feedback and expert mentorship matters far more. (If you&#x27;re curious, I found the book <i>Sources of Power</i> by Gary Klein gave me a good way to think about how expertise works.)<p>At the same time, memorization has a real cost: it takes time and it&#x27;s frightfully dull. For me, at least, trying to memorize something without context is not just ineffective but also totally kills any intrinsic motivation I have for whatever I&#x27;m learning. Sometimes a bit of memorization is unavoidable, but I&#x27;ve found that to be relatively rare.

To the extent that experts have simple easily verbalizable heuristics, these are largely post-hoc attempts at explaining their intuition rather than an accurate reflection of how they make decisions.<p>And, in fact, experts can&#x27;t even always do that: it is perfectly possible for experts to make good decisions without being consciously aware of why they are making them, and explaining <i>how</i> to make good decisions is a separate skill from being able to make them in the first place. The book I mentioned has a memorable story about a firefighter who thought he had precognition after pulling his team out of a dangerous situation without any specific indicator of the danger, but I figure a more common example is experts saying they did something because it was the &quot;obvious&quot; or &quot;clean&quot; or &quot;better&quot; way to do it and getting a bit flustered when pushed further.<p>We can see this in action pretty clearly if we look at advice for, say, writing. There is a lot of advice from good writers but just memorizing and blindly following this advice is actively counterproductive. Advice you can memorize fundamentally must lack nuance and context. We can see this clearly because so many different pieces of writing advice contradict each other and because good writers do not follow any of those suggestions with any consistency.<p>The same definitely applies to programming, which is why we have both &quot;don&#x27;t repeat yourself&quot; and &quot;you ain&#x27;t going to need it&quot;, and why new programmers trying to apply either rule (or both!) to a codebase inevitably create a mess.

There is a lot of discussion there on how memory is linked directly to creativity, and to understanding concepts deeply.<p>---<p>A choice passage:<p>&quot;...<i>If the essence of creativity is linking disparate facts and ideas, then the more facility you have making associations, and the more facts and ideas you have at your disposal, the better you&#x27;ll be at coming up with new ideas. As Buzan likes to point out, Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory, was the mother of the Muses.</i><p><i>The notion that memory and creativity are two sides of the same coin sounds counterintuitive. Remembering and creativity seem like opposite, not complementary, processes. But the idea that they are one and the same is actually quite old, and was once even taken for granted. The Latin root &#x27;inventio&#x27; is the basis of two words in our modern English vocabulary: inventory and invention. And to a mind trained in the art of memory, those two ideas were closely linked. Invention was a product of inventorying. Where do new ideas come from if not some alchemical blending of old ideas? In order to invent, one first needed a proper inventory, a bank of existing ideas to draw on. Not just an inventory, but an indexed inventory. One needed a way of finding just the right piece of information at just the right moment.</i><p><i>This is what the art of memory was ultimately most useful for. It was not merely a tool for recording but also a tool of invention and composition. &quot;The realization that composing depended on a wellfurnished and securely available memory formed the basis of rhetorical education in antiquity,&quot; writes Mary Carruthers. Brains were as organized as modern filing cabinets, with important facts, quotations, and ideas stuffed into neat mnemonic cubbyholes, where they would never go missing, and where they could be recombined and strung together on the fly. The goal of training one&#x27;s memory was to develop the capacity to leap from topic to topic and make new connections between old ideas. &quot;As an art, memory was most importantly associated in the Middles Ages with composition, not simply with retention,&quot; argues Carruthers. &quot;Those who practiced the crafts of memory used them---as all crafts are used---to make new things: prayers, meditations, sermons, pictures, hymns, stories, and poems.&quot; ...&quot;</i></div><br/><div id="41116808" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41116808" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kiwi_kim</span><span>|</span><a href="#41115622">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41115870">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41117836">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41116808">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41116808">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great book, motivated me to then read The Art of Memory by Frances Yates.<p>Although I&#x27;d say traditional mnemonic devices like memory palaces are basically linear information storage and recall devices.

Thanks!<p>When making flashcards I draw a lot from the softer type of theory-building they do in social sciences. I ask questions like<p>- What are the properties of this?<p>- What variants of this exist? I.e. how would I recognise this in the wild, or in other shapes?<p>- What subcomponents can this be deconstructed into?<p>- Into which bigger picture does this fit?<p>- What are the consequences of this? What are its antecedents?<p>- What is this a special case of? What would a generalisation of this look like?<p>- Which are other related things? What are their similarities and differences?<p>- In what context might I need to know this?<p>Whenever I encounter what seems like a significant thing I loosely ask some of these questions, and try to construct atomic, focused flashcards from the answers.<p>I say loosely because it would take forever to to through all questions for all flashcards I make, so there&#x27;s some bit of intuition that attracts me to which I think are the most significant questions for any given thing.<p>-----<p>One trick to make flashcards more specific that I use (maybe even abuse) is putting part of the answer into the prompt. Instead of prompting &quot;What is the property of subexponential distributions I found meaningful in this book?&quot; I might prompt &quot;What behaviour do subexponential distributions have around high barriers that others don&#x27;t?&quot; -- I&#x27;m giving away part of the answer by including &quot;high barrier&quot; in the prompt, but I&#x27;m okay with that.<p>If I&#x27;m concerned about that, I might create a second flashcard prompting something like &quot;What can a subexponential distribution do in one step that a more well-behaved distribution needs many steps to do?&quot; with the answer &quot;clear a high barrier&quot;. That captures both sides of the property without making too general a prompt.<p>I also do this a lot with &quot;why&quot; questions. Instead of prompting &quot;what is the definition of y?&quot; I might prompt &quot;why is the definition of y=f(x)?&quot; That gives away essentially the entire answer but focuses on the why instead.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41117617" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41117617" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">naasking</span><span>|</span><a href="#41116600">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41119264">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41117238">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41117617">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41117617">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re always memorizing something at some level, even in math where you can derive so much after memorizing some core concepts and deductions.</div><br/><div id="41119057" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41119057" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">HPsquared</span><span>|</span><a href="#41116600">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41117617">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41118055">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41119057">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41119057">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Math proof and derivations are a bit like remembering a walking route.

It&#x27;s going to just continue making relatively simple recombinations of its training set until somebody gives it a new training set to remix. This remix-only nature is no different with modern knowledge, but simply extremely obfuscated because there&#x27;s such a massive base of information, and nobody is aware of anything more than a minuscule fraction of it all.<p>---<p>As for the &#x27;secret&#x27; of LLMs, I think it&#x27;s largely that most language is <i>extremely</i> redundant. One thought or point naturally flows.... why do I complete the rest of this statement? You already know exactly what I&#x27;m going to say, right? And from that statement the rest of my argument will also mostly write itself. Yet we do write out the rest, which is kind of weird if you think about it. Anyhow the point is that by looking at language &#x27;flow correlations&#x27; over huge samples, LLMs can reconstruct and remix arbitrarily long dialogue from even the shortest of initial inputs. And it usually sounds at least reasonable, except when it doesn&#x27;t and we call it a hallucination, but it&#x27;s quite a misnomer because the entire process is a hallucination.</div><br/><div id="41116597" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41116597" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ArcaneMoose</span><span>|</span><a href="#41115909">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41116350">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41115747">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41116597">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41116597">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Interesting point - thanks for sharing!

I would be really curious to see how online-first AI models could work, focusing on a constant input stream and iterating on weights. Also I wonder how much knowledge is baked into our DNA through evolution. I have a hunch that this is somewhat analogous to model architectures.<p>Btw - although I see evidence of LLMs creating &quot;new ideas&quot; through combinations of ideas, I am a bit mystified by their apparent reasoning issues.

Memory and creativity are a lot more complex than I realized. There are different types of each, and it seems like they interact in complex ways. Here&#x27;s the findings from the abstract:<p>&gt; We found a small but significant (r = .19) correlation between memory and creative cognition. Among semantic, episodic, working, and short-term memory, all correlations were significant, but semantic memory – particularly verbal fluency, the ability to strategically retrieve information from long-term memory – was found to drive this relationship. Further, working memory capacity was found to be more strongly related to convergent than divergent creative thinking. We also found that within visual creativity, the relationship with visual memory was greater than that of verbal memory, but within verbal creativity, the relationship with verbal memory was greater than that of visual memory. Finally, the memory- creativity correlation was larger for children compared to young adults despite no impact of age on the overall effect size. These results yield three key conclusions: (1) semantic memory supports both verbal and nonverbal creative thinking, (2) working memory supports convergent creative thinking, and (3) the cognitive control of memory is central to performance on creative thinking tasks.<p>So some memory seems to be correlated with convergent creativity, which according to wikipedia (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Convergent_thinking" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Convergent_thinking</a>) is &quot;the ability to give the &#x27;correct&#x27; answer to questions that do not require novel ideas, for instance on standardized multiple-choice tests for intelligence.&quot; It sounds like there&#x27;s less correlation with divergent creativity, which (again from wikipedia (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Divergent_thinking" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Divergent_thinking</a>)) is &quot;a thought process used to generate creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions.&quot;<p>But my real takeaway is that people here seem to have strong (emotional?) opinions on &quot;memorization vs creativity: which is better&quot;, but few people seemed to bother reading page 1 google results on the topic. So I like to think that bothering to do some cursory research beats both. :)</div><br/></div></div><div id="41115934" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41115934" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Terr_</span><span>|</span><a href="#41119753">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41115934">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41115934">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">On the other hand, <i>episodic</i> memory (insofar as that is distinct from &quot;3*9=27&quot; memorization) is built on top of creativity.<p>The vast majority of what we consider &quot;memories&quot; are the creative brain doing an on-the-fly story generation, massaged until it &quot;seems right&quot; and serviced plus a big dollop of emotional confidence.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

I just figure taste is especially important in creative endeavors. That&#x27;s definitely the case for programming! Memorization in programming gives us architecture astronauts and design-pattern soup rather than elegant code.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I do think that it is useful and important to have a good mental model of what expertise is and how you can develop it. Memorization might be a <i>component</i> of this, but it&#x27;s going to be a <i>small</i> component at most. I expect that realistic practice with fast feedback and expert mentorship matters far more. (If you&#x27;re curious, I found the book <i>Sources of Power</i> by Gary Klein gave me a good way to think about how expertise works.)<p>At the same time, memorization has a real cost: it takes time and it&#x27;s frightfully dull. For me, at least, trying to memorize something without context is not just ineffective but also totally kills any intrinsic motivation I have for whatever I&#x27;m learning. Sometimes a bit of memorization is unavoidable, but I&#x27;ve found that to be relatively rare. Otherwise, my time is generally better spent on some sort of practice in context.</div><br/><div id="41115665" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41115665" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shw1n</span><span>|</span><a href="#41115622">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41116994">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41115665">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41115665">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for reading and the response!<p>One of the points I&#x27;m trying to make is that taste and elegance fundamentally stem from an internalized heuristic -- which at it&#x27;s core is memorization.<p>I understand the connotation of &quot;memorization&quot; evokes an image of blindly memorizing without connecting, but isn&#x27;t the tastefully developed expertise just memorization of a better heuristic?</div><br/><div id="41116823" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41116823" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Llamamoe</span><span>|</span><a href="#41115622">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41115665">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41115841">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41116823">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41116823">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think I can agree, as an extremely creative person with extremely bad memory - to a point where I pretty much never memorize <i>anything</i>, whether intentionally or by accident.<p>What I find instead, is that by just processing novel information, especially if I focus on analysing it, my brain internalizes insights and builds model of that type of thing, allowing me to either imperfectly reconstruct what I&#x27;ve seen, or to come up with an infinite array of permutations, extrapolations, etc which is where the real ideas come from.<p>Further, ideas crucially revolve not around just the information itself, but the &quot;feel&quot; for what role they play in the whole, how well they do it, in what way they&#x27;re notable, etc.<p>In fact I&#x27;d straight up claim that memorization is antithetical to creativity - a perfect ML autoencoder or GAN would just regurgitate the training data.

To the extent that experts have simple easily verbalizable heuristics, these are largely post-hoc attempts at explaining their intuition rather than an accurate reflection of how they make decisions.<p>And, in fact, experts can&#x27;t even always do that: it is perfectly possible for experts to make good decisions without being consciously aware of why they are making them, and explaining <i>how</i> to make good decisions is a separate skill from being able to make them in the first place. The book I mentioned has a memorable story about a firefighter who thought he had precognition after pulling his team out of a dangerous situation without any specific indicator of the danger, but I figure a more common example is experts saying they did something because it was the &quot;obvious&quot; or &quot;clean&quot; or &quot;better&quot; way to do it and getting a bit flustered when pushed further.<p>We can see this in action pretty clearly if we look at advice for, say, writing. There is a lot of advice from good writers but just memorizing and blindly following this advice is actively counterproductive. Advice you can memorize fundamentally must lack nuance and context. We can see this clearly because so many different pieces of writing advice contradict each other and because good writers do not follow any of those suggestions with any consistency.<p>The same definitely applies to programming, which is why we have both &quot;don&#x27;t repeat yourself&quot; and &quot;you ain&#x27;t going to need it&quot;, and why new programmers trying to apply either rule (or both!) to a codebase inevitably create a mess. What I&#x27;ve found with programming advice is that most suggestions are either actively wrong or too vague to be useful. (By the time you&#x27;ve learned enough about programming to be able to follow the vague advice, you don&#x27;t need it very much!)</div><br/><div id="41116226" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41116226" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ahazred8ta</span><span>|</span><a href="#41115622">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41115841">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41115830">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41116226">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41116226">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This happened about 20 years ago when they were trying to automate recognizing cancer cells.

There is a lot of discussion there on how memory is linked directly to creativity, and to understanding concepts deeply.<p>---<p>A choice passage:<p>&quot;...<i>If the essence of creativity is linking disparate facts and ideas, then the more facility you have making associations, and the more facts and ideas you have at your disposal, the better you&#x27;ll be at coming up with new ideas. As Buzan likes to point out, Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory, was the mother of the Muses.</i><p><i>The notion that memory and creativity are two sides of the same coin sounds counterintuitive. Remembering and creativity seem like opposite, not complementary, processes. But the idea that they are one and the same is actually quite old, and was once even taken for granted. The Latin root &#x27;inventio&#x27; is the basis of two words in our modern English vocabulary: inventory and invention. And to a mind trained in the art of memory, those two ideas were closely linked. Invention was a product of inventorying. Where do new ideas come from if not some alchemical blending of old ideas? In order to invent, one first needed a proper inventory, a bank of existing ideas to draw on. Not just an inventory, but an indexed inventory. One needed a way of finding just the right piece of information at just the right moment.</i><p><i>This is what the art of memory was ultimately most useful for. It was not merely a tool for recording but also a tool of invention and composition. &quot;The realization that composing depended on a wellfurnished and securely available memory formed the basis of rhetorical education in antiquity,&quot; writes Mary Carruthers. Brains were as organized as modern filing cabinets, with important facts, quotations, and ideas stuffed into neat mnemonic cubbyholes, where they would never go missing, and where they could be recombined and strung together on the fly. The goal of training one&#x27;s memory was to develop the capacity to leap from topic to topic and make new connections between old ideas. &quot;As an art, memory was most importantly associated in the Middles Ages with composition, not simply with retention,&quot; argues Carruthers. &quot;Those who practiced the crafts of memory used them---as all crafts are used---to make new things: prayers, meditations, sermons, pictures, hymns, stories, and poems.&quot; ...&quot;</i></div><br/><div id="41116808" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41116808" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kiwi_kim</span><span>|</span><a href="#41115622">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41115870">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41115897">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41116808">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41116808">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great book, motivated me to then read The Art of Memory by Frances Yates.<p>Although I&#x27;d say traditional mnemonic devices like memory palaces are basically linear information storage and recall devices.

Language did not even exist beyond what may have been crude sounds or gesturing and collective knowledge did not fall that far beyond &#x27;poke him with the pointy side.&#x27; Somehow we went from that to putting a man on the Moon in what was essentially the blink of an eye.<p>Training an LLM on the entirety of knowledge at this dawn of humanity and, even if you give it literally infinite training time, it&#x27;s never going to go anywhere. It&#x27;s going to just continue making relatively simple recombinations of its training set until somebody gives it a new training set to remix. This remix-only nature is no different with modern knowledge, but simply extremely obfuscated because there&#x27;s such a massive base of information, and nobody is aware of anything more than a minuscule fraction of it all.<p>---<p>As for the &#x27;secret&#x27; of LLMs, I think it&#x27;s largely that most language is <i>extremely</i> redundant. One thought or point naturally flows.... why do I complete the rest of this statement? You already know exactly what I&#x27;m going to say, right? And from that statement the rest of my argument will also mostly write itself. Yet we do write out the rest, which is kind of weird if you think about it. Anyhow the point is that by looking at language &#x27;flow correlations&#x27; over huge samples, LLMs can reconstruct and remix arbitrarily long dialogue from even the shortest of initial inputs. And it usually sounds at least reasonable, except when it doesn&#x27;t and we call it a hallucination, but it&#x27;s quite a misnomer because the entire process is a hallucination.</div><br/><div id="41116597" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41116597" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ArcaneMoose</span><span>|</span><a href="#41115909">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41116350">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41115747">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41116597">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41116597">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Interesting point - thanks for sharing!

I would be really curious to see how online-first AI models could work, focusing on a constant input stream and iterating on weights. Also I wonder how much knowledge is baked into our DNA through evolution. I have a hunch that this is somewhat analogous to model architectures.<p>Btw - although I see evidence of LLMs creating &quot;new ideas&quot; through combinations of ideas, I am a bit mystified by their apparent reasoning issues.

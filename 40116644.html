The main advantage of devirtualization is that it is necessary for inlining.<p>I think that enabling inlining is just one of the indirect consequences of devirtualization, and perhaps one that is largely irrelevant for performance improvements.<p>The whole point of devirtualization is eliminating the need to resort to pointer dereferencing when calling virtual members. The main trait of a virtual class is it&#x27;s use of a vtable that requires dereferencing virtual members to access each and every one of them.<p>In classes with larger inheritance chains, you can easily have more than one pointer dereferencing taking place before you call a virtual members function.<p>Once a class is final, none of that is required anymore. When a member is referred, no dereferencing takes place.<p>Devirtualization helps performance because you are able to benefit from inheritance and not have to pay a performance penalty for that. Without the final keyword, a performance oriented project would need to be architected to not use inheritance at all, or in the very least in code in the hot path, because that sneaks gratuitous pointer dereferences all over the place, which require running extra operations and has a negative impact on caching.<p>The whole purpose of the final keyword is that compilers can easily eliminate all pointer dereferencing used by virtual members. What stops them from applying this optimization is that they have no information on whether that class will be inherited and one of its members will either override any of its members or invoke any member function implemented by one of its parent classes.<p>With the introduction of the final keyword, you are now able to tell the compiler &quot;from thereon, this is exactly what you get&quot; and the compiler can trim out anything loose.</div><br/><div id="40129061" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40129061" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">simonask</span><span>|</span><a href="#40116928">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40128945">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40117555">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40129061">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40129061">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">An extra indirection (indirect call versus direct call) is practically nothing on modern hardware.

It almost always speeds things up for microbenchmarks, as such benchmarks easily fit in icache. So programmers and modern compilers often go out of their way to do more inlining.

Except if you __force_inline__ everything, of course.<p>Inlining reduces the number of instructions in a lot of cases. Especially when things are abstracted and factored with lot of indirections into small functions that calls other small functions and so on. Consider a &#x27;isEmpty&#x27; function, which dissolves to 1 cpu instruction once inlined, compared with a call&#x2F;save reg&#x2F;compare&#x2F;return. Highly dynamic code (with most functions being virtual) tend to result in a fest of chained calls, jumping into functions doing very little work. Yes the stack is usually hot and fast, but spending 80% of the instructions doing stack management is still a big waste.<p>Compilers already have good heuristics about when they should be inlining, chances are they are a lot better at it than you. They don&#x27;t always inline, and that&#x27;s not possible anyway.<p>My experience is that compiler do marvels with inlining decisions when there are lots of small functions they _can_ inline if they want to. It gives the compiler a lot of freedom. Lambdas are great for that as well.<p>Make sure you make the most possible compile-time information available to the compiler, factor your code, don&#x27;t have huge functions, and let the compiler do its magic.

Interface calls, however, are coded differently[1].<p>Also you are correct - virtual calls are not terribly expensive, but they encroach on ever limited* CPU resources like indirect jump and load predictors and, as noted in parent comments, block inlining, which is highly undesirable.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;runtime&#x2F;blob&#x2F;5111fdc0dc464f01647d6b6078342f451bf3a499&#x2F;src&#x2F;coreclr&#x2F;vm&#x2F;amd64&#x2F;virtualcallstubcpu.hpp#L471-L505">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;runtime&#x2F;blob&#x2F;5111fdc0dc464f01647d6...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;runtime&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;design&#x2F;coreclr&#x2F;botr&#x2F;virtual-stub-dispatch.md">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;runtime&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;design&#x2F;core...</a> (mind you, the text was initially written 18 years ago, wow)<p>* through great effort of our industry to take back whatever performance wins each generation brings with even more abstractions that fail to improve our productivity</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40117201" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40117201" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">i80and</span><span>|</span><a href="#40116928">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40117555">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40117389">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40117201">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40117201">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you already have LTO, can&#x27;t the compiler determine this information for devirtualization purposes on its own?</div><br/><div id="40117547" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40117547" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ot</span><span>|</span><a href="#40116928">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40117201">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40117297">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40117547">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40117547">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In general the compiler&#x2F;linker cannot assume that derived classes won&#x27;t arrive later through a shared object.<p>You can tell it &quot;I won&#x27;t do that&quot; though with additional flags, like Clang&#x27;s -fwhole-program-vtables, and even then it&#x27;s not that simple.

I mentioned that that doesn&#x27;t appear to be true, we went back and forth until I did a compile-then-decompile of a minimal test with equality-based-ifs, and showed that the compiler actually converts equality-based-ifs to `switch` behind the scenes. The guy accepted my PR after that.<p>But there&#x27;s tons of this stuff like this in CS, and I kind of blame professors for a lot of it [1].  A large part of becoming a decent engineer [2] for me was learning to stop trusting what professors taught me in college.  Most of what they said was fine, but you can&#x27;t <i>assume</i> that; what they tell you could be out of date, or simply never correct to begin with, and as far as I can tell you have to <i>always</i> test these things.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that a lot of these &quot;it&#x27;s faster&quot; arguments are often reductive because they only are faster in extremely minimal tests.  Sometimes a microbenchmark will show that something is faster, and there&#x27;s value in that, but I think it&#x27;s important that that can also be a small percentage of the total program; compilers are obscenely good at optimizing nowadays, it can be difficult to determine <i>when</i> something will be optimized, and your assertion that something is &quot;faster&quot; might not actually be true in a non-trivial program.<p>This is why I don&#x27;t really like doing any kind of major optimizations before the program actually works. I try to keep the program in a reasonable Big-O and I try and minimize network calls cuz of latency, but I don&#x27;t bother with any kind of micro-optimizations in the first draft.  I don&#x27;t mess with bitwise, I don&#x27;t concern myself on which version of a particular data structure is a millisecond faster, I don&#x27;t focus too much on whether I can get away with a smaller sized float, etc.  Once I know that the program is correct, <i>then</i> I benchmark to see if any kind of micro-optimizations will actually matter, and often they really don&#x27;t.<p>[1] That includes me up to about a year ago.<p>[2] At least I like to pretend I am.</div><br/><div id="40118212" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40118212" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jandrewrogers</span><span>|</span><a href="#40117389">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40117566">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40118212">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40118212">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A significant part of it is that what engineers believe was effectively true at one time.

It isn&#x27;t a terrible heuristic for life in general to assume that what worked ten years ago will work today. The rate at which the equilibriums shift due to changes in hardware and software environments when designing for system performance is so rapid that you need to make a continuous habit of checking that your understanding of how the world works maps to reality.<p>I&#x27;ve solved a lot of arguments with godbolt and simple performance tests. Some topics are recurring themes among software engineers e.g.:<p>- compilers are almost always better at micro-optimizations than you are<p>- disk I&#x2F;O is almost never a bottleneck in competent designs<p>- brute-force sequential scans are often optimal algorithms<p>- memory is best treated as a block device<p>- vectorization can offer large performance gains<p>- etc...<p>No one is immune to this. I am sometimes surprised at the extent to which assumptions are no longer true when I revisit optimization work I did 10+ years ago.<p>Most performance these days is architectural, so getting the initial design right often has a bigger impact than micro-optimizations and localized Big-O tweaks.

And in that case most of the newer stuff seems to be built with performance in mind. So you gain 30 % from the JIT, 2× from Kestrel, and so on. Perhaps.<p>With a Roslyn-based compiler at work I saw 20 % perf improvement just by switching from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 6. No idea how slow .NET Framework was, though. I probably can&#x27;t target the code to that anymore.<p>But for regex even with precompilation, the compiler got a lot better at transforming the regex into an equivalent regex that performs better (automatic atomic grouping to reduce unnecessary backtracking when it&#x27;s statically known that backtracking won&#x27;t create more matches for example) and it also benefits a lot from the various vectorized implementations of Index of, etc. Typically with each improvement of one of those core methods for searching stuff in memory there&#x27;s a corresponding change that uses them in regex.<p>So where in .NET Framework a regex might walk through a whole string character by character multiple times with backtracking it might be replaced with effectively an EndsWith and LastIndexOfAny call in newer versions.</div><br/><div id="40129123" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40129123" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neonsunset</span><span>|</span><a href="#40117389">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40128705">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40128834">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40129123">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40129123">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Roslyn didn&#x27;t have much of changes in terms of optimizations - it compiles C# to IL so does very little of that, save for switches and certain new or otherwise features like collection literals.

If you are building something in the critical path of the application, the best thing to do is build it from the ground up measuring the performance of what you have as you go.  This way, each time you add something you will see the performance impact and usually there’s a more performant way of doing something that isn’t more obscure.  If you do this as you build, early choices become constraints, but because you chose the most performant thing at every stage, the whole process takes you in the direction of a highly-performant implementation.<p>Why should you care about performance?<p>I can give you my personal experience: I’ve been working on a Java web&#x2F;application server for the past 15 years and a typical request (only reading, not writing to the db) would take maybe 4-5 ms to execute.  That includes HTTP request parsing, JSON parsing, session validation, method execution, JSON serialization, and HTTP response dispatch.  Over the past 9 months I have refactored the entire application for performance and a typical request now takes about 0.25 ms or 250 microseconds.  The computer is doing so much less work to accomplish the same tasks, it’s almost silly how much work it was doing before.  And the result is the machine can handle 20x more requests in the same amount of time.  If it could handle 200 requests per second per core before, now it can handle 4000.  That means the need to scale is felt 20x less intensely, which means less complexity around scaling.<p>High performance means reduced scaling requirements.</div><br/><div id="40117844" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40117844" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tombert</span><span>|</span><a href="#40117389">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40117722">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40118567">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40117844">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40117844">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But even that sort of depends right?

I&#x27;m not going to say that processing speed is a &quot;solved&quot; problem, but I am going to say that in a lot of performance-related cases the CPU processing is probably not your problem.  I will admit that this kind of pokes holes in my previous response, because introducing more machines into the mix will almost certainly increase latency, but I think it more or less holds depending on context.<p>But I think it really is a matter of nuance, which you hinted at.  If I&#x27;m making an admin screen that&#x27;s going to have like a dozen users max, then a slow, crappy solution is probably fine; the requests will be served fast enough to where no one will notice anyway, and you can probably even get away with the cheapest machine&#x2F;VM.

Both the single precision and the double precision instructions will take the same time, except for DIVSS&#x2F;DIVSD, where the 32-bit float version is slightly faster (about 2 cycles latency faster, and reciprocal throughput of 3 versus 5 per Agner&#x27;s tables).<p>You might be thinking of x87 floating-point units, where all arithmetic is done internally using 80-bit floating-point types.

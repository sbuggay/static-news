Stepwise Logistic follows Ou and Penman (1989)’s structure with their 59 financial predictors. ANN is a three-layer artificial neural network model using the same set of variables as in Ou and Penman (1989). GPT (with CoT) provides the model with financial statement information and detailed chain-of-thought prompts. We report average accuracy (the percentage of correct predictions out of total predictions) for each method (left) and F1 score (right). We obtain bootstrapped standard errors by randomly sampling 1,000 observations 1,000 times and include 95% confidence intervals.</code></pre></div><br/><div id="40468991" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40468991" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">flourpower471</span><span>|</span><a href="#40468878">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40468920">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40468991">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40468991">[66 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not to mention, as somebody who works in quant trading doing ml all day on this kind of data.

Like engineering projects alot of this is pretty standard so the starting point is the last doc. Diffing allowed us to see what the executives added and thought  was important and also showed what they removed.  This worked well and for some things still does, this is what a warrant canary does, but stopped generating much alpha around 2010ish.<p>- simple sentiment.  We started to count positive and negative words to build a poor mans sentiment analysis that could be done very quickly upon doc release to trade upon.  worked great up until around 2013ish before it started to be gamed and even bankruptcy notices gave positive sentiment scores by this metric.<p>- sentiment models.  Using proper models and not just positive and negative word counts we built sentiment models to read what the executives were saying.  This worked well until about 2015&#x2F;2016ish in my world view as by then executives carefully wrote out their remarks and had been coached to use only positive words.  Worked until twitter killed the fire hose, and wasn&#x27;t very reliable as reputable news accounts kept getting hacked.  I remember i think AP new&#x27;s account got hacked and reported a bombing at the white house that screwed up a few funds.<p>You also had Anne Hathaway news pushing up Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s share price type issues in this time period.<p>- there was a period here where we kept the same technology but used it everywhere from the twitter firehose to news articles to build a realtime sentiment model for companies and sectors.  Not sure it generates much alpha due to garbage in, garbage out and data cleaning issues.<p>- LLMs, with about GPT2 we could build models to do the sentiment analysis for us, but they had to be built out of foundational models and trained inhouse due to context limitations.

We instruct the model to take on the role of a financial analyst whose task is to perform financial statement analysis. The model is then instructed to (i) identify notable changes in certain financial statement items, and (ii) compute key financial ratios without explicitly limiting the set of ratios that need to be computed.

Thank you.<p>I do not think that SOTA LLMs demonstrate grokking for most math problems. While I am a bit surprised to read how little training is necessary to achieve grokking in a toy setting (one specific math problem), the domain of <i>all</i> math problems is much larger. Also, the complexity of an applied mathematics problem is much higher than a simple mod problem. That seems to be what the author of the first article you quoted thinks as well.<p>Our public models fail in that large domain a lot. For example, with tasks like counting elements in a set (words in a paragraph). Not to mention that they fail in complex applied mathematics tasks. If they have been loss-minimized for that specific calculation to the point that they exhibit this phase change, then that would be an exception.<p>But in the financial statement analysis article, the author says explicitly that there isn&#x27;t a limitation on the types of math problems they ask the model to perform. This is very, very irregular, and there are no guarantees that model has generalized them. In fact, it is much more likely that it hasn&#x27;t, in my opinion.<p>In any case, thank you again for the article.

What then? You can post on Twitter, but unless you already have a following it&#x27;s shouting into the void. You can go to your local newspapers, they&#x27;ll probably ignore you; if they do pay attention, they&#x27;ll write an article which gets a few hundred hits. If the mayor acknowledges it at all, they&#x27;ll slam it as a political hit-piece, and that&#x27;s the end of it. So your best chance is... hope really hard it goes viral, I guess?<p>This isn&#x27;t meant to be overly negative, but exposing financial corruption is mostly about information control; I don&#x27;t see how LLMs help much here. Even if&#x2F;when you find slam-dunk evidence that corruption is occurring, it&#x27;s generally very hard to provide evidence in a way that Joe Average can understand, and assuming you are a normal everyday citizen, it&#x27;s extremely hard to get people to act.<p>As a prime example, this bit on the SF &quot;alcohol rehab&quot; program[0] went semi-viral earlier this week; there&#x27;s no way to interpret $5 million&#x2F;year spent on 55 clients as anything but &quot;incompetence&quot; at best and &quot;grift and corruption&quot; at worst. Yet there&#x27;s no public outrage or people protesting on the streets of SF; it&#x27;s already an afterthought in the minds of anyone who saw it.

At least one prominent Poe expert I know speculates it may have been destroyed to hide the evidence.<p>Isn&#x27;t it more likely that they were fans of Poe and took the book for themselves or they stole it for someone who was a fan of Poe.

Did a printing error in the third run end up getting reproduced in later runs? Did an editor change this word at some point after the original publication, which wound up migrating into later editions of the work? Was that in agreement with the author, or done on their own? Was there originally a chapter break here to accomodate an illustration? What was the typeface like? What kind of ink was used - is the green tint on the chapter headings intentional, or did it fade over time?<p>On a purely aesthetic media-nerd level it&#x27;s also interesting. Books aren&#x27;t just their plaintext. There is craftsmanship and artistry involved in how a work is intended to be presented, and without examples of the original prints this context can be lost.<p>On a similar note, old movies are notoriously eclectic about different cuts and editions with scenes missing or added or lost to time. Having and preserving original reels is invaluable (especially because they&#x27;re much more fragile in storage than books).<p>Imagine watching Buster Keaton while a guy is actually playing live music and breaking out slide whistles while the crowd cheers and smokes and waves their hats - it&#x27;s an experience that&#x27;s closer to going to a club and seeing a comedy act, than streaming movies on the couch. That particular experience is largely inaccessible to us today because we don&#x27;t have pristine fully staffed 1920s cinemas that we can walk into. But if you have an original printing of a book, you can in fact just &#x27;walk in&#x27; and see what it was supposed to be like. :)</div><br/><div id="40797405" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40797405" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jajko</span><span>|</span><a href="#40796198">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40796947">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40797390">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40797405">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40797405">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Its 2024, we can trivially preserve 100% of the original form of any book digitally, with all original intentions, bugs in creation etc. The actual physical book itself becomes just a curiosity (or investment), nothing fundamentally necessary.<p>With such discussions we often move from facts to emotions of specific individuals&#x2F;groups.

If you do the scan at 1000 dpi and get several people to check it was done properly then very probably you will never want to refer to the original again, because a scan is much easier to consult: just turning to a particular page is much faster, and you can zoom in without having to manipulate a physical magnifying glass. But I&#x27;ve worked with book scans done by ordinary people using ordinary equipment and I have on many occasions found that the scan wasn&#x27;t quite good enough and I&#x27;ve taken the trouble to check with a paper copy whether a certain short word was printed in italics or whether the exact shape of the serif can help me disambiguate a letter which was badly printed in the original (the plate wasn&#x27;t properly inked or whatever). I&#x27;ve never personally experienced a situation in which I&#x27;ve said to myself, &quot;I wish I had another copy of this same edition to compare against&quot;, but I can imagine that might happen sometimes. So I think it is worth keeping multiple copies of the same edition, if it&#x27;s an &quot;important&quot; book, or you have some reason for suspecting that it might be important: you don&#x27;t know for sure what people in the future will be interested in.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40797657" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40797657" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kombookcha</span><span>|</span><a href="#40796198">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40797405">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40797724">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40797390">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40797657">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40797657">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In 100 years when you can do even better scans, how will you make them without an original?

For most modern paperbacks, I&#x27;d agree with you - the book is often just a means of transmission of the text. Even with modern books though, there are plenty of examples where it&#x27;s intended to be a physical object that affects you in some way, not just as a sequence of words that happens to be on a page. You&#x27;ll see some books that chose weird sizes or paper finishes or even variations in font size through the book, because that&#x27;s as much a part of it as the text itself.<p>In the early days of books, especially before the printing press, they were primarily considered works of art. You&#x27;d have ornate flourishes at the start of a chapter because it took so long to copy manually, adding something visually appealing wouldn&#x27;t have made it take much longer to create in the grand scheme of things. There might be beautiful illustrations with vibrant colours competing for attention as much as the textual content.<p>Even with much newer books, you can tell the difference. One I remember from my childhood is A. A. Milne&#x27;s Winnie the Pooh with its illustrations by E. H. Sheppard. To most readers, the illustrations are as much a part of the book as the text, and yet there are cheap versions that contain the text only which are probably interesting if you&#x27;ve never seen the original but just feel incomplete and disappointing if you have.<p>With Victorian printing, you&#x27;d sometimes have outlines of illustrations printed in black and white and then someone would colour them in by hand with watercolour prior to sale. Every book would be slightly unique. I&#x27;ve only seen one such book when I was very young, something my mum had rescued from her grandfather&#x27;s collection as a child.<p>Whilst new books are also great (there&#x27;s nothing quite like opening a new hardbook, having a smell of it and settling down to read), old books are also wonderful, not just for the contents because also the look and feel of them that transports you back to another time. I&#x27;ve got a few (probably not valuable) old books that are over 100 years old, and in those days people would usually add a handwritten note on the first page saying who was buying it for who and what the occasion was, and often in beautiful old-fashioned handwriting that itself is art now. This is just a glimpse into the history of the book and the world as it was at the time this book was new, that just add richness to the book itself.<p>Reading a book isn&#x27;t just about the contents, as there&#x27;s so much more to sense when handling something physical, especially old books that aren&#x27;t perfect in some way and so have their own story that&#x27;s different to every other copy.</div><br/><div id="40797775" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40797775" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tialaramex</span><span>|</span><a href="#40796198">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40797390">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40795714">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40797775">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40797775">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In 1986 &quot;the book is more than just the text&quot; is a sound justification for why a significant proportion of library stock can&#x27;t &quot;just&quot; be digitised.<p>But we&#x27;re long past that, we can digitise the images, paper texture, layout choices, almost everything if we choose.

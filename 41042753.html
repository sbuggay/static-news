I can select a different sink, even networked, whenever I want the output to appear on a different networked device. MacOS sometimes needs a reboot so that the bluetooth subsystem works, what the hell.<p>And all this worked with PulseAudio, and now works with Pipewire, which is an even higher quality iteration of PA.<p>I don&#x27;t complain. I wish MacOS&#x2F;Windows had such a versatile, configurable, but sanely-working-out-of-the-box audio system as an off-the-shelf Fedora, or even freaking Arch linux has.<p>HTH<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.rtrace.io&#x2F;images&#x2F;linux-audio-stack-demystified&#x2F;pulseaudio-architecture.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.rtrace.io&#x2F;images&#x2F;linux-audio-stack-demystified&#x2F;...</a></div><br/><div id="41043980" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41043980" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kristopolous</span><span>|</span><a href="#41043474">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41043932">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41043980">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41043980">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For me it&#x27;s been nothing but problems. The primary reason is I&#x27;m probably doing things that (almost) nobody else is doing but I assume countless people are and it should be working fine. Once I hook up some midi devices, want things to be recorded, run a synthesizer stack through pw-jack, expect the midi clock to go down the USB bus, etc, all kinds of interesting behavior starts happening. It even completely locked up my machine a few times. Like hard freeze.<p>And then there&#x27;s the whole new suite of programs you have to learn. It&#x27;s still far from great.<p>I used an Amiga about 30 years ago to do similar things. Now that was something that genuinely just worked. People are still using it.

If you want to do something somewhat advanced and you have to care about Jack, Alsa, and then the Pulse or Pipewire layers, it&#x27;s quite overwhelming (why would you have to know the Linux audio history to work with it).<p>PulseAudio was quite buggy when it was considered ready for general public by Ubuntu.
I kept using some scripts to do what it could theoretically do for 2&#x2F;3 years, and then it didn&#x27;t have any quirks anymore.<p>Now that it is replaced by the pipewire stack, audio bugs are back. For instance, on a laptop if system audio is set to &#x27;output&#x27; instead of duplex, switching between speakers and headphones does not work, and volume change would sometimes get stuck. And sometimes it duplicates the streams on another system, which can be solved by killing the daemon.<p>Even with this less stable state, I agree that this is nothing compared to how bad the situation is in Mac or Windows world.
In the professional environments I&#x27;ve been in, basically all people have given up on the system properly switching their device parameters correctly. So calls often need a few minutes to reconfigure audio.

The article(s) I really love to see is, on one hand, more technically detail-specific and, on the other hand, broadly defining options I can have as an end user. I mean - from basic tools (CLI, GUI) that are available for simple purposes like volume control, stream selection, etc. to pro-audio, complex scenarios. For me it&#x27;s too many tools and options I can use in linux for audio and this is the reason for being lost sometime.

Then on top of that you had esd or artsd, with incompatible APIs and userland delays.
Then at some point they were replaced with pulseaudio.

You only need pipewire api if you need more control or pipe through video as well.<p>JACK is very flexible approach to audio (think of unix pipes but audio) and this is what pipewire is inspired by, but targets the general desktop use and not just audio production as JACK does.<p>Generally pipewire stays out of the way and works as pulseaudio replacement, but with the pipelines you can do a lot as a power user.<p>Personally I think pipewire is one of the best things that has happened to linux, and since it shims all the previous audio apis instead of trying to tape the existing solutions into the package, it actually removes bloat from your system and you don&#x27;t have to write weird libasound config files anymore.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41043179" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41043179" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shmerl</span><span>|</span><a href="#41043109">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41043614">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41043185">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41043179">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41043179">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Don&#x27;t worry, Pipewire is a very good development.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41043185" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41043185" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">g15jv2dp</span><span>|</span><a href="#41043109">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41043185">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41043185">[15 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I now have flashbacks to when I tried to get sound working on my Gentoo install 15 years ago.

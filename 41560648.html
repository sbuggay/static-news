Console games, outside small or open source engines, use proprietary graphics api. Those apis are tied to the hardware. With this coming generation from Nintendo, and the &quot;current gen&quot; from Sony and Xbox they&#x27;ve been able to mostly reuse much of their software investment.

Decima is an engine from Sony’s first-party studio, so it&#x27;s understandable that their development process would lean more towards PS&#x27;s internal architecture rather than the more common GPUs on the market. Of course, even general-purpose engines can perform better on PS5, AMD, or NV. But, for these engines, they have less information about how customers will use the engines, so there&#x27;s less infomation can be used to optimize. On the other side, customers using these engines often don’t have enough experience optimizing sufficiently for each platform. None of this is absolute, but I think this logic is reasonable.<p>For game developers using these engines, if they take optimization seriously, they typically make adjustments to lighting, LOD, loading, and model details or shaders on console platforms to achieve a similar visual effect while meeting the targeted performance goals. This is why you usually get better performance on a console at the same price point compared to a PC, aside from the subsidies provided by Sony.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41564385" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41564385" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tacticus</span><span>|</span><a href="#41561877">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41563025">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41563447">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41563467">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41564385">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41564385">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Horizon Forbidden West needing a much better GPU on PC to run at the same level of fidelity as the PS5.<p>not being expected to run with variable refresh rate\interleaving and accepting 30\60 fps in best case situations?</div><br/></div></div><div id="41563467" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41563467" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">deaddodo</span><span>|</span><a href="#41561877">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41563025">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41564385">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41562410">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41563467">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41563467">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; They <i>almost all</i> use off-the-shelf middleware and game engines that are built to support all of the platforms.

That&#x27;s why you could forcibly enable bilinear filtering on PS1 games.

Originally it was all hardware[1], but then they dropped the EE+GS combo chip and went to GPU emulation, then they dropped the PS2 CPU entirely and all backwards compatibility with it. Then they actually <i>wrote a PS2 emulator anyway</i>, which is part of the firmware, but only allowed to be used with PS2 Classics and not as BC. I guess they consider the purchase price of the games on the shop to also pay for the emulator?<p>- No BC was attempted on PS4 at all, AFAIK.

Whatever CPU they could get, graphics hardware that was custom built for that particular machine, and all sorts of weird coprocessors and quirks. For example, in the last generation, we had...<p>- The PlayStation 2, sporting a CPU with an almost[0] MIPS-compatible core with &quot;vertex units&quot;, one of which is exposed to software as a custom MIPS coprocessor, a completely custom GPU architecture, a separate I&#x2F;O processor that&#x27;s also a PS1, custom sound mixing hardware, etc.<p>- The GameCube, sporting a PPC 750 with custom cache management and vector instructions[1], which you might know as the PowerPC G3 that you had in your iMac. The GPU is &quot;ATI technology&quot;, but that&#x27;s because ATI bought out the other company Nintendo contracted to make it, ArtX. And it also has custom audio hardware that runs on another chip with it&#x27;s own memory.<p>- The Xbox, sporting... an Intel Celeron and an Nvidia GPU. Oh, wait, that&#x27;s &quot;just a PC&quot;.<p>Original Xbox is actually a good way to draw some red lines here, because while it is <i>in some respects</i> &quot;just a PC&quot;, it&#x27;s built a lot more like consoles are. All games run in Ring 0, and are very tightly coupled to the individual quirks of the system software. The &quot;Nvidia GPU&quot; is an NV2A, a custom design that Nvidia built specifically for the Xbox. Which itself has custom audio mixing and security hardware you would never find in a PC.<p>In contrast, while Xbox 360 and PS3 both were stuck with PPC[2], they also both had real operating system software that commercial games were expected to coexist with. On Xbox 360, there&#x27;s a hypervisor that enforces strict code signing; on PS3 games additionally run in <i>user mode</i>. The existence of these OSes meant that system software could be updated in nontrivial ways, and the system software could do some amount of multitasking, like playing music alongside a game without degrading performance or crashing it. Y&#x27;know, <i>like you can on a PC</i>.<p>Contrast this again to the Nintendo Wii, which stuck with the PPC 750 and ArtX GPU, adding on a security processor designed by BroadOn[3] to do <i>very rudimentary</i> DRM. About the only thing Nintendo could sanely update without bricking systems was the Wii Menu, which is why we were able to get the little clock at the bottom of the screen. They couldn&#x27;t, say, run disc games off the SD card or update the HOME Menu to have a music player or friends list or whatever, because the former runs in a security processor that exposes the SD card as a block device and the latter is a library Nintendo embedded into every game binary rather than a separate process with dedicated CPU time budgets.<p>And then the generation after <i>that</i>, Xbox One and PS4 both moved to AMD semicustom designs that had x86 CPUs and Radeon GPUs behind familiar APIs. They&#x27;re so PC like that the first thing demoed on a hacked PS4 was running Steam and Portal. The Wii U was still kind of &quot;console-like&quot;, but even that had an OS running on the actual application processor (albeit one of those weird designs with fixed process partitions like something written for a mainframe). And that got replaced with the Switch which has a proper microkernel operating system running on an Nvidia Tegra SoC that might have even wound up in an Android phone at some point!<p>Ok, that&#x27;s &quot;phone-like&quot;, not &quot;PC-like&quot;, but the differences in systems design philosophy between the two is far smaller than the huge gulf between either of those and oldschool console &#x2F; embedded systems.<p>[0] PS2 floating-point is NOWHERE NEAR IEEE standard, and games targeting PS2 tended to have lots of fun physics bugs on other hardware.

Yes, Nvidia can make ARM CPUs, but they haven&#x27;t been putting out amazing custom cores.<p>Ignorant question - do they have to? The last time I was up on gaming hardware it seemed as though most workloads were GPU-bound and that having a higher-end GPU was more important than having a blazing fast CPU. GPUs have also grown much more flexible rendering pipelines as game engines have gotten much more sophisticated and, presumably, parallelized. Would it not make sense for Nvidia to crank out a cost-optimized design comprising their last-gen GPU architecture with 12 ARM cores on an affordable node size?<p>The reason I ask is because I&#x27;ve been reading a lot about 90s console architectures recently. My understanding is that back then the CPU and specialized co-processors had to do a lot of heavy lifting on geometry calculations before telling the display hardware what to draw. In contrast I think most contemporary GPU designs take care of all of the vertex calculations themselves and therefore free the CPU up a lot in this regard. If you have an entity-based game engine and are able to split that object graph into well-defined clusters you can probably parallelize the simulation and scale horizontally decently well.

At the time all desktop computers for games were x86 based IBM clone things.<p>I don&#x27;t know why AMD ended up with the PS4 and the xbox as opposed to Intel getting either, but x86 was probably inevitable. I wonder if these days something architecturally similar to the mac arm systems would be a reasonable alternative.</div><br/><div id="41563550" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41563550" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MBCook</span><span>|</span><a href="#41562453">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41562643">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41563341">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41563550">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41563550">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You’re right they didn’t want to target weird things like the PS3 anymore, that was a huge pain.<p>But you have to remember the other side: there were no other options than x86.<p>ARM wasn’t powerful enough for one of the high-end consoles at the time. Trying to have such a chip designed would be a lot more expensive than just choosing a premade design and tweaking at a little. It worked for Nintendo but they had different goals. I’m not sure ARM could’ve been used it for the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.<p>The previous supplier, IBM PowerPC, had basically given up. Apple switched off them for the same reason. It wasn’t getting much faster and IBM only really seemed interested in server chips. I think it’s reasonable to assume they wouldn’t have tried very hard to win a chance to make a faster console chip.<p>If you don’t want to design your own, that’s all the major players. x86-64 is all that’s left.<p>Which is not to say that was a bad option. Developers are extremely familiar with it, there’s a metric ton of tools available, it makes game porting to and from PCs easier, it was the highest performance option, and there are two big suppliers that you can play against each other. So even if you went with Intel and something happened you could switch to AMD.<p>When IBM decided they didn’t care about the market, you just had to leave the PowerPC.<p>Why AMD over Intel? They were probably hungrier since they were in second place. They had a competitive GPU business, which Intel didn’t. Single supplier + they could do everything on one chip. And if AMD makes both parts they can help optimize the hell out of it.<p>Microsoft got screwed by nVidia on the XBox. I don’t think they’d want to do that again. Sony would absolutely know that happened and be wary.<p>Honestly it’s not clear to me that nVidia cared too much. But maybe I’m just reading it wrong. Nintendo went with them because they had and all in one system on a chip they were willing to dump for cheap that thanks to its mobile heritage developers were already familiar with.<p>Also since AMD was the little guy (compared to Intel) they could really use the sales and the revenue. It would be a bigger percentage of their total income than Intel, meaning it was more important to win that contract.<p>So in the end I think it makes a lot of sense that PlayStation and Xbox ended up in AMD land.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41563341" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41563341" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">philistine</span><span>|</span><a href="#41562453">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41562643">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41563550">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41563389">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41563341">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41563341">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; [..] something architecturally similar to the mac arm systems would be a reasonable alternative.<p>It&#x27;s called the Nintendo Switch, and its the second best selling console of all time.</div><br/><div id="41563569" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41563569" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MBCook</span><span>|</span><a href="#41562453">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41563341">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41563389">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41563569">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41563569">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It was also targeting a very different capability level from the PS4&#x2F;XBox One.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41563389" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41563389" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">someNameIG</span><span>|</span><a href="#41562453">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41562643">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41563341">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41562874">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41563389">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41563389">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">ARM would be a reasonable alternative.

I was away from home, away from all my friends. I was coming to realize, with a kind of horror, that the door behind me, my childhood, had truly shut. I wasn&#x27;t sure at all that I would like this new adult world.<p>Gathered in the &quot;commons&quot; room of the dorm, watching that &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode, I just sat in the back of the dark room and cried. But his final message, that there are merry-go-rounds in the adult world if you know to look for them stuck with me.<p>Also blown away when I saw the episode, &quot;The Lonely&quot;. If you know the episode, you know how it ends.<p>&quot;All you&#x27;re leaving behind Corry, is loneliness.&quot;<p>&quot;I must remember to keep that in mind.&quot;</div><br/><div id="42546934" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42546934" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Joel_Mckay</span><span>|</span><a href="#42546681">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42547398">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42546934">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42546934">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Rod had a notoriously brutal TV writing schedule, but was able to spin a few good yarns.<p>It seems odd, but old stories like &quot;What You Need&quot; (s1e12), collaborated works &quot;To Serve Man&quot; (s3e25) and &quot;People Are Alike All Over&quot; (s1e25)  still seem to describe entering the senior realms of business.<p>&quot;The Lonely&quot; certainly broke down the notion of compassion within the context of civilization.

They are things that I had to notice while my mind was able to be quiet and curious.<p>A hint of what I mean:<p>Conspiracy theories come from seeking satisfaction and comfort, not ignorance. Debunking will never be enough. If a person tells themselves that they will not be affected by a conspiracy theory or scam, they have made themselves MORE vulnerable. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42454945">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42454945</a><p>---<p>Unsatisfying narratives feel nihilistic, but there might be something important on the other side of that nihilism <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42261315">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42261315</a><p>---<p>&#x27;Blame&#x27; is a place in our minds where we set down our heaviest burdens. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42248548">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42248548</a><p>---<p>Anyway, what I mean to say is that fiction can take us places that shouting at each other never will.</div><br/><div id="42546740" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42546740" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hamstergene</span><span>|</span><a href="#42546169">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42546624">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42546740">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42546740">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A lot more than conspiracy theories is explained by that. Why people join religions and cults despite obvious huge gaps in their worldview. Why people follow political leaders while being aware of their reputation of lying and&#x2F;or lacking reputation of being successful at what they claim to do.<p>Ever since I discovered the concept of emotional neglect I am growing in belief that problem is a lot more pervasive in society than a few therapy patients. Just because most people have no complaints doesn&#x27;t mean they were not affected.<p>Our culture has made rational behavior such a huge virtue that seeking good emotions became something that needs to be pointed out as a revelation, even though seeking to feel good is literally the biggest and maybe the only motivation people have. The default assumption when understanding other people is to expect them to prefer what makes sense over what feels good, which is not true.<p>Metaphorically, if one has a culture that teaches people to believe that body temperature is fundamentally unimportant and mostly random noise, would it really be a surprise that people ignore your attempt to convince them in diagnosis A over B when the only difference between those two were the presence of fever? That will be like convincing to choose A because it&#x27;s summer, people will just shrug it off.<p>In your example, when you shout about &quot;seeking satisfaction and comfort&quot; the receiver instantly skips that because &quot;no way that is important enough to be the true reason&quot;. Maybe it&#x27;s not as hopeless, one just needs to focus less on shouting messages and more on ensuring the receiver has enough fundamentals to get them.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

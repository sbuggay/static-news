It’s a lot easier to determine whether a 3D model depicts Super Mario than whether it’s in the “modern Nintendo” style.<p>Style is also very broad. It’s even harder to determine whether an 8-bit NES sprite is in the “old Nintendo” style, because 8-bit sprites don’t have much flexibility to distinguish themselves.<p><i>Broadness:</i> imagine if whoever first came up with the “low-poly 3D” or “flat material” or “voxel” aesthetics could copyright them and prevent anyone else from selling anything in those styles. What defines a style as narrow enough that it can be copyrighted? And what if that definition changes, e.g. if a a specific voxel style gets copyrighted, then someone else discovers a brand new way to render voxels super efficiently in only that style?<p><i>Objectivity and similarity:</i> an artist can make a concrete object or character which is very similar to a copyrighted one but also clearly distinct. This is very important, because if “similar” objects could violate copyright, where is the line when something is dissimilar enough? Ultimately it would be very far for small artists, who can’t afford to risk lawsuits; vast swaths of clearly <i>not</i> similar characters and objects would be blocked off from them, because in the eyes of the law and without good representation, they’re no longer “clearly” not similar. In fact, it may be hard for an artist to even come up with an object or character that doesn’t risk a copyright lawsuit, since there are more copyrights that anyone could fully know. (At least to my knowledge, with copyrightable characters and objects this hasn’t been a frequent issue; but if it is, copyrightable style will make it worse, so for the sake of the argument...)<p>Copyrighting style is basically copyrighting the “similar” works. There’s a fine enough line between whether a character or object is “similar to” or “the same as” another (again to the best of my knowledge). But there’s no fine line with style. If one tries to define a style with objective criteria like making their “style” a specific stroke thickness and color scheme, generative AI users will just create art which falls right outside of this criteria. If one tries to use an AI classifier (ironically) to deduce whether something is “the same” or “similar but distinct”, it will be foiled by AI-adversarial manipulation and its effectiveness will be endlessly disputed in court. And if one defines their style with very subjective judgements, that leads to the issue above.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40408703" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40408703" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">numpad0</span><span>|</span><a href="#40410321">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40408567">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40408703">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40408703">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">imho the whole GenAI and artists and luddites thing is way overblown and mis-characterized.

Is not some subset of that aesthetic quality derivative of the intuition and intention of a human mind? Sure, if you want to build some tehchnology to make designing packaging for dog food more effecient go ahead, as long as it isn&#x27;t the previous dog food packaging creators that are being made to absorb the economic cost of the new technology (which they are).<p>But I hope at last some subset of human art strives to do more than that, and I think it&#x27;s a bad thing that the incentive to increase revenue at the expense of quality has now expanded past being a tool to improve efficiency of laborious tasks and is now instead cutting costs via cutting artistic value.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

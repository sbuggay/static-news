By leveraging a small processing fee per claim (225), and a small annual maintenance fee (165), the system effectively doesn&#x27;t discriminate against small businesses and even individuals who want to seek their fortune mining the land.<p>The above fees only address the provisional stake holding, and environmental permits must be acquired before any mining commences. While the requirements to obtain EPA permission could be seen as nullifying any advantages to small business from the low prospecting fees, it&#x27;s also likely that once a prospector finds minerals they could also obtain partners or funding which would help share the cost of any additional permits required.<p>While it&#x27;s true that the state does not benefit financially from mineral extraction in the form of royalties, in many cases states are able to collect taxes from the operations of businesses involved in the mining, processing and sale of minerals, as other commenters point out.<p>It&#x27;s conceivable that an additional layer of tariffs in the form of royalties may make mining operations more difficult for small businesses and individuals, undermining (pun intended) the intended benefits of the low barriers to entry for prospecting.<p>It is also possible to make a connection with how large incumbent companies often lobby for more regulations. While a seeming paradox, this behavior actually helps protect their business by introducing additional barriers to entry that help keep out startups and smaller newcomers. These added costs, while affordable for the largest of companies, are often prohibitively expensive and burdensome for would-be competitors.<p>This shows a paradox: regulations meant to ensure fair business and collective good can sometimes just cement monopolies.</div><br/><div id="37972349" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37972349" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ethbr1</span><span>|</span><a href="#37972252">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37973305">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37972349">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37972349">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Agreed!

Expenses are either paid directly to individuals as income, or to other companies, where the money still ends up as either expenses or profits. There’s also the fact that everything a corporation sells is generally considered valuable enough by someone else to be a good deal at that price, so all the revenue they generate also represents value being provided to their counterparty.<p>In economics there is a thing called deadweight loss, which is the value lost when some kind of policy (like an inefficient tax) distorts the quantity supplied:quantity demanded relationship. When you tax only income and profits, you generally avoid deadweight loss because you shift the taxation to be “after” the supply:demand has already been determined; by allowing for expenses paid to other companies to be deducted, value isn’t taxed twice because ultimately that money always ends up as someone else’s income or profits. If you’re purely interested in more taxes to capture value for the government more efficiently (and not as a vice or pigouvian tax) instituting more taxes introduces double taxation that shifts the tax before the transaction and introduced deadweight loss which lowers overall output and value generated.<p>If you do mean to suggest the tax should be Pigouvian, that kind of already exists. Corporations have to pay a lot of the costs for compliance and remediation. I’m pretty sure to avoid all the issues of the past, companies have to put a bunch of money&#x2F;assets in escrow so if they fuck up the government doesn’t get stuck with the bill. It is true though that all taxpayers pay for eg the EPA and the fees paid by corporations generally don’t cover the full environment cost; generally this means the externalities of production aren’t being accurately priced and it would be better to shift those externalities into the companies.<p>But those kinds of pigouvian taxes have a major flaw in that we live in a global market economy, so without full international cooperation they just make your local industry uncompetitive and shift production to places with less regulations. Also, even though natural resource extraction generates some profits for private individuals, we generally all benefit from it. So it’s not too bad to tax some of the environmental compliance costs in a non-pigouvian manner.</div><br/><div id="37973285" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37973285" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mrmanner</span><span>|</span><a href="#37972518">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972694">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972564">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37973285">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37973285">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Can royalties put on mineral extraction on public land be considered taxes in this regard, though?

It would make sense if the low staking fee were being abused by bad actors using it to “squat” on things they don’t use - and I bet that does occur to an extent. But it seems like anybody else interested in the land economically could have also just filed a claim?<p>It actually seems like a good thing to keep the land in the commons and license it out. I think all land that’s not actively being used should belong to the commons instead of private individuals. To do otherwise allows land speculators and those engaging in rentiership to steal economic output from those who are actually producing value - if anybody’s going to do that, better for it to be the entity paying for roads and schools. The corporation will still pay income taxes on its labor, capital costs which are just income of some other entity, and corporate taxes - overtaxing the commons to try to shift more of the value-capture there is actually an inefficient form of double taxation that hurts international competitiveness.<p>One thing that really bothers me about this article is the tone about “ravaging” or exploiting the land as if all mining is this terribly evil thing. I for one like having inexpensive metals and energy. Until very very recently in human history in a small set of developed countries, all mining was done by slaves or the most desperate people in a society - it still is in the vast majority of developing economies engaging in mining, and it was even in the US until about a hundred years ago. I like having a 21st century standard of living and good but not perfect environmental regulations more than I like slavery or living as if I’m in the Stone Age.</div><br/><div id="37972693" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37972693" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jandrewrogers</span><span>|</span><a href="#37972601">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972283">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37972693">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37972693">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">re: squatting, that used to happen in the form of using a mining claim on government land and some theater to acquire land for non-mining purposes.

While the intentions are companies are hard to gauge, and likely diverse across the set of all for-profit corporations, it&#x27;s important to remember that without them we&#x27;d conceivably be living in a much less developed society with a much lower standard of living.<p>Admittedly, our environment would be largely unspoiled if this were the case.<p>This raises an interesting point about what people really want. Given the choice, would most people opt to live in an economically backward but pristine wilderness, or not?<p>Such an environment might lack modern conveniences like electricity, sophisticated city services, piped water and sewerage, but may possess an abundance of natural riches, like fresh air, clean water, and a beautiful landscape that was unscarred and intact.<p>I think many people would choose that life. I know I would, at least for a while. But many are also probably unfamiliar with the hardships of doing so, which may prove a decisive challenge for people and lead to them returning to more &#x27;advanced&#x27; way of life.<p>It could also be argued that the seeming dichotomy presented above represents an oversimplification of the reality, and that in general the choice would not be between such extremes.<p>An optimistic take might also consider that ideally we don&#x27;t need to choose, we can bring sustainable technologies with us to the wilderness, or we can make our existence in advanced cities environmentally friendly.<p>It&#x27;s important to remember that people often choose to migrate from less developed regions to more developed ones, primarily for the economic opportunities they believe are available to them and their loved ones there. It might be hard to argue that this is a bad thing, particularly as our concepts of ethics and morality are often based in notions of access to opportunity, sanitary conditions, and shelter.<p>The interaction between humanity and the environment comprises complex dynamics involving seemingly competing considerations. It&#x27;s crucial to consider the ethical intersection of good of the environment, and the good of the people.<p>Economics and the environment interact in complex ways: we depend on the health of the environment for our economic growth, but often end up harming it in the process, endangering ecosystems and ourselves.

Pursuant to FLPMA, the BLM issued regulations in 1981, which were amended in 2001 and require notices and plans of operation to include detailed reclamation plans. These regulations also require operators to provide financial guarantees covering the full cost to reclaim mining operations. Additionally, the BLM’s regulations allow the agency to require an operator to establish a trust fund or other funding mechanism to ensure the continuation of long-term treatment to achieve water quality standards and for other long-term, post mining reclamation and maintenance requirements after a mine is closed. These regulations provide the BLM with a mechanism to provide for protection of the environment after mining has concluded. In response to Government Accountability Office recommendations, BLM implemented a tracking system under which BLM certifies each fiscal year that the reclamation cost estimates for proposed and operating mines have been reviewed and are sufficient to cover the cost of reclamation. Currently, the BLM holds financial guarantees of $3.3 billion which is held to fund the costs of reclamation of mining operations on BLM-managed public lands.

While reform is needed it&#x27;s not accurate for this article to use pre-regulation abandoned mines as a benchmark for mines established post the 1981 regulations or the stricter 2001 standards set by the Bureau of Land Management.</div><br/><div id="37972286" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37972286" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blackoil</span><span>|</span><a href="#37972169">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972220">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972405">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37972286">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37972286">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Riches of America can be traced back to some Europeans getting lot of land by killing all the natives and then getting slaves as cheap labour.</div><br/><div id="37972531" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37972531" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zmgsabst</span><span>|</span><a href="#37972169">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972286">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972299">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37972531">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37972531">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Mining in the US West wasn’t done by slave labor.<p>And conquest coupled with slaving their rivals is what powered most indigenous tribes, too!

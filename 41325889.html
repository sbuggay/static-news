This approach combines the best of both worlds: the convenience of distributing executable files and the benefits of open source. So far, I have developed two web apps:<p>1. A live transcription and translation app that uses microphone input. This is useful for watching proprietary content and facilitating communication.<p>2. An app that translates SRT subtitles into various languages.<p>I opt for the &quot;bring your own keys&quot; model for two main reasons:<p>1. Low maintenance: As a professional software developer, I already maintain a lot of software, and the last thing I want is to maintain my side projects. My goal is to write and distribute these apps so they continue working without requiring constant attention from me.<p>2. Low cost: This model allows me to distribute the apps without ads. By having users provide their own keys, I can keep operational costs down and avoid the need for monetization through advertising.<p>This approach enables me to create and share useful tools while keeping both my maintenance burden and user costs to a minimum.</div><br/><div id="41326606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41326606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jillesvangurp</span><span>|</span><a href="#41326542">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41327213">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41326606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41326606">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Interesting; I&#x27;ve build a similar application for assisting with the translation of localization files (mozilla&#x27;s project fluent) and for the same reason as well.<p>I build this stuff for fun; and because I needed something like it.

Its still early, but seems like OpenAI hasn’t succeeded any more to be broad consumer product past the core Chat experience. Building an AI OAuth platform would be an interesting way to be sticky and avoid being a commodity. But it’d give developers more leverage vs their custom-GPT product, and it’d shift charging per-use for an API to “unlimited” per month for a single subscription fee.<p>Generally, a product shouldn’t tie themselves to an API provider (eg OpenAI) when it could’ve been an implementation detail. If you hide the actual API from users, you can swap it for cheaper or better ones as the market evolves. If you give up the account access to a providers OAuth, and you give up control over that implementation, you risk being really stuck to a market loser and no direct relationship with users.<p>Getting paid for it though…. That would be an interesting twist. But I’m not sure it’d make sense as anything but a bulk discount. The problem is that it doesn’t make sense to pay a developer to use your paid product, unless you get a relationship with the end users like Google Search defaults in browsers. But again, it doesn’t make sense to give OpenAI that relationship if you don’t have to.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41327149" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41327149" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vineyardmike</span><span>|</span><a href="#41326542">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41326790">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41326936">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41326989">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41327149">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41327149">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; So it&#x27;s also &quot;bring your own keys&quot; but then how do you monetize at all?<p>Why do you need to monetize?

ChatGPT says:<p>Here’s how it typically works:<p>SSL&#x2F;TLS Interception: Businesses deploy security appliances that intercept and decrypt HTTPS traffic. To do this, they install a corporate root certificate on all employee devices. This allows the appliance to decrypt the encrypted traffic, inspect it for threats, and then re-encrypt it before sending it to its intended destination. Employees are typically unaware of this process unless they encounter specific warnings or the organization&#x27;s policy clearly states it.<p>Productized Solutions: Several cybersecurity vendors offer these SSL inspection solutions as part of their enterprise security suites. These products are marketed to help organizations protect against malware, data leaks, and other security threats by allowing them to monitor all traffic, including encrypted traffic.<p>Employee Communications Monitoring: This setup effectively allows businesses to monitor all online communications of their employees while they are on the corporate network. This includes emails, web browsing, and any other online activities. The rationale is usually to ensure that sensitive company data is not being exposed or compromised and to protect against potential cyber threats.<p>Privacy Concerns: While this practice is legal and often justified under corporate security policies, it does raise significant privacy concerns. Employees might not be fully aware of the extent to which their communications are being monitored, and there can be ethical considerations regarding the balance between security and privacy.<p>In short, MITM operations in corporate environments are a deliberate and controlled security measure. These services are widely productized and deployed by businesses to maintain security over their networks, but they do so by intercepting and inspecting employee communications. This is a well-known and common practice in many organizations today.</div><br/><div id="41326833" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41326833" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">simonw</span><span>|</span><a href="#41326551">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41326771">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41326579">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41326833">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41326833">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Don’t try to support your arguments by pasting paragraphs of text from ChatGPT.<p>That said, there is a little nugget of useful information in there: “To do this, they install a corporate root certificate on all employee devices.”<p>This is true: if you are using a device which has had a root certificate installed on it you are vulnerable to MITM attacks.

TLS and Its Vulnerabilities:
TLS&#x2F;SSL stripping: This is a technique used by attackers to downgrade an HTTPS connection to HTTP, thereby removing the encryption. If an attacker can perform a successful TLS stripping attack, simply &quot;using HTTPS&quot; won&#x27;t protect your data, as the connection would no longer be encrypted.<p>Fake Certificates: An attacker might present a fake certificate that your browser mistakenly trusts (e.g., through a compromised Certificate Authority or if you ignore a browser warning), allowing the attacker to intercept and decrypt what you think is an HTTPS connection.<p>2. Why &quot;Always Use HTTPS&quot; Alone Isn&#x27;t Enough:
In a Compromised Environment: If the attacker has managed to manipulate your connection, &quot;using HTTPS&quot; might give a false sense of security. If the attack involves SSL stripping or the use of a rogue certificate, your data could still be intercepted and read in plain text.<p>3. Better Protections Against MITM in Public WiFi:
Use a VPN: A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and the VPN server. Even if the attacker intercepts the traffic on the local network, it remains encrypted and unreadable due to the VPN.
Verify Certificates: Be vigilant about certificate warnings. If your browser warns you about an untrusted certificate, don’t ignore it, especially on public WiFi. This could be a sign of a MITM attack.<p>HTTPS Everywhere: Browser extensions like HTTPS Everywhere force the use of HTTPS on sites that support it, but it’s not foolproof if the attacker is actively stripping SSL.<p>Check for HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security): Sites that use HSTS protect against some forms of SSL stripping because they enforce the use of HTTPS even on initial connections.<p>Disable Trust for Public Networks: Be cautious on public WiFi. Turn off automatic connection features, and avoid performing sensitive transactions unless you have additional protections like a VPN.<p>4. Advanced Security Measures:
DNSSEC: Ensures that the DNS responses you receive are authentic and haven’t been tampered with. This can help prevent DNS spoofing.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Protects your accounts even if your credentials are intercepted.<p>To sum it up, while &quot;Always Use HTTPS&quot; is generally good advice, it doesn&#x27;t cover situations where TLS is compromised or bypassed. In scenarios involving potential MITM attacks, stronger measures like using a VPN, being cautious with certificates, and employing additional security practices are crucial.</div><br/><div id="41327201" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41327201" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jaggs</span><span>|</span><a href="#41326551">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41327132">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41326579">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41327201">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41327201">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Don’t try to support your arguments by pasting paragraphs of text from ChatGPT.&quot;<p>Agreed.

To do this, they install a corporate root certificate on all employee devices. This allows the appliance to decrypt the encrypted traffic, inspect it for threats, and then re-encrypt it before sending it to its intended destination. Employees are typically unaware of this process unless they encounter specific warnings or the organization&#x27;s policy clearly states it.<p>Productized Solutions: Several cybersecurity vendors offer these SSL inspection solutions as part of their enterprise security suites. These products are marketed to help organizations protect against malware, data leaks, and other security threats by allowing them to monitor all traffic, including encrypted traffic.<p>Employee Communications Monitoring: This setup effectively allows businesses to monitor all online communications of their employees while they are on the corporate network. This includes emails, web browsing, and any other online activities. The rationale is usually to ensure that sensitive company data is not being exposed or compromised and to protect against potential cyber threats.<p>Privacy Concerns: While this practice is legal and often justified under corporate security policies, it does raise significant privacy concerns. Employees might not be fully aware of the extent to which their communications are being monitored, and there can be ethical considerations regarding the balance between security and privacy.<p>In short, MITM operations in corporate environments are a deliberate and controlled security measure. These services are widely productized and deployed by businesses to maintain security over their networks, but they do so by intercepting and inspecting employee communications. This is a well-known and common practice in many organizations today.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41327125" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41327125" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fragmede</span><span>|</span><a href="#41326551">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41326579">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41327125">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41327125">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">it doesn&#x27;t. you&#x27;re misunderstanding the pieces in play here<p>there&#x27;s:<p>you<p>claude<p>other company<p>this CORS change lets other company use your key to access claude, so you pay to use Claude instead of having to create an account with other company so they can pay Claude.<p>that change doesn&#x27;t let coffee shop or other MitM see your Claude key</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

Even with the various filters available these days, how do you work around the need to actually <i>have</i> a professional grade kit?<p>At a minimum I would expect you&#x27;d still need a professional lighting setup, a sturdy tripod, the right studio background, a good DSLR (or mirrorless), properly diffused, reflected and toned flash, and the skills to really work with RAW images to get the best possible output. And that&#x27;s even before we include the skills and knowledge to guide their subject to just the right poses to get the subtle body language right. (Yes, the relative position of your spine and the stress you put on your upper body does affect how comfortable and confident you appear in the final shot. I know that now.)<p>More than 20 years ago, my boss at the time recommended that I get a professional headshot. We were producing printed[ß] booklets as part of our marketing strategy, and I wrote occasional columns in them. He wanted to have the author&#x27;s face attached to the pieces. He recommended that I pay for the service myself so that the photos would remain with me. If the company had paid for them, getting them into any other (read: off-work, post resignation) use would have been awkward, confusing and possibly a red flag for the accountant. One of the best investments I&#x27;ve ever made. I paid for three slightly varied versions, and used them actively for about a decade.<p>As it happens, it might well be the time to get a fresh set.<p>ß: an anachronism, no doubt</div><br/><div id="42896680" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42896680" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ascorbic</span><span>|</span><a href="#42895565">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42896483">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42896829">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42896680">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42896680">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There are a number of services that let you upload a few random photos of yourself and will then generate headshots based on them.

And what human activity do these AI tools replace? 
A calculator is only useful if you are able to put in the right formula, which means you still need to understand the problem and its solution. On the other hand, you lose the ability to verify that the solution is actually correct, beyond double checking that all your inputs are okay. And if your solution cannot be found through the operations supported by the calculator then you&#x27;re just stuck and need to think of another way.<p>Modern AI is much more advanced because users only need to ask questions. But that means people who rely too much on it will lose the ability to understand the solution. Or, even worse, they will never acquire that ability in the first place if they offload all intellectual tasks from primary school onwards to an AI. If people leave the thinking to an AI, they will lose the ability to think on their own.<p>Of course responsible users can and will use AI to significantly boost their learning and capabilities, but the question is what will happen to society at large over long periods of time. If the dominant attitude is that only results and outcomes matter, then I think that we are heading towards an intellectual wasteland.<p>And that is kind of the point. Tools both augment and limit human capabilities, so that we gradually forget what was before the tool existed. But a tool like AI could limit people&#x27;s ability so much that we become collectively blind to its limitations. And that is exactly the local maximum of cultural development that started this thread of discussion.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42896640" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42896640" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">abenga</span><span>|</span><a href="#42895565">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42895768">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42896506">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42896714">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42896640">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42896640">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is using AI the equivalent of using a calculator to look up trigonometric function values, or outsourcing understanding what the functions are?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42896714" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42896714" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">idle_zealot</span><span>|</span><a href="#42895565">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42895675">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42895348">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42896714">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42896714">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Most great musicians, bartenders, software engineers, etc. do the same.

I&#x27;m willing to bet a $40 designer would drop the ball in a different, equally bad way (probably make it too corporate, or miss the precise &quot;cute but low-effort&quot; spot the original designer hit).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42896613" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42896613" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">asimpletune</span><span>|</span><a href="#42895888">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42895227">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42896613">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42896613">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">All I want to know is did he pay $200 for that little vector illustration of the monkey?</div><br/></div></div><div id="42895227" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42895227" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aprilthird2021</span><span>|</span><a href="#42896613">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42895509">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42895227">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42895227">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s worth noting that spending $200 on a graphic design from someone online was already a huge reduction in cost and time from what it would take before platforms like Upwork</div><br/></div></div><div id="42895509" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42895509" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mohsen1</span><span>|</span><a href="#42895227">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42895507">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42895509">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42895509">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">AI probably can do very nice landscaping design too.

For example, it&#x27;s really good with producing music... Which would have cost several thousands of dollars before. E.g: suno.com<p>I&#x27;ve been recording short tunes on my low-quality $50 Ukulele (which I self-taught myself) and then getting Suno to turn it into full songs. The quality is better than anything I could possibly have produced. Even if I paid thousands of dollars to a professional, I could not get better quality than what I&#x27;m getting from Suno. I cannot tell that it&#x27;s produced by AI. AI is surprisingly suitable for music.<p>If I want lyrics, I type out the topic and underlying message of the song and the aesthetics I want (e.g. short lines, rhymes, etc...) inside Claude or ChatGPT and make it generate the lyrics.<p>Also once you have the first draft of lyrics, you can make it refine them by telling it to rhyme in particular ways. For example, the first words of each sentence can rhyme with each other as well as the last word of each sentence and you can tell it to change the rhyme pattern each paragraph. It&#x27;s amazing how it can keep the meaning of the lyrics the same but totally transform the sounds of it by swapping out words with synonyms.<p>AI video capability is impressive but it can&#x27;t get it all the way to a production-quality film. For music though, it definitely seems to be production-quality. Sometimes it takes a few attempts but it definitely seems to cross the &#x27;professional&#x27; line regularly. Often, you don&#x27;t need any tuning, trimming or intervention to the piece; it&#x27;s just done.</div><br/><div id="42895568" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42895568" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">glimshe</span><span>|</span><a href="#42895507">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42896477">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42895568">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42895568">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Many people see AI as a replacement for the human, but current-gen AI is in my view a replacement for the hammer.

Maybe it will lack a bit of creativity but typically only a professional would be able to know that.<p>I think what Suno produces is often higher quality and more creative than what most modern pop stars produce... Just because the bar there happens to be quite low.<p>If I listen to 80s music, I can see the creativity gap (at least relative to the AI&#x27;s typical ouput)...

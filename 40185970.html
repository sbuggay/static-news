I have spent a total of 3 years in American corporate colonies in my country, and probably 3 times as much operating at various roles in local startups, many of which had major American funding.<p>I observe that even for the most capable Americans, operating a startup is at best a phase. Across the general public, it is not considered prestigious vocation. Of course, academic stars can do so, but very often that&#x27;s as a side gig (unlike Big Tech, which is a valid extension of one&#x27;s academic career). And for people who could both work in tech and e.g. finance, working in tech is the odd choice.<p>Since founding is premised on operating and having operating experience, a direct corollary is that extraordinary circumstances are needed for an American to be a participating founder (as opposed to e.g., throwing in the funding).<p>P.S.: US founders are abundant. I attribute that to the size of the US; it&#x27;s just that in my society, being a founder is a universally aspired role, whereas this appears not to be the case in the US.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40187106" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40187106" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jillesvangurp</span><span>|</span><a href="#40187027">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40186747">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40187106">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40187106">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is an interesting phenomenon that has happened before. You can look back at most ancient empires and find that at their peak they had vibrant cities, populated with the best and brightest from all over the world. Egypt, Athens, Rome, etc. People confuse cause and effect here. These places become so great because of the people that move there.<p>That makes the current debates in the US and the EU about limiting migration so silly and backwards. I come from the Netherlands; a country that used to punch way above its weight economically, militarily, and scientifically in the seventeenth century when New York was still called New Amsterdam. That happened on the tail-end of the rest of Europe pushing out intellectuals, religious minorities, etc. a lot of whom ended up in Amsterdam. You might think of Amsterdam as the seventeenth century Silicon Valley. Modern day dutch politics are dominated by populists with an anti migrant sentiment. They are longing for the good old days when the Netherlands was so great without realizing that migrants were a big part of that greatness.<p>Later London took over. And eventually the US ended up absorbing a lot of immigrants and became a world power. Twentieth century New York became the amazing place it is today. These events are not disconnected. You need a critical mass of migrants for stuff like this to happen.<p>I currently live in Berlin, which has a lot of people moving to it from all over the place. It&#x27;s too early to tell for sure but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see some beautiful things happen here over the course of the next decades. If it does, it will be despite of the locals. Silicon Valley increasingly feels like it has a lot of greatness in its past but not necessarily in its future. There sure is a lot of money there. And some good universities. But moving there is not the logical move it would have been twenty years ago.

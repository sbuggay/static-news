Security issues are inevitable, cloud&#x2F;sync&#x2F;store systems require servers, upstream APIs, libraries &amp; operating systems are constantly shifting and breaking things.<p>So OSS aside (which has its own complicated economics) someone needs an ongoing revenue stream for that work to happen. Whether it&#x27;s through regular release of paid upgrades (and EOL of old ones) or a subscription model is these days less of a fundamental separation and more of a question of cadence. Take a look at the much-vaunted Campfire from once.com - there&#x27;s been zero new features since initial release and I&#x27;ll bet the cost of a copy come Feb next year when it&#x27;s a year old there&#x27;ll be a 2.0 for another $300. How long after that will 1.0 be EOL&#x27;d? So are you really &#x27;buying once&#x27; for $300 or paying $300 a year just with the auto-renew turned off?</div><br/><div id="41615666" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41615666" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ksec</span><span>|</span><a href="#41615300">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41615408">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41615666">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41615666">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes.

If you pay 100-1200x more for your cloud services than you need, maybe not. And I guess that is a theme, if you have subscriptions you don&#x27;t really need to care about expenses because you have a steady income. Absurd? Yes, but that is how our industry behaves. I&#x27;m appalled at what people are paying for the cloud that literally could be served from a raspberry pi. Yes, you need redundancy etc. and that takes time and thought. But have you ever factored in the time and expertise required to manage the cloud? It is incomprehensible.<p>So, how many subscriptions do you need to be able to maintain your software? Is 10 enough? No? Conclusion, subscriptions are not sustainable?<p>Similarly, how many purchases do you need to recoup the initial development? You will hardly break even after the first 10 sales. But once you do break even every single purchase goes 100% to maintenance and new features. That is a very good position to be in.<p>Of course it matters what kind of product you have and how big of an audience you can get. If it is very niche product and you only expect 100 sales then maybe a one off payment isn&#x27;t particularly appealing. But then again, maybe the value lies in support instead. Or, of course, a subscription.<p>Paying for upgrades is also fine! But without shafting your current users. Compute is dirt cheap. If you sell someone a piece of software for $300 you can afford 20 cents per year for cloud costs to maintain your relationships.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41615410" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41615410" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ajb</span><span>|</span><a href="#41615300">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41615408">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41615376">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41615410">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41615410">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One of the problems of no-one being liable for security, is that no-one has the incentive to thoroughly separate software you really need to trust, and that you care whether it&#x27;s vulnerable to hacking, from that which you don&#x27;t. &quot;everything needs a revenue for security reasons&quot; would make sense if companies were giving an effective security guarantee and investing in fulfilling it, which they aren&#x27;t.

The money comes in anyway. Besides that, you often see regular price increases in such markets because the user lost all power. If you end your subscription, there is no good alternative.

They said:<p>&gt; Thing is, I don’t believe in owning software forever anymore. Things loose their value too quickly: what would an Office suite from 2005 yield me now, other than the need to run an ancient VM to produce files nobody else could work with? Am I ever going to play the copy of Dungeon Siege again that I bought in ca. 2002? No. It looks unbearable today.<p>The point as I understood it was: why would I pay a high fixed fee to own a software “forever” if I am not really going to use it forever? At some point, a subscription will be cheaper overall. Because people buying an office suite in 2005 for a fixed fee aren’t using it anymore, they can also use LibreOffice now. So if they had a choice between “one time $500” or “$5 per month”, the monthly option would have been better.

I wouldn&#x27;t be on the market for one because my current car continues to deliver value.<p>The &quot;roads changing&quot; can happen to software too, it&#x27;s true. If the x86 platform became obsolete then clearly a bunch of software that is too intrinsically tried to that platform would be less valuable (because you can&#x27;t run it).

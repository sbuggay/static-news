Been using your free product for a little while.  As a fellow traffic hacker, some random comments:<p><pre><code>  - I&#x27;ve been in the points game for a long time so I may not be your target customer.  Take feedback with a grain of salt, I guess.

  - Commissions &amp; Trust: You should disclose (more clearly?) that you&#x27;re getting commissions from the CC signups and, ideally, that those may not be the best offers available.  (ex as of this comment, referrals are paying 90K to sign up whereas your link is at 60K-an almost $300 difference).  I understand this is a huge revenue driver, but that&#x27;s not an excuse for shilling affiliate links where the user loses out on real, actual money.

  - Last Refresh: Would be nice to know when the last refresh was.  I&#x27;ve clicked a few times for available seats and found that the airline did not actually have the flights available.  As a user, this erodes trust in your results.

  - Slider: Points min&#x2F;max slider interface isn&#x27;t great but honestly I can&#x27;t think of an alternative.  1 AA point is not the same as 1 Asiana point.

  - Program coverage: Your tool coverage seems similar to the other cached searching tools (Seats.aero, award logic, etc) but, honestly, needs improvement.  Most airlines are quickly moving towards releasing more inventory to their own members, so coverage is much more important now than it was two years ago. As an example, Singapore Air very rarely releases ex-US business class awards to partners but releases them much more reliably to their own members.

  - Alerts: I understand this is part of &quot;SkyView&quot; but you should make it more prominent and clearly marketed.  Alerts are *super duper useful* and give your product direct, permissioned access to a user&#x27;s email and&#x2F;or SMS that they actually want!  This is what differentiates you from Point.me and the airline searches and also what gave ExpertFlyer its edge for so long.  My guess is making it more prominent will drive more subscribers.</code></pre></div><br/><div id="41102426" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41102426" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">timqin</span><span>|</span><a href="#41101968">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41102204">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41102426">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41102426">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you! Love more feedback, especially from travel hackers.<p>1) You&#x27;re right. We have Advertiser Disclosures on all other pages, but will make the disclosures more prominent. Going to push out a change today&#x2F;tomorrow. Affiliate commissions are not a big revenue driver right now.<p>2) We&#x27;re working on a new design so the last refresh is more prominent. Currently, you&#x27;ll be able to see the &quot;Update ## ago&quot; when you either expand the flight details or click into the full flight details page.<p>If are using the Roame live search, then it should be the instant you search. Please let me know if you are running into issues with live search results not showing up on the airline website.<p>If you are using SkyView or Discover cached search, we pull results and save them up to 4 days or so. This is to help users plan and search broadly across regions and dates.<p>3) Agreed. We try to simplify the UI for points beginners. Thought it would be too confusing to try to estimate AA vs. Asiana vs. United, etc. The value of the points would also depend on which fare class and route you want to take. If you someone only wanted to fly US to Japan in JAL, then AA miles would be gold. But if someone wanted to fly US to Paris, then Air France&#x2F;Flying Blue miles would be gold even though they are easy to earn because all the CC points transfer to Air France.<p>4) We&#x27;re working on adding more loyalty program coverage. Our free tool is in real-time though, so slightly different than the cached tools. We do have a cached tool called SkyView.<p>5) This is good feedback.

Leaving it up just for general awareness<p>General tips:<p><pre><code>  - Never carry a balance, ever.  If you do, forget about playing this game because it&#x27;ll cost you more than you gain.  Pay off your CC debt first.
  - There are many blogs&#x2F;sites that push &quot;their&quot; link over ones that pay more to the user because they get paid a hefty affiliate fee.  Be wary.
  - Have a goal in mind before you accrue points so you can be more strategic about accruing.  I recommend starting with a list of all the trips you&#x27;d like to take in the next two years and using that to frame what points you will need to accrue.  Don&#x27;t forget hotels as the cost of hotels can easily outweigh the cost of flights.
  - Figure out how much work you want to put in.  There are levels to the game-the deeper you go, the more work it will be.  It will also get that much more rewarding
  - Prioritize transferable currencies (UR, MR, Cap1, TYP, etc) because devaluations happen often and transferrable currencies help insulate a bit.
  - Try to get your partner on board if at all possible, having a second (third, fourth, etc...) player (P2-P100+) is a scaling super power
  - Keep in mind the &quot;burning&quot; side of the equation and use them often.  Points and miles are worthless bits of made up paper dressed up as currency and subject to the whims of corporations that don&#x27;t have your best interests in mind.  Treat them as such.
  
</code></pre>
My general strategy for a (US based) newbie is:<p><pre><code>  1. Read above, create a strategy and an ordered list of cards
  2. Sign up for the credit cards and put all your organic spend on those credit cards to meet spend.
  3. Repeat 1 &amp; 2 after meeting spend and gaining sign up bonus
  4. If you have another player available, switch between players every time you meet the spend and get the bonus to lower your velocity and appear &quot;safer&quot;
  5. You might also want to get a (minimum) 2% everywhere card for everything you can&#x27;t put on the new cards.
</code></pre>
It can get a bit difficult as the minimum spend requirements can be high.  There are many strategies out on the web that can help with this.<p>For a couple using this strategy, you&#x27;ll be averaging ~2 new CC&#x27;s per person per year (which is <i>very</i> safe) and earning ~7-10ish percent back on most spend.  After a year or so of doing this, you should have enough for a vacation or two.</div><br/><div id="41104312" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41104312" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Beijinger</span><span>|</span><a href="#41101968">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41104136">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41100987">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41104312">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41104312">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks, great info.<p>I never accrued points wiht my CC.

General archetypical goals of travel hackers I&#x27;ve seen are:<p><pre><code>  1. Maximum number of trips
  2. Minimum cost for trips (cheap or free travel)
  3. Free or discounted luxury travel (business class, luxury hotels, etc)
  4. Maximum cash back (to the point of being a full time job)
  5. Maximizing elite status (for business travel, etc)
  6. Short term, saving up for one or two big bangs (honeymoon, bucket list item, etc)
  7. Any combination of above and more.

</code></pre>
Each one of those goals require a different strategy.  If you&#x27;re aiming for maximum cash back, I personally think the work involved in the CC game would be worth the time but everyone is different. A sign up bonus generally represents 7-10% cash back on the bonus spend so I&#x27;m ok with spending a bit of time updating spreadsheets and keeping track.<p>On the other hand, I have some friends who do not want to bother due to the stress and overhead involved (finances can be difficult).  For those types, I usually recommend foregoing the CC game and putting everything on a no annual fee 2% card.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41106481" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41106481" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">khafra</span><span>|</span><a href="#41101968">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41104312">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41104646">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41100987">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41106481">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41106481">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Flying free is a high aspiration; are there easier goals in that direction?

(So rather than choosing a fixed destination, let it be open to any destination, and then plan a trip somewhere where you can get a good deal on a flight, if that makes sense?)<p>* On mobile, the filter popup is blocked by the &quot;Log In&#x2F;Sign Up&quot; buttons on the bottom of the screen.

Always open to feedback.<p>1) You&#x27;re right. We have been working on how to best present SkyView to users. Skyview is our cached search product, which lets users search up to 60 days at a time, search from region-to-region, and set alerts.<p>SkyView Lite is free &quot;intro&quot; version of SkyView, where free users with an account can search the upcoming 60 days of departing flights and search 7 days at a time. Wanted to let free users try it out before upgrading.<p>We currently do not support roundtrip because often times the lowest-priced points deals are found on different airline programs. With points redemptions 2 one-way flights are the same price as 1 roundtrip. (There are some exceptions like booking on ANA directly, which requires you to search roundtrip). You can open up a second tab to search the different directions though.<p>2) Totally understand. It was one of the debates we had. We were trying to balance showing users all the live points results out there so they can make their own decisions on whether to get new cards. We find that a lot of users may have one set of points that are not as useful or easy to redeem. They realize that perhaps they should consider another credit card for better access to deals.<p>We are planning to roll out a saved card programs feature, so you can just turn on to automatically filter.<p>3) So when you redeem on the Chase or Amex portal, your points are only worth at a set value of 1-1.5 cents per point (cpp) depending on your credit car program and they&#x27;re all pegged to directly to the cash fare.<p>Let&#x27;s use this example:<p>New York to Paris on Air France business class would cost around $4,000 in cash.<p>If you were to redeem on the Amex portal, that flight would costs 400,000 Amex points ($4,000 * 100 cents per dollar &#x2F; 1 cent per point).<p>However, if you were to use Air France Flying Blue miles and redeem on the Air France website, the flight could be as low as 50,000 points. At 50,000 points you points would be worth 8 cents per point ($4,000 * 100 cents per dollar &#x2F; 50,000 points). *Amex points can transfer to Air France Flying Blue at a 1:1 ratio.<p>So you&#x27;re getting 1 cpp on the Amex portal, but 8 cpp on the Air France website directly. That&#x27;s a big value increase.<p>Roame shows all the live availability if you were to redeem your points on the airline directly using their miles. So we would show the flight in the example above with the 50,000 points price.<p>4) Yes! We have a Discover feature where you can select your city and dates. You will see the cached flight deals from your origin city. We&#x27;re still rolling this out, so the origin cities are limited right now.<p>5) Mhmm. Let me take a look at that.

(Or at least, they don&#x27;t want people finding inexpensive redemptions, which cost them money.)<p>The fundamental reason that it&#x27;s hard to find cheap redemptions is that the economic incentives are aligned against cheap redemptions existing in the first place. Airlines want the revenue stream from points to be as high as possible, and the redemption rate to be as low as possible.</div><br/><div id="41103106" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41103106" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">timqin</span><span>|</span><a href="#41100886">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41102613">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41103169">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41103106">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41103106">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So this is an interesting question because there isn&#x27;t a clear cut answer. The airline industry is fragmented globally, there are tons of national carriers. And each airline team has different incentives.<p>Airlines, especially US airlines are making billions of dollars a year by selling points to credit card companies. So in theory, they actually want as many people in the world of points as possible because they a consistent high margin revenue from credit card companies.<p>I believe the real difference between airlines is how they balance loyalty redemptions vs. revenue sales. Airlines full control the pricing of the points redemptions, but they have to balance pricing with capacity and fixed costs. If the flight is only 50% full, then that points redemption is going to help amortize the large fixed costs of operating that half empty flight. So having a bargain points redemption rate, would look attractive.<p>Now, if that flight is 90% full, then the airline may not offer seats to redeem with points or raise the price to something extremely high like 200,000 points.</div><br/><div id="41104108" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41104108" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">timr</span><span>|</span><a href="#41100886">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41103106">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41103169">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41104108">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41104108">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Airlines, especially US airlines are making billions of dollars a year by selling points to credit card companies.

The airlines would <i>prefer</i> that you can&#x27;t redeem your points until the flight is absolutely unbookable by any more valuable means -- and for the airlines, essentially every form of cash booking is more valuable than points, since a &quot;point&quot; in your wallet means cash on their balance sheet. It&#x27;s not in their interest to make cheap redemptions easy to find.<p>If I had to guess, the airlines that do early releases of award seats treat it as marketing expense.

Yes, I see how they&#x27;re really a scam, but I think the scam isn&#x27;t quite what you think it is: the companies offering points are hoping <i>that you won&#x27;t use them</i>.  Of course, they know that people will use some of them, and that some people will maximize their use of their points, but the whole thing I think is basically trying to get people to use their card&#x2F;service, but hoping they won&#x27;t game the system by using all their points, maximizing their usage, etc.<p>If everyone stopped using the points they accrued, the companies aren&#x27;t going to lower their fees and make things cheaper for people.

So the corporate travelers actually do not get the most value&#x2F;benefit from points travel because corporate travelers already fly on business. Flying on business class is just a given. Corporate travelers also do not have as much flexibility with their travel schedule or destinations.<p>It&#x27;s really the average consumer who has never flown business class that gets the most value and just 1 credit card bonus offer of 60,000 points can get them that flight. Some sign up offers are 150,000 points or more. To the average consumer, flying on business class is a dream experience.<p>In terms of math:<p>When flying on points, you can redeem business class flights at 4-8 cents per point. So if you&#x27;re earning your points 1.5 cents per dollar (eg. Chase Freedom Unlimited), each dollar you spend can earn you 6%-12% back (1.5 points earned * 4-8 cents per point). You can redeem first class for even more at 12-20 cents per point.<p>This is just the low end.

You set the I-beam in a spot, and then… hold? Sometimes the “paste, copy, select all” menu comes up. Or it just prolongs the loupe being on screen. So you have to carefully slide down, without moving left or right, and then pinpoint exactly where the I-beam is with your finger, hold, and now you can paste. It will happily jump to a word or line ending on any step of that process.<p>Or! I’ve made some typo that’s inexplicably locked in the iOS dictionary now, so I have to remove one letter… which it will happily swap back to the incorrect one after I spent 10 seconds fiddling with a virtual magnifying glass to correct it.

Now I don&#x27;t know--do I wait and tap again? How long should I wait? How long after I tap will I know if it was successful? Just a totally bonkers and frustrating experience, to do something that should not be complicated.<p>This happens a lot on mobile and especially on the web. You tap or click on something, and there is no immediate feedback about whether or not that action did or will do anything. The computer churns for an indeterminate number of seconds, and then you finally get the UX feedback--or you don&#x27;t.

Like with the desktop UI before mobile, conventions have been established by the platform creators, and the application UI designer’s job isn’t to second-guess how a checkbox works or how pinch-to-zoom works. Adding your own unique personal animated touch might feel delightful and fun, but more often than not it’s just confusing to the user. (There are exceptions of course — some apps have a user base who thrive on discovering surprises and figuring out the unexpected. But the typical SaaS or mobile ordering app isn’t that.)<p>The word “design” itself has become somewhat misleading about what the purpose of this job actually is. “Information architecture” was always a better description of the actual bulk of the work.<p>Architects don’t generally spend any of their time inventing delightful door knobs that turn in unexpected ways.

Because  it randomly stops drawing unless it is fully screwed in. A useful detail would be if it had a tactile bump when screwing to let you know you are safe to use it.<p>I&#x27;d keep it to myself but the article reads just so full of itself I couldn&#x27;t resist.

Since childhood I turn a page by lifting its edge first with initial pinch motion towards the edge. For me &quot;swiping&quot; often lifts more than one page which is frustrating.</i><p>Yeah, that in particular was weird. Even the animation in the article subtly hints you at why you <i>don&#x27;t</i> swipe pages in books: that&#x27;s a quick way to get bent or torn pages. A sideways motion is literally the worst way to start a page flip, since the force you apply acts at the right angle to the motion you want, and instead is trying to compress the paper sheet.<p>The pinch gesture explanation was even weirder. Myself, I&#x27;d go for analogue of using finger swipes and two-finger motions to slide pieces of paper, or other small objects, on a desk. Only in that context pinching sort of comes up as a candidate zoom gesture - bringing small objects closer or further apart.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

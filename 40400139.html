It might be a boring area, and any opportunity to take it out and fly then counts as training, if nothing else can be written up for that flight. That there is a helicopter guarantees that it will be used.

Then, when a player can reach the other team&#x27;s camp without getting tagged, they can shoot one shot into the field of the other team.<p>A Stratego variant: every team gets his own stack of cards which represent the different players of Stratego, the board game. Players take a card before leaving their camp. If they are tagged, or tag someone, they show their card to the other person. The winner according to the Stratego rules wins the card of the other person, and the loser must go back to their camp for another card.<p>Some more games with paint, animal cards, ...<p>Lot of good memories from that time.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40400515" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40400515" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alwaysbeconsing</span><span>|</span><a href="#40402324">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40400319">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40400515">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40400515">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you have time, people, resources for such you might also interest in more elaborate variation, my favorite <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;killerqueenarcade.com&#x2F;fieldgame" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;killerqueenarcade.com&#x2F;fieldgame</a> Three different win condition, and one player have special role as &quot;queen bee&quot;.

This planned over a large public park which presumably other people use. Do you play around people? Do you avoid them with a minimum radius out of respect, or do you weave by them if it helps prevent someone from getting your flag? Participants loved the game, but how did non-participants in the park at the same time feel about it? Did they feel uncomfortable using the park with the game on all sides?<p>If you and your friends play soccer in an open area of the park, probably all agree that other people should avoid setting up their picnic in the area of play. Parents and dog-owners should keep their kids and pets from entering. If you and your friends declare the whole park to be the area of play, including the playground, children&#x27;s garden, bathroom, splash pad and parking lot as shown in the finished map, I think this ceases to be a reasonable expectation, but what the norms should be is ambiguous.</div><br/><div id="40401714" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40401714" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MatthiasPortzel</span><span>|</span><a href="#40401155">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40402006">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40401714">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40401714">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is why stuff like this doesn’t happen more often.<p>I played a 10-day game of tag in college.

Back in high school we would play this in a friends backyard. His parents had around 10 acres of woods, creek, and open field. Would be amazing to have an organized event with so many players like this.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40400502" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40400502" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">glenneroo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40403623">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40402980">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40400502">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40400502">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We used to do something similar here in Vienna at Türkenschanzpark, one of the biggest (and my favorite) parks in Vienna at night with 20-40 people.

It depends on how well you can judge momentum, people&#x27;s intentions, and it&#x27;s all about &quot;juking&quot; people. Such a simple game, but because of its physics it&#x27;s exceptionally skill-based. I&#x27;d love an mmorpg that had similar physics that PEOPLE master, so anyone can jump in and play without having to grind. Levelling up your reflexes instead of in-game character stats.</div><br/><div id="40400996" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40400996" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zoky</span><span>|</span><a href="#40400455">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40401010">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40400996">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40400996">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Weird, I remember that game was all over Reddit about 7-8 years ago, then when I remembered it and looked it up a couple years back it was completely dead.

At high pressures, various gases become toxic or cause side effects. Oxygen has a limit somewhere in the 1.2-1.6 bar range, and it becomes toxic. For deep dives, you need a lower percentage of oxygen in the mixture. Nitrogen causes nitrogen narcosis at higher pressures, so for deep dives, you need a lower percentage of nitrogen in the mixture. You need to add something <i>else</i> if you want to lower both nitrogen and oxygen, and that’s helium. At high enough pressures, helium causes high-pressure nervous syndrome, a.k.a. helium tremors.<p>That’s normally the limit. Pretty much every gas is bad for you at these pressures. There is an experimental alternative, which is to use hydrogen gas for the deepest dives, but people are understandably cautious about breathing a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen.</div><br/><div id="41323014" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41323014" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">qayxc</span><span>|</span><a href="#41322381">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41324131">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41323014">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41323014">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In principle liquid breathing is still an option.

Extending acceleration protection beyond 20g requires filling the lungs with fluid of density similar to water. An astronaut totally immersed in liquid, with liquid inside all body cavities, will feel little effect from extreme G forces because the forces on a liquid are distributed equally, and in all directions simultaneously. Effects will still be felt because of density differences between different body tissues, so an upper acceleration limit still exists. However, it can likely be higher than hundreds of G.<p>&gt; Liquid breathing for acceleration protection may never be practical because of the difficulty of finding a suitable breathing medium of similar density to water that is compatible with lung tissue. Perfluorocarbon fluids are twice as dense as water, hence unsuitable for this application.<p>We&#x27;re not at the point where we <i>can</i> launch at hundreds of Gs yet (and I&#x27;m not sure I would want them to be centripetal Gs initially either - that sounds very not fun) ... but when we get to the point were we want to launch a person into space in the direction of another planet at 10 or 20 or 30 Gs of initial acceleration, this is likely something to be revisited.</div><br/><div id="41325639" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41325639" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nick3443</span><span>|</span><a href="#41322381">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41325035">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41325350">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41325639">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41325639">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would be concerned with sudden high intensity jerks, and with handling rotational acceleration (causing shear stress between different solid&#x2F;liquid structures).

If you have nitrogen in your lungs, it will diffuse into your bloodstream, and thence to tissues, until the partial pressures are equalized. This is not normally a problem for free divers - even most deep free divers - because the combination of time and pressure are not great enough, but it seems that Nitsch might have crossed a line here.<p>I tried doing a back-of-envelope calculation to see if this seemed plausible. No-decompression limits in dive tables for air breathing bottom out at 5 minutes at about 60 m, and while the depth cutoff is presumably set by nitrogen narcosis and&#x2F;or oxygen toxicity, it is clear that nitrogen absorption is quickly reaching the bends-risk level (for comparison, this dive reached a depth of 253m and lasted about 4 1&#x2F;2 minutes.)<p>There are several factors to be taken into consideration. Firstly, Nitsch&#x27;s lungs would have been considerably collapsed at depth, and so presumably less-effective at gas transfer. secondly, dive tables are conservative. On the other hand, though, they are based on the tissues in which the diffusion is slowest (if it was effectively instantaneous, there would be no risk of the bends on ascent) and assume the diver is ascending slowly even when they are not taking decompression stops, so maybe in Nitsch&#x27;s case, the problem arose in different, faster-diffusing tissue (neural tissue?) than that on which the tables are based.<p>Given all this, I&#x27;m inclined to believe Nitsch&#x27;s own claim that he had a case of decompression sickness from this dive.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41322641" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41322641" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ashton314</span><span>|</span><a href="#41322192">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41324107">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41322641">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41322641">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is one of those things that, were an alien to encounter the stats sheet for humans, they would go, &quot;holy crap humans do <i>that</i>?&quot; Ability to lift crazy heavy things when there&#x27;s enough adrenaline rushing through your system is pretty wild too.

Swimming horizontally under water requires a lot of effort, which burns more oxygen. Combine high exertion with untrained individuals not aware of the risk, or misuse of hyperventilation (which doesn’t increase oxygen, but decreases CO2), and suppressing urge to breath, and you can also blackout.<p>Here are a few good articles:

They would probably have to give me a couple pounds of lead to sink properly...<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1Pe3L5OcAEg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1Pe3L5OcAEg</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41324105" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41324105" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lisper</span><span>|</span><a href="#41323337">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41323761">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41325174">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41324105">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41324105">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; there&#x27;s a sign that says &quot;don&#x27;t hold your breath underwater.&quot;<p>What exactly do they expect you to do instead?</div><br/><div id="41324134" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41324134" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jagged-chisel</span><span>|</span><a href="#41323337">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41324105">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41325174">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41324134">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41324134">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Exhale.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41325174" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41325174" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nradov</span><span>|</span><a href="#41323337">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41324105">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41323139">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41325174">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41325174">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think you must have misunderstood your scuba diving instructor because you have that part almost entirely wrong. Scuba divers don&#x27;t hold their breath while ascending. This is extremely dangerous due to lung over-expansion injuries (gas embolism).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dan.org&#x2F;alert-diver&#x2F;article&#x2F;lung-expansion-injuries&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dan.org&#x2F;alert-diver&#x2F;article&#x2F;lung-expansion-injuries&#x2F;</a><p>Among healthy people at sea level, hemoglobin oxygen saturation is already near 100%. You can&#x27;t squeeze <i>more</i> oxygen into the hemoglobin regardless of inspired PPO2. What actually happens at higher PPO2 levels is that extra oxygen dissolves into the bloodstream and circulates unbound from hemoglobin. (This is why recompression chambers can be used to treat patients suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning.)<p>Ascending back to the surface reduces PaO2 (assuming no change in breathing gas) but this presents no risk of hypoxia since the diver would just be returning to normal levels. The only exceptions would be for a technical diver breathing a hypoxic mix (like less than about 15% O2), or using a rebreather where some sort of error or failure prevents oxygen from being injected into the loop.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

The aspects you want to ignore (number of users, be something other than Apple, what others are using) would actually affect my use of HaxyDeck directly: since i&#x27;d be the only one (or one among a tiny number) using it, i&#x27;d be the only one having to make it do things i want, it wont have software from others, it wont support software other people may want to use for communication, software some services that theoretically have nothing to do with phones or computers (e.g. banks) wont work because HaxyDeck&#x27;s userbase is irrelevant for them, etc. All of these have to do exactly with what others are doing.<p>Basically see how all the non-Android Linux phones (like PinePhone) are faring.

Unfortunately I think things aren&#x27;t going back. What the article doesn&#x27;t appreciate--and we techies don&#x27;t either--is just how much the <i>scale</i> of today&#x27;s tech market absolutely dwarfs the scale of the tech market back in the days before the internet.<p>The market wanted growth. Early tech companies, like Microsoft, Apple, eBay, and then Google, went from zero to huge in a very short period of time. But companies like the FAANGs kept up the absurd levels of growth (20+% YoY growth in the case of Google) that Wall Street got hooked on, and it&#x27;s been on a drug binge ever since. The result is that we have <i>multiple</i> trillion dollar companies that will...never not want to be a trillion dollar company.<p>The total amount of money in the PC market was miniscule compared to today, and the internet and its online retail plus ads bonanza even dwarfed that. The PC software market, the video games industry, everything--it was all so much smaller. As the internet swallowed the world, it brought billions of users. And those billions of users can only use so many devices and so many games and spreadsheets and stuff. They had to be made into cash cows in other ways.<p>The tech market just <i>has to</i> keep growing. It&#x27;s stuck tripping forward and must generate revenue somehow to keep the monsters&#x27; stomachs fed (and their investors too). We will never be free of their psychotic obsession with monetization.<p>And advertising is <i>soooo</i> insidious. Everything looks like it&#x27;s free. But it isn&#x27;t. Because our eyeballs and our mindshare is for sale. And when they buy our eyeballs their making back those dollars of us--it&#x27;s the whole point. So whether you like it or not, you&#x27;re being programmed to spend money in other parts of your life that you wouldn&#x27;t otherwise. It cannot move any direction but falling forward into more consumerism.<p>I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m a doomer in this regard.

Yet I don&#x27;t think we have to put up with it all of the time. Most of the technology in our life is either frivilous or has a workable alternative. It is not as though we have to abandon technology in, or even current technology in pursuit of the personal. Yes, it involves making more careful decisions. Yes, it will likely be limited to people with technical knowledge. On the other hand, that was true of computing in the 1980&#x27;s and largely true of computing in the 1990&#x27;s.<p>In many respects, we are also better off than we were in the 1980&#x27;s. There are more of us, we are connected globally, and the tools that we have access to are significantly better. We also have a conceptual framework to work within. Technically speaking, Free Software may have existed back then but few people even knew of it. People were struggling with ideas like public domain software (rarely with an understanding of what that meant). If you wanted to make money, outside of traditional publishing channels, you were usually toying with ideas like shareware (where you had pretty much no control over distribution). If you wanted to spend money of software, outside of traditionally published stuff, chances are that you had to send cheques or cash to somebody&#x27;s house.<p>And then there is communicating with likeminded people. We may like to complain about things like Discord or Reddit, but they are not the only players on the block. Plenty of people still run small or private forums. Yeah, they can be hard to find.

When PCs (broadly, not just IBM compatibles) were penetrating into the home market they would often come with a suite of tools or demos to show what it could do, or let you create things even if they were the basic editions. Before the internet became part of the furniture, if you&#x27;d spent several hundreds on some hot technology there was a good chance you&#x27;d buy print magazines for it as well, and they would come with cover discs that exposed people to a lot of what was possible with computing.<p>Without wanting to sound like a stick in the mud, the focus of computing has definitely changed now. I see it as an interesting thought exercise on how to get someone running around with what is usually a marvel of computing in their pocket to try and imagine that is not the apex of computing, whether to explore what other means of computing offer or what comes next besides a slightly better version of what we have now.</div><br/><div id="42765886" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42765886" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BrenBarn</span><span>|</span><a href="#42763377">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42763605">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42764054">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42765886">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42765886">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I see it as an interesting thought exercise on how to get someone running around with what is usually a marvel of computing in their pocket to try and imagine that is not the apex of computing, whether to explore what other means of computing offer or what comes next besides a slightly better version of what we have now.<p>That is a great way of thinking about it and I&#x27;m curious what you&#x27;ve come up with.  I think it&#x27;s a pretty hard sell for most people, especially for things like messaging that have become very central to daily life.  Also, there&#x27;s a big difference between convincing someone to try something a bit less mainstream and  convincing them to reject the mainstream version.  Like, you may be able to get someone to install LibreOffice but it&#x27;s a lot harder to get them to uninstall Excel.<p>Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve found that people who have some other kind of retro&#x2F;niche&#x2F;subculture interest can be somewhat more receptive to the idea that the newest thing isn&#x27;t necessarily the greatest.  Like someone who&#x27;s into hunting for vintage clothes, or woodworking, or whatever.  Ironically such people are on average more tech-averse than a typical &quot;normie&quot;, but they often understand the concept that it can be useful to actually put effort into getting something that&#x27;s not just whatever&#x27;s handed to you.  In a way the insidious aspect of recent tech is the way it&#x27;s conditioned people to expect that they shouldn&#x27;t have to think much about how to do things, and to just want &quot;smart&quot; technology that reduces decisions.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42764054" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42764054" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cynicalsecurity</span><span>|</span><a href="#42763377">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42763421">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42763605">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42764363">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42764054">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42764054">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Gimp, LibreOffice, Gog.</div><br/><div id="42764101" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42764101" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">spencerflem</span><span>|</span><a href="#42763377">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42764054">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42764363">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42764101">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42764101">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I love free software, but gimp is not as good as 2006 photoshop and libreoffice is not as good as 2007 word.<p>Gog &amp; itch &amp; humble are great and as good as steam if they have what you want but the collection is a lot smaller</div><br/><div id="42764215" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42764215" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Dalewyn</span><span>|</span><a href="#42763377">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42764101">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42764363">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42764215">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42764215">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My $dayjob involves lots of officework as in paperwork.<p>You bet your fucking ass I&#x27;m using Microsoft Office and reliant on it to a bloody fault.

They seemed more rooted in innovation than value extraction at all costs.<p>Today, I look at those same companies with absolute derision over their completely unethical and hostile approaches to the world, the economy and dealing with the people that use or rely on them.<p>Worse, my ability to get excited about new companies, products, services and innovations has been completely blunted by the expectation that anyone working on something I think is &quot;cool&quot; will inevitably be co-opted by people who have the worst instincts: those who actually have no respect for technology or computing and view people as less than human, simply entities from which maximum value must be extracted at any cost.</div><br/><div id="42765769" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42765769" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">interludead</span><span>|</span><a href="#42764806">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42764667">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42765769">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42765769">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Maybe we should reconciling the best of the past with the benefits of today...</div><br/><div id="42765907" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42765907" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BrenBarn</span><span>|</span><a href="#42764806">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42765769">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42764667">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42765907">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42765907">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42764667" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42764667" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mmackh</span><span>|</span><a href="#42764806">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42765006">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42764667">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42764667">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We’ve been working on a new kind of home computer for a few years now based around microcontrollers. Unlike a traditional setup, it’s aimed at replacing the traditional light switch to provide environmental awareness and bring families closer together. Although the base OS is not open source, the SDK is totally scriptable, meaning as an owner you will be able to trace and understand the device fully.<p>Examples of what it can do
- Autonomous lighting with mmWave radar with 180 degrees fov and ambient light sensor
- Recording of temperature, humidity, barometric pressure and VOX to onboard SQLite database at a chosen interval. 
- Onboard web server, which serves as dashboard and configuration page.   
- Communication platform with integrated microphone (hardware indicator light, off by default) and speakers. I’m also experimenting with talking to LLMs like this.<p>And many more things.

Like this:<p>&gt;  I’m not calling the tech industry evil.<p>Well. . . why not?  I think at this point the tech <i>industry</i> is evil.  Not in the sense that water is wet, and maybe not even in the sense that mammals birth live young, but sort of in the sense that ice occurs near the Earth&#x27;s poles.  There are some bits and pieces here and there that don&#x27;t follow the pattern but they are the exception and they&#x27;re getting smaller.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that <i>technology</i> is evil, but the ways its being used and developed often are.<p>And that gets to another aspect of this that I feel like people in the tech world sometimes overlook when talking about this: enshittification is not a technological phenomenon.  It&#x27;s a social phenomenon that is driven by our socio-legal apparatus which allows and encourages high-risk pursuit of sky-high profits.  Corporate raiding a la the Sears debacle, consolidation in grocery stores, even something like tobacco&#x2F;health or oil&#x2F;climate-change coverups, all these are forms of enshittification.  Tech is the most prominent venue, maybe because it&#x27;s especially suited to certain forms of vendor lock, but it&#x27;s by no means the only one.<p>Enshittification happens because we are not willing to take a sledgehammer to the idea that making businesses bigger and bigger is a good thing.  Timid reforms focused on things like data privacy are woefully inadequate.  Large companies need to be directly dismantled, wealth needs to be directly deconcentrated, and broad swaths of behavior that are currently happening left and right need to become the kind of thing that will land you in prison for 10 years.<p>I&#x27;m not optimistic this is going to happen without some kind of &quot;hitting bottom&quot;, though, whatever form that may take.</div><br/><div id="42765899" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42765899" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">amilios</span><span>|</span><a href="#42765668">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42763381">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42765899">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42765899">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Maybe I&#x27;m too cynical, but too many people in power directly benefit fom enshittification for anything about it to change.

You have automated upgrades, a consistently funded developer that can better plan and deliver updates, if you only need the software for a short period of time it can be cheaper. Frankly the packaged software approach was a kludge due to the technical limitations of the time. Now if big releases make sense developers do that, if incremental updates over time provided as a service make sense, they can do that.<p>Most of the section on what we can do about all this is focused on stuff that didn&#x27;t exist in the past. The internet and online services, social media. Going back to the past wouldn&#x27;t be to do those in some ideal way that used to exist, it would mean not doing them at all.

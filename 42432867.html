All the same, this must be the oldest bug in computing.

The Metal database for which it was the I&#x2F;O component never materialized.

Apart from his lack of business&#x2F;project-planning sense (scope it down; don&#x27;t aim for 10 digits etc), I think other complicating factors that went into the tragedy of Babbage were:<p>(1) He kept coming up with new&#x2F;better ideas and pursued them (basically rabbitholing as mentioned),<p>(2) He had won a bunch of awards at a young age simply for <i>proposing</i> the Difference Engine (everyone could see it was a good idea and also seem to have expected it to be straightforward to build: a <i>fait accompli</i>) — so in the intervening decades he must have felt like he couldn&#x27;t give up,<p>(3) He got entangled with the government. IMO the tragedy here is that he was just middle-class enough to have a romantic idea of government: while the nobles distrusted government&#x2F;politics as they sort of looked down on it, and the lower classes distrusted government as it had never done anything much for them, he was of just the right class (his father came from humble origins and had made money in banking) to have patriotic notions of government and all that — he wanted to offer his invention to &quot;the nation&quot; (government), and conversely thought the government &quot;ought to&quot; reward him for it, rather than understanding the practical problems of government officials in funding his project. (The government offered to give his invention back to him, but he refused.)<p>(4) Possibly as a result of these awards, he seems to have been attached to the idea of being a &quot;smart&quot; person (many examples, e.g. the anecdote quoted in one of the appendices in Sydney Padua&#x27;s wonderful book, where he refused to judge an award along with Faraday — he thought he &quot;deserved&quot; to be the sole judge) — this also probably got in the way of doing practical things rather than pie-in-the-sky &quot;genius-type&quot; ideas.<p>I think the government entanglement is probably a big part of the story (he asked them basically &quot;I haven&#x27;t completed the Difference Engine but I have a much better Analytical Engine that I could implement with more money, what should I do?&quot; and they sat indecisively for twenty years!), and it&#x27;s interesting to read his accounts (in his memoirs) vs others&#x27;, e.g. Lord Playfair&#x27;s account from the same appendix:<p>&gt; <i>&quot;He was in chronic war with the Government because it refused to furnish supplies for his new machine, the ground of refusal being that he never completed the first. […] Babbage always considered himself a badly treated man, and this feeling at last produced an egotism which restricted the numbers of his friends. […] Babbage, who was delighted with the suggestion, but made it a condition that he alone should be appointed, as a reparation for all the neglect of the Government towards his inventions. Even the association of such a distinguished man as Faraday would take away from the recognition which was due to him.&quot;</i><p>Anyway Padua&#x27;s book (<i>The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</i>) seems very well-researched (I admit I haven&#x27;t read much of it but read all the appendices in detail; would strongly recommend anyway).</div><br/><div id="42437212" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42437212" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">irthomasthomas</span><span>|</span><a href="#42433555">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42437018">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42434610">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42437212">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42437212">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Reminds me of Bell who was funded to work on an update to the telegraph, but got distracted by his side-project,  the phonograph.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42436884" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42436884" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ursamin</span><span>|</span><a href="#42433555">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42434610">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42433635">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42436884">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42436884">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The real mark of a non-trivial program is that it doesn&#x27;t work on the first try.<p>not true.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42433635" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42433635" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neuronet</span><span>|</span><a href="#42433555">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42436702">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42433635">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42433635">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A really cool article.

But you can&#x27;t actually have a Turing complete system with variable-run-time loops that&#x27;s homomorphically encrypted, because that leaks information about the inputs.<p>When they say FHE is Turing-complete, what they mean is that you can take an arbitrary program requiring Turing completeness, then time-bound it, unroll it into a fixed-length circuit, and run <i>that</i> homomorphically. Since you can keep upping the time bound, you can compute any function. So the <i>system</i> that translates your programs into those circuits, with no limit on the bound you set, could then be called Turing-complete -- but you couldn&#x27;t say that about any of those circuits individually.<p>Earlier related comment: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40078494">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40078494</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42436045" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42436045" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LeroyRaz</span><span>|</span><a href="#42433351">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42437011">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42436045">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42436045">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Good article.

If you have the bug, it&#x27;s obvious you have to change your hash calculation to avoid it. The developers of 4cc may have struggled with bugs where they had buckets that were too large for efficient searching.<p>Convoluted hashing functions are not always used for hash tables. When hash tables are pointers (e.g. object identities themselves are used as keys to associated objects with additional properties), sophisticated hashing functions are not needed; e.g. simply extracting a few bits of the pointer, avoiding the lowest bits (which might all be zero due to alignment!).<p>I believe that the 4cc dictionaries hit upon the key insights of hashing: calculating a numeric key from an object which then directly identifies a small search bucket.<p>The Four Corner Code abandons semantics like radicals. Codes are assigned according to certain stroke patterns in the four quadrants of the character, without regard for their semantic role. The inventors hit a key insight there: that any way of calculating a hash code is valid as long as it can be consistently followed, and leads to short searches. The function can look at meaningless fragments of the object (exactly like when we take the middle bits of a pointer). A character&#x27;s etymology need not play any role in how it is digested.  Whereas in the radical methods, you have to know that for instance 火 and 灬 both mean &quot;fire&quot; and are understood as the same radical #86.

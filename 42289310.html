While it uses technical-sounding terms related to machine learning (LLMs, tokenization, data sets), the way they&#x27;re strung together doesn&#x27;t make logical sense.<p>2. The grammar is incorrect: 
   - &quot;a tokenization is isolating&quot; is not grammatically valid
   - The sentence structure breaks down in the middle with two &quot;is&quot; statements
   - The phrase &quot;establishing a lattice in uniformity within the field of technics&quot; is meaningless jargon<p>3.

One of their findings was that training data can be up to 50% code without actually degrading performance, and in some cases (benchmarks like bAbI and WebNLG) with improvements (probably because these tasks have an emphasis on what they call &quot;long-range state tracking capabilities&quot;).<p>For reference: In the Llama 3 technical report (2407.21783), they mention that they ended up using 17% code tokens in their training data.</div><br/><div id="42292246" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42292246" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eru</span><span>|</span><a href="#42290051">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42291313">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42290711">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42292246">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42292246">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is the network only trained on the source code, or does it have access to the results of running the code, too?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42290711" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42290711" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ninetyninenine</span><span>|</span><a href="#42290051">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42290973">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42290711">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42290711">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;On the one hand, LLMs demonstrate a general ability to solve problems.

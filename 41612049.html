You are right that the mental picture we get when we use the term “particle” is a little ball or something like that. It is unfortunately a confusing name…
You need to begin with a field, like the electromagnetic field for instance. When you look at its properties like energy, polarization and so on, in order to write down a state of the field you need to specify all of them in a way or another. In quantum mechanics you can associate a vector space to each property, and then (here is the important bit) you need to pick a basis for your vector space in order to write down its vectors. Obviously there is an infinite number of possible choices, and we usually end up choosing what makes things simple, so in the case of energy we pick the basis of eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian, because to evolve them in time you just need to multiply them by a complex number and that’s it. Well, those basis vectors are the “particles“ because when taken individually they share some properties with macroscopic particles, but the analogy really only goes so far. And the thing is that usually the state of the field is not in a single one of these basis vectors unless the conditions are very special, so even saying that the field is “made of particles” is misleading because it’s like saying that the wind is made of air going vertically, horizontally and across, which sure it’s “correct” because you can combine those directions and get any other direction but it’s also not really that…</div><br/></div></div><div id="41612307" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41612307" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">elashri</span><span>|</span><a href="#41612143">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614624">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41613022">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41612307">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41612307">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; we often think as though it were dirt, or a billiard ball, or something<p>The problem lies that it is hard to imagine something that does have zero dimensions. You can get the example of ant walking into 2D and it is unaware of third dimension to explain we are have something similar for space-time 4D (although not the same picture exactly as time is different from spatial dimensions). But we don&#x27;t have an idea how to approximate a mental picture of what a zero dimension could be. So you have something that does not occupy a volume in space (Talking strictly about elementary particles here) in the classical sense.<p>This does not mean they are abstract concept. According to QFT -Quantum field theory- you would think (by training) of particles are excitations or quanta of their respective fields. Fields are there always (vacuum is just filled with fields) and particle appears when they are excited (more complex processes occurs). So you would think of each particle as a manifestation of a quantum field that permeates the universe. What is interesting (and probably confusing to most people) is that these fields are not zero-dimensional, instead, they exist everywhere in space and time. But the quanta (particles themselves) are considered point-like with no spatial extension.<p>In practice physicists will think about particles properties (i.e charge, mass, interactions, spin) ..etc instead of what this particle actually is from that point of view. This is often for practical reasons. You are a working physicist and you learned from your training that you shut up and calculate (or implement if you are doing experimental particle physics as you spend most of your time coding) by this stage.</div><br/><div id="41614620" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41614620" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hughesjj</span><span>|</span><a href="#41612143">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41612307">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41612940">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41614620">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41614620">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I just think of a zero dimensial object as a ghost.<p>Topological defect.

This sounds blithe but ... it is as close as you will get to the truth.<p>I only got the bachelors&#x27; version of physics, though I did take some grad classes, so here is what I will tell you:<p>The human mind learns from experience and it thinks of things in terms of the past experiences it has had.  We are big assemblages which exist in a narrow range of temperatures (think in terms of Kelvin).  Our experience is <i>classical</i>, in the Newtonian sense: we move at not a particularly notable fraction of <i>c</i>, we are too warm to note the strangenesses which happen below, say, twenty or four or a thousandth of a Kelvin (superfluids and BECs are out), we are too cold to have a great internal experience of plasma, leaving us to be creatures of solid and liquid, with a sort of inferred understanding of gas.  We are too large to feel the quantum realm, in the sense that the uncertainty principle is not obvious to us from what we have felt.<p>So, we must make do with abstractions, with fictions, with approximations.  Conscious that we are the epitome of the six blind men trying to understand the elephant through touch alone, we try to <i>break</i> our understanding, to search for flaws in our inferences.  Yet this does not grant us true experience when we run across, say, the electron.  We try to think of it like a billiard ball, but we can say that a billiard ball is <i>this</i> wide, yet we are fairly sure at this time that the electron has no radius, no diameter, that it might as well be a geometric point.  Every time we try to measure, we can only establish a smaller and smaller upper bound for the confounded thing&#x27;s radius.  That&#x27;s not like our lives at all!<p>The reality of this electron is that if we get it going fast enough, it stops getting much faster no matter how hard we smack it.  That&#x27;s not like our reality.  If we try to pin down <i>where</i> it is, the more we do it, the harder it is to figure out how fast and in what direction it moves.  And as we work to ascertain the velocity (and therefore momentum), we lose sense of this bit of weirdness&#x27; position.<p>You eventually have to develop an understanding based not on experience at all.<p>Perhaps this was unique to me, but the first time I understood integration in calculus, I had a brief moment of dizziness as I apprehended this new thing.  You know how you are working a math problem and you have a good idea of what the answer is already, a sense of what the magnitude and direction might be?  I had ground my way through vector and tensor calculus, and had been working a problem in gravitation and relativity class when I <i>sensed</i> what the resulting tensor would look like, the shape of it, in the sense that I would know if my figures were way off.  I nearly fell off the chair, my head spun so.<p>If you care to, you can do this for a particle.</div><br/><div id="41615245" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41615245" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">librasteve</span><span>|</span><a href="#41612143">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614095">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41612916">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41615245">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41615245">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">this</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41612916" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41612916" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bbor</span><span>|</span><a href="#41612143">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614095">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41612323">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41612916">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41612916">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m not a physicist, but as an arrogant philosopher of science: isn’t it just field excitation?

It can be more sharp or more fuzzy and when it overlaps with another fuzzy particle object they might exchange a neat portion of momentum, angular momentum and energy and violently reshape becoming sharper or fuzzier (that&#x27;s the wave function collapse and expansion) then they go again on their separate merry ways.<p>Sometimes when particles meet or even spontaneously they can split or merge altering other parts of their nature (unrelated momentum, energy and angular momentum). This happens for example when neutron decays into proton and electron.<p>Sometimes they get stuck together because of electromagnetic force and they resonate in interesting harmonies and travel together. That&#x27;s atoms. Interestingly when they are resonating in those harmonies they become quite fussy about amounts of energy they prefer to exchange and they do it only in a very specific quanta.<p>And there&#x27;s a class of particles called quarks that travel together all the time as they are always tightly bound with each other and can never get free despite possessing incredible amounts of energy they continuously exchange. That&#x27;s nucelus.<p>We really don&#x27;t like this image because fuzziness is actually two dimensional in every point of our already 4 dimensional space-time and described by complex numbers so we prefer to focus on those brief moments when particles interact since if we have a lot of particles that are bound together to form measurement apparatus they are so sharp that the interaction they participate in squash other particles nearly to a point and we can declare that the measure particle collapsed to have some momentum, or location, or spin described by a single vector instead of a cloud. It neatly turns out that the square of complex number fuzziness describes the probability that a fuzzy particle will interact with a sharp one (one of those bound together in measurement apparatus) with a specific outcome.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41612476" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41612476" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ww520</span><span>|</span><a href="#41612143">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41613905">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41612476">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41612476">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s why calling Higgs Boson the God particle is not quite right.

So people think that <i>stuff</i>, whatever that stuff is, is fundamentally made up of much smaller stuff, and that stuff is fundamentally made of yet smaller stuff, and so the smaller you get, the more fundamental you get.

But no one mentioned that this is not a physics subject. The question “What is a particle?” belongs to philosophy not to physics. The problem for physicists is that they assume the Newtonian worldview that the world is made of indivisible units of matter called particles. [1] This assumption cannot be questioned. It is a dogma of the profession. But their experiments tell physicists again and again that the world is not made of indivisible units of matter. Physicists can either respect their experiments and accept that the world is not made of indivisible units of matter called particles or choose sophistry and try to fit their dogma into nature by wordplay. Physicists chose the latter and instead of dropping their dogma they keep changing the definition of the word “particle”. It does not matter what you call those indivisible units of matter. Physicists used to call them “particle” then “field”, then “excitation” and many other names that can be used case by case to save their sacred Newtonian dogma. Physicists’ dilemma is that they do business under the professional name of “particle” physicists. If there is no particle their profession would be redundant. Obviously they cannot call themselves “excitations of the field physicists”. So they keep the word particle but keep changing the meaning of it and they blame the public for not understanding physics jargon. My advice to physicists: respect the authority of your own experiments and drop the Newtonian dogma of a material world made of indivisible units of matter.<p>[1] &quot;God in the beginning formed matter in solid, massy, hard, impenetrable movable particles.&quot; Isaac Newton, Optics, 1704, Book III, page: 375</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

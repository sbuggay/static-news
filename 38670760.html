The failure of teams of highly capable individuals is often due to egocentric silver-haired gorillas in the room:<p>&gt;They spent excessive time in abortive or destructive debate, trying to persuade other team members to adopt their own view, and demonstrating a flair for spotting weaknesses in others&#x27; arguments. This led to the discussion equivalent of &#x27;the deadly embrace&#x27;. They had difficulties in their decision making, with little coherence in the decisions reached (several pressing and necessary jobs were often omitted). Team members tended to act along their own favourite lines without taking account of what fellow members were doing, and the team proved difficult to manage. In some instances, teams recognised what was happening but over compensated - they avoided confrontation, which equally led to problems in decision making.</div><br/><div id="38671371" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38671371" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">OhThatGuy</span><span>|</span><a href="#38671185">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38671016">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38671371">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38671371">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a silver haired person I really appreciate the comment about us.

I wonder if the difficulty of the &#x27;Apollo team&#x27; to coordinate can be boiled down to simply too much ego and status-seeking. I imagine that high performers would have bigger egos as they invested a lot of effort in getting to where they are and this makes them stand their ground more firmly.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed on some projects with poor leaders and many high-ego status-oriented people on the team, that sometimes people reach consensus over bad ideas because those ideas represent a kind of middle-ground between two large egos... But the middle-ground idea might actually be worse than both ideas from which it is derived.<p>I tried hard to avoid this when I was a team lead; the trick I used was that I would often raise half-baked ideas and then quickly admit if someone put up a counter-argument which showed how it was not ideal or just plain wrong.<p>I was trying to show everyone that coming up with a bad idea doesn&#x27;t make you a fool and it&#x27;s OK to play around with ideas and that what matters is not idea creation, but idea selection.<p>You need to be really knowledgeable in your field for this approach to work though because there will often be someone on your team who will try to use any opportunity to make you look bad and so you always have to be a few steps ahead.<p>So sometimes I might present a naive idea intentionally just to spark a discussion and get people thinking and forming their own ideas but, in fact, I have a much more developed idea in my mind about where I think it&#x27;s going to go; so maybe 90% of the time, I look like I&#x27;m thinking many steps ahead.<p>Then maybe 10% of the time, it goes in a completely unexpected direction and I genuinely change my mind and people are pleased with themselves that they could convince me.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38670924" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38670924" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neonsunset</span><span>|</span><a href="#38671016">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38670906">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38670924">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38670924">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had the opportunity to work with people like these.<p>The sad part is if you are highly disagreeable as well but also the only person in the debate that recognizes the importance of getting shit done over semantics or minute details, it will cause severe burnout.<p>Don&#x27;t repeat my mistake and leave early if you see no levers to sway the team dynamics.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38670906" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38670906" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">colordrops</span><span>|</span><a href="#38670924">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38670993">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38670906">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38670906">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sounds like Apollo Team type 1 had members with insufficiently &quot;sharp, analytical minds&quot; without high enough &quot;mental ability&quot;, otherwise they would have recognized that organizational rules, behavior, and culture are very important to a team&#x27;s success.</div><br/><div id="38671141" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38671141" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">j-a-a-p</span><span>|</span><a href="#38670906">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38670993">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38671141">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38671141">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The Apollo Syndrome<p>&gt; This page describes &#x27;The Apollo Syndrome&#x27;, a phenomenon discovered by Dr Meredith Belbin where teams of highly capable individuals can, collectively, perform badly.<p>If I try to imagine the Apollo project then I always see a group of glasses wearing (of the sixties type), white coat scientists and rocket engineers.<p>In reality the Apollo team counted 400.000 people.

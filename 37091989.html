That younger mindset is one that I&#x27;m only too eager to see become the dominant mindset in American politics.<p>As an American who was in his mid-thirties on 9&#x2F;11, I have to disagree with your assertion about 9&#x2F;10 vs. 9&#x2F;11.  I was (especially as a native New Yorker who worked across the street[0] from the World Trade Center for several years prior to 9&#x2F;11, and provided IT support and services to several companies impacted by the events of 9&#x2F;11) appalled and angry at the death and destruction wrought by those bloodthirsty scum.<p>However, I applauded the decision to not only rebuild WTC, but to build an even <i>bigger</i> building than the ones that came down.  When challenged on that opinion (with the idea that it was just painting an even bigger target on a new building), my thought was that &#x27;freedom isn&#x27;t safe, and to ensure liberty risks are necessary.&#x27;<p>As such, I was disgusted with the Patriot Act[1] and the various other surveillance mechanisms and security theater (cf. the TSA[2]) implemented after 9&#x2F;11.<p>I think that many folks felt a loss of control (control which they never actually had) and sought out means to regain that feeling of control.  One friend refused to fly after 9&#x2F;11, not because she believed that driving 1000 or 1500 miles rather than flying was actually <i>safer</i> (she knew the statistics as well as I did), but because she felt more in control in doing so.<p>And that&#x27;s dumb, especially when it comes to making laws.  I wish more of my fellow Americans understood that.<p>As traumatic as 9&#x2F;11 was for me (I <i>still</i> avoid the WTC whenever possible, not because I&#x27;m afraid, but because it&#x27;s still painful to think about 22 years later), I believe that a free and open society is important enough to accept some risk to preserve it.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;200_Vesey_Street" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;200_Vesey_Street</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Patriot_Act" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Patriot_Act</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Transportation_Security_Administration" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Transportation_Security_Admini...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37093719" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37093719" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cbsmith</span><span>|</span><a href="#37092615">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37093307">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37093327">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37093388">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37093719">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37093719">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Over 30 years, and you could name five things.

The work to develop TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] also aimed to encrypt more of the handshake so as to expose less information to network observers -- a fairly direct result of the Snowden revelations. Work to further improve TLS in this respect continues today using the so-called Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) mechanism [TLS-ECH] to remove one of the last privacy leaks present in current TLS.P:<p>Work on ECH was enabled by significant developments to encrypt DNS traffic, using DNS over TLS (DoT) [RFC7858] or DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484], which also started as a result of the Snowden revelations. Prior to that, privacy hadn&#x27;t really been considered when it came to DNS data or (more importantly) the act of accessing DNS data. The trend towards encrypting DNS traffic represents a significant change for the Internet, both in terms of reducing cleartext, but also in terms of moving points-of-control. The latter aspect was, and remains, controversial, but the IETF did its job of defining new protocols that can enable better DNS privacy. Work on HTTP version 2 [RFC9113] and QUIC [RFC9000] further demonstrates the trend in the IETF towards always encrypting protocols as the new norm, at least at and above the transport layer.P:<p>Of course, not all such initiatives bore fruit;&quot;<p>Indeed.  People are still sending cleartext domain names in SNI.  Are the alleged privacy gains of encrypting DNS traffic meaningful when anyone can see the domain names in SNI, when the user makes a TLS connection.  Arguably cleartext SNI is even worse for privacy than cleartext DNS because with SNI anyone can see when the person is connecting to a website whereas DNS only tells them when the person looked up a name.  Concluding that a person accessed a website from a DNS lookup alone requires some assumptions.  Cleartext SNI requires no such assumptions.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37097880" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37097880" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sph</span><span>|</span><a href="#37094383">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37094117">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37097880">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37097880">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>&quot;Looking back on all the above from a 2023 vantage point, I think that, as a community of Internet engineers, we got a lot right, but that today there&#x27;s way more that needs to be done to better protect the security and privacy of people who use the Internet. In particular, we (the technical community) haven&#x27;t done nearly as good a job at countering surveillance capitalism, which has exploded in the last decade. In part, that&#x27;s because many of the problems are outside of the scope of bodies such as the IETF. For example, intrusive backend sharing of people&#x27;s data for advertising purposes can&#x27;t really be mitigated via Internet protocols.<p>However, I also think that the real annoyance felt with respect to the Snowden revelations is (in general) not felt nearly as much when it comes to the legal but hugely privacy-invasive activities of major employers of Internet engineers.<p>It&#x27;s noteworthy that RFC 7258 doesn&#x27;t consider that bad actors are limited to governments, and personally, I think many advertising industry schemes for collecting data are egregious examples of pervasive monitoring and hence ought also be considered an attack on the Internet that ought be mitigated where possible. However, the Internet technical community clearly hasn&#x27;t acted in that way over the last decade.&quot;</i><p>--<p>We are all very aware of Snowden&#x27;s revelations and call him a hero, but we also routinely ignore, if not get paid by, major tech corporations that make tracking and advertising, a form of surveillance, their main source of income.<p>I guess it&#x27;s easy not to care when you&#x27;re paid $250,000&#x2F;yr and have a nice cafeteria to get unlimited free snacks.</div><br/><div id="37098330" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37098330" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mjan22640</span><span>|</span><a href="#37097880">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37094117">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37098330">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37098330">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Imagine being served ads so good that you would install a contentblocker to not be distracted from the ads.

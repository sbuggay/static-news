A table of users. You take a table from the database and put it into an html tag table. Wait, who is “you”? The model? Do you want your model to know about html? The view? Do you want your view to know how to connect to a db? The glue code for them? If so, then it is  the model-view-controller-glue, not model-view-controller.<p>This is why what the author calls Apple-MVC is far more common. It is just hexagonal architecture. You take different components that take care of their own area of concern and glue them together to fit specific needs of your app. That glue code is called “controller” in that case. It is intuitive and simple; and thousands of junior developers probably reinvent that type of architecture every day.</div><br/><div id="36400610" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36400610" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throw310822</span><span>|</span><a href="#36398063">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36398968">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36400610">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36400610">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; You take a table from the database and put it into an html tag table.<p>&gt; Do you want your view to know how to connect to a db?<p>I think this is where there&#x27;s a misunderstanding: you think of your model as &quot;a database&quot;.

A model is an object that provides an api with high-level business operations and views on data.<p>At that point, your view needs only to receive from the model the pre-digested data it provides and translate it into html.

Intent of the model is to be a black box the controller can talk to whenever it needs something from “storage”. If you did it right, you can change the entire underlying data store and endpoint, and as long as the API for the model is preserved, the controllers don’t even notice.<p>• Controllers mediate “turning prepared or cached model data queries into something to give back to the user” and “listening for the user wanting to do something and responding appropriately by fetching needed model data or server resources”. Handles moving between pages, incoming API calls, last mile data filtration (where last mile is based on milliseconds to do it, &gt;25ish or so and it probably belongs on the model) and cleanup if any is needed, and is first line of contact (and defense) for anything a user’s triggered.<p>• Views are whatever the user can visibly interact with and see, and provide buttons, links and interactibles which hook into controller calls to change things or give back data<p>I’ve found the above model typically has good separation of concerns, usually avoids most fights of “does this belong on the model or controller”, and you can usually cleanly parallelize work between multiple people on a small team if you use ~~waterfall~~ scrum to agree on a data model for each endpoint and needed functions before starting.</div><br/><div id="36399580" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36399580" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smaudet</span><span>|</span><a href="#36398063">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36398968">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36398846">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36399580">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36399580">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I more or less agree, the main issue with your &quot;Model&quot; is that it doesn&#x27;t separate Data from Service (or Manager or Database or whatever your data-management layer looks like).<p>A lot of &quot;MVC&quot; has Model as a dumb Data-Model, and data is passed around between the service&#x2F;manager&#x2F;db and controller a lot. It&#x27;s very rare (that I&#x27;ve seen) that you truly have so-called Model code talking directly to the controllers.<p>There is also the question of data-flow in larger &quot;MVC&quot; containers - where either numerous &quot;views&quot; must co-operate (e.g. in the case of complex nested lists), and must choose some combination of view-to-view communication (often in the case of layout-intense code), or view-to-controller-to-controller-to-view communication, or in some cases view-to-controller-to-service-model-to-controller-to-view communication.<p>Often the pattern applied to de-congest such a system is a service-oriented or micoservice, or event pattern, although all of these tend to introduce overhead and hence in-efficiencies compared to tightly coupled e.g. view-to-view communication, or tightly coupled controller to controller communication.<p>I suppose what I am arguing is that Model is a bit of a misnomer - you must always operate upon data, all code is simply transforming that data and the best way to transform that data is usually context specific to some combination of business and practicality needs... so the &quot;Model&quot; unless strictly defined as &quot;the raw data structures&quot; tends to somewhat overlap and envelope the other roles.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36398846" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36398846" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LeonB</span><span>|</span><a href="#36398063">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36398968">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36400648">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36398846">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36398846">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; You take a table from the database and put it into an html tag table.

Stuff like inheritance and mixins only exist to solve fake problems that make no sense outside of C# or Java. To me, singletons and plain-ole-functions are pretty easy to deal with in most languages - I just ask the editor where a function gets used or where it&#x27;s defined.

You have &lt;form&gt; tags. Every thing you can do in your view, is another thing you don&#x27;t have to submit to some slow service or wait for a controller to do.<p>GUI frameworks are often like this as well, complex well-written UI components tend to remove a lot of supporting code from Controllers that just was there to half-support the UI having a slightly different formatting. The more you can push into your view, the more you can delete controller code, the more model code becomes a glorified &quot;save&quot; button. If your data is well-formed, and&#x2F;or semantic, this model code can be very simple.<p>Games can be a lot like this as well - after you&#x27;ve loaded your geometry, pushing everything off to the GPU means your &quot;game&quot; code can be focused on simple things. Advanced things like physics and collision can be handled by actor-event logic. Controllers are still there to do some puppeteer-ing and models exist so save and networking code works.<p>Even databases can be view-heavy. A lot of database work amounts to building views of the same set of tables. Some analysis is done on the views, maybe, but keeping everything in normalized tables means losing out on view caching. Possibly this is more how vector databases work, as part of the data is <i>where</i> the data is not just <i>what</i> type the data is or which table it happens to be in.<p>Of course, none of this works great for heavy-networking cases (lots of net-code, lots of multiplayer events, lots of cross-database replication), but those are maybe less interesting to me - I prefer decentralized distributed models anyways. I generally value having more functionality at the local compute node, versus some monolithic service that may fail in a couple years time on the other side of the planet.<p>But that&#x27;s just me.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36398588" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36398588" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ebiester</span><span>|</span><a href="#36397436">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36398516">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36399761">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36399024">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36398588">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36398588">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Until the moment that models have to call other models to get anything done.<p>The problem is that the models often get too tied with the database implementation.

An object that models part of the service&#x2F;product. Meaning, not something related to the operation of the <i>medium</i> by which the service&#x2F;product is delivered, but any operation that models the service&#x2F;product itself, independent from medium. This could be a representation of a DB row, a service object, a decorator, or any other piece of logic that relates to what you do.<p>2. An object that reflects a DB row, but <i>not</i> anything that represents other parts of the service&#x2F;product. I don&#x27;t know the full history, but probably connected to the rise of ORMs and Rails, and when devs got in the habit of throwing almost all product logic either into controllers or Active Record models. And when you want to start putting the bulk of that code in dedicated, non-DB files, you have so many active record files that you don&#x27;t want to muddy up the `models` directory with non-DB code too, so you create other directories alongside `models`, `views`, and `controllers` to house the other files.<p>The author may have been using definition 2, where models are strictly seen as DB-related code, and having them be &quot;dumb data containers&quot; is useful as it enforces extracting operational logic to classes better suited for that logic. But since they get put in other directories, they aren&#x27;t seen as &quot;models&quot;, despite technically still belonging to the &quot;model&quot; part of MVC.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36400760" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36400760" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hardware2win</span><span>|</span><a href="#36397436">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36398744">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36398047">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36400760">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36400760">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Actually, having dumb models is the surest way to completely screw up your controllers design, since you’re now left with no other places to write your business logic in.<p>There is such a place: model</div><br/></div></div><div id="36398047" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36398047" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gymbeaux</span><span>|</span><a href="#36397436">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36400760">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36397696">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36398047">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36398047">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The end of this rabbit hole is probably something like “actually DDD is best!” or whatever comes&#x2F;has come after DDD (domain-driven design)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36397696" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36397696" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">keyle</span><span>|</span><a href="#36397436">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36401174">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36397696">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36397696">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is a lot of truth in what the Author wrote, however he completely missed the MVVM pattern and confused it with MVC.<p>The MVVM pattern, originally designed by MSFT for Silverlight, showed a way that basically cleaned up a lot of the issues with MVC.<p>That is what SwiftUI uses today, MVVM, as you can compare with his diagram of what he calls &quot;Apple&#x27;s MVC&quot; and this diagram from MSFT: [1].<p>In fact, I&#x27;d go out on a limb and say that no one really uses MVC today - in its pure original form.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;architecture&#x2F;maui&#x2F;mvvm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;architecture&#x2F;maui&#x2F;m...</a></div><br/><div id="36398743" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36398743" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sparkie</span><span>|</span><a href="#36397696">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36398537">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36398743">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36398743">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I like the Model-View-Adapter[1] architecture, which is basically what you get by reversing the arrows between the View and ViewModel in MVVM.

I&#x27;ve used it in an MMO server, with the view representing the network protocol which clients interact with, and the model being the state of the game world. The adapter receives messages from game clients asynchronously and updates the world, then sends messages back to the clients affected by the change in the world state.<p>IMO it makes sense to have the inverted dependency in this case. If the view depended on the adaptor, then changes to the game server behavior would impact the network protocol, which would also force changes to user clients each time the server gets updated. Ideally we want to be able to make regular updates to the server without impacting clients.<p>[1]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93adapter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93ada...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36398537" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36398537" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smackeyacky</span><span>|</span><a href="#36397696">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36398743">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36401174">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36398537">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36398537">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Funnily enough, the 1990s VisualWorks UI moved on from the original MVC implementation into a pile of complexity involving adaptor classes and automated event processing, so even the Smalltalk guys knew the original implementation wasn&#x27;t  enough for most GUI problems.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36401174" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36401174" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mpweiher</span><span>|</span><a href="#36397696">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36398061">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36401174">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36401174">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Model updates View, View sees User, User uses Controller, Controller manipulates Model.<p>Yeah, not really.

In that context, this “design pattern” really isn’t a design pattern per se; it’s just a formalism over the code you’d inevitably write to make such a system work. In a green-screen system:<p>• the “view” is the terminal buffer state — not even a “virtual DOM” version of it, but literally the buffer state itself (under 3270 protocol, properties like “editable” are basically bits in the TTY buffer applied per-cell — you can think of them like ANSI TTY-cell background colors and not be far off.) Think of it as an mmap(2)ed file in backend memory, holding structs of <i>almost</i> the same type as the view, save for OS-syscall-time remapping to prune out the form labels.<p>• the “model” is the ADT over the record-oriented mainframe datafile backing the terminal (How does the model know how to change the view? Because it’s a very <i>thin</i> abstraction: fields in the view-state, and fields in the DB state, are 1:1, with no parsing or serialization — leading to things like passwords only being stored in the DB at the size of the form-field for them.)<p>• the “controller” is the serial line-discipline that interprets the key codes sent from a TTY into editing actions like “overwrite a character” or “backspace”, and applies those actions to the data in the model (how does it know what part of the model is active? “Spatial databases” have something like a hierarchical navigation-path DB cursor as part of their descriptor state. Switching the active view is a model state change!)<p>• you need an “editor” separate from the “controller” because otherwise every character edit action sent to the TTY would provoke an instantaneous commensurate change in the DB data. If you need to store <i>and validate</i> live edits before committing them to the DB, then you need an editor “proxy” object to hold that “draft” state.<p>All in all, pretty different from anything we’re doing these days. Or is it? Depends on where you draw the line of abstraction! In modern terms:<p>• the classical MVC “controller” is the <i>frontend</i> or <i>per-component view controller</i> — observing the client’s actions and feeding them into the system as events.<p>• the classical MVC “view” is the <i>API query result set, databound through the client DOM components</i>. If your app is server-side rendered, it’s the HTML DOM itself as loaded into the browser!<p>• the classical MVC “model” is the entire backend, through its API<p>• the classical MVC “editor” is the <i>changeset</i> — a CQRS Command-in-draft.

It’s essentially an X11-like client-server bidirectional state synchronization protocol for what are essentially pure-text HyperCards.<p>If you can understand that, then you can probably see how Smalltalk <i>is</i> — in the abstract! — a green-screen terminal system. (So is X11 itself; and so are modern “framework display server protocols” like QML and XAML; and Mozilla’s XUL; and of course HTML.) Smalltalk just happens to have the client and server in the same address space. (But they’re still separate objects — a Smalltalk display window is a “control” that doesn’t share state with its backing delegate that’s telling it <i>what</i> to display.) One could think of this as the “client - backend responsibility separation” paradigm.

A view should never know about things like keyboard and mouse events directly.<p>I&#x27;d like to emphasise the &quot;a view can update its model directly&quot; part - which is exactly what Redux and React are designed to <i>prevent</i>: when logic in a view can mutate the model (especially when the view _also_ depends on update notifications from the model to update itself) things get impossible to reason-about.<p>Instead, Redux&#x2F;React is designed to force the view to &quot;update&quot; the model indirectly via actions and reducers.<p>Another tenet of Redux+React is that the model (&quot;state&quot; in Redux&#x2F;React) is an immutable object-graph which is replaced on every update, whereas &quot;classical&quot; MVC requires a mutable, long-life&#x27;d model.<p>I feel the similarities only exist if you squint - and if you&#x27;re lumping TFA&#x27;s idea of MVC with React (and MVVM (groan...)) as ideas in opposition to how most people wrote&#x2F;write RAD&#x2F;VB6&#x2F;WinForms by directly subclassing controls and overriding message-pump event-handler methods, which (I hope) everyone will agree is an approach that doesn&#x27;t scale beyond building throwaway UIs.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36397403" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36397403" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">laurent123456</span><span>|</span><a href="#36397222">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36397650">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36397445">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36397403">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36397403">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In many ways it&#x27;s really just MVC (at least the fat model &#x2F; skinny controller style) except they renamed the elements:<p>- Dispatcher = Controller<p>- Store = Model<p>- View = View<p>And the actions are the messages sent from the user to the controller.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36397445" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36397445" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MrPatan</span><span>|</span><a href="#36397222">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36397403">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36399367">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36397445">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36397445">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It may be a matter of explaining it differently.

Wikipedia says the first public demo of WebObjects was 1995.<p>Original WebObjects tried to ignore the web&#x27;s statelessness by keeping state on the server, and encoding state in a path param in every URL.  It was not exactly designed to fit a stateless environment as designed to let the developer <i>ignore</i> the fact that the environment was stateless, put an abstraction on top that made it appear stateful.  But maybe that&#x27;s semantics.  But later WebObjects, towards the end of when it stopped being a commercial product, grew out of this -- it was in fact a very bad fit for the web. Encoding an opaque identifier in every URL to connect to back-end state is bad for cache-ability, idempotency, persistent URLs, etc., it&#x27;s not what Tim BL or Roy Fielding wanted from URLs at all.<p>BUT, despite all that (differences in &quot;routing&quot;, URL-to-app mapping), as far as the MVC break-down, the original WebObjects was still very much like the architecture of Rails, to the extent that I&#x27;ve often wondered if the Rails originator(s) were exposed to WebObjects.<p>But, then, I&#x27;m not sure that this architecture, actually was motivated by, as OP says: &quot;but in a way that makes sense for the web. The components don&#x27;t have references to each other, because and nothing is alive. Each object is only around long enough for the page to be rendered&quot; -- because the earlier WebObjects, as far as MVC split very much like Rails, in fact did it&#x27;s best to keep the objects alive after all on the back-end, and provide abstractions that hid the statelessness of the web from the developer, connecting each HTTP request to the kept-alive-in-back-end objects, where things <i>did</i> have references to each other, or appeared to, that ought to have not been possible.  But still had the same MVC breakdown that could be diagrammed the same way.<p>Actually here&#x27;s a 2001 version of the WebObjects manual, note they are pointing this out as <i>different</i> than classic MVC, but it is very much like Rails too.<p>&gt; Note: WebObjects uses the term “model” differently from MVC. In WebObjects, a model establishes and maintains a correspondence between an enterprise object class and data stored in a relational database. In MVC, model objects represent the special knowledge of the application.<p>— <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;archive&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;LegacyTechnologies&#x2F;WebObjects&#x2F;WebObjects_5&#x2F;WebObjectsOverview&#x2F;WebObjectsOverview.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;archive&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;Le...</a>  page 28<p>More on MVC in WebObjects there too<p>&gt; Acting as a mediator between Model objects and View objects in an application is a Controller object… Because of the Controller&#x27;s central mediating role, Model objects need not know about the state and events of the user interface, and View objects need not know about the programmatic interfaces of the Model objects.<p>Familiar, right?  And different from what the OP is saying was original MVC; maybe consistent with both what OP calls Apple-style as well as Rails-style MVC?<p>I haven&#x27;t found an earlier dated WebObjects manual online (such as actually from NeXT days!), but they definitely existed, would be interesting to see how they referred to MVC.<p>You can see a little bit about the weird ways original WebObject tried to encode state in URLs, mapping to persistent back-end state, in this other legacy WebObjects doc I found on the web, see &quot;Component Action URLs&quot; on page 12, and following through page 17. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.wocommunity.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;attachments&#x2F;1049043&#x2F;Web_Applications.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.wocommunity.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;attachments&#x2F;1049043&#x2F;We...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36397390" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36397390" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Avlin67</span><span>|</span><a href="#36399252">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36399407">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36397390">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36397390">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I did long forgot the MVC stuff...</div><br/></div></div><div id="36399407" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36399407" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">1propionyl</span><span>|</span><a href="#36397390">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36397795">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36399407">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36399407">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, because what is called MVC today is really MVP (originating at Taligent), which was a simplification&#x2F;derivation of Xerox MVC intended for loosely coupling business logic to user interfaces.<p>This is just my speculation but I think the mixup between MVC&#x2F;MVP was largely the fault of Rails&#x27; popularity coupled with a general lack of awareness of Xerox MVC, and after its popularity other frameworks have rolled with the corruption&#x2F;redefinition.<p>That said, whether you call it a Presenter or Controller is largely irrelevant in practice. It&#x27;s just a particular application of the mediator pattern (requiring some form of observer-like pattern) with the goal of decoupling the Model from the View.<p>The presenter&#x2F;controller&#x27;s job is to mediate between the model and view. The P&#x2F;C references and can directly call both M and V, but also observes M and V such that neither M not V knows about P nor about each other. The key benefits here are that the M is now testable in isolation, and it&#x27;s much easier to swap V out for V&#x27; (with an accompanying P&#x27;).<p>MVVM is another story, but it&#x27;s in the same MVP derived family.

Then Microsoft announced successor to Windows Forms... a new technology called WPF. WPF uses MVVM which automated more of the work that a developer has to do: it automatically updates the UI when data objects change, and it automatically updates data objects when the user inputs something through the UI. Sounds cool, right? The problem is that in large projects it becomes hard to understand how data is flowing. Because of excessive automation things are happening behind the scenes. Developers began to understand that this is not as cool as it initially looked. React re-introduced one-way data binding, which updates the screen when data objects change, but not the other direction. People found that they are significantly more productive with this technology even though it does less on behalf of the developer. Now it is widely acknowledged that one-way data binding is better.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36397426" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36397426" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fredgrott</span><span>|</span><a href="#36400393">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36397839">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36397426">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36397426">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To get anal<p>If you use any SDK and or framework you do not have MVC<p>you instead have<p>framework-SuperController

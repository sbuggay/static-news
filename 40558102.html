I got an Elegoo Mars and a very large expensive Chinese resin printer that I never got to work.<p>I ran into three problems that I was not able to overcome, even after tons of trial and error:<p>- Warping. With ABS, a heated chamber, ABS slurry, heated glass bed, completely solved all warping. With resin, I was unable to predict or fix warping issues.<p>- Model not sticking to the bed. Behaviour was inconsistent. With a good printer like the Form, that is probably not a problem. With FDM, having an all metal printer, with a glass bed and a good Z probe solved this for good.<p>- Mechanical performance was garbage. Very brittle.<p>- Always needing supports. With FDM, if you fully control the design process, you can completely eliminate supports (at least in my case, of course this imposes design constraints). With resin, you always need supports. The supports are more complex and harder to remove.<p>I still think resin may be the future, because the level of detail with resin is just amazing.</div><br/><div id="40560618" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40560618" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">torginus</span><span>|</span><a href="#40560543">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40560373">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40560618">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40560618">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The warping one is strange, warping is caused by thermal expansion&#x2F;contraction and resin doesn&#x27;t really change temperature during the printing process. That&#x27;s one of the reasons you<p>Sounds to me you either aren&#x27;t printing at room temperature, don&#x27;t have the resin dialed in or you got a bad batch of resin&#x2F;<p>The other criticisms are fair, but not necessarily dealbreakers and can be mitigated.<p>PLA is brittle as well, about the same as standard resin. Just like with FDM, there are other formulations.<p>Imo resin printing is mostly useful for tabletop minis, not engineering prints.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40560373" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40560373" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">teruakohatu</span><span>|</span><a href="#40560543">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40560480">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40560373">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40560373">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; First up, the Raspberry Pi 4 compute module. From a scrappy little “$35 computer” put out by a charity originally for the educational market, Raspberry Pi has taken over the world of single board computers, socket by socket. Thanks to the financial backing it had from government grants and donations as well as tax-free status as a charity, it was able to kickstart an unusually low-margin hardware business model into a profitable and sustainable (and soon to be publicly traded!) organization with economies of scale filling its sails. It also benefits from awesome software support due to the synergy of its charitable activities fostering a cozy relationship with the open source community. Being able to purchase modules like the Raspberry Pi CM with all the hard bits like high-speed DDR memory routing, emissions certification, and a Linux distro frees staff resources in other hardware companies (like Formlabs and my own) to focus on other aspects of products.<p>A very succinct description of the Raspberry Pi past trajectory.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40560480" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40560480" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">archi42</span><span>|</span><a href="#40560373">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40560583">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40560480">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40560480">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Since Formlabs position themselves at the higher end, I was surprised they didn&#x27;t skip LCDs and went straight to DLP.<p>PDF from TI from 2019, though I think they have updated their line up since: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ti.com&#x2F;lit&#x2F;sl&#x2F;dlpt019e&#x2F;dlpt019e.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ti.com&#x2F;lit&#x2F;sl&#x2F;dlpt019e&#x2F;dlpt019e.pdf</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40560583" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40560583" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">torginus</span><span>|</span><a href="#40560480">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40560346">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40560583">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40560583">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Honestly, this just looks like a fancypants version of the cheap Chinese LCD resin printers you can buy for the fraction of the price.

I also find it much harder to prep designs; is that going to warp as it is pulled off the bed for each layer; is that going to trap uncured resin etc.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40560600" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40560600" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sciolistse</span><span>|</span><a href="#40560346">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40560385">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40560410">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40560600">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40560600">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You can get a good quality SLA printer for $200-300, and you can buy FDM printers for tens of thousands of dollars.

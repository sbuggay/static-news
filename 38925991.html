I don’t doubt that the system has produced some academic success stories but it must be the exceptional case.

Consider how little interest there would be in the &quot;Ann Arbor Wolverines&quot; vs &quot;Columbus Buckeyes&quot; in the USFL without any association with schools and their alumni, or whether anyone outside a 20-mile radius would watch Durham vs Chapel Hill if they played in the NBA&#x27;s G-league.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38936843" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38936843" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wolverine876</span><span>|</span><a href="#38937587">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38927323">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38936843">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38936843">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This conference realignment is obviously a bad outcome. The leaders of the universities and American academia are delivering very poor results: education is too expensive, academic freedom is limited by outsiders, and now this. What good do the conference realignments do for anyone? Who is happy or better off?<p>The Big 10, in particular, used to be both an athletic association and an academic one, sharing resources between their members, (almost) all AAU members (leading research universities). This year they had the chance to add <i>Stanford</i> and <i>Cal</i> to the academic association, and share their resources. And they turned them down, because the Bay Area college football market isn&#x27;t big enough. The story I read said Fox Sports, the Big 10&#x27;s main broadcast partner, made the decision. They had the chance to add <i>Stanford</i> and <i>Cal</i> to their academic association, and said no - if you restrict yourself to universities which compete in major college sports, you will never get a better opportunity.<p>For generations, college football avoided this absurdity. Long ago, maybe eight years ago, there was a crazy notion of people working together, cooperating for a greater good. Why do that? Because it was good, and because they could accomplish more by working together than by acting in anarchy. People now embrace law-of-the-jungle anarchy like it&#x27;s a rebellious trend, instead of just well-established idiocy. The NCAA members could work together to make it better; they could arrange conferences so that they work for everyone, without students flying across the country; but what was the norm for generations is now so obviously absurd that people roll their eyes at me.</div><br/><div id="38937328" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38937328" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ehnto</span><span>|</span><a href="#38936843">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38937168">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38937328">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38937328">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a thought, faith has been lost in institutions, and society in general, and rightly so in many respects.

If Vanderbilt loses out on a grant that goes to a less appropriate research group at Nebraska simply because Vanderbilt is in the SEC while Nebraska is in the Big Ten, does that best serve the taxpayers funding the research?

So far, he&#x27;s experienced much of what you called out. But, they have held him to a far higher academic standard than I expected.<p>He went to junior college first. After his first year, his current university brought him to campus a few times for recruiting purposes, but they didn&#x27;t end up making him an offer because of his grades. A year later, his grades were up, and he got an offer from that university.<p>At this university, bad grades will cause you to be dropped from the team and lose your scholarship, no matter how big a star you are. They drill this into the players and make it clear that they owe it to their teammates to keep their grades up. I didn&#x27;t expect that, and I assume it&#x27;s far from universal at this level, but I&#x27;m glad to see it.<p>It&#x27;s also a great opportunity for my nephew. He and his parents don&#x27;t have the resources for an education of this caliber (his parents are both teachers), but he is getting it because of football. And he&#x27;s getting much more active support in that education (through things like the tutoring mentioned above). He&#x27;d love to play professionally. Now that he&#x27;s the wise old age of 20, he understands how low the odds are, and he&#x27;s making sure he gets an education that will lead to opportunities for a good non-athletic career. Not all of his teammates have that clarity, but he says a lot of them do. One of his teammates graduated before his football eligibility was used up, so he&#x27;s now getting a master’s degree.<p>You can argue that it&#x27;s not fair that football players get so many more resources thrown at them. But at this level, they are a huge source of funding for the university. Through things I&#x27;ve heard from his coaches (I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to meet the head coach, the offensive coordinator, and a few others), my <i>guess</i> is that the university brings in somewhere in the neighborhood of $100M&#x2F;year from football and spends something like 30% of that on football and support for the players. That 30% is seen as protecting the rest of the $100M (if the team doesn&#x27;t do well, that money is at risk). These numbers are for a university that is not a perennial top 20 team, so I&#x27;m sure the numbers can be significantly higher for the top football programs.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38937559" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38937559" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">disposition2</span><span>|</span><a href="#38927323">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38936848">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38937628">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38937124">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38937559">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38937559">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Maybe OP, despite the article being about college football, was considering how the realignment might affect athletes in other sports?<p>For college football, it’s only ~12 games a season and they typically are played at or near the weekend.

I wanted to understand why IT incompetence still could exist to this degree in this day and age after all the knowledge the world had developed about good IT and software practices over decades of experience. Of course, I quickly found out that IS research had already figured most of this out, and that perhaps, people were just people and crappy organizations were just crappy organizations, and perhaps that&#x27;s something that will never change because bell curve distributions exist for almost everything.<p>If all people could be selfless, humble, intelligent, competent at everything they ever try to do, AND be people of integrity, I&#x27;m sure many of the world&#x27;s problems would disappear, in addition to just IT problems. People suck, organizations suck, societies suck, and we all suck in our own way. I think organizational research like I&#x27;m trying to do still tries to point us towards a better path nevertheless, but sometimes it&#x27;s a throw your hands in the air thing. Some people will never care.<p>Needless to say, I&#x27;m no longer focused on researching this topic, as it seems really well-researched already. But it&#x27;s still interesting to see that this particular example still pops up in a news report now and then. There are still plenty of other big examples that pop up every year, but this one seems to have staying power to stay in the news media.</div><br/><div id="39010484" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39010484" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chii</span><span>|</span><a href="#39010273">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39010547">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39010484">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39010484">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I quickly found out that IS research had already figured most of this out
&gt;  People suck, organizations suck, societies suck<p>and yet you don&#x27;t see very many buildings collapse, bridges fail, and damns flood down valley. The idea is that there should be liability assigned to important systems, for which this liability makes the onus on the creator&#x2F;owner to build in safe guards, checks or other protections to prevent disasters.<p>Why this isn&#x27;t applied to software engineering is a whole nother story, but i think it probably should.

Furthermore, software is inconsistent in how it works, and this trains people to think that software is just naturally glitchy, but the glitches aren&#x27;t a big deal.

Obviously, this isn&#x27;t what a proper software guy will think, the proper software guy knows that things are a bit more complex than that. But this is what the software guy communicates to non-technical people.

That&#x27;s counting from the difference engine that Babbage never finished building, and if we are talking about the first modern computer that does contribute significantly in a way, that&#x27;s around the time ENVAC and Z3 appeared, just around 80 years.<p>Structural Engineering existed for over 2000 years. With that comes with a lot of people died in natural disasters and advancing material science to improve structural integrity. But even the Japanese to this day still can&#x27;t solve the earthquake and the problems the fallout makes.<p>&gt; Why this isn&#x27;t applied to software engineering is a whole nother story<p>I actually think it is. That&#x27;s why real-time operating system and mission-critical hardware exists for human to fly in the air and explore the space, not counting a lot of time-sensitive industry robotics software that controls the actuators in real time as well.<p>That said, the strict requirements of real-time programming requires a lot of expertise such as CPU cycle counting, CPU slack reduction, timing requirements and choice of algorithm (such as EDF scheduling and real time memory allocators like TLSF, and you won&#x27;t see jemalloc on embedded devices, right?), stack or heap memory allocation which also complicates the programming stuff, because removing malloc might free you from OOM but this means a lot of functions needs to accept extra parameters to state the output location, and that means a lot of normal software can&#x27;t be used. (You can go for a hybrid approach by using arena allocation, but that still isn&#x27;t a perfect solution)<p>As you see, even for soft real time engineering (which I actually mentioned so far, I don&#x27;t know much about the real hardcore &quot;hard real time engineering&quot; though), the sheer complexity here already, means there&#x27;s a lot of design decisions which simply just makes people stay away and just go for normal software engineering (but in the end, if everything is predicable its fine).<p>&gt; Move fast and break things is not something i wanted to hear tbh.<p>When Zuckerberg said that, he&#x27;s referring to his startup mindset when Facebook was really just a startup in his day. In a highly competitive market environment, startups has to fight desperately for their own survival, even with lots of fundings and VC rounds.<p>Startup can move very fast and their agility is the only weapon against the old dogs.

Each professional community has their own knowledge and best practices, but these don&#x27;t generalize well to other professions. So you have boundary spanners who can bridge two professional communities by being good at both, but those types of experts are rare. Also, the amount of experience and learning required to become an expert in two professional communities, rather than just one, requires such a large amount of time that most people can&#x27;t be bothered to put in the effort.<p>It&#x27;s enough work to do one&#x27;s own job well already. The go getters can of course do it as a natural course of action, but they are outliers. There are a limited number of job opportunities that require developing this experience on the job, so there are limited opportunities to become a good boundary spanner in the first place. Furthermore, people aren&#x27;t naturally interested in multiple disparate subjects. True renaissance folks like Leonardo da Vinci who are interested in becoming experts in both art and engineering are rare. Elon Musk types that will try to dive deep into multiple unrelated areas are rare. All of this adds up to boundary spanners being rare. As such, leaders who can develop cultures that handle multiple areas simultaneously (see the founders of Flexport who understand both tech and shipping logistics) are rare.<p>In short, expertise is hard to develop, expertise in multiple areas is rare, and coordination between two areas that understand different worlds is difficult without boundary spanners. As a result, you get failures. See any software engineer who creates a startup to try to revolutionize some old-school industry and then fails dramatically because they don&#x27;t understand the problems that actually need to be solved. The outliers will figure it out, but not everyone can become an outlier due to reasons discussed, among other reasons.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39010328" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39010328" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">IronWolve</span><span>|</span><a href="#39010273">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39010404">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39010554">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39010328">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39010328">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I did a quick look around for some blogs about this early paper to digital transaction register migration, I didn&#x27;t see much for such a major case.<p>Just a few basic things that wasn&#x27;t included, no audit&#x2F;transaction logs, transactions modified by tech support to keep the system running.<p>Operators couldn&#x27;t prove they didn&#x27;t steal funds, and the british law that computers systems are to be trusted as fact, pretty much convicted them all.</div><br/><div id="39010535" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39010535" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">imtringued</span><span>|</span><a href="#39010273">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39010328">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39010554">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39010535">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39010535">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This isn&#x27;t a software error and it is pretty clear.<p>There are two problems here.

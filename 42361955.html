But Pat acknowledged Intel’s problems - something Otellini, Krzanich, and Swan never did. These CEOs, all non-technical, focused on dividends, buybacks, and next-quarter results while Intel fell behind in advanced nodes and innovation.<p>Gelsinger inherited a disaster: 10nm delays, TSMC pulling ahead, and no GPU strategy. He had the courage to cut buybacks and slashed dividends. He poured billions into fabs in Arizona, Ohio, Germany, and Ireland. He delivered Intel 18A, powered on first silicon, released PDK 1.0 for Microsoft, and secured Microsoft and Amazon as customers. There were even rumors Apple might join.<p>Contrast this with Nadella at Microsoft back in 2014. He didn’t reboot the company by tearing everything down. Instead, he built on Ballmer-era wins like Azure, Office 365 while shifting Microsoft’s focus to the cloud. Gelsinger had to start from scratch in many ways, tackling years of neglect while facing harsher challenges.<p>Yes, Intel’s stock dropped $150 billion, but Gelsinger was upfront - it wouldn’t turn around before 2025. He was trained by Gordon Moore and Andy Grove, and while some saw him as arrogant, that confidence came from decades of technical leadership.<p>The real issue? The board.

But people tend to forget how rapidly this happened.  Even as late as the semi-aborted 2018 launch of Cannon Lake it seemed like it was just a routine burp they&#x27;d correct with a process respin.  Then TSMC quietly reached parity with 7nm, shipped 5nm which was a better process, and by 2021 Apple had jumped ship and Intel was falling behind even AMD.<p>The disaster happened <i>fast</i>.

It was a desperate move to avoid shareholder lawsuits and possible criminal prosecution. Intel <i>had</i> to ship <i>something</i> under the 10nm label before the end of the year, because they had made far too many (false) promises that 10nm would be working Soon. Cannonlake was a mostly-broken chip because their 10nm process <i>did not work</i>, and Intel never even tried to make significant revenue from it or ramp it to volume production (though they kept promising for months that they <i>were</i> going to ramp). And it was still two years late.<p>Meanwhile, Intel&#x27;s chip designers kept targeting an unusable process, and wasted <i>years</i> that they should have been iterating on designs for the fab process that <i>actually worked</i>. <i>Skylake</i> shipped in 2015. They didn&#x27;t deliver a new CPU microarchitecture on 14nm until 5.5 <i>years</i> later, a year and a half after they shipped that same microarchitecture in a mobile-only form when their 10nm finally started to be somewhat usable (but not fast enough for desktop).<p>What were the chip designers <i>doing</i> for all those years? In 2015, Intel knew that 14nm had been harder to bring up than any previous fab process, and they knew that 10nm was proving <i>even harder</i>, but they refused to try making an updated CPU design for 14nm. How could the management not have realized that spending <i>multiple consecutive years</i> not shipping new designs would cause long-term damage to their capability to iterate on CPU designs? Not participating in the feedback loop of <i>actually shipping</i> left Intel with an oversized P-core design and an E-core design that wasn&#x27;t well-matched to it, making <i>Alder Lake</i> awkward and slapdash when they finally got 10nm working well enough for desktop CPUs.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42363873" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42363873" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sangnoir</span><span>|</span><a href="#42362565">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42363094">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42363285">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42363806">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42363873">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42363873">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; ...Intel was falling behind even AMD<p>The &quot;even&quot; makes the tone of your comment feel a tiny bit disrespectful towards AMD.

Intel has had a crazy amount of time to restructure and refocus when we consider how long their x86 intellectual property lead kept them afloat with their subpar fabrication and delayed manufacturing process updates. They spent many years having faster chips than anyone else despite having subpar fabrication. But now, they can&#x27;t really escape the fact that ARM is exploding and AMD has the most flexible x86 platform where as each year goes by the number of use cases where Intel is the best choice diminishes.<p>If you play games, the x3D chips are basically the only sensible choice. If you are looking for servers, AMD is consistently 10% cheaper in all the cloud platforms. If you want a mobile system, anything involving ARM and&#x2F;or TSMC will get you better battery life.<p>The fact that fabless players in the market like AMD and Apple can outpace Intel in so many product lines is, frankly, embarrassing. While I think that other processor design shops selling off fabrication divisions made sense, I think that Intel as a company basically makes no sense if they can&#x27;t get their fabrication shit together.

So Intel is paying more per chip than they would if they just spun off the fab. If they did that, they could have higher margins&#x2F;lower prices.<p>But if you spin off the fab, can they actually get enough business to be able to survive? They’re not on the leading process.

The memory latency and branch penalty are just too high for anything where the sequence of operations isn’t highly predictable and repeated for a large number of items.

In reality, his tenure was filled with disasters and not much measureable upside:<p>1) while expected, the process node issues haven&#x27;t been resolved. Instead Intel had to rely on TSMC to push out a semi-competive mobile platform. 18a and other processes have been delayed and 20a outright cancelled under the guise of rapid 18a progress (how rapid can the progress be, when 18a was just delayed again?). And this is just what we know externally, the board must have much better info anyway. A far cry from the promised &quot;5 nodes in 4 years&quot; and more than remeniscent of the situation in the decade+ before.<p>2) Pat single handedly directly harmed Intel&#x27;s bottom line on almost day 1 by trash talking Taiwan and partner TSMC (which was supposed to be their lifeline to gain access to competitive process nodes) in a tactless attempt to attract US government support. This resulted in TSMC cancelling the massive ~40% wafer discount for Intel&#x27;s chips.<p>3) in line with his Larabee lineage, Pat invested significant resources into Gaudi AI accelerators and Arc discrete GPUs. Both uncompetitive, released borderline unusable with pathetic software support and on the verge of cancellation from day 1, which killed what little enthusiasm they might attract. Even the much smaller (employee # wise) AMD has been able to push out serviceable AI&#x2F;GPU software and competitive DC cards for training and has been riding the AI wave on Nvidia&#x27;s coattails; Intel just looks completely lost.<p>4) arrow lake, released years into his tenure, is characteristaly delayed, overpriced and uncompetitive. Software issues pushed the needle for the launch towards disaster.<p>5) raptor lake instability&#x2F;degradation scandal and months long lies and embarrassing messaging from Intel&#x27;s side making people literally avoid buying Intel CPUs<p>6) Epyc Turin just annihilated the most recent Xeon gen, making Intel further uncompetitive for DC&#x2F;HPC on the CPU side for at least another year, but probably more.<p>7) lack of any timely decisive and proactive moves which Intel desperately needs. I can&#x27;t identify a single area where Pat pushed hard and fought against the inertia. He might&#x27;ve been more honest about Intel&#x27;s financial woes (through his unnecessary constant presence on business news channels), but if the situation was so bad, why did he do nothing but complain? Why did it take so long for him to cut the dividend or lay people off? If he cut the dividend on day 1 and made Arc his Manhattan project, he would be much more palatable, even if the project missed the AI wave. Instead, he seemed to spend time clamoring for political attention while projecting the exact image of Intel in 2010s: excuses, delays, and underwhelming products.<p>In totality, whatever Pat&#x27;s been doing hasn&#x27;t resulted in any real, tangible results. If anything, Intel&#x27;s disasters have accelerated in frequency and scale under his helm and they&#x27;ve been losing ground at an accelerated rate everywhere, possible unrecoverably (mobile, graphics, desktop, DC&#x2F;HPC). 
Of course, turning Intel around is a massive undertaking and as always, there have been glimpses of promise and innovation. But it doesn&#x27;t feel fair to cherry pick the rare positives from the sea of negatives and assign them to Pat. Still, it&#x27;s completely possible that the results of his work were just not seen yet and he should&#x27;ve been given more time - at this point, we&#x27;ll never know.</div><br/><div id="42363560" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42363560" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">computerdork</span><span>|</span><a href="#42363207">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42363673">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42363560">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42363560">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Think you&#x27;re not wrong about these, but think this was the price of 5 nodes in 4 years (these stepping stone nodes are going to be pretty shaky).

It&#x27;s never too late, but at this point this would be financially risky and would require an enormous resource investment concentrated on both gaming and compute, while possibly never paying off. As you mention, AMD is struggling against Nvidia too, and their GPU tech is solid. A viable strategy for Intel would probably require selling at cost or even at a loss, while offering significantly better specs (more VRAM than competition seems like a viable path right now, but the AI bubble might not last).<p>However, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see the whole Arc effort killed off before another year passes, in line with Intel&#x27;s absolute inability to stay committed to a product line. There&#x27;s probably a reason why discrete Arc only appeared once Pat was in charge and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see it gone with his departure.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

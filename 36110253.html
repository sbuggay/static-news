You don&#x27;t seem to understand what a container is, or what a sandbox is.<p>The reason to deploy software as a container image (instead of a standalone binary) is that a container image contains a full chroot, including auxiliary files that aren&#x27;t embedded into the main binary.

It&#x27;s ... rough. The impression I get (as an uninvolved third-party) is that the WASI folks set out with a goal of writing a sort of capability-based POSIX that they could write a thin libc for, but partway through realized that POSIX embeds a lot of assumptions that aren&#x27;t compatible with portability or capability-based security.<p>IMO (again, no direct involvement) a better approach would be to start with a low-level API that is capability-based from the beginning. Something like EFI, or (more experimentally) an RPC-oriented syscall API resembling Fuchsia&#x2F;Plan9. Then the various sorts of magic integers and process state found in POSIX can be layered on top of that as a library.<p>The good news is that the people working on WASI do seem aware of what they&#x27;ve gotten themselves into, and I think a lot of the chaos (shifting repos, broken docs, etc) is just the natural outcome of them exploring the solution space. My <i>expectation</i> is that they&#x27;ll be forced to drift pretty far from POSIX if they want a workable design, but maybe they&#x27;ll surprise us.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36111169" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36111169" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rektide</span><span>|</span><a href="#36110796">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36110966">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36110842">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36111169">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36111169">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Things don&#x27;t have to be the same to compare &amp; contrast.

There were entire frameworks built around this &quot;process per request&quot; model, with various optimizations like pre-warming (start the process, connect to db, wait for request on stdin) and variant protocols (SCGI).<p>Any time you have an execution model based on running a single address space per request, it&#x27;s fundamentally CGI-ish. It doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the implementation language. The limitation of CGI is that state can&#x27;t be persisted in-process between requests.<p>---<p>Going back to the thread, there&#x27;s multiple aspects when thinking about the structure of a hosted service:<p>1. Whether state is shared between requests (CGI vs long-lived process).<p>2. Whether the binary is native code (x86&#x2F;ARM&#x2F;) or bytecode (WASM&#x2F;JVM&#x2F;).<p>3. Whether the binary is standalone or comes with additional files.<p>4. If it needs additional files, whether it&#x27;s distributed as a package (apt&#x2F;rpm) or chroot (container image).<p>Does breaking those different concepts down into a list help? You can see that trying to compare the performance of &quot;WASM deployed as standalone binary with CGI execution model&quot; and &quot;native code deployed in container image&quot; just isn&#x27;t meaningful. The article is mixing up too many different ideas when trying to benchmark.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36111457" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36111457" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kitd</span><span>|</span><a href="#36110796">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36110842">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36110894">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36110856">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36111457">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36111457">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Indeed<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krustlet.dev&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krustlet.dev&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36110856" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36110856" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pjmlp</span><span>|</span><a href="#36110796">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36110842">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36111457">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36111567">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36110856">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36110856">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah, re-inventing application servers, badly.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36111567" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36111567" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ridruejo</span><span>|</span><a href="#36110796">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36110842">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36110850">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36111567">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36111567">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Nobody is deploying large-scale services on top of what would be essentially the CGI model.&quot;  Yes, they are.

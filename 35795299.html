So everyone has pretty much the same cost basis in long established industries like food.<p>There is simply no incentive for these corporations to start a price war; they all know starting one will only result in a very brief competitive advantage until everyone returns to baseline profits.<p>Funnily enough, a lot of recent reductions in cost basis in &quot;innovative&quot; startups is not done through optimization; it is done through VC speculating on their competitor finding a more permanent place in a (supposedly) new market after consolidation and prices adjust back to reality.

And media (among many other industries) has been permitted to consolidate to ridiculous levels that would have been unimaginable to the architects of early-mid 20th century antitrust laws even on a practical level -- an Amazon-level entity would have been literally impossible to envision in the early 20th century because companies just practically couldn&#x27;t get that big with manual technologies.<p>The largest US company in 1929 had revenues of about $1.5bn - roughly $30bn in 2023 dollars, which wouldn&#x27;t even put it in the Fortune 100 today.

But another is that people have stopped <i>believing</i> the former.<p>Suppose there is a market with an existing duopoly that charges high prices and you&#x27;re a rich investor who likes to make money. Popular theory says that you shouldn&#x27;t enter that market because they&#x27;ll just undercut you until you go out of business and then go back to charging high prices.<p>But how does that work? Once you&#x27;ve invested the money to enter the market, you&#x27;re committed. The incumbents have to deal with that. If you charge slightly less than they do, they have four options. One is to ignore you and keep doing what they were doing, which would allow you to take a disproportionate share of the market. Another is to match your price. But then you still get a third of the market where you previously had none and you now have goodwill with customers because you finally caused the market price to move in the direction they like, so that&#x27;s quite profitable for you. The third is to buy you out, which is you turning a profit again.<p>The last is to undercut you and launch a price war. But by then you&#x27;ve already paid to build the infrastructure needed to compete with them. It exists. Even if you were to give up, you would still have that infrastructure to sell to anyone who wanted to give it a go. And if the expectation is that prices would return to profitable levels at any point in the foreseeable future, there would be returns in doing that for anyone with money to invest. Which mitigates your risk. And means the incumbents can&#x27;t eliminate the competition by doing this. They can only torpedo their own profitability. Their real options are to lose some of their market share to you or buy you out, both of which are profitable to you.<p>So who taught investors that doing this is not profitable?</div><br/><div id="35799440" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35799440" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">navane</span><span>|</span><a href="#35795906">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35798786">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35799103">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35799440">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35799440">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">it is only profitable if you are a big corp who made his money elsewhere, a significant amount of money compared to the money in the market you&#x27;re trying to enter.<p>We&#x27;ve always known that a big guy can come into a small guys party and squish them all.

And the more fiscal stimulus that went out, the more stocks went up.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35796402" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35796402" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">argentinian</span><span>|</span><a href="#35796089">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35796635">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35796829">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35796402">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35796402">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Good, they are following Argentina&#x27;s politicians&#x27; recipe to the letter.<p>Here in Argentina we even have politicians that affirm &quot;Saying that printing money causes inflation it totally false&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pagina12.com.ar&#x2F;diario&#x2F;economia&#x2F;2-190369-2012-03-25.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pagina12.com.ar&#x2F;diario&#x2F;economia&#x2F;2-190369-2012-03...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35796829" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35796829" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">brianjking</span><span>|</span><a href="#35796089">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35798470">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35796829">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35796829">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It is 100% corporate profits, lol.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35798470" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35798470" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">frankreyes</span><span>|</span><a href="#35796829">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35796681">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35798470">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35798470">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Because companies have to raise prices to the point of replacement.

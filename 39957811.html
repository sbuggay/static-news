Unemployment is super low and tradesmen are completely booked.<p>Unemployment is a measure of labor market efficiency. We have computers now so anybody who needs work can apply to jobs over the internet or install an app and do gig work. The only times in this century that the unemployment rate has exceeded 6% were immediately after the housing crisis and a few months during COVID.<p>But labor market efficiency tells you nothing about how hard it is to find someone to hire. You don&#x27;t have to find someone without a job, all you have to do is pay more than driving for Uber does.<p>&gt; Many skilled tradesmen require licensing that takes years to acquire and can not be brought online quickly. Others are unionized that restrict membership.<p>These are the regulatory barriers, and there are obvious ways to bring capacity online faster. Example: Give a license to anyone who can pass a written exam, then eliminate the testing&#x2F;licensing fees and give away free study materials.<p>Here&#x27;s a big one for free: Stop charging for renewals, so older tradesmen can &quot;retire&quot; (i.e. stop working full time) without making it prohibitively burdensome or expensive to retain their license and work part-time.<p>&gt; And then there’s materials. Did you see what happened to costs with an uptick in the demand&#x2F;supply balance during Covid? It’s not so easy to just suddenly increase supply to suit demand on many materials as the inputs come from natural sources that are limited.<p>Short-term demand shocks are exactly that. It takes time to increase production capacity, but that takes a year give or take depending on the industry, and then output continues at the higher level indefinitely.<p>There are no practical natural limits on raw materials. You reopen some marginal iron mines. The park service buys some agricultural land to convert into forest while selling some forest land to be logged and converted to agriculture, creating immediate lumber availability. Wood, plastic and aluminum can be substituted for each other in various use cases depending on availability.<p>&gt; Lastly the people that own the land wound rather build valuable things on it than housing for poors.<p>Housing is the valuable thing they&#x27;re prohibited from building on it. The existing problem is that there is too much land zoned only for single-family homes. A piece of land with one single-family home isn&#x27;t as valuable as the same piece of land with a 10 story building providing 80 housing units.<p>&gt; For most of history a lot of people had rather modest living conditions. Very small spaces with limited services.<p>This is literally the thing that people are prohibited from building. Prices would go down significantly if it wasn&#x27;t because there are plenty of people who would pay a lower price for a smaller space, except that building 10 times as many units on the same lot is prohibited by zoning, and if you can only build one unit on a lot then it&#x27;s going to be a full-sized house and not a studio.</div><br/><div id="39959134" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39959134" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nemo44x</span><span>|</span><a href="#39958485">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39959039">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39959027">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39959134">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39959134">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You just need a dictator instead of this pesky democracy where the people that make up a constituency get to decide how they want to live.<p>Even still, as you’ve pointed out there’s a lot of other things that would need to change.

We have made pretty much everything else than housing cheap.

As a result, people have to move elsewhere (since the jobs will also disappear with the economy), driving housing prices up there. There is a feedback loop between housing prices and overall economic activity and people have to live in places with at least some sort of functioning economy, and thus all of the world gets partitioned into parts with cheap housing and no jobs and expensive housing with jobs.</div><br/><div id="39959333" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39959333" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">surfingdino</span><span>|</span><a href="#39959250">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39959259">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39959333">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39959333">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hard to disagree.

Yes, there are cheaper places, but there are no jobs there or employers who notice you live there offer you substantially less money. People gravitate towards London and other large cities and he property prices follow. But there is a cruel twist to that story. In terms of income, London-based IT salaries and contract rates have gone back and below 2010 low levels. At least that&#x27;s what I see on LinkedIn and in my inbox. The property prices did not adjust and even worse, the quality of newbuilds has gone through the floor (often literally) further exacerbating housing shortage.

They use that exact sentence to determine your monthly payment. Lower interest rates mean you can borrow more for a given payment. Then they tell you how much you can borrow. Everyone involved - banker, agents, seller, neighbors - wants you to spend as much as possible. Even if you don&#x27;t, prices are set by &quot;the market&quot; where people do.

There are maybe a handful of metropolitan areas&#x2F;megapolis in the US where the majority of americans could live and feel welcome. Land and building costs are probably cheaper in Idaho or rural Ohio but it may not be safe for anyone who can&#x27;t assimilate to the goings ons if those areas. That can be said much of rural US. That&#x27;s why not many remote workers relocate to cheaper and prettier places in the US.<p>I am however a huge proponent of high speed rail connecting remote suburbs with city centers. Building new housing on unincorporated land and connecting it via high speed rail that is. Imagine suburbs in NE california or south of Reno,NV (or much of south central NV) to LA and SF. Or Denver with western colorado. Point is, much of the US is not developed. People would want to live in rural areas if it meant easy and fast access to cities.

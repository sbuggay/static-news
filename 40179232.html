With LLMs we are discovering (amazing) capabilities and the limits of language models. While language models can do incredible things with language that humans can&#x27;t, they still can&#x27;t do something simple like sudoku. But there are neural networks, CNNs and RNNs that can solve sudoku better than humans can. I think that the thing to learn here is that some problems are in the domain of language models, and some problems are a better fit for other forms of cognition. The human brain is amazing in that it combines several forms of cognition in an integrated way.<p>One thing that I think LLMs have the capability to do is to integrate several types of systems and to choose the right one to solve a problem. Teach an LLM how to interface with a CNN that solves sudoku problems, and then ask it a sudoku problem.<p>It seems to me that if we want to create an AGI, we need to learn how to integrate several different types of models, and teach them how to distribute the tasks we give them to the correct models.</div><br/><div id="40187029" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40187029" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">keefle</span><span>|</span><a href="#40185761">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40186120">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40187029">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40187029">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But even without going this far (with integrating various other specialized or having an LLM use them when required), an LLM is probably able to recognize a sudoku puzzle when it sees one, and even tho it itself can&#x27;t solve it, I think it can easily write the code that would solve sudoku.

As a model of computation, attention is very rigid, whereas human brains are always undergoing synaptic plasticity.

You might think &quot;but what about Chess!&quot; - except Chess is encoded extremely often as a 1D stream of tokens to notate games, and bound to be highly represented in LLMs&#x27; training sets. Wordle and cellular automata are not often, if ever, encoded as 1D streams of tokens - it&#x27;s not something an LLM would be experienced with even if they had a reasonable &quot;understanding&quot; of the concepts.

We have &quot;reasoning machines&quot; that are intelligent but seem to be hitting fundamental limits we don&#x27;t understand.&quot;<p>One thing an LLM _also_ doesn&#x27;t bring to the table is an opinion. We can push it in that direction by giving it a role (&quot;you are an expert developer&quot; etc), but it&#x27;s a bit weak.<p>If you give an LLM an easy task with minimal instructions it will do the task in the most conventional, common sense fashion. And why shouldn&#x27;t it? It has no opinion, your prompt doesn&#x27;t give it an opinion, so it just does the most normal-seeming thing. If you want it to solve the task in any other way then you have to tell it to do so.<p>I think a hard task is similar. If you don&#x27;t tell the LLM _how_ to solve the hard task then it will try to approach it in the most conventional, common sense way. Instead of just boring results for a hard task the result is often failure. But hard problems approached with conventional common sense will often result in failures! Giving the LLM a thought process to follow is a quick education on how to solve the problem.<p>Maybe we just need to train the LLM on more problem solving? And maybe LLMs worked better when they were initially trained on code for exactly that reason, it&#x27;s a much larger corpus of task-solving examples than is available elsewhere. That is, maybe we don&#x27;t talk often enough and clearly enough about how to solve natural language problems in order for the models to really learn those techniques.<p>Also, as the author talks about in the article with respect to agents, the inability to rewind responses may keep the LLM from addressing problems in the ways humans do, but that can also be addressed with agents or multi-prompt approaches. These approaches don&#x27;t seem that impressive in practice right now, but maybe we just need to figure it out (and maybe with better training the models themselves will be better at handling these recursive calls).</div><br/><div id="40184862" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40184862" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">int_19h</span><span>|</span><a href="#40179731">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40184262">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40184536">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40184862">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40184862">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">LLMs absolutely do have opinions. Take a large enough base model and have it chat without a system prompt, and it will have an opinion on most things - unless this was specifically trained out of it through RLHF, as is the case for all commonly used chatbots.<p>And yes, of course, that opinion is going to be the &quot;average&quot; of what their training data is, but why is that a surprise? Humans don&#x27;t come with innate opinions, either - the ones that we end up having are shaped by our upbringing, both the broad cultural aspects of it and specific personal experiences. To the extent an LLM has either, it&#x27;s the training process, so of course that shapes the opinions it will exhibit when not prompted to do anything else.<p>Now the fact that you can &quot;override&quot; this default persona of any LLM so trivially by prompting it is IMO stronger evidence that it&#x27;s not really an identity. But that, I think, is also a function of their training - after all, that training basically consists of completing a bunch of text representing many very different opinions. In a very real sense, we&#x27;re training models to assume that opinions are fungible. But if you take a model and train it specifically on  e.g. writings of some philosophical school, and it will internalize those.</div><br/><div id="40185371" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40185371" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">krainboltgreene</span><span>|</span><a href="#40179731">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40184862">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40184536">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40185371">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40185371">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I am extremely alarmed by the number of HN commenters who apparently confuse &quot;is able to generate text that looks like&quot; and &quot;has a&quot;, you guys are going crazy with this anthropomorphization of a token predictor.

Most people I know would flunk most of the benchmarks we use to evaluate LLMs. Not just a little bit but more like completely and utterly and embarrassingly so. It&#x27;s not even close; or fair. People are surprisingly alright at a narrow set of problems. Particularly when it doesn&#x27;t involve knowledge. Most people also suck at reasoning (unless they had years of training), they suck at factual knowledge, they aren&#x27;t half bad at visual and spatial reasoning, and fairly gullible otherwise.<p>Anyway, this list looks more like a &quot;hold my beer&quot; moment for AI researchers than any fundamental objections for AIs to stop evolving any further. Sure there are weaknesses, and paths to address those. Anyone claiming that this is the end of the road in terms of progress is going to be in for some disappointing reality check probably a lot sooner than is comfortable.<p>And of course by narrowing it to just LLMs, the authors have a bit of an escape hatch because they conveniently exclude any further architectures, alternate strategies, improvements, that might otherwise overcome the identified current weaknesses. But that&#x27;s an artificial constraint that has no real world value; because of course AI researchers are already looking beyond the current state of the art.

Just because something is highly persistent doesn&#x27;t mean it will &quot;converge&quot; on a correct outcome.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40179638" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40179638" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">3abiton</span><span>|</span><a href="#40185740">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40185543">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40179638">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40179638">[14 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The article should be titled &quot; What can LLM never do, yet&quot;.

We would need to add some kind of advanced recursive structure to large language models, as well as some kind of short-term and working memory, as well as probably many other structures, to make them capable of the kind of metacognition necessary to properly do a lot of the things people want them to be able to do. Without metacognition, the ability to analyze what one is currently thinking and think new things based on that analysis, and therefore to look at what one is thinking and error correct it, consciously adjust it or iterate on it, or consciously ensure that one is adhering to certain principles of reasoning or knowledge, we can&#x27;t expect large language models to be able to actually understand Concepts and principles and how they are applicable and reliably perform reasoning or even obey instructions.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40179945" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40179945" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hackinthebochs</span><span>|</span><a href="#40179638">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40179875">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40184546">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40179914">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40179945">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40179945">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;will not change it from being a language model into something else,<p>This is a pretty empty claim when we don&#x27;t know what the limits of language modelling are.

I&#x27;m not saying that there are things that <i>AI</i> models will never be able to do, I&#x27;m saying that there are things that Large <i>Language</i> Models will be unable to do.<p>Training LLMs is often argued to be analogous to human learning, most often as a defence against claims of copyright infringement by arguing that human creativity is also based on training from copyrighted materials. However, that is a red herring.<p>The responses from ever more powerful LLMs are indeed impressive, and beyond what an overwhelming majority of us believed possible just 5 years ago. They are nearing and sometimes surpassing the performance of educated humans in certain areas, so how come I can argue they are limited? Consider it from the other side: how come an educated human can create something as good as an LLM can when said human&#x27;s brain has been &quot;trained&quot; on an infinitesimal fraction of the material which was used to train even the 1st release of ChatGPT?<p>That is because LLMs do not learn nor reason like humans: they do not have opinions, do not have intentions, do not have doubts, do not have curiosity, do not have values, do not have a model of mind â they have tokens and probabilities.<p>For an AI model to be able to do certain things that humans can do it needs to have many of those human characteristics that allow us to do impressive mental feats having absorbed barely any training material (compared to LLMs) and being virtually unable to even remember most of it, let alone verbatim. Such an AI model is surely possible, but it needs a completely different paradigm from straightforward LLMs. That&#x27;s not to say however that a Language Model will almost certainly be an necessary module of such an AI, but it will not be sufficient.</div><br/><div id="40181348" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40181348" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mewpmewp2</span><span>|</span><a href="#40179638">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40179914">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40179739">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40181348">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40181348">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think values, opinions or things like that are needed at all.

Then we subsequently pay the bills for those services. Which amounts to thousands of small invoices having to be paid by a municipality each month. An example of this could be payments for a dentist visit, transportation and similar. Most of these are relatively small in size, and we&#x27;ve long since automated the payments of anything below a certain amount through automation. Systems which are faster and less error prone as far as putting valid data everywhere goes. They are more prone to decision making errors, however, and while fraud isn&#x27;t an issue, sometimes citizens have invoices approved that they aren&#x27;t entitled to. Since it&#x27;s less costly to just roll with those mistakes than to try and fix them, it&#x27;s an accepted loss.<p>The systems are hugely successful and popular, and this naturally leads to a massive interest in LLM&#x27;s as the next step. They are incredibly tools, but they are based on probability and while they&#x27;re lucky enough to be useful for almost everything. Decision making probably shouldn&#x27;t be one of them. Similarly ML is incredibly helpful in things like cancer detection , but we&#x27;ve already had issues where they got things wrong and because MBA&#x27;s don&#x27;t really know how they work, they were used as a replacement instead of an enhancement for the human factor. I&#x27;m fairly certain we&#x27;re going to use LLM&#x27;s for a lot of things where we shouldn&#x27;t, and probably never should. I&#x27;m not sure we can avoid it, but I wouldn&#x27;t personally trust them to do any sort of function which will have a big influence on peoples lives. I use both Co-pilot and OpenAI&#x27;s tools extensively, but I can still prompt them with the same thing and get extremely different quality outputs, and while this will improve, and while it&#x27;s very to get an output that&#x27;s actually useful, it&#x27;s still a major issue that might never get solved well enough for what we&#x27;re going to ask of the models way before they are ready.<p>I hope we&#x27;re going to be clever enough to only use them as enhancement tools in the vital public sector, but I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;re going to use them in areas like education.

I think deep learning should not be confused with deep RL. LLMs are autoregressive models which means that they are trained to predict the next token and that is all they do. The next token is not necessarily the most reasonable (this is why datasets are super important for better performance). Deep RL models on the other hand, seem to be excellent at agency and decision making (although in restricted environment), because they are trained to do so.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Attention_(machine_learning)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Attention_(machine_learning)</a></div><br/><div id="40179939" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40179939" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">visarga</span><span>|</span><a href="#40179913">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40184077">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40179939">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40179939">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">LLMs are fine-tuned with RL too. They are NOT simply next token predictors. RLHF uses whole answers at once to generate gradients, so it is looking further into the future. This might not be perfect but it is clearly more than focusing just 1 token ahead.<p>In the future the RL part of LLM training will increase a lot. Why am I saying this? There are two sources for learning - the past and the present. Training on human text is using past data, that is off-policy. But training on interactive data is on-policy. There is nothing we know that doesn&#x27;t come from the environment. What is not written in any books must be learned from outside.<p>That is why I think supervised pre-training from human text is just half the story and RL based agent learning, interactivity in other words, is the next step. The two feed on which intelligence stands are language (past experience) and environment (present experience). We can&#x27;t get ahead without both of them.<p>AlphaZero showed what an agent can learn from an environment alone, and LLMs show what they can learn from humans.

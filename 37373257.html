In countries with good democracy, e.g. USA[^1], it sometimes happens that the population divides evenly between the flags available to them (i.e. Republicans and Democrats).<p>[^1]: The US&#x27; democracy has many faults, but it&#x27;s a shining thing compared with a lot of countries in the world.</div><br/><div id="37377776" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37377776" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">paganel</span><span>|</span><a href="#37374519">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37377728">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37374997">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37377776">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37377776">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  Marx and his ideology when they were happy with the soviets, Ceausescu later when the political winds changed.<p>Exactly that.<p>If it matters, and while we&#x27;re talking history of ideology, towards the latter years of the Ceausescu government real and genuine &quot;local&quot; Marxists had been sidelined almost completely, meanwhile there was a push for inter-war nationalism veering into what today would be called far-right.<p>The 6th volume of the &quot;Military history of the Romanian people&quot;, published in 1989 under the editorship of one of Ceausescu&#x27;s brothers, had details of the Romanian Army&#x27;s involvement on the Eastern Front during WW2, meaning while we were on the Germans&#x27; side and fighting against the Soviets, on Soviet land.

You must publish often and your work most be &quot;novel.&quot; The more novel, the more prestige, the more frequent the faster you rise.<p>This is a system that&#x27;s problematic for science, but crazy in humanities. One reason in science is it discourages replication. But there is a parallel here in something like history, reinvestigation. Something like the Roman Empire is well studied and there&#x27;s lower novelty to be gained. But do we want to discourage such research? Discourage modern people for maintaining such records?<p>Under the current system, we can encourage these people to continue studying popular areas but do we encourage maintaining historical truth and integrity? I conjecture that the answer is no. It encourages making things up, especially to fit a modern narrative. It&#x27;s a system that makes people not know they&#x27;re lying because they are true believers and no credible experts push back.<p>This isn&#x27;t a problem unique to the study of history, but you can find issues like this is all research in academia. It is very hard to measure the quality of research. Citations, h-index, and so on do not mean a lot. We&#x27;ve seen in the past few months very popular researchers found to be frauds, with high positions in prestigious institution like Stanford. Even in practical areas that should be treatable: psychology, medicine, machine learning, and more. We want to believe, but do we have strong evidence and strong understanding? We make easy metrics at first to be &quot;good enough&quot; or because we lack better ones. But we often forget the limitations of those metrics as time goes by because we get caught up in the rat race. You can&#x27;t just ask yourself if the metric makes sense, but instead need to ask if there&#x27;s an easier way to score on the metric that isn&#x27;t the intended object of measurement. We can see here that citations can be hacked easily by fun stories, surprising results, and we&#x27;ll never uncover them because the only people who attempt to replicate are those in junior positions like undergrads and grad students, who are more likely to question their results than the original work. Those failures never get written about.<p>Science is really about progressing knowledge. Publications are really about communication. Both these are very vague and can be accomplished in many different ways.<p>I say instead of making narrow easy to define metrics that will never be good enough we embrace the chaos and noise. Let the researchers be free and let ̶G̶o̶d̶ time sort it out. We don&#x27;t know what is good research until 5-20 years down the line. We don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s a good teacher until the same. By removing the metrics you force nuance to not be ignored. Most of the time it&#x27;s a &quot;know it when you see it&quot; definition and if that&#x27;s true we have to be careful about levels of confidence. The thing that makes us human is the ability to handle nuance. It is what differentiates us from animals and LLMs. If the downside is that in a field where people are required to think hard and carefully have to... Think hard and carefully, then that&#x27;s okay. ML is very successful with the arxiv model because despite much hype, noise, and even many bad actors, us researchers can sniff it out. We have to do it anyways, as that&#x27;s our job.<p>I fear if we don&#x27;t fix things we will continue to just degrade our foundation. We&#x27;ve seen this experiment fail over the last century. It&#x27;s time to just get rid of the bureaucracy. Let academics be academics. Micromanagement isn&#x27;t helping. Research can take decades, but people concerned with the next quarter will never allow that. Academics is about risks, challenging the status quo, and nuance. It is not to be run like a business. I am happy for this sector to not be profitable because I know the profits are indirect and benefit everyone. But returns on investments may take centuries, and that&#x27;s okay.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37374316" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37374316" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">simbolit</span><span>|</span><a href="#37378022">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37377232">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37374316">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37374316">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the authors confuses stories and &#x2F;grand stories&#x2F; (sometimes called &quot;meta-narratives&quot;).<p>I don&#x27;t see how it is possible to do history without stories.

And Haig was no Cadorna or Hötzendorf.<p>The big mistake Haig made, or the thing he didn&#x27;t see, was IMHO how the war was fought and won on the Western Front. He wanted a breakthrough, instead he got a war of attrition. One the Entente was winning. Haig went from attempted breakthrough to winning, without realizing why his strategy worked. Because one can fight a war of attrition without sacrificing as much of your own men as the Entente did.<p>How the Entente reacted to the Kaiserschlacht so, well, that was the right reaction: let the Germans leave their fortified positions, outrun their logistics, and sacrifice some ground until the enemy runs out of steam. Then counter attack. That way, you don&#x27;t even have to break through the enemies lines as they are already abandonned and unmanned.

For example, I see constant attempts to deny that the Wrights&#x27; 1903 Flyer was the first powered, controlled flight. The evidence presented is always a pile of fanciful conjecture.<p>This rewrite occurs with modern events, too. For example, the narrative on the 737MAX crashes. I&#x27;ve posted about it here many times. On a recent trip, I ran into a 737-800 captain on layover, and struck up a conversation. I chided him a bit about remembering the stab trim cutoff switch. Well, that opened the floodgates. He told me in no uncertain terms that those accidents would have never happened to him, because he knew how to fly the 737. He told me one way they could have recovered the airplane was the one I mentioned here many times - trim to normal and turn off the stab trim system. He said there was another way. The EA airplane was operating at <i>full throttle</i>. The overspeed warning could be heard on the cockpit voice recorder. The pilots ignored it. Overspeed is a very dangerous situation, as the air loads on the airplane exceed design limits. All the pilots had to do was just pull the throttle back. Then they could have manually retrimmed the stabilizer, which they tried to but could not because of the overspeed.<p>He added that all the 737 pilots he knew knew about this, but were afraid to speak up.<p>Remember all the narrative about the pilots could not have diagnosed stab trim runaway? This infuriated him, because when the trim runs, it spins two wheels right by the pilots&#x27; knees, making a loud and unmistakable clack-clacking sound. Something I was told about by Boeing engineers, but it was nice to hear it from a captain.<p>I suspect that the reason the single point of failure design of the MCAS went through is Boeing simply assumed that the pilots would just turn off the stab trim system if it misbehaved. And this is exactly what happened in the first MCAS incident - the crew turned it off, and continued the flight normally and landed safely.</div><br/><div id="37377041" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37377041" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cameldrv</span><span>|</span><a href="#37376102">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37376142">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37377041">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37377041">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As far as is publicly known, the failure has occurred three times, and has led to two crashes.  It is possible to recover from if you know what you&#x27;re looking for and you act promptly.  However, Boeing did not tell pilots what to look for.<p>The pilots did not diagnose it as stab trim runaway because it&#x27;s not stab trim runaway.  When MCAS is malfunctioning in this way, it engages nose down trim for 9.3 seconds, and then pauses for 5 seconds.  A runaway trim is where you have a stuck trim microswitch or relay or some sort of short circuit.  You&#x27;re expecting a continuous trim input.  The confusing thing about MCAS is that it appears to resolve itself, but then waits 5 seconds and comes right back.<p>By the way, the wheels going clack clack is a normal thing at that phase of flight.  The 737 has something called Speed Trim and another thing called Mach Trim that automatically adjust the trim as the speed of the aircraft changes.  In the initial climbout, this will be running constantly.<p>Both the speed trim and mach trim systems are documented in the 737 manual and pilots are required to know how they work to get a type rating.  The workings of MCAS were deleted from the manual before it was released because Boeing was concerned that the FAA would require more training on the system, which would cause Boeing to have to pay a contractual penalty to Southwest Airlines.<p>edit:<p>Also, Boeing&#x27;s own test pilots failed to respond promptly to this failure in the simulator: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aviationweek.com&#x2F;air-transport&#x2F;aircraft-propulsion&#x2F;boeing-aware-pilot-response-issues-during-max-certification" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aviationweek.com&#x2F;air-transport&#x2F;aircraft-propulsion&#x2F;b...</a><p>It&#x27;s very easy as a pilot to say that you would do a better job and something like this would never happen to you.

MCAS failure exhibits as exactly this. The most likely cause of uncommanded movement is an electrical fault of some sort. Electrical faults are <i>often</i> intermittent. When you don&#x27;t know why an intermittent fault is happening, you turn it off. This is not rocket science. In the first LA crash, the crew restored normal trim 25 times. The uncommanded trim happened twenty five times. In what universe is this not runaway trim?<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen the definition you&#x27;re using is one invented after the fact by parsing word meanings like a lawyer. If it&#x27;s your butt in the pilot&#x27;s seat, I recommend thinking like a pilot, not like a lawyer.<p>From your link:<p>&quot;in at least one simulator session, Boeing pilots took more than 10 sec. to react to a runaway stabilizer&quot;<p>First off, they don&#x27;t seem confused about what a &quot;runaway&quot; is. Secondly, 10 seconds was plenty of time, as in both incidences the crew battled it for several minutes.<p>&quot;Aerodynamic loads on the mis-trimmed aircraft made the trim wheel hard to turn&quot;<p>The loads were too high because the pilots were at full throttle and ignored the overspeed warning horn.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s very easy as a pilot to say that you would do a better job and something like this would never happen to you.<p>And in the first incident, that&#x27;s what the crew did. They just turned it off and continued to their destination.<p>&gt; the wheels going clack clack is a normal thing at that phase of flight<p>When the wheels are clack clacking and the nose suddenly pitches sharply down, there&#x27;s the clue that the stab trim is running away.<p>&gt; The earth is pockmarked with the smoking holes of these people&#x27;s airplanes<p>It sure is, and that&#x27;s why airline pilots are supposed to know things like what the switches in the cockpit are for and what stabilizer trim runaway is and read and understand all Emergency Airworthiness Directives.

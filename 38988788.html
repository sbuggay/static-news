I must have checked out books on the history of the submarine about that time and became obsessed with the simplicity of the original Turtle submarine — operated with hand screws (propellers).<p>Likely too I saw a homemade sub or scuba tow on the odd Popular Mechanics cover....<p>I had read enough to incorporate a lead ballast that could be released from inside the sub. I imagined props and motors based around those electric trolling motors you can get for a small fishing boat. I therefore incorporated a car battery into the design. Front and rear ballast tanks allowed me to control the pitch trim. I imagined a small electric automotive tire pump would suffice to force the water out of the ballast tanks.<p>I obsessed over a mechanism to allow each trolling motor to be gimbaled from a pair of joysticks in the sub. I built mechanical models with paper drinking straws and toilet paper rolls to test the mechanics.<p>I played with different seating configurations to minimize the size of the sub but keep it &quot;operatable&quot;.<p>It was a weird and impossible fantasy that never had a chance of moving beyond the drawing board stage. You know, especially for a kid with a single mother who was a secretary. But perhaps there was some intellectual and creative stimulation that I was feeding off at the time that made the effort worth it.<p>Thinking about it now though, how obsessive I was, it might also have spoke to a boredom, isolation and maybe sadness I felt at the time. The sub might have been an escape for me.<p>To see someone build a sub for real is kind of cool. But it also makes clear how likely my design would have just collapsed right away at about 10 feet depth. I mean, I planned on using plywood for the hull, ha ha.</div><br/><div id="38998386" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38998386" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">NoPedantsThanks</span><span>|</span><a href="#38997047">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38998699">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38998386">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38998386">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh man, that&#x27;s great! For me it was a go-kart. They were illegal where I lived (Chicago suburbs), but whatever.<p>There were two big hurdles for a kid: acquisition of a side-shaft motor (lawn mower engines&#x27; shafts were vertical, so no dice) and acquisition of a clutch. I couldn&#x27;t afford either of those. Nor could I weld.<p>My friend and neighbor, as it turns out, inexplicably had a snow-blower engine in his garage. Horizontal shaft, perfect! But I still couldn&#x27;t get a clutch.<p>So I decided who needs to start or stop in a sane manner? I&#x27;d simply attach a bicycle wheel directly to the shaft of the engine, and use lawn-mower wheels for the other three.<p>Then I set about to build the frame, by hacksawing an old angle-iron bed frame apart and bolting it into a rectangle. I managed to cut the metal, but drilling holes in it for bolts proved to be essentially impossible.<p>So I built a crude platform out of wood and attached the wheels to it. The front wheels were bolted onto the ends of a board that I could pivot with my feet. Then I bolted the engine onto the back, with wood shims to make the bicycle wheel meet the ground at the same height as the three other wheels.<p>There were no brakes and no way to totally stop the engine. I propped the back up on some bricks and went to start it... and the pull-start mechanism broke. Probably saved me from serious injury or worse.<p>And that was that.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38998699" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38998699" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stavros</span><span>|</span><a href="#38997047">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38998386">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38998540">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38998699">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38998699">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes but what an amazing 10-foot journey that would have been!</div><br/></div></div><div id="38998540" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38998540" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacquesm</span><span>|</span><a href="#38997047">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38998699">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38998472">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38998540">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38998540">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When I was 7, with a bunch of friends, I built a &#x27;plane&#x27; in our attic.

It is used in boat Buildng all the time.(aircraft also)
By bending very thin(1&#x2F;8” for example), you can add by gluing, and or nailing each later on top, which will hold the original bent shape. Plywood itself is strong, because of it&#x27;s intrinsic layers, and adding more layers on top, makes it extremely strong.
Making the bow and Stern, fit and be as tight and strong - that&#x27;s another problem.
Maybe you should get back to the drawing board, and continue.

So there he was, dragged to the bottom of the reservoir, chained to a railway sleeper with a semi-functioning home-made underwater breathing apparatus.<p>He must have escaped somehow but when he told the story he would just leave that part a mystery and he’s dead now so there’s no way of finding out.</div><br/><div id="38998552" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38998552" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacquesm</span><span>|</span><a href="#38998069">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38997742">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38998552">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38998552">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What an absolutely awesome story.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38997742" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38997742" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">joncrane</span><span>|</span><a href="#38998069">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38998358">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38997742">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38997742">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Step 1: Build the submarine<p>Step 2: Don&#x27;t go in the submarine</div><br/></div></div><div id="38998358" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38998358" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ivolimmen</span><span>|</span><a href="#38997742">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38997558">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38998358">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38998358">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Awesome to see this; hope they don&#x27;t go to see the Titanic.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38997558" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38997558" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pushedx</span><span>|</span><a href="#38998358">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38997558">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38997558">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I love the live translation for this talk, and others.

He cited a DARPA experiment in which a squad of Marines defeated an AI-governed robot that had been trained to detect them simply by altering their physical profiles. <i>Two walked inside a large cardboard box.</i> Others somersaulted. One wore the branches of a fir tree. All were able to approach over open ground and touch the robot without detection.<p>Oh..<p>&gt;I was curious about Palantir, whose stock indeed soared amid the 2023 AI frenzy. I had been told that the Israeli security sector’s AI systems might rely on Palantir’s technology. Furthermore, Shin Bet’s humiliating failure to predict the Hamas assault had not blunted the Israeli Defense Force’s appetite for the technology; the unceasing rain of bombs upon densely packed Gaza neighborhoods, according to a well-sourced report by Israeli reporter Yuval Abraham in +972 Magazine, was in fact partly controlled by an AI target-creation platform called the Gospel. The Gospel produces automatic recommendations for where to strike based on what the technology identifies as being connected with Hamas, such as the private home of a suspected rank-and-file member of the organization. It also calculates how many civilians, including women and children, would die in the process—which, as of this writing, amounted to at least twenty-two thousand people, some 70 percent of them women and children. One of Abraham’s intelligence sources termed the technology a “mass assassination factory.” Despite the high-tech gloss on the massacre, the result has been no different than the slaughter inflicted, with comparatively more primitive means, against Dresden and Tokyo during World War II.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39847403" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39847403" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dosinga</span><span>|</span><a href="#39848496">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39840576">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39847403">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39847403">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The examples in the article are rather cherry-picked.

And it warned Americans to avoid large gatherings for the next 48 hours. That was on March 7th. The actual attack would only take place on March 24th.<p>Incidentally, there is speculation that the attack may have been planned for March 9th. One of the terrorists was photographed at Crocus on the 7th, and on the 9th there was a large concert by Shaman - a patriotic Russian singer who&#x27;s regularly made songs glorifying the war in Ukraine, performed for soldiers in Russia&#x27;s claimed territories, and so on. This would also have coincided with just before the Russian elections, which happened on the 15th. But security was extremely high during that concert - very possibly in response to the US warning.<p>By contrast when Russia warned the US about the Boston Bomber, the warning was precise to the point of even naming him.</div><br/><div id="39848333" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39848333" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wolverine876</span><span>|</span><a href="#39847403">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39848175">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39848695">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39848333">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39848333">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is there evidence of the last claim?</div><br/><div id="39848382" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39848382" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">semerda</span><span>|</span><a href="#39847403">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39848333">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39848378">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39848382">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39848382">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;storyline&#x2F;boston-bombing-anniversary&#x2F;russia-warned-u-s-about-tsarnaev-spelling-issue-let-him-n60836" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;storyline&#x2F;boston-bombing-anniversary...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39848378" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39848378" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">foolfoolz</span><span>|</span><a href="#39847403">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39848333">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39848382">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39848695">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39848378">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39848378">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;idUSBREA2P02R&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;idUSBREA2P02R&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39848695" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39848695" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK</span><span>|</span><a href="#39847403">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39847996">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39847832">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39848695">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39848695">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;&gt; The danger could only be warded off by adopting ... aerial and naval unmanned systems ...<p>That was actually spot on, as recent events show.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39848299" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39848299" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">quotemstr</span><span>|</span><a href="#39847403">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39847832">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39840576">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39848299">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39848299">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Organizations commonly fail by deluding themselves. One form of self-delusion is confusing motion for progress. The author&#x27;s point is that the Pentagon <i>thinks</i> it is funding technology but isn&#x27;t getting value for its money. It&#x27;s failing to do so because it lacks the will or ability to unite expertise, authority, and responsibility in a single brain. When organizations diffuse responsibility or grant authority to people unequipped to distinguish motion from progress, the result is always waste and stagnation.<p>Effective leadership is a continual struggle against this entropic tendency of organizations towards management of appearances over world-of-atoms results. During those rare interludes in history when a strong leader manages to temporarily reverse this organizational entropy, magic happens. Consider ULA versus SpaceX or DeepMind vs. OpenAI<p>Imagine how much further up the technology ladder we as a species would be if institutional competence were the norm, not an unstable and fleeting miracle.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39840576" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39840576" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nkozyra</span><span>|</span><a href="#39847403">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39848273">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39840576">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39840576">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think - like a lot of media reporting on the space - this overgeneralizes (heh) artificial intelligence.

It&#x27;s a great human interface. Do I for a second believe that it played a much larger role, such to be implied as responsible in any non-negligble way for missing the attack. Of course not.<p>My point here is that ML continues to play a role, ML continues to both succeed and fail, and ML will continue to be imperfect, even moreso as it competes against adversarial ML.

Moltke the Elder was in charge of the Prussian army at the time. Moltke the Elder was a student of Clausewitz who literally wrote the book on modern strategy. But Clausewitz when he was in active service was not some world beating general. Clausewitz fought for the Prussians during the Napoleon’s time and was actually at one point a prisoner of Napoleon.

It wasn&#x27;t &quot;an act of terrorism&quot;. It was an <i>invasion</i> and jointly, a rocket attack, by a neighboring semi-state with a military, that has stated it will invade over and over again. And of course, the capture of 250 hostages.<p>This isn&#x27;t a kind of one-off terror attack that was met with revenge for the sake of it. For the months after the initial invasion, Hamas fired thousands of rockets at Israel, essentially shutting down the country for a few weeks, until they were forced to stop. Hamas militants were literally running around inside of Israel for two days.<p>No nation on Earth could afford to effectively cease functioning as rockets rained down on it, and as other parties like Hezbollah were threatening to widen the conflict to a far more serious attack as well.<p>&gt; If the Palestinians stop defending themselves with terrorism would Israel play nice?<p>I can&#x27;t answer that, but it&#x27;s worth noting that during the 1990s there <i>was</i> a sizeable Israeli left that was pushing for peace, there were talks, there were accords that gave the Palestinians self-governance in the West Bank, etc. This was met with terrorism, with the express purpose of <i>stopping</i> the peace process.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that Israel completely <i>left</i> Gaza in 2005, <i>removing</i> all its settlements there and the soldiers there. Gaza then elected Hamas, which immediately started shooting rockets at Israel.<p>So while I highly dislike Israel&#x27;s right-wing government and extremism, and highly dislike the settlements, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s accurate to say that the terrorism is helping protect against anything.

The intelligence disaster was even more striking considering Hamas carried out much of its preparations in plain sight, including practice assaults on mock-ups of the border fence and Israeli settlements—activities that were openly reported. Hamas-led militant groups even posted videos of their training online. Israelis living close to the border observed and publicized these exercises with mounting alarm, but were ignored in favor of intelligence bureaucracies’ analyses and, by extension, the software that had informed them. Israeli conscripts, mostly young women, monitoring developments through the ubiquitous surveillance cameras along the Gaza border, composed and presented a detailed report on Hamas’s preparations to breach the fence and take hostages, only to have their findings dismissed as “an imaginary scenario.” The Israeli intelligence apparatus had for more than a year been in possession of a Hamas document that detailed the group’s plan for an attack.<p>&gt; Well aware of Israel’s intelligence methods, Hamas members fed their enemy the data that they wanted to hear, using informants they knew would report to the Israelis. They signaled that the ruling group inside Gaza was concentrating on improving the local economy by gaining access to the Israeli job market, and that Hamas had been deterred from action by Israel’s overwhelming military might. Such reports confirmed that Israel’s intelligence system had rigid assumptions of Hamas behavior, overlaid with a racial arrogance that considered Palestinians incapable of such a large-scale operation.

They just understood the realities of that region and operated in ways that modern western nations (thankfully) aren’t willing to. The fact we tried a different way was admirable despite ultimately being unsuccessful and a poor allocation of resources.<p>Relevant wiki quotes:<p>“In the Mongol invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire (1219–1221), Genghis Khan invaded the region from the northeast in one of his many conquests to create the huge Mongol Empire. His armies slaughtered thousands in the cities of Kabul, Kandahar, Jalalabad etc. After Genghis Khan returned to Mongolia, there was a rebellion in the region of Helmand which was brutally put down by his son and successor, Ogedei Khan, who killed all male residents of Ghazni and Helmand in 1222; the women were enslaved and sold. Thereafter most parts of Afghanistan other than the extreme south-eastern remained under Mongol rule as part of the Ilkhanate and the Turko-Mongol Chagatai Khanate.”<p>And:<p>“From 1383 to 1385, the Afghanistan area was conquered from the north by Timur, leader of neighboring Transoxiana (roughly modern-day Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and adjacent areas), and became a part of the Timurid Empire. Timur was from a Turko-Mongol tribe and although a Muslim, saw himself more as an heir of Genghis Khan. Timur&#x27;s armies caused great devastation and are estimated to have caused the deaths of 17 million people. He brought great destruction on Afghanistan&#x27;s south, slaughtering thousands and enslaving an equal number of women. Allied with the Uzbeks, Hazaras and other Turkic communities in the north his dominance over Afghanistan was long-lasting, allowing him for his future successful conquests in Central Anatolia against the Ottomans.”<p>The Mughal empire rose out of this and ruled until the 1800’s.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39845276" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39845276" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shuntress</span><span>|</span><a href="#39840522">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39844133">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39844720">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39845614">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39845276">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39845276">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; How exactly does providing the latter do anything but piss surviving conservatives and hardliners and reactionaries off even more?<p>It is fairly well understood that decreasing gender inequality by empowering women is one of the most effective ways to reduce instability in struggling societies.</div><br/><div id="39847287" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39847287" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ramblenode</span><span>|</span><a href="#39840522">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39845276">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39845351">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39847287">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39847287">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This sounds a little vague.

That&#x27;s why European culture(s) had to recover much of the knowledge they lost after the Dark Ages from Muslim sources. So your statement disproves itself even by its own ethnocentric standard.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2016&#x2F;nov&#x2F;09&#x2F;western-civilisation-appiah-reith-lecture" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2016&#x2F;nov&#x2F;09&#x2F;western-civili...</a><p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thediplomat.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;03&#x2F;is-india-the-mother-of-democracies&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thediplomat.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;03&#x2F;is-india-the-mother-of-democ...</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trueafrica.co&#x2F;article&#x2F;why-democracy-is-just-as-african-as-it-is-european&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trueafrica.co&#x2F;article&#x2F;why-democracy-is-just-as-afric...</a><p>[3]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.loc.gov&#x2F;law&#x2F;2023&#x2F;09&#x2F;the-haudenosaunee-confederacy-and-the-constitution&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.loc.gov&#x2F;law&#x2F;2023&#x2F;09&#x2F;the-haudenosaunee-confeder...</a><p>[4]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Christian_influences_on_the_Islamic_world" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Christian_influences_on_the_Is...</a><p>[5]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Greek_contributions_to_the_Islamic_world" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Greek_contributions_to_the_Isl...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39846674" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39846674" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">082349872349872</span><span>|</span><a href="#39840522">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39845614">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39846283">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39845974">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39846674">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39846674">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>...

They lacked serious plans for such an eventuality and still lack a serious goal for their invasion of Gaza.<p>They have competing strategic visions.<p>The current ruling coalition under Bibi Netanyahu, which is far more conservative, wants Israeli control of the entirety of what used to be Mandatory Palestine between the West Bank of the Jordan River and the Mediterranean. Palestinian Arabs would have some presence in such a society but it would be as a minority, and only if said minority plays nice with the majority. There would be a single state with a Jewish ethnic majority and government acting under Jewish jurisprudence as opposed to secular, Christian, or Islamic.<p>The goal for the invasion of Gaza for this coalition is simple: break the will of the Gazans. The coalition points to the fact that the Gazans elected Hamas over the more secular Fatah in 2006, and that Hamas has, for a very long time, refused to recognize that Israel has <i>any</i> right to exist anywhere in former Mandatory Palestine. The coalition under Netanyahu sees them as a thorn in their side and will commit total war on Gaza, seeing that as a way to convince the Gazans that there will be no success in raising a military challenge to Israel. They&#x27;ve shown themselves to be right while committing a whole host of actions that probably deserve ICJ review. While Hamas still holds Jewish hostages, they have virtually no control over the current war. The Israelis conduct military operations at will in the territory and Hamas has no real way to prevent that.<p>The other vision is that of a significant portion of the Israeli population and most of the rest of the international community, which at this point just want the hostages back.

Israel&#x27;s neighbors can very credibly pose an existential threat, which only external intervention can thwart.<p>Imagine for example the very realistic scenario where Iran obtains nuclear weapons. Then, should Iran decide to fund a missile blockade of Israel in the Mediterranean and Red Sea, Israel has zero capability to protect shipping. Since Iran would be a nuclear power, it&#x27;s very obviously not in Israel&#x27;s interest to escalate to the use of nuclear weapons, so a threat to do so wouldn&#x27;t be credible.<p>The only way Israel could achieve its goals in such a scenario is through external intervention, which the Yemenis have shown even now would be difficult.<p>Israel does need strategic vision, desperately. It&#x27;s a tiny country that&#x27;s existentially depend on the US and Western Europe, and doesn&#x27;t have the industrial capacity to independently defend itself while it&#x27;s neighbors increasingly can. This is the first time this ever happened - in the past, Israel and it&#x27;s neighbors were on an equal footing because while Israel couldn&#x27;t produce its key weapons on it&#x27;s own, neither could it&#x27;s neighbors.<p>This isn&#x27;t true anymore. It&#x27;s a momentous strategic shift in the region. What&#x27;s worse is that this happens at the same time as the balance of power is tipping away from its main allies. What&#x27;s even worse is that public opinion, especially in the US, is undergoing an unprecedented shift.<p>Something else that has not been reported on is that China, which historically was agnostic on the issue, now has an official policy that Palestine has the right to armed resistance. It&#x27;s a sizeable diplomatic shift because historically neither of the dominant powers openly supported armed Palestinian resistance.<p>If this grand strategem is to take more than 15 years, and it is, it&#x27;s extremely risky strategically. It&#x27;s not true that strategic vision past that is unneeded, it&#x27;s more important now than it ever was.

The first is that the US will intervene militarily to defend Israel. The second is that a military threat to Israel (ex: a blockade) would need military collaboration from Sunni Arab states. The third is that the Sunni Arab states that have relation with Israel do it from direct self-interest.<p>None of those are truths you can rely on right now, let alone for 1-2 generations.<p>It&#x27;s doubtful that the US, should Israel really fly off the handle, would be willing to intervene against a nuclear state - it hasn&#x27;t in Ukraine despite much more favourable circumstances. As time goes on and the balance of power shifts away from the US this will become more and more true. Additionally, the US cannot militarily stop antiship missiles even at a relatively small scale, so the only intervention that would be guaranteed to work would be an invasion of Iran, which if it had nuclear weapons would probably not be undertaken.<p>Secondly, there is no need for cooperation from any Sunni Arab state. In theory, all it would take would be missile launches from Iraq, Syria or Lebanon to shut down traffic to Israel from the Mediterranean - that would be enough to basically collapse the Israeli economy, as it would not be economical to ship overland from Egypt or Jordan, even if those countries would be willing to collaborate (and they might not).<p>Thirdly, no Arab country has diplomatic or economic ties to Israel out of the goodness of their heart. They only do due to massive pressure from the US, who either gives diplomatic concessions in exchange (ex: recognition of Western Sahara) or hangs the military umbrella (Saudi Arabia, UAE). This is not something you can bank on when shit hits the fan, let alone for the next 1-2 generations.<p>At the end of the day Israel&#x27;s strategic situation is extremely precarious and is completely dependent on foreign powers who not only have greatly waning influence and relative capability, but also declining sympathy. This used to also be true, to some extent, for it&#x27;s neighbors, but it isn&#x27;t anymore because Iran managed to make its own sanction-proof and relatively competitive MIC. In the future, Iran might not even be the only state in the region to manage such a thing, and structurally any state which aims to do this aims for strategic independence, and a state which is strategically independent doesn&#x27;t have much of a reason to be sympathetic to Israel right now, let alone in the situation you presented. Additionally, it&#x27;s not unlikely there will be nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, which will greatly weaken Western influence as Western nations will oppose proliferation and because states which attain nuclear weapons are no longer reliant on the US for defense.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39846503" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39846503" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kromem</span><span>|</span><a href="#39840522">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39846912">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39846503">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39846503">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m getting really tired of writers crapping on &#x27;AI&#x27; as if a static self-sufficient offering.<p>Like no, the AI doesn&#x27;t know everything other than what the terrorist is thinking.

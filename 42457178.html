Industrial civilization at scale goes back less than 200. A useful starting point is the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (1830). This the moment when the industrial revolution got out of beta, and, quite literally, picked up steam.<p>Extractable natural resources are somewhat finite. Sometimes, with more inputs, you can get more output. Fracking is a modern example. An older example is taconite, the low-grade iron ore (15% iron) mined after the reserves of high-grade ore (65% iron) were exhausted.[2] Gold and rare earths are extracted at great expense from very low concentrations in the raw material. At some point, extraction in high volume becomes impracticable.<p>We&#x27;re only two hundred years into high-volume mined resource extraction. 
The USGS has a Critical Materials List.[3] Most of the current problems are political and commercial, not outright shortages. USGS lists known reserves for mined resources. Most have at least a century of known resources left, but not a millennium. On a time scale of civilizations, that&#x27;s not long.<p>Recycling is a battle against entropy. Almost all gold is recovered. About 80% of aluminum is recovered. About 60% of steel is recovered. Each time around, you lose some through dispersal into forms not easy to collect and recycle. So that, too, has a diminishing returns problem.<p>Sometime in the future, perhaps closer than the distance in time since Oxford University was founded, most of the minerals will no longer be available in large quantity. It will be a slow, but difficult transition.<p>Biological systems, though, mostly keep shuffling around C, H, O, and N. That&#x27;s been working for over 300 million years now, pretty much recycling the same atoms. Long term, on the scale of millennia, systems running on the weaker bonds in that space can go on for millions of years. That&#x27;s the default mode of planetary operation.<p>Energy isn&#x27;t a long-term problem because forms of energy are convertible, and wind and solar keep working as long as the sun does, at least if there are enough materials left to build generators. That looks like a long-term win on the scale of thousands of years. Millions, though...<p>It&#x27;s quite possible that industrial civilizations have a finite lifespan, bounded by material availability. Doesn&#x27;t mean there can&#x27;t be sentient civilizations. Or that they&#x27;re limited to &quot;nature&quot;. Biological systems can be engineered, too.<p>But you don&#x27;t get interstellar travel out of biology. Too low-powered.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railw...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Taconite" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Taconite</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usgs.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;national-news-release&#x2F;us-geological-survey-releases-2022-list-critical-minerals" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usgs.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;national-news-release&#x2F;us-geologica...</a></div><br/><div id="42459211" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42459211" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">marcus_holmes</span><span>|</span><a href="#42458312">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42458656">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42459211">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42459211">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Organized human civilizations go back 2000-3000 years<p>More like 10,000 at least [0]<p>Australian Aborigines are at 50,000 or so, depending on your definition of &quot;organised&quot;.<p>And, inferring from the article, I kinda like the idea that advanced civilisation fade back into nature.

It&#x27;s a sobering way to visualize just how brief our industrial window might be. But I think we&#x27;re missing some fascinating possibilities here.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right about the recycling entropy battle - those diminishing returns are brutal. But I&#x27;m curious about where biological innovation might shift this equation. We&#x27;re already seeing organisms that can work well beyond the traditional C&#x2F;H&#x2F;O&#x2F;N sandbox - bacteria that reduce metals, engineered microbes that synthesize quantum dots. This hints at possibilities that blur your distinction between biological and industrial approaches.<p>The interstellar travel conclusion particularly caught my attention. While current biological systems are indeed low-power, that very efficiency might be what makes them perfect for long-haul space missions. Imagine hybrid systems where bio-engineered organisms maintain spacecraft over generations, working alongside traditional tech. Maybe slow and steady wins the interstellar race.<p>I&#x27;d argue we&#x27;re on the cusp of even more radical transformations in materials science. What if atomic-scale manufacturing fundamentally changes our relationship with scarce resources? The jump from 65% to 15% iron ore might look tiny compared to what&#x27;s coming. Maybe we&#x27;re not facing a binary choice between current industrial systems and purely biological ones. The sweet spot might be in hybrid approaches that combine biological resilience with industrial capability.<p>Curious to hear your thoughts on this - particularly around how engineered biological systems might reshape our assumptions about resource constraints. There&#x27;s something compelling about the idea of building civilization&#x27;s next chapter on that 300-million-year track record of biological innovation.</div><br/><div id="42459419" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42459419" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Animats</span><span>|</span><a href="#42458312">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42458656">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42459390">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42459419">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42459419">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; bacteria that reduce metals<p>Separate metals from organics, yes.[1] Reduce metals, probably not. Reduce means to pull a metal out of its oxide. This is way uphill energetically. It is usually done by heating the oxide to a high temperature in an oxygen-poor environment.
The other direction, oxidation, produces energy, and there are some biological processes that use that.<p>Still, there are some bacteria which manipulate manganese.[2]<p>&gt; What if atomic-scale manufacturing fundamentally changes our relationship with scarce resources?<p>I used to know Drexler, the early nanotechnology guy, back when nanotechnology meant pushing atoms around by mechanical means, rather than surface chemistry. Not much came of that. It&#x27;s hard to apply enough force to break strong molecular bonds apart.
IBM did manage to spell out &quot;IBM&quot; with xenon atoms, but xenon is inert and doesn&#x27;t bond strongly to anything. No strong bonds to break.<p>Asteroid mining is potentially possible. Somebody will probably try it for gold and platinum within fifty years.

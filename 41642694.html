I learned Morse code and theory on my own.  Back then the novice license was only available through volunteer examiners. Now all licenses are taken with volunteer examiners.  After passing I built my radio and launched my antenna which was a vertical. I was limited solely to code and low power but quickly had contact with hams around the world.<p>Then to upgrade my license I had to have my dad drive me down to the FCC office in Detroit where I had an appointment.  I still remember the glass lined room where I took the code test had a bit of an echo which made copying the code a little difficult but I passed the first time.  My Dad treated me to a corned beef sandwich at the legendary Lefkowski&#x27;s at Eastern market.  Then I upgraded both my radio and launched a tower and a yagi.  Did it all before I had a drivers license.<p>Started a ham club at my high school which a half century later I am proud to report is still going strong.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41685502" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41685502" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LeoPanthera</span><span>|</span><a href="#41685558">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41685390">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41685502">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41685502">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s frustrating how a cheap VHF handheld is often recommended as a &quot;first radio&quot;. What you can do with one is quite limited, and for most practical purposes you&#x27;ll be tethered to a repeater.<p>I would always recommend a cheap, probably second hand, desktop HF radio to start with. You will be forced to learn how to make a simple antenna, how to cope with impedance matching, and in the process of using it you will learn about HF propagation, and the reward is that you get to communicate across the world, not just across your town. It&#x27;s a much better, and much more educational place to start.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41685390" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41685390" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wkat4242</span><span>|</span><a href="#41685502">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41685433">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41685390">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41685390">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I helped a friend do the novice exam, which is really quite easy these days and even permits the use of some HF bands (which I&#x27;ve personally never even have used with my full license from the 90s - I live in a city apartment and simply don&#x27;t have the space for the required antennas)<p>I can really recommend doing it. If you have some knowledge about electronics and some affinity for it, it&#x27;s pretty easy. You&#x27;ll need to study some of the regulations and stuff but it&#x27;s very doable.<p>When I did mine in the 90s the exams were still pretty hard but even then I studied for a day and passed. Of course having all my existing knowledge of electronics and 5 years of CB experience did help a lot. But overall i just coasted through it. People worry about it too much I think.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41685433" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41685433" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">quacksilver</span><span>|</span><a href="#41685390">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41685433">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41685433">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I did it in the UK mostly for the hardware &#x2F; legal transmit permissions on some experimental bands for my SDR.<p>There are repeaters most places, though chatting on them didn&#x27;t really interest me much. Check out echolink (available as a smartphone app) after getting your license if that does though - there is no special hardware needed and you can speak with people on repeaters all over the world if you want to.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

And precise language.  Agora was also the reason I learned Perl, when I got elected as the one who kept track of proposals and votes and inherited the perl scripts of my predecessor and had to read the man page (just one, it was Perl 4, excellently written but verrrry long) to learn the language to edit them.  Which was also highly formative, come to think of it.<p>Agora still seems to be alive and well, though, and coming up on 30 years old, at agoranomic.org .</div><br/></div></div><div id="39835599" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39835599" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">viraptor</span><span>|</span><a href="#39836532">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39836021">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39835599">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39835599">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s sad how many of those finished game urls are dead today.

It was weird and very non-traditional (if you could call Nomic games traditional).<p>We were just teenagers when one of the members of our strange little online friend group discovered Nomic and introduced it to the rest of us. We thought it was interesting, and after playing with the basic rules a bit, we modified it substantially. We turned the base Nomic rule making into this weird improvisational fantasy ARG that we played over AIM and IRC. It was set up to have us conduct &quot;real life&quot; missions to stop imagined alien invaders disguised as corporate overlords. (This very much resembled the plot of the game &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;.) The objectives, limitations on what we could explore, what imagined dangers we could face -- all mutable rules we dreamed up and voted on together.<p>On some weeks we&#x27;d put players up for certain tasks that defined our game world, like finding some place or object that became part of the ongoing mythology. It was essentially an append-only log of rules, lore, and journaling. I don&#x27;t think any of this content exists anymore, not that it was any good. Before long that slowly morphed into a more permanent and recorded game on EzBoard (which also no longer exists) before we started hosting our own websites and forums (bits and pieces of this still exist on archive.org). We were weird kids, but it was all entertaining to us.<p>At some point we decided to transition the Nomic rules into the bylaws for a fake company that made products and had ambitions of &quot;taking over the world for fun&quot;. We made games, short films, websites [2]. Lots of stuff. Some of our websites are still around today [3].<p>We got featured in Nintendo&#x27;s E3 press conference one year, beat Anil Dash [4] in some SEO competition (as teenagers that didn&#x27;t care a thing about SEO -- we just wanted to win prizes), and even made it on Slashdot a few times. All of this was conducted with Nomic rules that we had collectively voted on at some point or another.<p>There was even one time where the game led to us creating a sandboxed instance of phpBB where people could set rules, ban each other, wipe the entire forums, etc. It was a bit of performance art for a few months. When someone (never identified) SQL injected the website and deleted all the tables, we cheered.<p>I miss the early web and my younger years, but I have to imagine kids these days are exploring technology and doing the same crazy things in Discord, Minecraft, Roblox, VRChat, etc.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20060213020409&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.merkey.net:80&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=IRCNomic2&amp;amp;action=creativecommons" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20060213020409&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.merke...</a> I don&#x27;t even remember this one.

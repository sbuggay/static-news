The idea that geography is the primary shaper of civilisations seems _very_ likely to be true in general. I’ve read other books on the impact of geography on military defence and how that shapes geopolitics, for example.<p>Having worked in academia for many years, when I see academics attack a book such as GGS my instinct is to question their motives. Academics can be very egotistical and territorial. A priori, it is very difficult to imagine a situation where academics would say to any book like Diamond’s “oh yes this is a really great point and we need to learn from this guy” and very very likely to say “this guy doesn’t know anything about (less important factors that I know a lot about)! What an idiot! He even gets the date of this event wrong, proving I am clever and he is wrong.”<p>So when I hear about academics attacking something that seems to be fairly obviously correct at least at a very general level, my instinct is not “oh, yes, this guy must be completely wrong” but rather “this guy is probably mostly right but of course there will be a lot of other factors and it will be very easy to pick apart his book if you so wish, especially if your ego relies on you finding fault with him.”<p>I’m not so easily dissuaded that GGS isn’t mostly right that geography and in particular agricultural factors are the broad strokes of history, rather than the less permanent and smaller scale “Gaussian noise” of cultural events that intuitively are likely to mostly even out over time.</div><br/><div id="39600659" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39600659" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bryanrasmussen</span><span>|</span><a href="#39600412">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39600481">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39600659">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39600659">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In fighting there are various factors at place, the size and speed of those in the fight, the area they are in, the training.

Almost all countries nowadays are industrialized therefore there is no geographical factor that prevents industrialization in those nations.<p>Finally, historical trends seem not really to last more than 200-400 years, which 200 years really seems like the kind of thing that can be effected by a cultural issue - somebody who was a really bad king came along and reined for 70 years and destroyed the country, now you&#x27;re in a weakened condition and get picked on by everyone else for the next 130 years.

On the latter point, for example, Diamond is still a believer in Clovis-First hypothesis, despite that having been discredited for so long that I learned about it in grade school decades ago.<p>On the first point in particular: there&#x27;s a general thesis of anthropology which is properly termed unilineal model (and in more colloquial terms, Civilization-style tech tree), which views civilizations as existing on a spectrum from less to more advanced. In essence, GG&amp;S reduces the question of &quot;why did Europe conquer the New World and not the other way around&quot; as &quot;because Europe was more advanced&quot; (and then go on to try to explore why Europe was more advanced), but never trying that hard to justify why &quot;was more advanced&quot; was the answer to the first question. By contrast, the consensus view of modern anthropology is that technological development is heavily adapted to the context of its culture, so that (for example) the Incans don&#x27;t develop carts because carts are useless in their mountainous environment.<p>Once you go beyond the idea that &quot;more advanced&quot; is a qualitatively useful metric of comparison and actually start demanding to see the causal links in how specific technologies are necessary to achieve the claimed outcomes, it starts to become clear just how badly Diamond whiffs it. Literacy is a fun example: Diamond has to work around the fact that the conquistadors were largely illiterate, and they were facing bureaucratic, administrative imperial states that ran on record keeping, requiring at least proto-writing [1]; really, how different were the two empires in terms of literacy? Another fun example I like to bring up is comparing Tenochtitlan (the Aztec capital) to Toledo (the Spanish one). Tenochtitlan had over 100,000 inhabitants, universal primary education (for both boys and girls, even!), running water, and public amenities like zoos and history museums; the Spaniards had... none of that.<p>[1] And there&#x27;s a case to be made that Incan quipu were an honest-to-god writing system.</div><br/><div id="39600025" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39600025" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">GMoromisato</span><span>|</span><a href="#39588823">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39599792">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39600388">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39600025">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39600025">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What is the consensus answer to why Europe conquered the Americas and not vice versa?<p>If technological development is &quot;heavily adapted to the context of its culture&quot;, and that context is mostly geography (&quot;mountainous environments&quot;) then isn&#x27;t Diamond right?<p>Seems like the alternative is, &quot;That&#x27;s just the way it turned out,&quot; which is not very satisfying.</div><br/><div id="39600536" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39600536" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rjtavares</span><span>|</span><a href="#39588823">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39600025">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39600388">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39600536">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39600536">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The interesting question really is &quot;why did Europe conquered the Americans instead of China conquering the Americas&quot;?<p>And I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s just the way it turned out.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39600388" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39600388" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ffgjgf1</span><span>|</span><a href="#39588823">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39599792">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39600025">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39600249">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39600388">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39600388">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; conquistadors were largely illiterate, and they were facing bureaucratic, administrative imperial states that ran on record keeping<p>That seems like a weird (pointless?) thing to say when a lot of what we know about the conquest comes from letters Cortez constantly sent to Charles V to inform him on his progress.  Yes, some Conquistadors were illiterate, so what?<p>&gt; how different were the two empires in terms of literacy?<p>Massively. Usage on of writing for bookkeeping specifically  (though pretty much everything else as well) in Europe by 1500 was on a whole other level. It’s not even comparable. Are you really saying there was hardly any difference between quipu&#x2F;etc. and double entry bookkeeping? Based on what we know bureaucratically&#x2F;administratively European states were much more complex at the time than the Aztec empire (which was more like a hegemonic confederation, possibly because they did not have the administrative capacity to administer the areas they subjugated directly).<p>&gt; Tenochtitlan had over 100,000 inhabitants, universal primary education (for both boys and girls, even!), running water, and public amenities like zoos and history museums;<p>Rome and Constantinople had most of those things too. Doesn’t mean that Spain ~1500 AD wasn’t more advanced technologically than Rome in ~100 AD in almost every way. Also what are your sources on on universal education? And I don’t really think that most houses had direct access to running water (and many Medieval cities, albeit usually on a much smaller scale had functioning water distribution systems*, e.g Barcelona still had a functioning systems from the Roman period).<p>Bronze and pre-Bronze ages civilizations in the old world also had very complex societies, large cities (and from what we can tell) more advanced writing systems. The most advanced American civilizations were overall about on the same (or slightly below) level technologically. So yeah in that sense they were about 3000-4000 years behind the Spanish and other Europeans.<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fakehistoryhunter.net&#x2F;2023&#x2F;07&#x2F;29&#x2F;list-of-medieval-towns-villages-cities-with-water-supply-systems&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fakehistoryhunter.net&#x2F;2023&#x2F;07&#x2F;29&#x2F;list-of-medieval-to...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39600249" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39600249" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ffgjgf1</span><span>|</span><a href="#39588823">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39599195">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39599792">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39600095">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39600249">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39600249">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To be fair they don’t seem to like most popular historians, podcasters etc. and big picture&#x2F;all encompassing  theories which over simplify complex systems.<p>Which I guess is reasonable, if you’re a real historian deeply specialized in a specific field seeing someone gloss over or outright ignore very important details and&#x2F;or new findings&#x2F;theories might be hard to stomach.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39600095" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39600095" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">melagonster</span><span>|</span><a href="#39588823">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39599195">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39600249">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39599432">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39600095">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39600095">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Most of historians at there said they like him, some people even said that they were inspired by his book. but as a historian, they can&#x27;t say book is correct, because it is not truth.

Diamond&#x27;s assertion that Europeans conquered the world because they had an easier time domesticating animals makes sense if you&#x27;re talking about the Americas, but not so much when talking about Africa, which was in constant contact with Europe and in theory should have been able to trade for any technology invented there.<p>Simply saying that Africa didn&#x27;t have domesticable animals isn&#x27;t good enough because, certainly, they could have imported them along with other technology from Europe.<p>The continental axis hypothesis is his answer to this.  He says crops (and later animals) could be more easily moved east to west rather than north to south because the climate will change less.  In his mind, this explains why Africans didn&#x27;t adopt European advancements in agriculture and animal domestication.<p>You don&#x27;t need a study to debunk this theory within the context of Diamond&#x27;s overall hypnosis; you need a globe and some measuring tape.  Africa&#x27;s east-west axis (4600m) is only 8% smaller than its north-south axis (5000m), which in turn is almost identical to Eur-Asia&#x27;s (4,900m).  The only time this isn&#x27;t true is on a distorted map like the Mercator projection he uses in the book.<p>Sub-Saharan Africa is not some wasteland that couldn&#x27;t support these animals and crops.  And this is obvious when you consider that colonial empires brought their crops to Africa without the need to fundamentally change them for the climate.  Colonial holdings in Africa often produced a good chunk of the grain for their empires as a whole.<p>Axis theories aside, Diamond is just factually wrong about the origins and timelines of domestication.  Many of the crops and animals that supposedly helped Europe dominate the world were widely present in Africa centuries before European invasions.<p>Romans explored into Sub-Saharan Africa in the 1st century BC; Turks and Arabs had established trade routes deep into Africa by the 6th century AD; the Indian Ocean, including the coast of Africa was continually interconnected through trade going back to the bronze age at least, and trade caravans across the Sahara have been recorded in ancient Egyptian records.<p>This is covered well in Diamond in the Rough: Reflections on Guns, Germs, and Steel <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;24707701" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;24707701</a><p>You could fill a book disproving his theories, but I&#x27;ll point out one last thing: trying to explain European conquest through the lens of continents is super weird.  Africa, let alone any other &#x27;continent,&#x27; is a vast and diverse place.  The idea of continents in and of itself makes less and less sense the more we learn about geography.

As said by the official secretary of Pizarro [1]: “The city of Cuzco, being the primary place where the lords made their residence, is so great and so beautiful and with so many buildings that it would be worthy to be seen in Spain”.<p>On a fortress of the city: “Many Spaniards who have seen it, and who went to Lombardy and other foreign kingdoms,” he adds, “say they have not seen another building like this fortress nor a stronger castle.”<p>In any event, the advantages of stronger pack animals are only significant if you can create wheeled carts. The Incans, like most Mesoamerican civilizations, had limited access to metals and advanced metallurgy preventing them from widespread usage of wheels as a means of facilitating travel. Without wheels, the amount of distance most animals can go while carrying their supplies is fairly similar.<p>If I recall correctly, it is something on the order of 150 km, regardless of horse, ox, or even human. If you have to carry your food and water you can only go around 150 km with what you can carry. That means proportional consumption rate is highly similar, so two animals that can carry 100 kg is not materially different than one animal that can carry 200 kg. Under that model you would probably actually prefer smaller pack animals to reduce concentrated risk of animal loss and improve maneuverability.<p>You actually can do better since animals like horses can efficiently graze, but that heavily limits your transportation speed and weight maximums for commerce purposes and you still need to feed the humans.<p>Incidentally this is why rivers are so important in early civilization. Barges on rivers bypass the fundamental distance limit even without wind. Floaty boat and a stick to push off the banks&#x2F;riverbed dominates almost everything else for commerce.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cambridge.org&#x2F;core&#x2F;journals&#x2F;renaissance-quarterly&#x2F;article&#x2F;inca-architecture-from-the-andes-to-the-adriatic-pedro-sanchos-description-of-cuzco&#x2F;19E051A819D3223B0925A762040A9E88" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cambridge.org&#x2F;core&#x2F;journals&#x2F;renaissance-quarterl...</a></div><br/><div id="39598283" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39598283" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nradov</span><span>|</span><a href="#39588520">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39598213">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39598324">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39598283">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39598283">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Incas had a handful of fancy residences for the ruling class.

But you do have to make a argument that is consistent with the fact that the Incans seemed pretty darn wealthy even though they were missing certain technologies that we would normally view as critical or indicative of &quot;progress&quot;.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39599571" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39599571" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">WalterBright</span><span>|</span><a href="#39588520">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39599252">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39599519">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39598748">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39599571">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39599571">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The obvious answer is the Spaniards had the means to get to the Americas.<p>A more subtle answer is the Spanish commanders had access to thousands of years of military history in the form of books.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39598748" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39598748" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">truculent</span><span>|</span><a href="#39588520">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39598283">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39598818">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39598324">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39598748">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39598748">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The Incas had a handful of fancy residences for the ruling class.

QHINs are one of the outputs of TEFCA, and are a flavor of HIEs that promise to bring more use cases, such as patient access, to the table)<p>Unfortunately QHINs aren&#x27;t very meaningful right now, since patient access queries are not mandated to be responded to by TEFCA. One of the HIEs we connect to, CommonWell, is already a QHIN, so we&#x27;ll look at leveraging that, or becoming one ourselves, as we see fit.<p>&gt; How are you handling interstate data exchange privacy requirements.<p>We handle this on a case-by-case basis based on: (1) what state our customers&#x27; patients&#x27; are located, (2) what kind of data they can&#x2F;will be sharing, and (3) state requirements as you mention. For example, there is a new bill in California that will require special care of medical info as it pertains to abortion, contraception, and etc: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trackbill.com&#x2F;bill&#x2F;california-assembly-bill-352-health-information&#x2F;2348913&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trackbill.com&#x2F;bill&#x2F;california-assembly-bill-352-heal...</a><p>&gt; also wondering how you are handling the patient data access audit trail<p>All transactions that interface with our system have audit logs attached to them by default (as per HIPAA&#x2F;SOC2 requirements).<p>&gt; Or is that all being handled upstream w&#x2F; your QHINs?<p>Nothing is handled upstream with the HIEs we connect to (note that QHINs are a different subject, and just enable future use cases outside of Treatment) - audit logging is up to each member of the network, including us. For example, Carequality only has a directory that implementers connect to, they don&#x27;t store any data, and their only service is a directory of endpoints (it&#x27;s more of a framework in that sense).</div><br/><div id="40462172" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40462172" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nradov</span><span>|</span><a href="#40458037">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40458831">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40458509">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40462172">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40462172">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is this intended for use by providers or consumers&#x2F;patients?

Referring to the post: &quot;using Metriport for patient data exchange today requires a Treatment purpose of use under HIPAA - which means that only Covered Entities, or Business Associates who work with Covered Entities, can use Metriport.&quot;<p>&gt; Authorized providers can use TEFCA through a QHIN to query for treatment purpose of use, which is supported by all participants.<p>Yes you can query for Treatment, but you won&#x27;t get meaningful coverage. QHINs do not have nearly enough adoption to be used for Treatment. Essentially the pool of providers using QHINs is insignificant, so you need to go through existing HIEs to get meaningful coverage.<p>The driving force behind QHINs is to open up new use-cases for accessing patient data, not necessarily to make the Treatment purpose of use better.<p>&gt; How does your service differ in practice from existing networks of networks<p>We&#x27;re the only vendor that&#x27;s open source, where you can see and trust what&#x27;s going on under the hood. Ask other vendors how they do record location, patient matching, or data mapping, and they&#x27;ll just tell you &quot;trust us, we&#x27;re the best!&quot;.<p>Additionally, we&#x27;re the only vendor that is confident enough in our solution to work with companies month-to-month, to show them that our product actually brings them value (and works as advertised) in production. Other vendors will lock you into $120k+ yearly contracts before even showing you production patient data. True story: a provider came to us recently after one of the vendors you mentioned locked them into a yearly contract, and only after the lengthly implementation period did they realize the product didn&#x27;t work well at all - so a bunch of time&#x2F;money wasted, and they need to migrate now anyways.<p>We have many advantages feature-wise as well, feel free to compare our dev docs!</div><br/><div id="40462470" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40462470" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rqtwteye</span><span>|</span><a href="#40458037">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40462434">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40462477">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40462470">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40462470">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We are paying 60k for Health Gorilla and I am not sure it’s worth it.

So, we had to tailor our pitches to make investors understand why our product matters, since generally even people that have healthcare experience, have no idea what the hell an HIE is.<p>That, and our GTM allowed us to sell quickly, without needing to wait for slow moving hospital contracts, as are typical in healthcare - so some decent traction definitely helped.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40456201" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40456201" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pelagicAustral</span><span>|</span><a href="#40458509">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40459133">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40456201">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40456201">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Congrats on the launch, the site it&#x27;s quite nice and informative...<p>&quot;Access comprehensive EHR data for your patients in seconds, with FHIR R4...&quot;, I got Vietnam flashbacks from building an app to interface with the NHS Covid Vax certificate, that was my first encounter with FHIR...

I&#x27;ve worked for years in the healthcare interoperability space and there are still a huge number of unsolved problems impacting cost and patient care.<p>There actually is a standard for converting C-CDA records to FHIR. It isn&#x27;t 100% complete but serves as a useful starting point. If you find problems with it you can feed those back into the standards process.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hl7.org&#x2F;fhir&#x2F;us&#x2F;ccda&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hl7.org&#x2F;fhir&#x2F;us&#x2F;ccda&#x2F;</a><p>Microsoft has an open source library which works pretty well and I think implements at least part of that standard, although I haven&#x27;t used it lately.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;FHIR-Converter">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;FHIR-Converter</a><p>FHIR also includes unstructured narrative text so it isn&#x27;t necessarily better than C-CDA in that regard.

The ecosystem for the insurance documentation is never open source.

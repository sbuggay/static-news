The entire system is totally insecure and non-private by design.<p>The idea that dating app could prevent your preferences from being collected seems unlikely to me too. If people are posting profiles and messaging each other on a platform, that platform is going to have no problem learning what their interests are. They don&#x27;t need to know what you&#x27;re searching for, as long as they know who you&#x27;re finding.</div><br/><div id="41297553" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41297553" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">perching_aix</span><span>|</span><a href="#41296871">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41297130">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41297553">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41297553">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not sure you genuinely don&#x27;t understand, the privacy promised was very clearly inteded to be from other users, not the service itself, or those who may be able to get unauthorized access to your&#x2F;their devices and data. It was just phrased in an oh-so-typically misleading way by the service provider.<p>Yes, these groups might overlap, particularly the users and those with unauthorized access to the service provider&#x27;s devices and data (as demonstrated in the article). But identifying this as a concern I don&#x27;t think is much of a revelation. Like yeah, unauthorized access is a privacy concern, who woulda known.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41297130" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41297130" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tsimionescu</span><span>|</span><a href="#41296871">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41297553">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41295742">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41297130">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41297130">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Whenever you use an online service, you share at least all of your data related to that service with that service (often they get even more data than you think). The companies making your phone, your OS, maybe your baseband, and any advanced attackers may also be getting some or all of this data. Many of these parties may be sharing this data with other parties that they trust, and their employees may be using it for their own ends too. This much is at least partly understood by most people and it is impossible to use an electronic device and an online service without exposing yourself to all of this.<p>But what you don&#x27;t expect is that any other user of that service has access to your data. That is a completely different level of privacy breach. And it&#x27;s also one that people using a dating app in particular have <i>much</i> more reason to worry about than the more nebulous threat from above. Especially when they&#x27;re not out in their community about their romantic and&#x2F;or sexual preferences, and are told by the app that it hides this information.</div><br/><div id="41297538" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41297538" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eru</span><span>|</span><a href="#41296871">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41297130">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41295742">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41297538">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41297538">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The companies making your phone, your OS, [...]<p>These expectations are very different in the desktop computer world.

The willingness and intention exhibited by the animals in this video is just incredibly enthusiastic.<p>Watching that whale check its work is like the difference between someone  sounding out notes to a song as they play them and knowing it well enough to completely rock it. Some people might read about operant conditioning in school and think this is just &quot;circus training,&quot; but actually educating another being so that it can subdue its instincts and co-operate and reason about abstractions is an incredible accomplishment. This video is essentially an example of what could be called &quot;whale dressage,&quot; where the animal is being educated to be fit for purpose. (from the French word, <i>&quot;dresser&quot;</i>, meaning to train, or to set up for a purpose.)<p>The argument about &quot;circus training,&quot; vs &quot;education&quot; is a very old controversy in horsemanship that persists to this day as well, and it&#x27;s oddly relevant to ideas about animal consciousness and ethics around what intelligent life is. Such a great program.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

If you&#x27;ve played the game you might remember the one spot where there&#x27;s a giant sword sticking out of the ground. Since this place also appears in one of the game&#x27;s FMV cutscenes they had to use a real giant sword prop for filming. The person that made the giant sword prop was Adam Savage from Mythbusters.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;gcDCZ2TmTck?si=8J8A4ja1vRGDC9c6&amp;t=150" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;gcDCZ2TmTck?si=8J8A4ja1vRGDC9c6&amp;t=150</a></div><br/><div id="40404669" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40404669" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LeoPanthera</span><span>|</span><a href="#40404460">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40404631">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40404669">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40404669">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Cyan, by the time they got Adam&#x27;s dagger prop, figured out they could do the whole thing in CG and so did not use the prop.

Most of their cash comes from remakes or ports of Myst&#x2F;Riven, and half the time they aren&#x27;t even the ones making the damn ports (third parties have paid them for the rights to do it, if you buy Myst on GoG then you got a version that was ported by GoG themselves).<p>They recently put out Obduction, which on paper seems to be a commercial failure (though I haven&#x27;t sold seven figures worth of games so who am I to say), raking in like $5M total.

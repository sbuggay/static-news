If you&#x27;ve played the game you might remember the one spot where there&#x27;s a giant sword sticking out of the ground. Since this place also appears in one of the game&#x27;s FMV cutscenes they had to use a real giant sword prop for filming. The person that made the giant sword prop was Adam Savage from Mythbusters.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;gcDCZ2TmTck?si=8J8A4ja1vRGDC9c6&amp;t=150" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;gcDCZ2TmTck?si=8J8A4ja1vRGDC9c6&amp;t=150</a></div><br/><div id="40404669" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40404669" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LeoPanthera</span><span>|</span><a href="#40404460">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40404631">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40404669">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40404669">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Cyan, by the time they got Adam&#x27;s dagger prop, figured out they could do the whole thing in CG and so did not use the prop.

That is, The Witness understands that huge challenge is completely fine, so long as it&#x27;s isolated to a specific virtual space, such as a given panel and room. Instead many old games give a strong sense that a solution may be found anywhere in the game so far, or anywhere on any random bitmapped area from a set of 10+ screens. I think the &quot;concession&quot; The Witness makes is to focus itself in order to ask the player to focus. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to ask the player, like Riven does, to be comfortable living in the world for extended periods. Riven does so by unfocussing and spreading itself out over everything: anything might be interactable, anything might be a clue and important.<p>Today, people want progress, and if they are stuck, they want to know exactly where. The sense of anxiety created by totally open confusion is not acceptable. For me, personally, that&#x27;s the moment I open a walkthrough: for example, the moment I feel like I missed something important and I have no idea where.</div><br/><div id="40406306" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40406306" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">voganmother42</span><span>|</span><a href="#40404631">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40406097">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40406816">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40406306">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40406306">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Totally open confusion is how I would describe Outer Wilds, long periods where I was lost and making no progress, and it was absolutely one of the most amazing games I’ve ever played.</div><br/><div id="40406394" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40406394" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bowsamic</span><span>|</span><a href="#40404631">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40406306">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40406496">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40406394">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40406394">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well first I think that Outer Wilds still does a great job at nudging the player in a direction and making them feel like they are doing important stuff, though sometimes this fails.

I think an aspect of making the player feel like they&#x27;re doing something important and not just wasting their time is that for Outer Wilds the game world itself is so interesting and unique that it feels fine to be lost in it.<p>Riven is a series of paintings, Outer Wilds is a beautiful and serene real time fully simulated solar system.

Don&#x27;t watch this spoiler - Play the game&quot; which is definitely the correct advice. If you&#x27;re not sure, play the game.<p>I actually only played a few hours of Outer Wilds and decided to watch others (and particularly Thor) finish it instead because I&#x27;m bad at flying the ship and I found it too frustrating to die unsure whether I was bad at it or what I was attempting is impossible.<p>But I know I&#x27;m weird, I think the Penn &amp; Teller things where they explain the trick are the best, clearly Penn himself doesn&#x27;t agree because you won&#x27;t see too much of that in their newer work. My favourite bit of Portal 2 was playing with commentary on just before &quot;The Part Where He Kills You&quot; where there&#x27;s a frantic portal fling and in testing they realised it&#x27;s <i>not fun</i> if the player accidentally flings the wrong portal. Like, sure, if you actually did that you die, but so what? So - if you hit the wrong button you get the correct portal anyway, as a special exception to the game&#x27;s rules. So yeah, I&#x27;m weird, I like to understand how it works.<p>Outer Wilds (less so the DLC) has a lot of opportunity for you to completely misunderstand and I think it&#x27;s actually overall <i>nice</i> that the game doesn&#x27;t finish by insisting on correcting you. You can keep believing whatever it is, and maybe you eventually realise you were wrong or maybe not. Life&#x27;s like that.<p><i>SPOILERS - Stop reading if you haven&#x27;t played Outer Wilds and think you might</i><p>It&#x27;s very possible to &quot;win&quot; Outer Wilds not understanding why the visitors died. Maybe you never visit the asteroid, maybe you don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s happening there and never go inside, maybe you see what happened but never understand it. This is especially likely if you haven&#x27;t noticed that they&#x27;re clearly right in the middle of everything, they actually have just discovered the Sun Station doesn&#x27;t work at the time!<p>If you understood why they died, it&#x27;s <i>even more</i> possible to not see why Hearthians were spared. Video game protagonists are used to miracles that save them, but your whole species is here and yet other species were annihilated in seconds. Was it so long ago? Well, yes and no. It was a long time ago, but your ancestors were amphibians and like radiation the death is abated by water&#x27;s density so that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re here.<p>It&#x27;s also really possible to not &quot;get&quot; how the &quot;Quantum&quot; rules work. To &quot;win&quot; you don&#x27;t need to actually go meet the last &quot;living&quot; alien although ideally you will, and so you don&#x27;t need to grok the rules well enough to go there.

The thing about Myst and Riven is that they really are full of the kinds of things that players will naturally try to circumvent by looking up solutions: non-obvious interactable objects, branching paths, easy to accidentally backtrack. Basically, full of ways to feel like you are wasting your time. The concessions that Outer Wilds and The Witness make are naturally related to this. Particularly with the latter, Jon Blow stated how much they changed the game to make it clear that the panels were the only thing that needed to be interacted with, and the game makes it very clear from the beginning that each panel can be approached independently. It&#x27;s only with the game&#x27;s environmental puzzles that this starts to devolve, but they are not necessary by any means. Outer Wilds also does a great job of making you feel like you are getting something significant from each time loop.<p>But I must agree with you, the ship has sailed with this kind of game. You can of course go back and enjoy it but you do so with the knowledge that you can be doing other things that feel as meaningful but without the feeling of frustration.<p>Another similar example are MMOs. When I was a kid, my dad and I were really into Star Wars Galaxies. Well, people made emulation projects to go back and play it, but it&#x27;s just not the same for various reasons. I feel the same way with World of Warcraft. It is almost more stark than Riven, because you not only miss the word of mouth and lack of easy &quot;cheating&quot; aspects, but you also feel the distinct lack of open socialising in modern online gameplay.<p>A good example of the opposite would be old Nintendo games. Super Mario Bros 3 is still one of the best 2D Mario games of all time, and in no sense when playing it do you feel compelled towards a modern experience.</div><br/><div id="40406627" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40406627" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">doctorhandshake</span><span>|</span><a href="#40404631">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40406062">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40408894">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40406627">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40406627">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had a similar experience when I bought an iOS remake of legend of Zelda three… Within an hour I found myself circling the border of the accessible area of the game looking for the door or NPC interaction I was missing.

A deeper question might be, is there any generative process that would produce the complexity of Riven without an explicit desire or demand to create such complexity. The complaints by the author in a sense echo the utter impracticality of creating such complex puzzles. Most of the time the practical solution is just to have a key, but that leads to boring bog standard gameplay. Maybe a virtual civilization that only allows initiates that demonstrate a certain persistence and curiosity, but how do you weed out those that simply follow the instructions that others have given?

These were the last PC games I played obsessively. (In my late teens I decided I wanted to be an artist, while gaming was moving in the opposite direction with always more guns and 3D and less story and less art. So for a long time I never played another game after Fallout 2.)<p>In 2016 I was very impressed by the advances in VR, and so I spent thousands on a gaming PC and HTC Vive and the VR edition of Fallout 4. But one hour into the game it was clear that the magic just wasn’t there. I had this expensive setup to put me directly inside the world I enjoyed as a teen, but it was totally “uncanny valley.” The overwrought game design had lost the mystery, and the 3D VR rendering just made everything look cheap and fake.

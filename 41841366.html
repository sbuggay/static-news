If you&#x27;re shipping continuously then your on-call engineer is going to be fixing the issues the other engineers are shipping, instead of those engineers following up on their deployments and fixing issues caused by those changes. If you&#x27;re not shipping continuously, then anyway customer issues can&#x27;t be fixed continuously, and your list of bugs can be prioritized by management with the rest of the work to be done. The author quotes maker vs. manager schedules, but one of the conclusions of following that is that engineers <i>don&#x27;t</i> talk directly to customers, because &quot;talking to customers&quot; is another kind of meeting, which is a &quot;manager schedule&quot; kind of thing rather than a &quot;maker schedule&quot; kind of thing.<p>There&#x27;s simply no substitute for Kanban processes and for proactive communication from engineers. In a small team without dedicated customer support, a manager takes the customer call, decides whether it&#x27;s legitimately a bug, creates a ticket to track it and prioritizes it in the Kanban queue. An engineer takes the ticket, fixes it, ships it, communicates that they shipped something to the rest of their team, is responsible for monitoring it in production afterwards, and only takes a new ticket from the queue when they&#x27;re satisfied that the change is working. But the proactive communication is key: other engineers on the team are also shipping, and everyone needs to understand what production looks like. Management is responsible for balancing support and feature tasks by balancing the priority of tasks in the Kanban queue.</div><br/><div id="41845627" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41845627" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dakshgupta</span><span>|</span><a href="#41845515">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41845956">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41845627">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41845627">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a real shortcoming, the engineers that ship feature X will not be responsible for the immediate aftermath.

It didn’t make much sense to me. So you have Joe punching code like there’s no tomorrow and introducing bugs because features must go live asap. And then it’s me the one fixing stuff.

Everyone sitting back in defence, then the occasional hail mary long pass up to the opposite end. I would love to see a more well developed understanding within companies that certain teams, and the processes that they have are defensive, others are attacking, and others are “mid field”, i.e. they’re responsible for developing the foundations on which an attacking team can operate (e.g. longer term refactors, API design, filling in gaps in features that were built to a deadline).

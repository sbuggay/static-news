Nothing forced Apple to design their hardware this way: they could have built licensing&#x2F;compliance limits into the hardware itself.

Should a hardware manufacturer, or OS vendor, be allowed to make a product that blocks malware on their systems (like Windows Defender)? Windows was seen as a poor product because of all the adware that infected it in the early 2000s. That issue has largely been resolved, thanks to efforts from Microsoft. Should they not be allowed to solve the biggest issue that plagued the public perception of their product?<p>I realize I&#x27;m move the goalpost slightly, from hardware to OS vendor, but ultimately, it isn&#x27;t Apple&#x27;s hardware that&#x27;s creating these controls, it&#x27;s iOS, the operating system.

It doesn&#x27;t fully prevent adware infection anyway, but regardless, the discussion is about whether a hardware maker (or platform owner if you&#x27;re going to try to extend this to OSes) should be allowed to prevent 3rd-party software selected by the user from running on their platform.<p>Defender doesn&#x27;t do this: it&#x27;s an optional security application by MS that&#x27;s included with Windows.  Users are free to disable it if they wish.  Nothing is preventing Windows users from running whatever software on top of Windows that they like.  Defender will prevent some malware from running, and many users like this for obvious reasons, and the fact that it&#x27;s included for free unlike competing anti-malware software, but it&#x27;s not so baked into Windows that you can&#x27;t turn it off.  An antitrust argument could possibly be made, along the lines of Windows including IE and putting competing software out of business, but that&#x27;s a different issue than what we&#x27;re discussing.<p>So you&#x27;re right about this being really an OS vendor issue, but Microsoft doesn&#x27;t force anyone to use Defender, and doesn&#x27;t prevent anyone from using competing products.  Google also allows using competing app stores (or even side-loading .apk files), though only a tiny fraction of users take advantage of this.

The negative aesthetic experience of having more icons? Everyone has to oppose this crushed-in-head line of thinking. One meaingless detail that impacts an extremely low brow part of the aesthetic experience - the fucking home screen icons - should not preclude the gain in meaning from 10k-100k more developers who could flourish in the mobile ecosystem if it were to have working discovery. It has the same energy as requiring Helldivers users to create PSN accounts - offensive only in a strictly <i>aesthetic</i> sense even though successful competition and cross promo benefits everyone. The users&#x27; fixation on meaningless aesthetics is wrong.<p>I mean Apple could make discovery pluggable too, all of it could be pluggable and have fewer &quot;icons,&quot; this isn&#x27;t even a real obstacle. There are many, many ideas in this space, and no permissions to do any of it.<p>As it is, the App Store and Google Play are glorified install wizards. Open, install TikTok, Google Maps, whatever. Never visit again. That is 98% of people. That&#x27;s horrible and its Apple&#x27;s fault. TikTok <i>already</i> does not pay any fees.

It&#x27;s better than the US in many ways:<p>1. Eating out.  At many Japanese restaurants, you have a tablet computer at your table, or you get a QR code to order on your phone.  You use the tablet&#x2F;web app (which admittedly doesn&#x27;t always have the greatest UI, esp when you switch to English) to order your food and maybe pay.  It&#x27;s not just big chains like Jonathan&#x27;s; you&#x27;ll even see this sometimes at small non-chain restaurants with 1 or 2 workers.  This kind of tech is mostly unheard of in the US; you have to verbally tell your order to some annoyed worker and hope they don&#x27;t screw it up, and then they expect a gigantic &quot;tip&quot; for simply doing their job.  Partially thanks to the much lower staffing needed at Japanese restaurants, it&#x27;s quite inexpensive to eat out.<p>2. Toilets: they all have electronic controls to spray your butt after you poop.  You can select water pressure, activate seat heating, etc.  These washlets as they&#x27;re called are actually available in the US, but no one buys them except maybe Japanese expats.  Even after the Great Toilet Paper Shortage of 2020, Americans steadfastly refuse to improve their hygiene and adopt this technology.<p>3. Public transit fare cards: in Japan, virtually every public transit system uses &quot;IC cards&quot; based on the Felica NFC chip.  It&#x27;s twice as fast as other NFC technologies, so it gets people through fare gates quicker, which is critical in the crowded Tokyo subways.  These stored-value cards can mostly be used nationwide (tip: get a Suica or Pasmo card, they&#x27;re good almost everywhere).  In addition to train fares, you can also use them to pay for vending machines, many restaurants, and lots more.  On top of this, the Felica chip is built into Japan-market smartphones, so you can do all this with your phone instead of a card.  In the US, the NYC metro system still uses magnetic stripe cards, and while the DC system is more advanced (using stored-value cards that aren&#x27;t as fast as Japan&#x27;s), like all other transit systems in the US, the cards are only good on that one transit system in one city, and for nothing else at all.<p>4. Remote-control air-conditioners.  Called &quot;mini-split&quot; in the US, the typical A&#x2F;C units in Japan are only good for one room, but they come with a remote control and have many functions: cooling, heating, dehumidification, etc.  You can control whether the vents are fixed in one direction or oscillate.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve missed many other useful functions.  Since the A&#x2F;Cs are room-sized, you don&#x27;t have to waste energy cooling&#x2F;heating rooms you&#x27;re not using at the moment, or you can set them differently.  These systems have become increasingly popular in the US, especially for retrofitting older buildings that don&#x27;t have ducts.<p>5. Interpersonal messaging.  In Japan, everyone uses LINE.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but it has great privacy and lots of features.  In the US, most people are still using telephone-number-based SMS from the 1990s.  The US is <i>decades</i> behind on basic communications, easily the worst in the world.  I don&#x27;t think I need to go any further here.<p>6. Bullet trains.  Japan leads the world, and will have the world&#x27;s first serious maglev train between Tokyo and Nagoya in around 5 years.  The US doesn&#x27;t have anything to speak of.<p>7. Combination washer&#x2F;dryers.  Americans think this is a brand-new thing, but they&#x27;ve been here in Japan for many years now and are very common at the higher-end.<p>8. Chip manufacturing.  The US only has Intel, and TSMC is trying to expand there with government subsidies but it&#x27;s not going well at all.  Japan has Renesas and TSMC is expanding here too, with far better success.  Time will tell how this pans out, but given how dysfunctional US society and politics are these days, I wouldn&#x27;t bet on the US doing well here.</div><br/><div id="40667191" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40667191" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Dalewyn</span><span>|</span><a href="#40664158">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40666919">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40664605">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40667191">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40667191">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Eating out.

Why? Because LINE is a South Korean product.<p>Sure, but that&#x27;s irrelevant.  What&#x27;s important is what&#x27;s actually used, which is what my whole post is about: what technology is actually used day-to-day by average people in Japan?  Japan: LINE.  US: SMS.

If you rode a limited express (like Shinkansen or Narita Express), you&#x27;d have to buy two tickets: the basic fare ticket and the express surcharge ticket. The basic fare ticket would also cover your non-express connections, so this was quite convenient in Japan&#x27;s complex transit system.<p>Japan still has that system in place, but the basic fare is usually replaced by your IC transit card or integrated into an eTicket (which contains both basic fare + express surcharge and is tied into your IC card).<p>So if you buy a ticket to NEX on the Ekinet app you&#x27;ll be offered a ticketless option, but you probably wouldn&#x27;t know that means you still need to tap your Suica in order to pay the basic fare.<p>Shinkansen trains are generally using eTickets, which would be even more confusing for visitors, but many visitors are using JR Pass which is completely outside the fare systems (but does need reserved seats).<p>Most of this complexity is inherent complexity, not accidental complexity that comes from bad software. The main issues I&#x27;ve seen with the software in question  are: Lack of English version (Ekinet), Complex registration flow (SmartEX) and flaky authentication (Ekinet).

She was absolutely allergic to letting scar tissue build up. She would tell me about every little negative thing that happened between us. And she would phrase it by talking about her feelings rather than about my actions. (&quot;I felt hurt when I heard you say X,&quot; rather than &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t have said X.&quot;)<p>Suffice it to say, it freaked out. I wasn&#x27;t used to people sharing their feelings with me. In normal relationships, by the time someone is telling you they feel &lt;insert negative emotion&gt;, a ton of scar tissue has already been built up, and they&#x27;re at a breaking point. So I was conditioned to believing that sharing feelings = things have gotten really bad.<p>But early on she would calm me down, and say no, things aren&#x27;t bad, she&#x27;s fine, she&#x27;s just into sharing feelings early and often to prevent the buildup of resentment. So I got used to it, and even started doing the same thing back.<p>Eventually our relationship ended, but I brought the practice to new relationships I entered afterwards. And, unsurprisingly, it kind of freaked people out! Almost nobody is used to it at first, just like I wasn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s incredibly easy to get defensive when someone lets you know that they felt bad in response to something you did. And it&#x27;s usually vulnerable and risky to find the words to share feelings without arousing the other person&#x27;s defenses.<p>Still, when I look back at how I&#x27;ve evolved as a person, I credit this &quot;scar tissue&quot; view of relationships with a lot of personal growth. It&#x27;s given me a habit of confronting people problems head on, something past-me was unconsciously avoidant of. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and being willing to have uncomfortable conversations instead of kicking the can down the road is one of the hallmarks of adulthood and maturity.</div><br/><div id="36096405" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36096405" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shon</span><span>|</span><a href="#36096249">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36096778">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36096405">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36096405">[26 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This style of communication is well defined and works quite well.

The book Nonviolent Communication also basically teaches a similar structured conversation technique. It&#x27;s the stuff that most marriage therapists teach, but it was a revelation to me.<p>I&#x27;m a brutally direct communicator (and I justify myself by saying &quot;I&#x27;m honest and expect honesty from people&quot;) but I also tend to damage relationships (surprise! communication is not about 1 person&#x27;s preference but 2). After many relationships that didn&#x27;t work out, I decided to take a step back and ask myself what I could be doing better, and one of the things was learning to communicate in a way that others found  less alienating, without compromising my own style. I stumbled upon the Imago technique and it has worked really well.<p>One of the major takeaways for me that it is important to <i>validate people</i> and <i>be curious</i>, whether you agree with them or not. I used to think this was a contradiction, and that bad ideas need to be corrected immediately, but I&#x27;ve since learned that it&#x27;s possible to validate people without agreeing with them. The point is to make them feel heard first, and then I can present my own view. Here&#x27;s an example of how validation works (without agreeing): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.onsolidgroundcounseling.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;2015&#x2F;08&#x2F;31&#x2F;creating-closeness-in-disagreement-the-power-of-validation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.onsolidgroundcounseling.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;2015&#x2F;08&#x2F;31&#x2F;crea...</a></div><br/><div id="36098166" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36098166" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JackFr</span><span>|</span><a href="#36096249">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36097286">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36097486">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36098166">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36098166">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When many people describe themselves as brutally honest, they seem to believe that being honest is a license for brutality.</div><br/><div id="36099249" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36099249" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rgifford</span><span>|</span><a href="#36096249">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36098166">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36100811">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36099249">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36099249">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oddly I quite like these people -- provided they&#x27;re internally and externally consistent.

This is the hard lesson I learned after 4 years in a thoroughly depleting relationship where I tried everything to make it work. When I look at my friends in their 40s, some have great partners and some don&#x27;t, and the ones that don&#x27;t have a truly execrable life despite good health, jobs, income, cars, holidays etc. Choosing a good partner matters more than almost anything else.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I am not advocating we put all the bad partners in a camp somewhere. They are fundamentally in a state of suffering, and benefit from help and support. But the way to deliver that support is not by being in a romantic relationship with them.<p>If you are good partner material, consider the following asymmetry: A good partner can be in a relationship with a poor partner, but two poor partners will almost never be in a relationship together.

Shared values is precisely the best explanation to my relationships that wore out in the past, I don&#x27;t think scar tissue was the reason.<p>The analogy of scar tissue could work for symptoms, though: the presence of scar tissues in a relationship may&#x2F;could indicate that conflicts never get fully resolved because deep in the relationship, there is a fundamental misalignment of values, and that&#x27;s what creates scar tissues when conflicts emerge.<p>For me, the real thing that tends to explain my long relationships is the authenticity of someone to her&#x2F;his own values. Which is not to be confused with sharing the same opinions, I can easily be friends with people who vote differently than me, but what I can&#x27;t stand is dishonesty (e.g., inventing theories or excuses to put the blame on the &quot;others&quot;).<p>The reason I think it works that way is in part due to my own character: I don&#x27;t hesitate getting into conflict with other people and more particularly with those dear to me when I disagree or when I feel disturbed by something. I can have intense arguments with some of my friends, my wife, my parents, my boss, but it never damaged our relationship because I think deep under, our values are aligned.<p>Now, what do I mean by &quot;values&quot;? Those are things I characterize as values:
- how you negotiate internal conflict
- how you respond to being wrong &#x2F; corrected by someone else that presents a good argument to you
- how you treat people of lower socioeconomic level (e.g., disdain, disrespect,neglect vs. empathy&#x2F;consideration, etc.)
- how you treat people of higher socioeconomic level (e.g., jealousy, envy, ass-licking vs. admiration, respect, inspiration, etc.)
- whether you behave differently with co-workers situated &quot;below&quot; you vs. &quot;above&quot; you vs. those who can affect your career advancement
- whether you are faithful to yourself and your opinions (aka, whether you can stand the cost or implications of your opinions, or if you change your mind and invent yourself another stance just to avoid any discomfort)
- whether your respect everyone&#x27;s right to privacy or assume you can invade your spouse or child&#x27;s personal space
- etc.<p>So, in summary, yes a very interesting article but I can only disagree with the premise: I don&#x27;t think that scar tissues make relationships wear out, I think values misalignment does.</div><br/><div id="36097308" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36097308" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">HurtByNegatives</span><span>|</span><a href="#36095702">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36096381">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36097372">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36097308">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36097308">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>I don&#x27;t think that scar tissues make relationships wear out, I think values misalignment does.</i><p>Sometimes it can also be a character flaw.<p>While I believe our values were aligned, my partner was very critical about almost everything I did. She was not supportive of my goals. She dismissed my interests, and she often criticized how I did things. We were from two different cultures, but we strongly agreed on many important points (including how to raise children). It was the little things that bothered her. This was bad enough that even friends who visited us noticed and admonished her for treating me like that. A therapist friend also noticed and tried to help her. Probably due to how I was raised, it took me years to realize myself that there was a problem, and it took a few more years for her to acknowledge the problem herself. It was when she realized that her mother treated her the same way. Unfortunately she felt that she was unable to change. I credit it to our shared values that I stayed with her as long as I did.

I think the scar tissue is a bit of a tortured analogy.<p>At some point you just have to let shit go if you don’t want it to build up. These little things are what Dan Savage calls the “price of admission.” It’s important to have good communication skills, to be able to talk through conflict, to be able to give someone space. But if after talking about how your partner loads the dishwasher three times and nothing has changed? Or the umpteenth big fight where things were mostly patched over bit there’s still some underlying pattern that you know is going to come up again? Now you know the price of admission. Is it worth it to you to pay that price to stay in relationship, or not?<p>The speaker confesses their perfectionist tendencies. People like this, myself included, cannot let go of anything. I’ve spent years learning how and it still takes a conscious effort, but it’s better. My zen teacher used to hand students a stick and tell them to let go of it. So many could not - it’s going to drop, messily, onto the floor! The stick might break! You can’t just let go of it like that, it needs to be put down gently, in its proper place, etc.<p>High achieving individuals, especially in a field like academia which heavily rewards certain narcissistic and neurodivergent traits, are just hard to deal with in relationship.

And in most (if not all) such cases, the best way to avoid the scar tissue is exactly what you say: let it go. Is it really <i>worth</i> feeling even a little smidgen of animosity towards this person, with whom you have a relationship lasting many years or decades, because of this one little thing?

If it is, stop feeling annoyed - the annoyance is harming the self and the relationship for no reason. It is an illusion that can only cause trouble.<p>Most of the time that is the end of it. However, sometimes it is a case 1 or 3. Then it is perfectly fine to sit down with Jim and talk feelings. Just do it. Learn to make it sound natural and stilted and people only notice that you seem really easy to talk to. Figure out whether it is case 1 or 3 and whether it can just be resolved on the spot.

Many have been active NVC educators.<p>Maybe they&#x27;ve all been Doing It Wrong, but...I find that when presented with the &quot;NVC way&quot; of discussing a problem, my brain always translates it to the emotional symbols I understand, which are nearly identical to the symbols generated by an overt criticism.<p>That said, I recognize that could simply be a &quot;me problem.&quot; Which I won&#x27;t dispute. I&#x27;m not entirely neurotypical. And generally if something I&#x27;m doing is bothering someone, I try to deal with it; I don&#x27;t make everything into drama. I just don&#x27;t parse the NVC words appreciably differently than a normal, polite request. (Overt hostility does push my buttons, but short of that, it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.)<p>Just saying that NVC isn&#x27;t magic. If the person making the request has a reasonable point, I&#x27;ll acknowledge and do what I can to adjust my behavior. If they seem to be asking something less reasonable, wrapping it with NVC language doesn&#x27;t change the request materially for me at all.<p>&gt; It drives me crazy when I find out people just sit there and don&#x27;t tell me when I&#x27;m upsetting them. Communication, my men! If you can&#x27;t fix it in your own head, get other people involved and talk it through.<p>Agree that people should <i>generally</i> be open about issues. But there&#x27;s appropriate context for everything. I really don&#x27;t want coworkers coming up to me and asking to work through an emotional issue for an hour because something I suggested was different than their suggestion, and my suggestion bruised their ego. Close friends? Sure. I probably have higher than average tolerance for such conversations among those I care about. But I choose my close friends, and largely don&#x27;t get to choose specific coworkers, and so demanding that level of emotional work seems outside of the job description.<p>Also: Totally agree about telling the contractor that dust got everywhere and letting them know that&#x27;s a problem. But for me, it wouldn&#x27;t be at all about &quot;my feelings.&quot; It would be about a request to a contractor to adjust their behavior or that of their subs based on reasonable expectations. I would personally feel foolish taking an NVC approach with a contractor in that situation, TBH. Not &quot;It makes me feel disrespected when dust gets all over the place,&quot; but something more like, &quot;Hey Jim, someone didn&#x27;t seal the plastic around the construction area and we had a bunch of dust we needed to clean up. Can you be sure that everyone knows that it&#x27;s important to keep the dust seal closed?

Resentment in a relationship <i>can</i> be permanent, but doesn&#x27;t have to be. The analogy that every unresolved grievance leads to a monotonically increasing amount of perpetual relationship weakness is, I think, wrong.<p>I think of resentment more like foreign bodies. When I was a kid, I got a chunk of pencil lead stuck in my hand without realizing it. The wound healed over it, but it was still in there. I could see it as a dark spot under my skin. Many years later, my body gradually migrated it to the surface and eventually it came out. (This was definitely a weird experience.)<p>When there&#x27;s some sort of grievance or unresolved conflict in a relationship, I think of it as leaving a little chunk of foreign body or poison in the person&#x27;s symptom. Some amount of this is natural, and you will just build up a little scar tissue and get by. But if you keep accumulating them, they&#x27;ll make you less and less healthy.<p>Often, the best solution is to make sure the foreign body is removed before the wound heals over. When a hurt happens, take the time right then to work through it with the partner so that you aren&#x27;t leaving anything in there and it can heal quickly and completely.<p>But, if that doesn&#x27;t happen (and sometimes it won&#x27;t), you can still dig it out later. It just requires re-opening the wound. The longer you wait, the more painful it is. When you re-open that wound, you will feel raw and vulnerable. It requires a lot of trust and care. Sometimes, this may happen years later, but it can be done.<p>If you find yourself doing this so frequently that you feel like you&#x27;re never fully healed, that&#x27;s a good sign that you aren&#x27;t right for each other. Likewise, if you never feel that you&#x27;re in an emotionally safe enough space to re-open those wounds and clean out the festering gunk in them, that&#x27;s also a warning sign.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36096012" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36096012" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jeffreyrogers</span><span>|</span><a href="#36097198">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36100628">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36096012">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36096012">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I like the analogy and think what he&#x27;s describing is a big reason relationships fail, but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s right that you need to make sure scar tissue never occurs in long-term relationships, at least romantic ones.

He systematically alienated the person doing an important job for him, apparently fully aware of that person&#x27;s shortcomings-- i.e., the contractor getting defensive and not owning up to problems. Yet allowing the job to continuing through these periodic grievances was a tacit acknowledgement in the story that Ousterhout thought the work was decent enough.<p>Then, he uses hyperbolic metaphors to describe what he apparently sees as the only possible outcome if he were ever to slip up:<p>&gt; Because if there&#x27;s <i>anything at all</i> when you&#x27;re giving in that you can feel bad about later, you&#x27;re <i>nuking</i> the relationship - you&#x27;re creating <i>scar tissue</i> with yourself, and that will build up to the point where you <i>wreck the relationship</i>.<p>(Emphasis mine.)<p>(And he ended up wrecking the relationship, regardless!)<p>Yikes! Who in the world could live up to this model?<p>I think a much more workable and reasonable approach would be to reflect on what fuels our own compulsions and shortcomings. To just make up an example-- if I were arguing a point with a contractor <i>every morning</i> in an attempt to convince the five year-old version of myself that I&#x27;m important enough to not be abandoned, I should be aware of the fact that I&#x27;m doing this.<p>Armed with that knowledge I&#x27;d be able to skip at least one morning and go treat myself to some waffles.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36099890" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36099890" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ambyra</span><span>|</span><a href="#36099606">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36099672">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36099890">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36099890">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I can always tell a relationship is about to be over when one person uses the phrase &quot;You always x&quot; or &quot;You never x&quot; or &quot;Why do you always x&quot; or &quot;he&#x2F;she is always x&quot;.

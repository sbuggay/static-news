My memory of the basic story that book told:<p>- The Pope encouraged Galileo to publish a book with his new theories, but just told him to add a theological &quot;escape hatch&quot; (provided by the Pope himself) to make sure he wasn&#x27;t viewed as heretical<p>- The book is a dialogue between three people, one of whom, &quot;Simplicio&quot;, is kind of stupid and backwards the whole book, but in the last chapter says effectively, &quot;Actually I&#x27;ve just been pretending this whole time to be foolish; but actually I&quot;m wise, and let me tell you why.&quot;  He then gives the Pope&#x27;s argument and the book ends -- giving the Pope the last word, as it were.<p>- At the time no books can be printed unless they&#x27;re officially approved by the Church as being non-heretical.  The book was reviewed, and approved, by two different Papal censors in two different cities.  It was only sometime later that the Pope became offended by his words being placed in Simplicio&#x27;s mouth; in what the author I read thought was almost certainly a misunderstanding.<p>As the author said, Galileo was encouraged to write the book; was told some theology to put into it; he did so.  The book was submitted for review and approved twice.  What more could Galileo have done?<p>If I could read Renaissance Italian I&#x27;d go back and read it and judge for myself.  Anyone here read it that can weigh in on the theory that Galileo never meant to offend the Pope?</div><br/><div id="40780508" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40780508" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gjm11</span><span>|</span><a href="#40779832">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40780241">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40780411">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40780508">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40780508">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;law2.umkc.edu&#x2F;faculty&#x2F;projects&#x2F;ftrials&#x2F;galileo&#x2F;dialogue4.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;law2.umkc.edu&#x2F;faculty&#x2F;projects&#x2F;ftrials&#x2F;galileo&#x2F;dialog...</a> appears to be an English translation of the fourth and final &quot;day&quot; in the Dialogue. Here&#x27;s the last thing Simplicio says:<p>[begins]<p>You need not make any excuses; they are superfluous, and especially so to me, who, being accustomed to public debates, have heard disputants countless times not merely grow angry and get excited at each other, but even break out into insulting speech and sometimes come very close to blows.<p>As to the discourses we have held, and especially this last one concerning the reasons for the ebbing and flowing of the ocean, I am really not entirely convinced; but from such feeble ideas of the matter as I have formed, I admit that your thoughts seem to me more ingenious than many others I have heard. I do not therefore consider them true and conclusive; indeed, keeping always before my mind&#x27;s eye a most solid doctrine that I once heard from a most eminent and learned person, and before which one must fall silent, I know that if asked whether God in His infinite power and wisdom could have conferred upon the watery element its observed reciprocating motion using some other means than moving its containing vessels, both of you would reply that He could have, and that He would have known how to do this in many ways which are unthinkable to our minds. From this I forthwith conclude that, this being so, it would be excessive boldness for anyone to limit and restrict the Divine power and wisdom to some particular fancy of his own.<p>[ends]<p>That doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s quite the same as what you&#x27;re saying you read. Simplicio ends up professing a sort of pious agnosticism about what Galileo is talking about. I don&#x27;t get any particular sense from this that we&#x27;re meant to think &quot;oh, hey, Simplicio is much smarter than we were giving him credit for being&quot;.<p>(I do not know enough about any pope&#x27;s astronomical opinions to have a useful opinion on how closely Simplicio&#x27;s professed positions match those of the pope, or how likely it is that Galileo was and&#x2F;or seemed to be making fun of the pope. My highly inexpert impression was that Simplicio wasn&#x27;t modelled on the pope specifically but on other people with whom Galileo had more of a grudge.)</div><br/><div id="40780847" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40780847" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gwd</span><span>|</span><a href="#40779832">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40780508">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40780411">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40780847">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40780847">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for that; this part in particular:<p>&gt; I do not therefore consider them true and conclusive; indeed, keeping always before my mind&#x27;s eye a <i>most solid doctrine that I once heard from a most eminent and learned person</i>, and before which one must fall silent,<p>Assuming that the following really is the &quot;theological angle&quot; suggested by the Pope, it&#x27;s literally saying that the Pope is a most eminent and learned person, and that the argument he&#x27;s made is &quot;solid doctrine&quot; and an unassailable argument.  And Simplicio isn&#x27;t coming up with the argument himself; he&#x27;s saying he&#x27;s heard it from this other eminent and learned person.  All that&#x27;s perfectly consistent with a good-faith attempt to flatter the Pope&#x27;s wisdom and influence, and accommodate his request regarding the theological &quot;escape hatch&quot;.<p>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s also fairly open to being construed as being a sarcastic insult... or even an attempt at a sort of &quot;dog whistle&quot;, where &quot;devout&quot; people take it as face value, but people &quot;in the know&quot; take it as being sarcastic.<p>EDIT: And, seriously:<p>&gt;  I know that if asked whether God in His infinite power and wisdom could have conferred upon the watery element its observed reciprocating motion using some other means than moving its containing vessels...

as an employed guy I know I&#x27;m exchanging time for value. But I also get time during the weekends and a few hours outside work. These allow me to think about things outside work, like dabble in learning new things, work on side projects, read a book, do non-career related stuff etc.
This is the most basic, and I&#x27;d do everything in my power to avoid getting in a situation where I absolutely have no&#x2F;minimal time freedom. Got bitten by this in the recent past: I simply said yes to people close to me; committing to doing certain things (&quot;I&#x27;ll build you a shopify store&quot;) and then realizing I&#x27;d put myself into a hole. Never again family person.<p>maximizing every chance to be useful to others at work:
It&#x27;s a great feeling when I could help someone and them thanking me for the help. It&#x27;s silly, I don&#x27;t need validation to do the work for which I get paid. But when a big part of the work you do goes unnoticed, your ears perk up when the occasional praise comes your way. So that&#x27;s why I try to teach my juniors some coding trivia at least once a day.<p>close the week without any debt:
Even if there&#x27;s enough time for a task next week, if I could find the time to do the core work needed for the task this week, then I&#x27;d do it. Even if it meant spending an hour or so on the weekend. I just don&#x27;t like work piling up for the next week.<p>extract more out of the transaction:
yes I get paid for the work I do at my job. But if I choose to, I can get <i>more</i> out of the work.
Things I learned at the project, access to specific tech&#x2F;hardware that&#x27;d be difficult to get all by myself etc.
Translate these bits into things that can help you. Make them as blog&#x2F;linkedin posts, learn some new tech with your laptop etc.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41545978" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41545978" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chrisdbanks</span><span>|</span><a href="#41546164">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41546016">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41545978">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41545978">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would also add to this.<p>Aligning your personal goals with your company&#x27;s mission can be a game-changer in achieving both professional success and personal fulfillment.

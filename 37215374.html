I think most people who joined were hardcore into mechanical or programming, and I was the only socially awkward freshman who wanted to join the seemingly &quot;boring&quot; electronics sub-team. That half-semester of after-school mentoring really added to my motivation and confidence for other pursuits I would later pursue in high school.<p>Suffice it to say, FRC and other precollegiate STEAM competitions like it are some of the best opportunities I&#x27;ve witnessed for younger people to get hands-on experience with engineering.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37232609" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37232609" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Geisterde</span><span>|</span><a href="#37230859">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37231251">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37232609">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37232609">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Still waiting for a battlebots season, would love to see a bunch of lockheed and NASA funded battlebots go head to head.

I heard about it quite recently, and was sad that it was introduced too late for me to experience it.<p>I founded a private Vex team with my friends in middle school, and though we had absolutely no clue what we were doing we somehow managed to bug local coaches enough to get some good advice and figure out a vauge direction to go in. We had no funding and could not afford to pay for a full field, and so rather than forgo an autonomous routine, I wrote code for what I called &quot;replay autonomous,&quot; which allowed us to record an autonomous routine using manual driver control on the practice field the day of the competition, then &quot;replay&quot; it without driver input during the competition. Sadly, our team disbanded because we all ended up in different places for high school, but that year is still one of my fondest memories.</div><br/><div id="37231811" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37231811" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">arjvik</span><span>|</span><a href="#37231805">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37230854">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37231811">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37231811">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Also, curious to hear if you enjoyed FTC or Vex more.

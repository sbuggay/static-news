I&#x27;m down 13% of my body weight. I realized that frequent cannabis consumption interferes with the weight loss, so I&#x27;ve kicked the habit from daily to occasionally on weekends. I&#x27;ve started walking 2-3 miles a day, 2-3 days a week regularly, in addition to eating less and being more motivated to calorie count.<p>All this to say, this drug has been life changing for me. I spend more time doing things I want to do, depression and anxiety have less of a hold on me now. I feel that this drug has allowed me to be the best version of myself I have been in a long time. The only side effects so far have been positive. I do worry about what I will do once it&#x27;s time to titrate off the weekly dose and the best I can think of is that the habits I&#x27;m forming in the time on the drug I will have the resolve to continue after cessation.<p>I say this because I have battled depression, anxiety and obesity issues my entire life. I&#x27;ve had many failed attempts at getting back to a healthy, productive and non-obese lifestyle.

A significant number of people end up obese because they&#x27;re poor. This seems silly at first, right? Go to the grocery store, buy good whole food, cook, save money! There&#x27;s problems with this: Many poor people work long hours and have difficulty finding the time or energy to cook. Even when they do, many of the cheapest food items are also the most calorie dense and worst calorie:satiety ratios. So this starts them on a cycle of eating the sort of food that makes you fat. And then the fatter you get, the more feedback cycles you have encouraging you to continue getting fatter - such as the well researched links between obesity and leptin. So they get fat, their kids get fat, and it becomes ever more difficult to stop being fat, all because that&#x27;s the food they could afford to feed their families with.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41817438" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41817438" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">christianqchung</span><span>|</span><a href="#41812493">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41817160">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41817501">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41817199">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41817438">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41817438">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Even if you were completely right, you might as well start shaming Africans for &quot;needing&quot; malaria vaccines.

And that’s <i>before</i> you consider the genetic factors, environmental factors, food deserts, and the other dozen reasons it’s so hard to stay fit for some people.<p>I am genetically gifted in some ways; an athlete’s metabolism was not one of them. I can be extremely disciplined, but the constant vigilance creates this “food noise” in your head that’s hard to explain, but extremely stressful, and causes you to constantly be seeking the next meal.<p>It used to be that every single food I put in my mouth tasted amazing (within reason). Apparently this is not true for everyone, and they have a greater and sharper distinction between “foods that are amazing” and “foods that are just <i>fine</i>”. That distinction exists for me now, and never really did before this medication.<p>There are so many ways it has helped me. My blood labs are perfect, and my liver was definitely not perfect before. My A1C was just on the cusp of prediabetic, at 5.7%. My triglycerides, ALT, AST… all were wayyyyy higher than they should have been.<p>A1C at last test a few months ago was 5.0%, and all the other numbers are well within low-mid range of where they should be.<p>Anyone that looks at someone using GLP-1 medications and thinks they’re “cheating” is a child. You still have to put in the work; you still have to eat right and work out and lift. It just makes it <i>actually possible to do that</i> for the first time in many people’s lives. I don’t know if you’ve ever put on a realistic “fat suit,” but trust me when I say that <i>everything is harder</i> when you’re heavier. A walk around the block <i>is</i> an insane workout if you are 450lbs and haven’t walked in years. It’s not where you should end, but it <i>is</i> a start, and if there is a medication that helps someone start… everyone else can fuck right off. You will never find me shaming someone else or judging them for <i>getting healthy</i>, which is the actual point more than just losing weight.<p>There is one way to get off the medication in the future (or get on the lowest dose, etc): build significant muscle mass. That’s why it’s so important to lift.<p>One common argument I’ve heard against GLP-1 meds is the idea that you’ll have to be on the meds forever. And for some people, maybe even most, that may be true. We don’t know yet.<p>But you know what’s worse than being on a GLP-1 med forever? Being obese forever. We know <i>precisely</i> just how that kills so many of us.<p>But you’re right, we should just go back to the way it was.

They will not pay for GLP-1s, but they will send you a newsletter about losing weight if you want.

If you break the addiction and it could very well remain.<p>An example is tobacco&#x2F;nicotine. If you stop smoking while you are on the drug and you break the addiction and the habit, you aren&#x27;t going to reform that habit unless you start smoking again. And that&#x27;s unlikely to occur because you no longer have the habit, you no longer have the chemical compulsion, and you aren&#x27;t consuming any of it. Maybe stress could force a relapse due to weakness of mind but all things considered that&#x27;s minor relative to the chemical addiction and the habit forming behavior.<p>An example where you may see relapse is alcohol or marijuana where the substance comes almost more from a social environment than it does from the chemical draw. Like once the habit is broken, it&#x27;s still easy to be put into situations where recreational use is common and more or less expected on rare or semiregular occasions. That of course could lead to new habits forming and leading to relapse or it may not depending on what other (hopefully healthy) habits the user is now taking part in, their stress level, and other aspects of their life.<p>So the answer is of course that it depends but if the drug can reliably help people break habits then it can maybe also be useful in helping them avoid forming new bad habits or relapsing when the urge becomes too strong to resist.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41813441" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41813441" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Someone1234</span><span>|</span><a href="#41812493">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41813420">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41813588">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41813462">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41813441">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41813441">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What is the core of your point?

Before this, I didn&#x27;t think about it too much (I am not obese myself).<p>I notice now that there is a LOT of judgement, bias(?), around obesity, that people, obese or not, carry with them [1]. I certainly carried that bias, and the reason I noticed it was because Ozempic is literally an external substance that you take that simply makes obesity go away. So if you believe (like most of us unconsciously do) that obesity is a personal failing or an issue of willpower, an issue of personal merit -- HOW is it possible that a chemical pill, an external chemical process, can SO effectively resolve it? When no amount of hectoring and moralizing and willpower can? My inability to square that circle really changed my thinking about obesity in a fundamental way.<p>Already there is a reaction to Ozempic -- like people thinking that taking Ozempic is a personal failing, or judging celebrities, for taking it, thinking it&#x27;s the &quot;easy way out&quot; -- I think the origin of that is this very deep unconscious bias that we all have about what obesity actually <i>is</i> fundamentally.<p>My view: It is a health condition, that people do not choose. Not unlike diabetes, celiac, or clinical depression. We should be focused on how to improve the lives of people who suffer with that health condition. We all agree insulin is unequivocally a good thing; that it&#x27;s not a &quot;personal failure&quot; or &quot;cheating&quot; to take insulin; that it really is simple as, diabetes is a health condition and insulin is used to treat it. Ozempic? Same. Exact. Thing.<p>It&#x27;s really heartening to hear your experience. Your post really struck me, I felt exactly the same way after getting on a CGM + Insulin Pump for my Type 1 Diabetes.

I certainly carried that bias, and the reason I noticed it was because Ozempic is literally an external substance that you take that simply makes obesity go away. So if you believe (like most of us unconsciously do) that obesity is a personal failing or an issue of willpower, an issue of personal merit -- HOW is it possible that a chemical pill, an external chemical process, can SO effectively resolve it? When no amount of hectoring and moralizing and willpower can? My inability to square that circle really changed my thinking about obesity in a fundamental way.<p>I see no contradiction here. That ozempic works doesn&#x27;t imply that willpower isn&#x27;t real or that people can&#x27;t lose weight via diet and exercise.<p>&gt; My view: It is a health condition, that people do not choose. Not unlike diabetes, celiac, or clinical depression. We should be focused on how to improve the lives of people who suffer with that health condition. We all agree insulin is unequivocally a good thing; that it&#x27;s not a &quot;personal failure&quot; or &quot;cheating&quot; to take insulin; that it really is simple as, diabetes is a health condition and insulin is used to treat it. Ozempic? Same. Exact. Thing.<p>I&#x27;m very suspicious of &quot;it&#x27;s a health condition&quot; applied to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and even depression.

Of course that doesn&#x27;t imply that there should be a taboo against medication to help people who can&#x27;t.

I see it as a failure of information and choices.<p>Obesity was rare until the United States officially decided in 1977 that saturated fats were considered harmful. A few years later, it started rising to the current epidemic level. We&#x27;ve come a long way since the American Heart Association was recommending candy and soda as &quot;healthy&quot; alternatives to real food, but the idea that an optimal diet contains low saturated fat and high complex carbohydrates remains firmly entrenched in present-day nutritional and medical orthodoxy.<p>Imagine a counterfactual where Congress had reached the opposite conclusion, instead recommending a standard diet full of saturated fats, high in salts (both sodium and potassium), moderate in monounsaturated fats, low in polyunsaturated fats, and sparing in carbohydrates. The population and food industry would have moved in an entirely different direction. We&#x27;d have a whole different universe of nutritional advice, diet trends, restaurant menu options, and easily available processed foods. A lot would be the same, but large sections of the grocery store would look like lowcarbfoods.com, maybe burger joints would serve mozzarella sticks instead of fries, maybe instead of potato chips and corn chips people would eat pork rinds and kale chips, and maybe instead of rice or potatoes an average dinner would include all manner of delicious fried vegetables. Instead of a low(er)-fat (i.e. high(er)-carb) diet, doctors would tell fat people to try keto. Maybe that timeline&#x27;s equivalent to trans fat would be sugar alcohols and artificial sweeteners, and governments would ultimately pressure the industry to transition to stevia, monk fruit, and inulin fiber.<p>In such an alternate universe, I&#x27;m sure the food industry would still work overtime to find ways to make many of its products shitty and addictive, and I&#x27;m sure the average person would still lean heavily on processed foods and fast food over home cooking and whole foods. I&#x27;m sure that would cause its own set of health issues, but what I highly doubt it would cause is an obesity epidemic. It&#x27;s simply a lot harder to overeat fats than it is carbs. We&#x27;d also inherently have less insulin resistance, which means less type 2 diabetes, less dementia, and probably a good amount less of mental&#x2F;neurological issues like depression and anxiety.<p>Unfortunately, we live in this universe. And in this universe, I find it really hard to blame individuals for struggling with obesity when we&#x27;ve practically purpose-built an environment to make us fat and keep us that way. In order to not be fat (by pre-1980 standards), you either have to win the genetic lottery, be extraordinarily physically active, put a high amount of effort into controlling your caloric intake, or be willing to go against the grain (no pun intended) on what you&#x27;ve most likely been led to believe for your entire life by everyone and everything around you. It&#x27;s great to fall into one of those four buckets, but on a population scale it should be obvious that the majority wouldn&#x27;t.</div><br/><div id="41814884" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41814884" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fortran77</span><span>|</span><a href="#41812493">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41814049">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41813614">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41814884">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41814884">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Do you view a chronic smoker as a failure of character or willpower?</div><br/><div id="41815021" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41815021" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">buu700</span><span>|</span><a href="#41812493">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41814884">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41813614">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41815021">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41815021">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wouldn&#x27;t say inherently. Trying and failing to quit is plainly a failure of willpower on some level, albeit an understandable one given varying levels of nicotine addiction. Perhaps it could also be a failure of information (helpful techniques, etc.), although I&#x27;m not familiar enough to comment in detail on what quitting smoking is like.<p>On the other hand, is picking up the habit in the first place, or choosing not to attempt to quit, a failure of character? I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s for anyone other than the individual to decide. I personally feel it&#x27;s unwise given that in 2024 smoking tobacco is pretty much universally known and accepted to be wildly unhealthy, but if someone weighs the tradeoffs and decides that maybe it has social and&#x2F;or professional and&#x2F;or mental benefits for them that outweigh the downsides, I wouldn&#x27;t call that a character flaw so much as a decision that I&#x27;d highly disagree with. I&#x27;d say the same whether we were discussing tobacco or meth.<p>---<p>Edit: More to the point I now see you were probably getting at, there&#x27;s a pretty big difference in the knowledge and time&#x2F;resource investment required to stop buying cigarettes (which costs nothing) and to adopt a low-carb or ketogenic diet that a particular individual would be happy with long-term. I&#x27;ve been keto for over 12 years, and I have a routine that I enjoy, know my way around a kitchen, know what foods I like, and know all the right ingredients and recipes to use to create any food I might want to eat in a keto-friendly form that&#x27;s as good as or better than what I could otherwise buy at a store or restaurant. For example, I make some of the best ice cream I&#x27;ve had anywhere (sometimes in flavors that I&#x27;ve never seen commercially available), and the one time I cheated for a New York slice I was disappointed because it didn&#x27;t hold up to the pizza I&#x27;d already been making at home.<p>Maintaining my diet takes zero willpower, because I enjoy it even more than my diet from when I was fat, and I never had to starve myself or give up my sweet tooth. The problem is that for that to work it required not just the inclination to research and adopt keto in the first place (a major hurdle in itself), but turning it into a dedicated hobby with development of knowledge and skills that I wouldn&#x27;t expect the average person to casually pick up. That may work for me, but isn&#x27;t a scalable solution for the population at large. On the other hand, if I could magically reformulate every food product in the world based on what I know from experience works, no one would struggle to eat a high-fat diet because that would just be the default instead of high-carb.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41813614" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41813614" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">j-a-a-p</span><span>|</span><a href="#41812493">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41812839">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41814049">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41814628">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41813614">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41813614">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The willpower frame actually works pretty well for a lot of people.

It also seems like the muscles will likely function better with less insulin resistance:<p>&gt; <i>Intentional weight loss causes a greater relative decrease in body fat than FFM or SMM, so the ratio of FFM&#x2F;SMM to fat mass increases. Accordingly, physical function and mobility improve after weight loss despite the decrease in FFM&#x2F;SMM, even in older adults with decreased FFM and SMM at baseline. In addition, weight loss improves the “quality” of remaining muscle by decreasing intramyocellular and intermuscular triglycerides and increasing muscle insulin sensitivity</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;tirzepatidecompound&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1dtzr2l&#x2F;recent_jama_article_on_muscle_loss_of_those_who&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;tirzepatidecompound&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1dtzr2...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41816180" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41816180" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">onionisafruit</span><span>|</span><a href="#41813072">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815439">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815992">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815692">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41816180">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41816180">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are you saying that us fatties should move to those other countries where our “behavior” will be kept in check?</div><br/><div id="41817343" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41817343" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">unlikelytomato</span><span>|</span><a href="#41813072">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41816180">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815692">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41817343">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41817343">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t understand the hostility.

There are folks who have serious health issues or disabilities that preclude exercise... but the rest of us [the majority?] can walk more, do body weight squats, some form of incline push ups, and so forth and build larger successes on top of smaller ones.  We can start by taking a morning and evening walk.<p>We all can make healthier decision about what food we put into our bodies (a lot could be done to make our food supply healthier, as well). I find I have to be more strict about eating right as I get older to maintain my health.<p>I feel like folks saying &#x27;fitness&#x27; isn&#x27;t in reach [for most&#x2F;many of us] is a cop out.  This is anecdotal, but i know people who have lost 100+ lbs in their 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s and completely turned their life around; I know people who have reversed Type-2 diabetes through diet and exercise.  These people have busy lives with a lot of responsibility... some of these people live in city areas where access to gyms or outdoor spaces for walking, etc. is not convenient.<p>I have a few doctors and other medical professionals in my family... knowing what I know, I am &#x27;almost terrified&#x27; of becoming metabolically unhealthy and overweight. Many of the maladies that afflict us are metabolic disorders (in whole or in part) due to the long term effects of poor diet, lack of exercise &amp; quality sleep (high stress doesn&#x27;t help either). Poor metabolic health tremendously increases risk of almost every disease and malady: diabetes, heart disease, heart attack, dementia &amp; Alzhiemer&#x27;s, many cancers, stroke, depression and other mental illnesses, sleep apnea, susceptibility to infectious disease, etc. Poor metabolic health also indirectly leads to higher likelihood of issues causing chronic pain: e.g., herniated discs in the spine, ankle&#x2F;knee&#x2F;hip problems, migraine headaches.<p>I&#x27;m glad Ozempic exists but it is not a cure... it is an aid towards building a healthier life. Use Ozempic as a tool, by all means!!, to start your journey and get yourself into a better situation physically. But please use that good start to pursue the &#x27;best&#x2F;healthy you&#x27;... do it for yourself.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41814371" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41814371" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">timeinput</span><span>|</span><a href="#41813072">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41814035">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41816709">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41814188">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41814371">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41814371">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Something like 15% of the world lives in extreme poverty.

Bananas, peaches are ready to go, almost no prep required.<p>- steaming fresh broccoli takes 3-5 min of prep... and about 15-20 minutes total.<p>- Equally important is making small decisions to avoid or limit less healthy foods, which requires no time at all and often saves us money [that we can spend on healthier foods instead].<p>Exercising: 30-60 minutes a day, most days, is ideal but anything is better than nothing. A morning and evening 20 minute walk is great place to start (and can be so relaxing).  If a person spends time on Hacker News, they could instead allocate that time to exercise.  There are free 15 minutes yoga videos on Youtube. A set of push ups requires 60 seconds. Sometimes I do body weight squats at my desk at work (especially during Teams calls, camera off of course).<p>Sleep: get at least 7 hours of sleep a night... ideally starting to bed before 11pm. more sleep gives us more energy to put towards being awesome during the day and more energy for exercise and doing the extra work to eat better.<p>I think almost everyone can set aside 6-10 hours in their week towards building their health.

Some subset<p>Luckily there&#x27;s a precise term from economics we can use here to split the difference: Opportunity cost. I can certainly concede that in some people&#x27;s lives the <i>opportunity cost</i> to working out is higher. In some lives you make a lot more money per hour worked than you do working out, and so it&#x27;s not a surprise more people on the margin in those situations choose the former over the latter. If you dislike even having that option on the table, the good news is you can move to someplace where you make less money, and then that opportunity cost will go down, because working out is pretty much the same wherever you go.<p>One more sophisticated take of course is to claim people don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s good for them, and they discount the true value of working out far too heavily. (s&#x2F;working out&#x2F;eating less&#x2F;g, or whatever other health promoting difficult activity you wish to sub in here.)

She noticed some mild nausea - she even said she didn&#x27;t throw up. That&#x27;s mild nausea. She was thirsty - this makes sense. Food contains water, so she was probably dehydrated which contributes to the nausea. She should have drank more water. Finally, she did not want to eat. That is the intended effect of the drug. Sounds like it did exactly what it was designed to do.<p>Yes, gastroparesis can happen. This is not a shocker, as GLP-1 agonists affect the rate of gastric emptying. Gastroparesis is ... a slowing of gastric emptying. 750 out of nearly 150,000 GLP-1 patients experienced gastroparesis. This is about double the incidence in the general population. In very rare cases of gastroparesis you can experience blockages, but that is very much the exception, not the rule. Even so, this is why it&#x27;s important to meet regularly with your doctor, discuss how you&#x27;re feeling while on the drug, and get medical attention if you discover you&#x27;re not shitting and normal methods don&#x27;t improve things.<p>There are many useful, common drugs that have side effects that seem scary but are rare. ACE inhibitors are wonderful, well-tolerated drugs for controlling blood pressure, but long term use can cause kidney issues in very rare cases.

GLP-1s were 71% of Novo’s revenue in 2023, 16% of Lilly’s in 2023, and 26% of Lilly’s in 2024Q1. If these sales are proportional to the manufacturing capacity used to create those drugs, then about 40% of Novo and Lilly’s combined estimate of $45 billion in gross PP&amp;E is for GLP-1s, for a total of $18 billion; $25 billion would then mean a 140% increase in GLP-1-relevant PP&amp;E.&quot;<p>Manufacturing investment is not proportional to sales, because there&#x27;s a fixed cost to making a certain drug regardless of how much you sell.

They can be made for no more than $2.83 per month’s supply, the authors concluded, based on interviews with former employees and consultants to injection device manufacturers. One Ozempic pen is used weekly and lasts a month.<p>So while the injection pens are significantly more expensive than manufacturing the drug itself, they are still relatively cheap.

Used to be that two eggs and two pieces of toast was breakfast.  Now I better skip at least one of those pieces of toast or I&#x27;m going to feel overfull and might get reflux as punishment.<p>But there are some unexpected positives.<p>Obviously I am eating less.  I have to log food not to keep it in check, but to make sure I&#x27;m eating enough and with the right nutrients.  There&#x27;s another possible negative here -- you get a lot of hydration from food, so if you start eating less you should carefully monitor your fluid intake to allow for that.<p>But I&#x27;m also more focused.  Not nearly as distracted.  I&#x27;m getting a lot of things done which I used to just procrastinate on until years had passed in some cases.  Man, the garage is going to be <i>clean</i> and superbly organized in a few weeks.<p>And my emotions are quieter.  Not just the food noise, that was expected, but I feel more relaxed.  That&#x27;s not what I expected, and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.<p>As an aside, what makes this all really noticeable is that it&#x27;s a once-a-week injection, and the peaks and valleys are <i>very</i> obvious.  Saturday is injection day, but Sunday is where it <i>really</i> becomes quite noticeable that I took it.  Monday-Wednesday is cruising altitude and the effects are good but not over the top.  Thursday I can feel it tapering, and today ... well, I&#x27;m looking forward to tomorrow&#x27;s injection.  I might switch to a twice-a-week split dose at some point to ease the peaks and valleys.<p>Edit: Before someone asks, yes I have considered there may be long term effects.  This is a risk, which I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;m okay with at my age.  Nobody gets to live forever anyway, and I was going to end up in an early grave via another route if I <i>didn&#x27;t</i> do this.  &quot;Just eat less and exercise more&quot; is trite.

And no one candy bar will make you fat, so it&#x27;s easy to think &quot;I&#x27;ll exercise more tomorrow to make up for this indulgence.&quot;  But then you don&#x27;t, because that&#x27;s hard too.</div><br/><div id="41812343" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41812343" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stevenAthompson</span><span>|</span><a href="#41811603">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41812170">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41812458">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41812343">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41812343">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  At any given time you just have to decide whether to have the snickers bar or the apple.<p>No, you have to decide to even think about the difference between them instead of thinking about something in your life that feels more important.

The paper the video is based on is highly flawed.<p>That paper has a few major problems but these are the biggest:<p>1) The authors didn&#x27;t control for body mass. The Hadza and Bolivians burned 52kcal per kg of body weight. Americans burned only 38kcal per kg of body weight. That is: the active groups burned significantly more calories than the inactive groups, on a pound-for-pound basis.<p>2) The active groups were defined as such because they walked ~12km per day. This is significant because the human body is exceptionally efficient at walking. It is certainly true that over a comparable span of time, you will burn less calories walking than you would running, or lifting weights.<p>GLP-1&#x27;s are miracle drugs and people should take them if they at are high risk for obesity-related diseases.<p>But diet and exercise certainly do aid weight loss, and will have fewer negative side effects than a GLP-1 drug.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.germanjournalsportsmedicine.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;archive-2018&#x2F;heft-1&#x2F;editorial-fat-in-spite-of-exercise-an-alleged-paradigm-change-results-from-calculation-mistakes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.germanjournalsportsmedicine.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;archive-...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41812663" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41812663" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pugets</span><span>|</span><a href="#41811603">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41811926">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41812313">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41812180">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41812663">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41812663">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It does work.

The desperation of the medical establishment to get people to do ANY exercise meant the general advice is watered down.<p>It&#x27;s the doom of the statistical distribution. Good outcomes are defined in relative terms on the bell curve, not on absolute performance which exercise is actually suited for.<p>In days of manual labor jobs and lots of walking, people likely burned 1500-4000 calories more per day than sedentary modern lifestyles. I can imagine farmers back in the days of 12-hour days of physical labor may burn 5000 or 6,000 calories. A pound of fat is 3500 calories.<p>Meanwhile, people that are generally following some 20 minutes of exercise five times a week, regimen of the medical establishment are likely really only burning about 300 to 400 calories tops in those 20 minutes sessions, if they even do that.<p>For the sake of argument, we&#x27;re going to ignore the basal metabolic advantages of people that are burning an extra 1,500 to 3000 calories per day and the stimulated muscle growth that comes with it.<p>People back in olden days just on activity were burning a third to a half a pound extra of fat per day in terms of energy.<p>Meanwhile, modern people who &quot;exercise&quot; are burning maybe a tenth of a pound. Only when you get to &quot;athletes&quot; that are &quot;training&quot; do you get to the calorie burns that people&#x27;s lives used to entail.<p>So it&#x27;s important to keep in mind when people say exercise is ineffective in weight loss that they really are talking about very minor amounts of added activity by by modern medical standards.<p>Exercise is extremely effective at limiting weight if you get to what I call the 1000 calorie Hammer, where your exercise is adding an extra thousand calories or more per day to your activity. And you&#x27;re simultaneously not going nuts on your diet.<p>A 1000 calories is a considerable amount of activity. For a 180 lb man, that&#x27;s 4000 yards of swimming, 7 miles of running, or 25-30 miles of biking.<p>If you are a 120 lb woman, increase those distances by 50%.

Because I have done this once, now I can control my weight and have any weight I want, even if I gain weight extremely easily. It is enough to eat one day like I was eating when I was obese to gain enough weight to require a week of weight losing diet to go back to the desired weight.<p>The rules for losing weight and maintaining the weight are very simple, but they must be observed and those who claim that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t work&quot; never try to observe the rules, so it is entirely predictable that it cannot work for them.<p>First, it should be obvious that after losing weight one must eat differently as before, otherwise weight will be gained until reaching again the original weight.<p>To be able to control the weight, anyone who is or has been obese must stop eating until they feel satiated. At each meal, one must plan before beginning to eat how much to eat and then eat only the amount planned, never more than that. One must eat a fixed number of meals per day (preferably few, e.g. only two meals per day should be enough for an adult who has a sedentary lifestyle) and never eat between meals any kind of snacks or drink any sweet of fatty beverages. Between meals, only water or beverages without any calories (e.g. unsweetened herbal teas or tea or coffee) are acceptable intakes.<p>While losing weight, the most important thing is to weigh oneself every day with  precise digital scales (with a resolution of 100 grams or less), at the same hour and in the same physiological conditions, i.e. in the same order with respect to meals and relieving oneself.<p>Whenever the weight is not less than the previous day, then the quantity of food planned for the current day must be diminished in comparison with the previous day. At the very beginning of losing weight there may be a delay, e.g. of a week or so between starting to eat less every day until the weight begins to decrease, but eventually it is possible to reach a steady state of a constant rate of losing weight per day.<p>When diminishing the amount of eaten food, only the carbohydrates and the non-essential fats must be reduced. The amount of proteins, essential fatty acids, vitamins and minerals must remain normal. To achieve this, one must eat a source of pure proteins, for example turkey breast or chicken breast or some kind of protein powders, so that eating enough proteins contributes only a minimum amount of calories. The rest of the nutrients can be provided mostly by non-starchy vegetables and perhaps by some supplements like fish oil. One could also eat almost anything that is not recommended, for instance chocolate, with the condition that the quantity is negligible, which can normally be achieved only when such treats are not eaten every day, but e.g. only once or twice per week.<p>These rules are simple and anyone who follows them will lose as much weight as desired. Obviously, this is easier said than done, because for the entire duration of the weight-losing diet one will be permanently hungry and one would tend to think about food and it will be difficult to resist temptations, so it is better to not keep in the house any kind of food that can be eaten immediately, without requiring some kind of preparation. Unfortunately, this is unavoidable and it is the price that must be paid. After the first few weeks, the hunger sensation diminishes in intensity and it always disappears for a few hours whenever you find some work to do that captures your attention.<p>As long as you do not want to follow such rules, you will not lose weight, but that is because you do not want to do it, not because it does not work.<p>Not wanting to do it is a valid reason, because one may abhor more the feeling of hunger during many months than being obese, but this decision must be described correctly and not be justified by the false claim that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t work&quot;. At least in my case, the improvement in my health and in what I was able to do (e.g. before losing weight climbing a few stairs would make me tired and sweaty) has made worthwhile any displeasure felt during losing weight and I have been very happy to have achieved that.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41812708" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41812708" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pixl97</span><span>|</span><a href="#41811603">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41811926">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41812714">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41812708">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41812708">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;I might switch to a twice-a-week split dose at some point to ease the peaks and valleys.<p>If you&#x27;re willing to shoot up more often it moderates the effects better.</div><br/><div id="41813803" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41813803" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">spondylosaurus</span><span>|</span><a href="#41811603">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41812708">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41812889">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41813803">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41813803">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Might have to float this by my tirz-taking partner, especially if it helps with side effects.

Reviewing literature from other fields I don&#x27;t research myself and forming an opinion on how it applies to my research <i>is</i> part of my job and something I do almost every day. I am even also called upon to peer review articles and grant proposals that are not within my direct field of research, as is general practice to get &quot;outside opinions.&quot;<p>In cases like this, I am able to be familiar with basically everything published on the issue. However an actual researcher in a specific field will have additional knowledge and opinions from firsthand experience, that cannot be found in literature.<p>In general, I think it is okay to have your own opinion on something even if you aren&#x27;t e.g. a professional whose whole life is focused exactly on that one issue. No formal training, credentials, or firsthand experience are necessarily required to have an informed opinion.

I was curious, so I started testing other local water sources including bottled water from various brands; to my surprise they all tested positive for QUATs.

In the last year, I&#x27;ve tested the drinking water in multiple states and countries, and only one source has tested negative for QUATs. It was the water from a drinking fountain in the San Francisco Airport, interesting enough.<p>My suspicion is that QUATs are often flushed down the drain, and the molecules must be too small to be filtered out in the water treatment process.<p>I haven&#x27;t found much research on the impact of QUATs on the human body, but I can help but think our mitochondria would be susceptible to damage.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41814576" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41814576" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">avelis</span><span>|</span><a href="#41812288">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41812956">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41812316">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41814576">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41814576">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I could suppose it&#x27;s some of all of this.

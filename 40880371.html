I don&#x27;t like weapons spending and I&#x27;m a pacifist at heart, but realistically having no defense industry is impossible. There&#x27;s some amount of money which needs to go into researching the weaponization of space, because other hostile nations are spending on it. Do I wish this weren&#x27;t true? Of course. Do I pretend it&#x27;s not true and there really are no gray areas in the world because I&#x27;m naive, or because my priors being accurate is irrelevant to the virtue signaling I&#x27;m trying to do? No I don&#x27;t but it looks like this author does.<p>I&#x27;m sick of these proclamations on the Internet that are the total opposite of realism and really just amount to virtue signaling into the vacuum by their author. It&#x27;s no surprise that this lady works for Mozilla which has been grazing on Google money for years to watch Firefox decay, I guess. Anyone at Mozilla seems to be light years away from the reality based world the rest of us are in these days.</div><br/><div id="40881034" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40881034" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">varjag</span><span>|</span><a href="#40880960">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40881007">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40881034">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40881034">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The whole framing for miltech in the article is infantilizing.

Inside &quot;the power&quot;, there&#x27;s little you can change, but any change lasts.<p>I&#x27;d also say, the ending part about reinventing the bus, is a very common thing, not only among the tech crowd. Every educated person has recipies that they suggest to copy&amp;paste from abroad, think of how they&#x27;d solve a problem, etc. Often times the solution already exists, it&#x27;s the matter of execution (e.g. buses need dedicated lanes, and lanes need enforcement, with fines for parking or driving by them).<p>Often times, the educated folks propose fighting for things that are happening already by themselves. E.g. in post-Soviet countries, you can hear people argue for suburbia like in America, express grief &amp; sorrow for living in apartment buildings, suggest subsidies BUT the fact is cities are already rapidly sprawling in suburbia themselves!<p>Another, opposite trend, is to suggest to evacuate people from depopulating villages. People get so emotional about it. &quot;Villages are money black hole!&quot; &quot;Budget leeches!&quot; Yet, the migration is happening at rapid pace itself already! (Fun fact: these guys call themselves &quot;liberals&quot;, and are pro-western.)<p>Some people can be both proponents of American suburbia, and evacuation of villages.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40880953" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40880953" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hiAndrewQuinn</span><span>|</span><a href="#40881018">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40880933">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40880953">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40880953">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well, trade benefits both parties by definition, so I&#x27;d wager just doing your work is already pretty good in and of itself.<p>I guess if you discover your work has large, hidden externalities, you are morally obliged to quit, at the very least.

Fortunately, we told him to get something where we could either license it or have documentation it didn&#x27;t have to be licensed. Paid license, CC, whatever, but we needed proof we were allowed to use it. Our designer thought using famous people instead of stock photos would sell more. The designer went on to start a web design company that got sued for infringement, and ended up having to settle.<p>I always wondered why if, my designer friend had to settle, how Warhol got away with it.</div><br/><div id="35994515" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35994515" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">reaperman</span><span>|</span><a href="#35994145">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35995092">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35994515">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35994515">[21 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Warhol was previously presumed to be “transformative” work due to Warhol’s reality distortion field.

Whether use is transformative is an aspect of the “Purpose and character of use” factor in fair use analysis. That a use is “transformative” (that is, that it has a <i>different</i> character and use – that it becomes a work of a significantly different kind) is typically, where present, a finding which ways in favor of fair use, but it is neither by itself neither necessarily necessary for nor necessarily sufficient for fair use (though in a <i>specific</i> case it can be either), there is no hard and fast rule, and fair use analysis is <i>highly</i> context-specific.<p>&gt; So basically what I’m asking is why do judges appear to apply the “transformative” rule to visual arts but not to auditory ones.<p>The defendants in the Blurred Lines case did not assert fair use, they asserted that there was no use at all, and that there was no copying and no substantial similarity in the works resulting from copying. Whether they might have prevailed had they done so <i>instead of</i> denying copying at all is…speculation, but it is not an inconsistency that they did not win on an argument they did not make, even if consistency would demand that they should have if they did.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35995256" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35995256" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Retric</span><span>|</span><a href="#35994145">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35995092">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35997434">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35995275">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35995256">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35995256">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One of the major problems with songs is they often “borrow” from songs in competition or even the same style.

I think it made me a far better person. When my grandfather passed away he had no money or assets to his name. You know what he said on his death bed?

As portraits of Prince used to depict Prince in magazine stories about Prince, the original photograph and AWF’s copying use of it share substantially the same purpose. Moreover, AWF’s use is of a commercial nature. Even though Orange Prince adds new expression to Goldsmith’s photograph, in the context of the challenged use, the first fair use factor still favors Goldsmith.<p>That&#x27;s not to say this doesn&#x27;t touch on larger issues, or that this ruling won&#x27;t have wider-ranging implications, but the text of the case makes it specifically about the licensing, not the creation of the work itself.</div><br/><div id="35994159" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35994159" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">btown</span><span>|</span><a href="#35992219">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35992740">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35994159">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35994159">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">From the opinion, as quoted in the article:<p>&gt; “AWF [Andy Warhol Foundation] contends that the Prince Series works are ‘transformative,’ and that the first fair use factor thus weighs in AWF’s favor, because the works convey a different meaning or message than the photograph. But the first fair use factor instead focuses on whether an allegedly infringing use has a further purpose or different character, which is a matter of degree, and the degree of difference must be weighed against other considerations, like commercialism.&quot;<p>It seems like there&#x27;s a strong possibility that if you use any tool, but especially an automated tool, explicitly to generate work &quot;based on Artist Name&#x27;s work&quot; and then you try to sell it <i>for substantially the same purpose</i> as Artist Name&#x27;s original work <i>with an explicit goal to avoid the commercial ramifications of licensing those rights from Artist Name</i>, then the courts might not see that as fair use under this new precedent.<p>This is immensely important, say, if Artist Name is a writer that a studio is trying to replace while maintaining their style by asking an AI to mimic their style, or an actor where the studio wants to use an AI-generated likeness in place of paying them. And of course, this means that studios will try to get these creators to sign their rights away explicitly - which makes some of the current collective action all that much more important!</div><br/><div id="35994421" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35994421" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pmoriarty</span><span>|</span><a href="#35992219">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35994159">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35994923">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35994421">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35994421">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But the case wasn&#x27;t about the style of the photographer, but the close resemblance to that particular photo.</div><br/><div id="35994634" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35994634" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">greiskul</span><span>|</span><a href="#35992219">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35994421">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35994923">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35994634">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35994634">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not close resemblance.

The Gap:<p>&gt; The de minimis doctrine is rarely discussed in copyright opinions because suits are rarely brought over trivial instances of copying. Nonetheless, it is an important aspect of the law of copyright. Trivial copying is a significant part of modern life. Most honest citizens in the modern world frequently engage, without hesitation, in trivial copying that, but for the de minimis doctrine, would technically constitute a violation of law. We do not hesitate to make a photocopy of a letter from a friend to show to another friend, or of a favorite cartoon to post on the refrigerator. Parents in Central Park photograph their children perched on José de Creeft’s Alice in Wonderland sculpture. . . . When we do such things, it is not that we are breaking the law but unlikely to be sued given the high cost of litigation. Because of the de minimis doctrine, in trivial instances of copying, we are in fact not breaking the law. If a copyright owner were to sue the makers of trivial copies, judgment would be for the defendants. The case would be dismissed because trivial copying is not an infringement.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lexisnexis.com&#x2F;community&#x2F;casebrief&#x2F;p&#x2F;casebrief-davis-v-gap-inc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lexisnexis.com&#x2F;community&#x2F;casebrief&#x2F;p&#x2F;casebrief-d...</a></div><br/><div id="35995390" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35995390" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sandworm101</span><span>|</span><a href="#35992219">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35994740">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35993743">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35995390">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35995390">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">De minimus is about assignment of copyright to new works that are only slightly different than the original.

Higher end photographers usually work as you describe, but some, particularly on the lower cost end or in places like malls (think Santa or Easter Bunny pictures), will take dozens of photos for free, but then offer packages of images&#x2F;prints at various price points. Usually there&#x27;s a digital package that will include high res versions of all images along with the full rights, but that tends to be priced relatively high. What some clients might do is to buy a lower end package (or none at all) and then try to make prints of additional pictures from the digital sample images they&#x27;re given, thereby circumventing the photographer&#x27;s business model. The resulting photos are of course of poor quality, due to low resolution and imperfect watermark removal, but some people really don&#x27;t care if it can save them some money.

It does not matter how different the Warhol is from the original photo—how much “new expression, meaning, or message” he added. It does not matter that the silkscreen and the photo do not have the same aesthetic characteristics and do not convey the same meaning. It does not matter that because of those dissimilarities, the magazine publisher did not view the one as a substitute for the other. All that matters is that Warhol and the publisher entered into a licensing transaction, similar to one Goldsmith might have done.

A lot of the comments here seem to be talking about copyright issues that aren&#x27;t present in this case.<p>The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision is linked from the article (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supremecourt.gov&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;22pdf&#x2F;21-869_87ad.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supremecourt.gov&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;22pdf&#x2F;21-869_87ad.pdf</a> [pdf]), and the first few pages summarize the facts of the case and go to lengths to present a <i>very</i> limited scope for the ruling. I <i>haven&#x27;t</i> finished reading all 87 pages, perhaps there is something further along in the ruling that people are specifically concerned about, but if there is, there&#x27;s no hint about that in the comments here or the article about it or in the summary.<p>First, the Court notes that it is specifically testing only <i>one</i> aspect of the Fair Use doctrine: &quot;In this Court, the sole question presented is whether the
first fair use factor, “the purpose and character of the use, including
whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes...”<p>It continues: &quot;...the fact that a use is commercial as opposed to nonprofit is an additional element of the first fair use factor. The commercial nature of a use is relevant, but not dispositive.&quot;<p>and: &quot;...in a broad sense, a use that has a distinct purpose is justified because it furthers the goal of copyright, namely, to promote the progress of science and the arts, without diminishing the incentive to create.&quot;<p>and (most importantly, IMO): &quot;...The same copying may be fair when used for one purpose but not another...&quot;<p>There is some <i>very</i> specific context here. Lynn Goldsmith originally <i>licensed</i> this photograph to Vanity Fair for a <i>single use only</i> as an &quot;artist reference for an illustration&quot;. VF then hired Warhol, Warhol made the derivative work in 1984, VF published it, and VF paid Goldsmith for the license. All was fine at this point.<p>Then Prince dies in 2016, and Conde Nast (parent company for Vanity Fair) contacts the Andy Warhol Foundation, and they say, &quot;hey, we&#x27;ve got a nice Orange Prince you can use&quot;, and they sold a license for that art to Conde Nast for $10,000. Goldsmith did not even know Orange Prince existed. She sees it on a magazine cover, and contacts the Andy Warhol Foundation to say, &quot;hey, I think this might be a copyright infringement,&quot; and AWF <i>pre-emptively sues her for declaratory judgement of non-infringement</i>.<p>The Court decided this case in favor of Goldsmith <i>explicitly</i> because both versions of the artwork are competing for the exact same kind of commercial use. i.e., had AWF merely been presenting this in an art gallery, it is less likely to have been found to be infringing. (And, had AWF not been massive dicks about the matter to begin with, this case might not have even gone to court.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="35991630" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35991630" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">oidar</span><span>|</span><a href="#35995485">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35997162">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35991630">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35991630">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think minority stance was incorrect in this case.

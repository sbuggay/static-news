Way #2 is supported by the use of &quot;shall&quot; in the language used. Way #1 is supported by the fact that Way #2 is batshit crazy.<p>It seems that a lot of people are convinced that Way #2 is the intended one, despite its catastrophic implications for many software-based companies.</div><br/><div id="38148161" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38148161" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">keepamovin</span><span>|</span><a href="#38143849">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38148930">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38148161">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38148161">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One could argue that the tax approach outlined in Way #2 rightly adjusts for the longstanding discrepancy where software development costs, particularly salaries, have been treated as immediate expenses rather than capitalized investments in software IP—an asset with enduring value. The explicitness in software development and employment contracts about the creation of IP suggests this capitalization is a reflection of actual business transactions, making the tax treatment more aligned with economic reality.<p>This change might not be as much an undue burden as it is a logical extension of tax principles applied across various industries. From this perspective, the software industry&#x27;s ability to immediately expense these costs could be viewed by other sectors as an inequitable advantage, one that is now being corrected.<p>While the apprehension around these changes is understandable due to the added complexity and potential for increased tax liabilities, it&#x27;s worth considering that some of the more intense reactions could be driven by a concerted effort from larger entities aiming to generate grassroots resistance against the new rules. It’s conceivable that the IRS, aware of the potential burden on smaller companies, might enforce these rules with a revenue threshold, thus sparing smaller enterprises from the need to capitalize software costs.<p>Moreover, it&#x27;s crucial to recognize the benefits of capitalizing software expenses: it affords companies the opportunity to match tax deductions more closely with the productive life of the software. This can lead to a smoother tax liability schedule and cash flow, particularly advantageous for companies with consistent earnings and those that stand to gain from representing their software development efforts as capital assets on their balance sheets.</div><br/><div id="38148422" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38148422" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PaulDavisThe1st</span><span>|</span><a href="#38143849">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38148161">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38148930">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38148422">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38148422">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree that you could argue all these points.<p>I have to agree, because I don&#x27;t agree with any of them :)<p>While the actual duration of software value is neither the day it was created nor &quot;forever&quot;, the idea that a fixed amortization schedule is appropriate seems clearly wrong to me. Even crazier that it would depend on the geographic location of the person who did the work.<p>The productive life of any particular blob of source code is an awfully complicated thing to talk about, and the idea that the tax code should attempt to incorporate such a concept into a relatively simplistic rule (or pair of rules) seems faintly ludicrous to me.</div><br/><div id="38148643" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38148643" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">keepamovin</span><span>|</span><a href="#38143849">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38148422">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38148930">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38148643">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38148643">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I understand :)<p>So you think software development costs should not be capitalized, right?

Some software is developed and then provides value to the company that owns it in a way that is clearly comparable to other capital investment. But lots of other software just isn&#x27;t. There&#x27;s also the problem of differentiating between ongoing work that is supposed to just be &quot;maintenance&quot; and essentially identical work that is &quot;updates&quot; and &quot;new features&quot;. Even at the code level it is not always easy to tease these apart.<p>Also, the change to Sec 174 is related to R&amp;D expenditures. This is also another aspect of trying to fit a multiheaded hydra into a small sphere: yes, some software development does share many similarities with R&amp;D activities, but lots of software development does not (unless you label R&amp;D in a way that is so broad as to encompass just about anything).<p>If the US wants to force amortization on software development expenses, I think that should be stated more explicitly, and with a much more detailed rationale.

Claiming &quot;shall&quot; is ambiguous because it changes meaning when you put &quot;be&quot; after it makes no sense.

<i>If the substitution rule is applied in the sentence: “The employee shall be reimbursed all expenses”, you would get: “The employee has a duty to be reimbursed all expenses”. This created ambiguity for the simple reason that the intent appeared to state an entitlement of the employee and not to impose a duty on the employee.</i><p>Do they lack common sense when reading this, or do they struggle with English? It&#x27;s like claiming &quot;I have a carrot&quot; is somehow ambiguous because &quot;I have been a carrot&quot; means something entirely different.

However, they are ultimately taxed quite differently: with an S-Corp once you exceed the SSI threshold for the essentially mandatory portion of revenue you must repatriate to yourself as a salary, the remaining income can be repatriated as qualified dividend which is taxed at a significantly lower rate than directly passed-through income. With an LLC, it&#x27;s all self-employment income subject to regular income taxation, meaning that in any realistic scenario, you&#x27;re paying a higher effective tax rate with the solo LLC form.<p><i>So if I went the S Corp route, I&#x27;d actually have to pay taxes on 0 revenue.</i><p>This is false. The income tax on $0 revenue (meaning no revenue, not no profits) is the same: $0. (Note, however, that many states have &quot;fees&quot; assessed on business entities like S-Corps and LLCs, even single-member LLCs, and in such cases a minimum fee is owed regardless of revenue.)<p><i>But as a regular LLC, my own work (as the owner) does not count as anything taxable, so I&#x27;m safe.</i><p>This is also false. The work you provide to the entity as an owner is <i>still</i> an R&amp;D expenditure. The difference is that with the S-Corp, the expenditure cost is clearly documented, while with the LLC you&#x27;re pretending that the number is $0 and gambling on not getting audited. This only matters once you start generating revenue...<p>Either way, not all of your salary would be subject to capitalization. If you have revenue, you clearly spent at least some time and work on marketing and business development, and expenses for those non-R&amp;D activities are not capitalized.<p>With the S-Corp, your salary offsets up to [your salary assigned to non-R&amp;D tasks less 1&#x2F;10 [see note] of your current-year salary assigned to R&amp;D plus carried-over capitalization from R&amp;D from prior years] in revenue each year, and after an appropriate amount of salary (generally the SSI contribution threshold for the year) the rest of that annual revenue can be repatriated to yourself as a dividend at lower tax rates. With the LLC form, since you aren&#x27;t paying yourself a salary, you owe tax on 100% of the revenue arising from the software you develop without any deductions.<p>TLDR: If you actually care about tax, S-Corps are <i>almost</i> always the better option for the solo entrepreneur, and they&#x27;re still the better option here.<p>NOTE: Capitalization is on a mid-year convention, so the first and last year you only capitalize 1&#x2F;10th of the cost; and in the middle 4 years you capitalize 1&#x2F;5th of the cost. So, for Y2, if you paid yourself $100 in salary both years, your total capitalization deduction would be $30: $10 capitalization for the Y2 salary and $20 for Y1 capitalization.</div><br/><div id="38145585" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38145585" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gavinhoward</span><span>|</span><a href="#38143735">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38145330">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38143596">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38145585">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38145585">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The difference is that with the S-Corp, the expenditure cost is clearly documented, while with the LLC you&#x27;re pretending that the number is $0 and gambling on not getting audited.<p>So if the IRS audits me, they&#x27;ll say that my work is worth something and therefore, I have to pay taxes on it?<p>Sounds awful.<p>But I and the accountants I talked to don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not going to take R&amp;D credits, nor claim deductions from salary, so why would they care?<p>And I did the math: yes, an S Corp is <i>technically</i> better.

Whether you deduct 100% or 20% of your salary from $0 business income you still have $0 of taxable business income (and as an individual you don&#x27;t get NOL carryovers so that amount is lost to you forever).<p>In fact, in the event of an audit, you&#x27;d likely get a refund since the IRS would determine that you&#x27;re incorrectly calculating your tax liability by failing to capitalize your R&amp;D expenditure (i.e., your flow-through revenue which is entirely treated as self-employment income). But, because this error affects other years&#x27; returns, which means that a one-return audit can turn into a multi-return audit. It also means you get put on a very special list of taxpayers subject to increased scrutiny (meaning, significantly more likely to be audited again in a future year).<p><i>But at the revenue levels I plan on seeing, the difference isn&#x27;t that much (a few thousand), and any revenue gets taxed right away, which is more convenient for me.

Firms that invest in capital often have large startup costs that go down as the firm becomes fully capitalized. Software development costs seldom go down, but instead expand with the firm&#x27;s success. This is counter-evidence to the idea software is capital.<p>The software produced is also of unclear value and is not fungible. If a firm buys manufacturing equipment and the enterprise is unsuccessful they can sell the equipment. In the case of an unsuccessful enterprise the software almost always is of zero resulting value. Given these rules if a firm invests money in software development, makes some revenue, but ultimately doesn&#x27;t create a sustainable enterprise, 100% (or more!) of the profits could go to taxes with no ability to recoup the overtaxing when the firm is dissolved.<p>Additionally, a firm buying durable goods will be able to buy those goods on credit, using the durable good as collateral.

For nearly 70 years, the tax code recognized the importance of R&amp;D by allowing businesses to fully deduct their R&amp;D expenses in the same year they were incurred. Unfortunately, starting in 2022, the tax code has required businesses to amortize (or deduct over a period of years) their R&amp;D expenses, making R&amp;D more costly to conduct in the U.S. ... tens of thousands of jobs are at risk if the harmful R&amp;D amortization requirement remains in place. As a result of this change, the U.S. is now one of two developed countries requiring the amortization of R&amp;D expenses.

  2. Prior to Jan. 1, 2022, businesses&#x27; interest expense deductions were limited by section 163(j) to 30% of their earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Interest deductions are now limited to 30% of earnings before interest and tax (EBIT). 

  3. Over the past several decades, the tax code has provided businesses with varying degrees of first-year expensing (i.e., accelerated depreciation). A 100% deduction for the purchase of equipment and machinery in the tax year purchased was in place from 2017 through 2022 ... full expensing began to phase out at the beginning of 2023 and will be eliminated completely by 2027.</code></pre></div><br/></div></div><div id="38148883" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38148883" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bunnie</span><span>|</span><a href="#38145699">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38143803">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38148883">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38148883">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Seems like somewhere in all of this there is an assumption that one writes software to profit from its sales.<p>However, in some cases people contribute software to open source projects that are not only Libre but also &quot;Free as in Beer&quot;. Sometimes they get donations or grants to work on such projects. Heck, they might even have a contract from a company that uses this free-as-in-beer software, but, once the contributions are made, the code is free for everyone to take.<p>In this model, there is explicitly no forward looking profit to be had. All parties contractually agree that the value of the work, after it is done, is $0.<p>In this case I don&#x27;t see how it would even make sense then to amortize donations&#x2F;grants&#x2F;contract money on a 5-year schedule when the asset value of the deliverable is $0?<p>I would think in this case that the person doing the development is providing a bona-fide &quot;service industry&quot; activity, and not doing an R&amp;D activity. Thus the wages of that person should be as deductible as any other service-industry worker: There is as much expectation for future profits from writing this code as the person painting your house has future expectations of profits from the higher resale value of your place because of the improved paint job.<p>So at least for individuals being paid to work on free-to-download code, the entity paying you to do the coding may have to write off your contract as an R&amp;D expense, but the individual contractor should still be able to depreciate that payment as a wage within the tax year because they are providing &quot;coding services&quot;, and not doing R&amp;D.<p>This logic has precedent if you consider how capital assets work. Let&#x27;s say a shop purchases a donut machine. The purchaser of the donut machine has to depreciate that purchase over several years. However, the individuals who were paid to assemble the donut machine are paid wages as factory labor, and their expenses are deducted by the donut machine marker that tax year.<p>In this case the donut shop is whoever is paying you to write the code, and the coding contractor is the donut machine assembly technician. So long as the donut assembly technician doesn&#x27;t have a stake in the donut shop&#x27;s future-looking profits, I think it&#x27;s quite clear who is providing a service and who owns a capital asset.<p>I think this logic would also mean that individual contractors who work on proprietary, for-profit code bases but assign all value of their work product immediately to the contracting body would also be a service provider and thus can depreciate their own wages within the tax year. But, the example is not as clear-cut as a work product that explicitly has a $0 expected market value.</div><br/><div id="38149224" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38149224" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bunnie</span><span>|</span><a href="#38148883">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38143803">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38149224">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38149224">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I see now that Section 6.04 explicitly states that if a provider retains any right to use the developed software, they are not allowed to deduct their expenses:<p>&gt; &quot;However, even if the research provider does not bear financial risk under the terms of the contract with the research recipient, if the research provider has a right to use any resulting SRE product ... costs paid or incurred by the research provider that are incident to the SRE activities performed by the research provider under the contract are SRE expenditures of the research provider for which no deduction is allowed ...&quot;<p>Thus, the rule as written would make it such that contractors who write Windows drivers could deduct their expenses (as they would have no rights to Windows), but contractors who write Linux drivers may not (as they would have some rights to Linux).<p>In effect, the tax rules would explicitly double-tax open source software development, due to its over-broad test of whether you <i>could</i> have any right to the code base you&#x27;ve written, irrespective of whether the code you wrote actually has any practical residual value to the author.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38143803" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38143803" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Apreche</span><span>|</span><a href="#38148883">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38144090">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38143803">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38143803">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The thing that I hate most about this rule, as a developer, is that employers keep trying to get me to track all my hours of work.

In a SaaS world, where CI&#x2F;CD is commonplace and things like A&#x2F;B testing are everywhere, and it&#x27;s basically impossible to distinguish &quot;new development&quot; from &quot;maintenance&quot;, the whole capex vs. opex for modern software companies is a total joke that can easily be gamed in either direction. For example, I previously worked for an e-commerce company that <i>wanted</i> us to categorize as much dev time as possible as CapEx, because it made our bottom line look better. The whole thing was a total sham, and it&#x27;s not that the company was at fault, but it&#x27;s that the accounting guidelines think, wrongly, that software development for most web companies can be neatly divided into &quot;research and development&quot; vs. &quot;maint&quot;, and that is just absolutely not possible given how devs at most companies work.<p>Unless it&#x27;s basically &quot;shrink-wrapped&quot; software, which largely doesn&#x27;t exist anymore, software that is delivered by a company that provides that product online and continuously improves&#x2F;monitors it (i.e. basically all SaaS companies), all software dev should be treated as OpEx, period.

I found it interesting that his stories ended up like how the gospels tell Jesus stories. His messages had a main point, but he spoke extemporaneously, so depending on what he had been saying before he got to the story, he would included different elements into the story. One of the last messages I heard, he incorporated a few pieces of context at the beginning that I had never heard him tell before, and although I had heard him tell that story multiple times by that point, it completely changed the meaning of the story. Not that it invalidated the previous tellings, but that bit of context made a big difference to the meaning of the story. The gospel stories read a lot like that. Jesus may have told the stories differently depending on the context, and&#x2F; or the writer may have told the story different depending on the points he was making with the story.<p>Which is to say, I think it less likely that Q was written. Mark is generally said (by people who follow Christ, at least) to be summarized from Peter&#x27;s messages. It seems likely that Matthew and Luke took from Mark as well as a shared source of apostolic teaching, especially since Luke claims to have researched these things, and at least several of the original disciples are traditionally said to have been preaching in the Greek-speaking areas of the Mediterranean.</div><br/><div id="42048112" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42048112" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rodric</span><span>|</span><a href="#42045817">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42046764">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42048112">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42048112">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If Q is not a written source, the Q hypothesis falls apart.

If you have any interest in the scholarship behind the ancient world, Bart Ehrman&#x27;s books are phenomenal.

He is also genuinely one of the best human beings I know, and I don&#x27;t say that lightly.<p>I also really enjoyed his book about suffering. If you&#x27;ve struggled with your faith over the amount of suffering in the world, and&#x2F;or yearn for answers to those hard questions, I highly recommend &quot;God&#x27;s Problem: The Bible Fails to Answer Our Most Important Question - Why We Suffer.&quot;  It actually goes far beyond just the Bible (though that is covered very, very well) and includes much philosophy and other things.  It&#x27;s a deeply personal book where he opens up about his own struggle and really allows himself to be vulnerable.  For me, I was struggling deeply with these questions and had nobody to talk to.  Everyone close to me in life had strong faith and was perfectly satisfied with dismissing the problem as &quot;God knows. He is perfect. That&#x27;s enough for me.&quot;  The book was like having a brilliant and deeply thoughtful friend to have a conversation with, and it was an important point in my life.  I&#x27;ll be forever grateful to Bart for writing it.<p>Disclaimer: Bart is a friend of mine, but I read most of his books before meeting him.</div><br/><div id="42047779" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42047779" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wahern</span><span>|</span><a href="#42041313">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42041773">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42044886">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42047779">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42047779">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Related Wikipedia page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Problem_of_evil" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Problem_of_evil</a><p>The question is a central one in Western philosophy and religion.

This was originally part of what is generally considered to be the first critical edition of the New Testament, published in 1774&#x2F;1775. In 1776 he republished it independently under the title &quot;Synopsis Evangeliorum Matthaei, Marci et Lucae&quot;[2] (&quot;evangelium&quot; = &quot;gospel&quot;). This became a very prominent tool for studying the details of the textual relationship between these three closely related gospels.[3] As a consequence biblical scholars started to speak of the &quot;synoptic gospels&quot; as a shortcut if the wanted to point out the contrast between Matthew, Mark and Luke on the one hand and John at the other.<p>The usage of &quot;synoptic&quot; in reference to charts is also attested in other contexts from this time. For the English language, the Online Etymology Dictionary mentions 1763 as the date of the earliest usage of the term &quot;synoptic&quot; (from Greek syn- &quot;together&quot; + opsis &quot;sight, appearance&quot;) in &quot;reference to tables, charts, etc.&quot;, also used in other contexts such as wheather charts.[4]<p>Today, a synopsis of the gospels typically also includes the gospel of John, see for example Kurt Aland&#x27;s &#x27;classical&#x27; &quot;Synopsis of The Four Gospels&quot;[5]. However, the term &quot;synoptic gospels&quot; stuck to the original set of just Matthew, Mark and Luke.<p>The term ‘synoptic’ in relation to the Gospels is thus derived from a technical term in connection with charts and tables, not from the more general meaning ‘summary’.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Johann_Jakob_Griesbach" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Johann_Jakob_Griesbach</a><p>[2] Here is a scan of this book: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;synopsisevangeli00dewesynopsisevangeli00dewe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;synopsisevangeli00dewesynopsisev...</a> -- The table starts at p. 12.<p>[3] Matthew as based on Mark + Q + extras, Luke as based on Mark + Q + extras. However there is one longer passage in John 7:53–8:1 (&quot;Jesus and the woman taken in adultery&quot;), that is not included in the oldest manuscripts of John, but nevertheless became canonical, that is sometimes refered to as a &quot;synoptic&quot; interpolation into John, although it is not from any of the synoptic gospels, but similar in style to them.<p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etymonline.com&#x2F;search?q=synopsis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etymonline.com&#x2F;search?q=synopsis</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;291923.Synopsis_of_the_Four_Gospels" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;291923.Synopsis_of_the_F...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42045066" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42045066" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Suppafly</span><span>|</span><a href="#42041436">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42041634">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42046711">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42041477">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42045066">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42045066">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So the reason it&#x27;s not synoptic, is because it literally isn&#x27;t synoptic.

Moreover, Justin Martyr (~150 CE) is often cited as evidence against named Gospels, but in the same source he refers to the Gospels collectively as &quot;the memoirs of the Apostles&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t help the case for anonymous authorship.<p>The biggest problem for the anonymous theory, however, is simply that there are no manuscript witnesses to support it: all the early manuscripts have titles.  So the anonymous theory has to posit:<p>- The last Gospel, John, was reduced to writing about ~95 AD.<p>- The Gospels circulated throughout the Mediterranean in anonymous form.<p>- At some point before 180 AD, the Church decided to get its story straight and assigned names to the Gospels.<p>- At that point, everyone from France to India started referring to the Gospels with their present names, without any controversies or mixups.<p>- All of the earlier anonymous manuscripts were lost to history.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that <i>definitely could not have happened</i>, just that it doesn&#x27;t seem especially more plausible than the traditional account.<p>I&#x27;ve read a suspiciously large amount of historical criticism for someone who doesn&#x27;t do this for a living, thinking I would finally get to the bottom of what the New Testament was &quot;really&quot; about.  I came away with the impression that the optimal amount of attention to pay to NT hist crit is either a lot, or zero.  Every generation of hist crit somehow comes away with the conclusion that the NT is really about the issues of concern to that generation.  In fact this has been going on ever since the field was founded by 19th century German Romantics, who discovered that the NT was the product of national ur-spirits expressed through folklore [!]<p>Our cultural familiarity with the NT sometimes keeps us from seeing how strange a collection of documents it really is.  It is perhaps the best attested collection of sources in the ancient world, yet contains a mixture of Greco-Roman biography and history, supernatural events, and mystical theology.  I am not trying to persuade you of any particular view about NT scholarship so much as challenge the idea that there&#x27;s anything cut and dry about it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42045737" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42045737" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Shawnj2</span><span>|</span><a href="#42041436">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42044553">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42044706">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42045868">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42045737">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42045737">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ehh for Mark and Matthew yes.

Its later church fathers who just assigned names to them based on tradition.<p>As someone who was raised in the christian faith, learned the sunday school version of the bible and only later seriously studied the texts (first in theological seminary and later from a purely historical perspective after becoming an atheist) - it&#x27;s remarkable how different the consensus of serious historians is from what most people learned in sunday school.<p>As you&#x27;ve said, we don&#x27;t even know who wrote the synoptic gospels, where or when (closer than estimated decades). Due to the lack of original documents, reliable contemporaneous accounts and other supporting evidence, we know shockingly little with any certainty. It&#x27;s extremely unlikely the authors of the gospels were eyewitnesses to any of the events they describe. I was most surprised when I learned from later study just how much the canonical bible I&#x27;d learned as a child was retconned hundreds of years later through an opaque process of curation and editing by fractious groups of church leaders at events like the Council of Nicea.<p>&gt; In Mark for example, Jesus basically doesn&#x27;t say that he is the son of god.<p>Which is why the many inconsistencies in today&#x27;s canonical new testament are even more remarkable. This is the most consistent version they could assemble from a far larger group of even more divergent, inconsistent texts. Ultimately, the bible we know today is descended from a pastiche of copies of copies, written over decades by unknown authors in different places and languages and then survived several &#x27;negotiated settlements&#x27; between opposing factions arguing over arcane theological points under an overarching power dynamic trying to unite some semblance of a unified &quot;church&quot; (and even what we know of these councils is only the sanitized version written by the &#x27;winners&#x27;).<p>Applying an adult&#x27;s experience of how large groups work and how ad hoc organizations adapt orthodoxies over time and distance (ie &#x27;telephone game&#x27;), the only way to <i>not</i> see the synoptic gospels as randomized fan fiction largely unrelated to any actual historical events is to believe that god miraculously intervened dozens of times over hundreds of years to force an historically &quot;correct&quot; bible to be the surviving version we know today.</div><br/><div id="42046923" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42046923" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">drekipus</span><span>|</span><a href="#42041436">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42045847">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42047613">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42046923">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42046923">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; it&#x27;s remarkable how different the consensus of serious historians is from what most people learned in sunday school.<p>Well one side is &quot;children, once a week&quot; and the other is &quot;full time commitment in history career&quot;.<p>Sunday school is just day care with stories.

I find it really hard to defend this view in my opinion.<p>The idea that these text are just written in 1 go and depend on each other doesn&#x27;t really make sense. There are different styles of writting and so on in these text.<p>Its much more likely that there are multiple layers and that there are interdependent on each other between each of these.<p>As the typical standard attack on Q, I suggest people look at &#x27;The case against Q&#x27; by Mark Goodacre. And he makes the case that if you simply have Markan Priority you don&#x27;t need Q. This made more sense to me then Q. However he still accept a traditional view of gospel creation and to some extent dating.<p>A more &#x27;radical&#x27; approach is being put forward currently by people who study Marcion and in general, the &#x27;Apostolic Fathers&#x27;.<p>One of the big problems with biblical scholarship is that &#x27;Gospel&#x27; period and &#x27;Apostolic Fathers&#x27; period were treated as two different things. So by how the field was split, it was clear that Gospels came before the time of the Apostolic Fathers (this was the standard view in Christian tradition). The problem however is that in terms of external evidence, there is no evidence for the gospel that goes back that far back.<p>The first we have a clear external indication of these text existing with these names, is in the 170s. Lots of people we have text for, seem to either not know the texts, or not think its important. Both are quite strange if you assume they were in their final form before 100. You would assume that after that people constantly use them as references, but they don&#x27;t.<p>So once you overthrow out that &#x27;traditional&#x27; view, and you just assume the gospels are just like many other writing in the second century and treat them no different, all of a sudden lots of things make a whole lot more sense. This reevaluates not just Marcion but also other early church figures like Ignatius.<p>Markus Vinzent and his PhD student Jack Bull have nice youtube channel that you can check out: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@Patristica" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@Patristica</a><p>They work with Mark Bilby sometiems on using methods better then simple word counts and other traditional methods to try to understand the different layers in the text.

See his work:<p>&gt; The First Gospel, the Gospel of the Poor: A New Reconstruction of Q and Resolution of the Synoptic Problem based on Marcion&#x27;s Early Luke<p>(Hard to read, but you can find videos of him explaining a lot it). His &#x27;Q&#x27; is quite different from the traditional one.<p>For those interested, the &#x27;History Valley&#x27; youtube channel interviews a whole lot of different scholars with different points of view in the field on these topics.

Challenging the Existence of an Historical Jesus,&quot; and next up is, &quot;On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt.&quot;<p>I have become largely convinced that the epistles of Paul and pseudo-Paul are writing not about a man who recently lived, but about a being revealed to him &#x2F; them in revelations from god (small &quot;g;&quot; remember, I&#x27;m an atheist). I won&#x27;t litigate their arguments here as I&#x27;d have to write blocks of text, but I have been persuaded that the book of Mark was likely an allegory and it was only with time that such came to be taken literally.<p>The need to reset the expectations of the believers because the arrival of the kingdom of god kept getting pushed back from &quot;this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened&quot; (Mark), to now coming soon following the destruction of the temple (Matthew, Luke), to (paraphrasing) &quot;it&#x27;s coming eventually, so trust in the Church,&quot; (John) created a need to keep reinterpreting Mark (hence, why Jewish Christianity died out and mostly only Gentiles remained).<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s a fun topic if you&#x27;re a non-believer and won&#x27;t get offended by the ideas presented. I&#x27;m enjoying it a lot and thought I&#x27;d share. Q is frequently cited in most of the above works and that was my jumping off point. There&#x27;s also thought to be a &quot;sayings&quot; source that was made up of quotes by Jesus used in the gospels. The thing is, following the Nicene Creed, the variants of Christianity (of which there were at least three documented by ancient historians) were systematically wiped out. Were it not for the works found around the Dead Sea, we&#x27;d have little to go on other than descriptions from Christian apologists; what little we have demonstrates the rich tapestry of alternative beliefs fighting for supremacy (even Paul fought the Jerusalem apostles: Peter, James, John on topics such as The Law and kosher foods).<p>It&#x27;s just after 6am where I live and I just woke up.

Within Judaism of that time the whole Jesus story or similar isn&#x27;t all that crazy).<p>Now clearly Jesus was controversial in many ways and maybe not super Orthodox, maybe it has some more Gnostic explanation...but I just find that highly implausible compared to the much more historically plausible story told in the non Gnostic gospels.<p>It&#x27;s fair to question whether the Gnostic gospels are being faithful to a historical movement or whether they are a form of hellenistic fanfiction for lack of a better way to describe a lot of that content. I think they are interesting...but looking at Judaism of the time and the religion in that area and then landing on &quot;Gnostic Jesus&quot; really seems like a stretch. If anything, I would suspect that somebody like Paul probably played up Jesus&#x27; acceptance of some Greco-Roman cultural stuff during his ministry to try and lessen the culture shock. If gnosticism was accepted and taken seriously I really doubt Paul&#x27;s writing would be what they are.<p>Strategically, putting myself in the shoes of somebody trying to spread the religion of some Jewish guy who maybe got a little liberal with things but was definitely an actual practicing Jew from the Middle East and living in a Jewish culture, the writings we&#x27;ve actually got that are attributed to Paul (as well as the regular gospels) make a lot of sense in the context of the ordinary gospels and new testament canon, and the Gnostic stuff doesn&#x27;t really make all that much sense.<p>Sure, much could have been suppressed or destroyed. But it would have had to have been a pretty thorough destruction for a hypothetical Gnostic canon to have been coherent enough to be remotely competitive with what wound up winning out.<p>In other words, while the Gnostic texts are indeed very interesting and can be fun reads, and there is some debate to be had over canon (but I think a more productive debate would probably be over something like Enoch), the early church and councils and whatnot probably made the right final decision w.r.t most of the Gnostic texts. That&#x27;s just my opinion of course.<p>It&#x27;s always more fun to believe there is a big conspiracy out there trying to supress the true story. But I think a simpler and more realistic explanation is just that the Gnostic texts kinda suck, read a bit like fan fiction by somebody that is culturally disconnected with what they are commenting on, and don&#x27;t really fit together very coherently and introduce a lot of unnecessary or irrelevant questions. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big mystery why the early church wound up dumping them.</div><br/><div id="42049269" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42049269" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">goatlover</span><span>|</span><a href="#42041599">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42047954">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42045054">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42049269">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42049269">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The real tricky part is the Ebionite Gospel(s), which didn&#x27;t survive.

Like the very necessary guys who fix the water mains or the sewers, the expectation is that the service&#x2F;data pipeline&#x2F;database will be always available, and nobody really cares too much either way once everything&#x27;s working as expected.<p>The issues I encountered working as a data engineer many moons ago, is that in a business that&#x27;s either agnostic to data quality or doesn&#x27;t invest in reliability, the data engineers tend to become the face of failure. If a Kafka queue begins acting up, or a data ingestion jobs fails because of some upstream data source changes, then it&#x27;s usually up to the data engineer to...<p>1. Notice that something&#x27;s gone wrong.<p>2. Figure out who in the organization is going to be affected and let them know.<p>3. Run any triage and comms with the business keeping them in the loop until it&#x27;s fixed.<p>In my experience, like the guy who only gives good news to the dictator, certain execs&#x2F;leadership would quite happily let data engineers take the lead for outages, only swooping back in once everything was up and running again to demand a report on &quot;how this happened&quot; and some glib advice to &quot;take time to stop this happening again&quot;.<p>While it can be technically rewarding as a career move, it&#x27;s got to be highlighted that it&#x27;s only fun and games until you hit your first major outage.</div><br/><div id="36720860" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36720860" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BiteCode_dev</span><span>|</span><a href="#36720105">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36720332">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36720860">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36720860">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a lesson I keep repeating to our juniors: when you do something notable, celebrate it, and make sure to include the whole team, the users and the boss in the celebration.<p>It can be as simple as an email, but sometimes, making a few chat messages or even calls.

And this has many positive consequences on your life.<p>This, of course, works only if the celebration avoids technical terms, is short, straight to the point, and explain what&#x27;s the benefit to them and the org and how much it took to to it.<p>People must know that you are doing a good job, and you are the only one that is in the position to let them know.

I have mixed feelings about the field precisely because it’s so SQL dominated.<p>Data engineering can be unsatisfying if you thrive on writing reliable systems.  There’s a whole lot of big-ball-of-inscrutable-SQL work out there which when it gets changed breaks in unpredictable ways.  And the cultural traditions of testing and validation are underdeveloped because SQL has no core testing story — people count on joins being logically correct, but don’t go to the trouble to prove that true.  Vector operations are just hard to get right in any ecosystem and if you don’t stay humble and apply skepticism to your work, it’s going to be wrong a lot.<p>I try to do stuff in pandas or similar — which has its own problems, but at least allows for testable library code. But in the field of data engineering, that’s swimming against the tide.</div><br/><div id="36719836" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36719836" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">appplication</span><span>|</span><a href="#36718367">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36718998">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36719836">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36719836">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">DE is an inherently less tame domain than traditional SWE. The ground is more likely to shift under your feet. IMO the real problem with testing data engineering is that the data changes at a cadence that is independent to your version control&#x2F;CI&#x2F;CD cadence. You can have airtight unit and integration tests that get wrecked when the data schema changes without warning, the distribution of the data shifts, etc.<p>And you can certainly say “I’m going to enforce x rules on ingest and if it doesn’t match it doesn’t pass”. Depending on your system you may end up with a lot of on call or self-enforced down time or data loss. You might white list a schema and then later find out you’ve been missing out on 3 months of high value data because your upstream provider added a new columns. Alternatively, you can let things float through, monitor changes, but don’t let it plug up your system. This is also a risky game to play, with its own set of downsides.<p>Striving for comprehensive testing is still super important though. I find probably 60-80% of my time is spent tooling test frameworks that let us address the various edge cases. We use pyspark, and the amount of test-oriented tooling around that is, at least to me, surprisingly underdeveloped.</div><br/><div id="36720013" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36720013" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">code_biologist</span><span>|</span><a href="#36718367">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36719836">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36718998">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36720013">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36720013">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve recently done my first implementation of dbt and though its fundamental Jinja+yaml nature does show through a bit, I was really pleasantly charmed by the data testing.

Hits all the basics: nullness, uniqueness, freshness, value cardinality, value distribution, row count, foreign key validity, etc.<p>I still don&#x27;t like the yaml completely, but it makes adding data assertions so easy there is no excuse not to.<p>This project is pretty black and white, but I&#x27;m glad dbt supports test failure severity to lower on call load (error vs warning) when I have the need.<p>Just wanted to add a positive review for dbt, that it made it fun to do better data testing!</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36718998" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36718998" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vjust</span><span>|</span><a href="#36718367">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36719836">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36720070">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36718998">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36718998">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You made great points.

Quite often its dev and then straight to Prod.

This is a problem not just with automatically unit-testing SQL, but any other code.  In general, for regular code, we simply go with special, &quot;manual&quot; tests of the execution time for critical pieces (the biggest issue is fragility or flakiness: due to changing conditions a test runs under, speed is not always stable).  We could do similar for testing SQL performance.  If we know the database we are targetting, we could also use some of the introspection tools it offers to get even better tests (eg. we could run an &quot;EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON)&quot; query on a very large Postgres database matching production to ensure right indexes are being hit and no seqscans are being done and Postgres&#x27; estimation of the time is on target).<p>Basically, so far it&#x27;s hard because &quot;performance&quot; means so many different things, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s impossible.<p>As for the other point, those 1-in-a-million edge cases, we&#x27;ve got those with regular code too!  If you really want to test something against production-like DB, it&#x27;s not hard (make an anonymised replica of prod DB), it&#x27;s just expensive (tests will be slow, getting this set up will be slow, etc).<p>I personally believe the right balance for cases like those is to catch them in production: automated tests should be quick and allow quick iteration if someone wants to do TDD on any part of the codebase.  There are certainly product niches where this is not true (let&#x27;s not have airbags in cars deploy accidentally every 1M rides, because there&#x27;s a lot more than 1M rides daily :)), but for our regular applications, that&#x27;s usually more than fine: quick tests will make it easy to fix the particular edge case once we hit it.<p>FWIW, I love the idea of pgTAP for those who haven&#x27;t seen it too.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36719887" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36719887" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jochem9</span><span>|</span><a href="#36718367">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36719171">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36719553">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36720070">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36719887">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36719887">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Writing performing transformation code is one of the critical skills that a data engineer needs to master.

I basically work in this role in my organization. I&#x27;m not sure how typical my experience is compared with other people who call themselves &#x27;data Engineers&#x27;. I&#x27;m usually put into the situation where I&#x27;m looking at how to capture a raw signal (out of an instrument, device or similar) and package it up as structured data and store it in some kind of meaningful format people can use.<p>Useful skills I think (other than SQL) are: 
-Some understanding of PLCs&#x2F;SCADA&#x2F;OPC communication world. 
-knowledge about Signal analysis&#x2F; DSP, Kalman Filters, Fourier Transforms etc. Especially useful when you need to store a raw signal as &quot;data&quot; of some kind. also increasingly useful when the underlying data is in some format like Video, Audio etc.
-An Understanding of working with Time Series analysis can help with data transformation etc (downsampling a high frequency signal into lower frequency one for example).<p>Once you have captured the signal and stored it you move on to the second part how to make it available to end users in a meaningful and accessible way - this is where SQL knowledge and working with DBAs comes into it. In my experience it has become increasingly common you need to understand about cloud architecture etc as well. For example in my org more and more of our storage is moving to Azure so knowing how to navigate that stack and all the terms they use for things can help save a lot of time and frustration.<p>Lastly it can help if you are at least somewhat familiar with the BI tools the end users will be using to ultimately leverage the data.</div><br/><div id="36719460" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36719460" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SOLAR_FIELDS</span><span>|</span><a href="#36718433">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36719090">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36719992">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36719460">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36719460">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One really interesting aspect of this that I’ve had some revealing conversations with the data engineers in my org is how to best expose the firehose of data for people in BI tooling. We use dbt in my org, and Metabase as the BI tool, and a lot of thought is put into how to create a clearinghouse that serves the needs of the organization. The current pattern that has been of interest is to ELT into what the data engineers call OBT (one big table). The OBT is cleaned, denormalized, and able to be sliced on. An org might have several of these OBT consisting of various areas of interest. End users then import the OBT in Metabase to drive their filtering and build dashboards. The goal is to reduce reliance on custom SQL scripts and push all of that custom slicing and dicing of the data into Metabase’s front end logic where filtering can be applied dynamically rather than trying to maintain a bazillion sql variants.<p>Eventually I think we will move into a post ChatGPT world where you’ll give ChatGPT (or whatever equivalent) your schema and a question and it will output the dashboards for you.

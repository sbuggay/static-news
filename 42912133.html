Someone compared them to Cussler&#x27;s work in this thread and I agree, the difference between the two is that Cussler never made the hook &quot;cool enough&quot; on the level of Brown.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42912803" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42912803" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dlcarrier</span><span>|</span><a href="#42916298">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42915753">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42912803">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42912803">[50 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I listen to a few hundred audio books a year while working.  There seems to be no correlation between the quality of the writing and the fame of the book.  As disheartening as it is that thousands of great novels are never recognized, it is also awkward that some percentage of awful novels sell well and need to be reviewed.<p>I don&#x27;t think we should make fun of Dan Brown, or assume that all of his novels will be awful, but we should take his individual novels for what they are, and for every one I&#x27;ve read, they&#x27;re squarely in so-bad-it&#x27;s-good territory.<p>For anyone else who enjoys such novels, I highly recommend Dan Brown&#x27;s Digital Fortress.

Write quality is made up of dozens of factors (prose, character development, world building, plot development, grammar, uniqueness, pacing, dialog, etc). Each person balances those factors differently, and trying to squash them into a single metric is just bad communication.<p>Personally, I love sci-fi with good world building; As long as the book has great world building, a decent plot, and a unique concept; I&#x27;m usually willing to give it the label of &quot;average writing&quot; despite the bad prose, clunky pacing, and cookie-cutter character development.

The goal of people making stuff isn&#x27;t to make good stuff, it&#x27;s to sell lots of their stuff, at the highest price they can.<p>Certainly sometimes making bad stuff does make it so people don&#x27;t want to buy it, and those who do buy it will only buy it for a low price, but surprisingly that&#x27;s the case less often than you&#x27;d expect.  (Blame the field of psychological manipulation that is advertising?)<p>And so on top of that, the algorithms that recommend things are eventually going to be subverted by the people who want to sell you things, so you end up with stuff pushed at you that &quot;sells well&quot; even if much of it doesn&#x27;t actually match what you want.<p>One thing that might work is to decouple the recommendation algorithm from the entity trying to sell you stuff.  I&#x27;d want an independent third party to give me recommendations on what to buy on Amazon, for example, rather than Amazon themselves recommending products to me.  But you have to also somehow ensure that this third party isn&#x27;t motivated by profit in a way that&#x27;s related to what products you eventually buy.<p>On top of that, the problem with every good service is that once it gets to a certain size, it attracts the sort of people who will make it a bad service, because bad services can make them more money.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42913577" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42913577" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mandmandam</span><span>|</span><a href="#42912803">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42913283">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42915349">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42915705">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42913577">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42913577">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; It feels like that didn&#x27;t happen<p>Any time it happens, things get twisted, or shut down.

My SO hadn&#x27;t seen it before, and while she thought it was fine overall, she really disliked that there isn&#x27;t a canonical &quot;this is what happened and this is what the things mean&quot; explanation.

I embarked on a similar &quot;read the Hugos&quot; adventure and much of it is great in a sci-fi premise - understandable - but the characters or pacing or unfolding story is meh.<p>Example, The Wanderer by Fritz Leiber [0] is a great exposition of gravitational effects when a planet-sized object appears in the sky nearby earth. Characters and unfolding story are meh. I pictured it as a C-grade 60&#x27;s movie with stilted acting. But the way the earth was reacting and the moon coming apart was a great fictional invention and the way it was done was novel at the time!<p>In similar vein, Conan stories are great fantasy adventures with well described fights, battles, scenes. I&#x27;ve never found a better author to describe a fight - or a battle between armies - with enough detail to make it interesting and exciting and yet in relatively few words. I&#x27;ve also never read stories as sexist and racist... but I don&#x27;t go out of my way to look for that I guess.

One example is Dan Brown&#x27;s books, other examples might be Twilight Saga, or books that are very repetitive to send the message like &quot;Leaders eat last&quot; or &quot;Surrounded by idiots&quot;. They are written in an addictive way you have to keep reading, and makes them popular (not good). They have a lot of paragraphs or full chapters that are very clearly written in one go and never looked back to fix mistakes. Usually you could get rid of entire chapters and the book would be the same.<p>Then you have good books, where you can feel that the author took care of doing a good job. They are not redundant, and they don&#x27;t use dirty cheap tricks to keep you engaged. They might be even repulsive or unnerving (I&#x27;m thinking of Kafka&#x27;s The Metamorphosis or The Trial), and some people can find them boring.<p>The point is that you can read both of them. It&#x27;s like watching a quality TV show (maybe The Wire), but also watch some Kardashians. You can easily tell which one is good, and which one is bad but made in some way that you want to keep watching even when you know you are wasting your time and getting nothing in return other than a goog feeling that disipates as soon as you end watching. It&#x27;s like reading a danluu blog entry or wasting one hour in TikTok or Instagram: one of them is good, the others are tricking your mind to keep you engaged. There&#x27;s nothing bad in wasting some time, but IMO it&#x27;s important to be aware of what is happening, that not all content is the same, and that popularity doesn&#x27;t necessarily means good.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42915694" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42915694" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">davkan</span><span>|</span><a href="#42914922">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42915574">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42915772">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42915868">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42915694">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42915694">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My friend is a poet and will be the first to say we can objectively judge art.

Good why? There’s a difference between saying a book is good and a book is well written. Likewise if someone tells me Dan Brown is bad they’ll have to tell me why.

And in any case, that just reinforces my definition: quality is what a certain (elite) group of people say it is.<p>Another argument is that complex books are better than simple ones. But that just means elite taste-makers like complex books, maybe because they&#x27;ve read so many books that straightforward ones are boring to them. But there&#x27;s value in books that are easily understood--that&#x27;s the whole point of writing: to communicate. One shouldn&#x27;t value opaque books just because they&#x27;re opaque.<p>Yet another argument is that smart people like good books and dumb people like popular books. Smart people are able to appreciate good books that are beyond most people. The convenient thing about this is that you can show how smart you are by liking certain books, which is way easier than winning a Fields Medal or Nobel Prize. Snark aside, this is just defining &quot;good books&quot; as &quot;books smart people like&quot;, which is (in my view) morally equivalent to &quot;books high-status people like&quot;.<p>As for &quot;discouraging people from talking about things,&quot; I&#x27;m not yet arrogant enough to think that my post on Hacker News(!) is going to influence anyone.

I don’t even remember if everything made sense but that stuck with me.</div><br/><div id="42913364" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42913364" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crooked-v</span><span>|</span><a href="#42913323">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42913437">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42913364">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42913364">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To some degree it reminds me various pieces of &quot;thinky&quot; scifi (a lot of Stephen Baxter or Larry Niven work, for example), where the plot and characters are constructed around exploring some interesting ideas or concepts for the reader.

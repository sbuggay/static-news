This is Bess, Jake&#x27;s wife. I just want to say how deeply touched I am to see how much Jake and his writing are appreciated here on HN. The intellectual online community which made up a big piece of his life for so long was important to him, as was having a positive influence on others, and it would have meant so much to him- as it does to me- to see the impact he made. Thank you for the people who reached out while he was still alive to make sure he knew just how large that impact was.<p>I&#x27;ve lost the love of my life, as well as my thinking and writing partner, and everything is strange and disorienting right now. It&#x27;s a comfort when nothing feels comfortable to know how appreciated he was and still is. As soon as I&#x27;m able, and for anyone who is interested in joining the efforts, I promised him I&#x27;d continue the push for FDA reform, and to try to find ways to improve agency for cancer patients so that other people in his position might suffer less than he did. I&#x27;ve never known a braver person. I&#x27;ll miss him forever, but won&#x27;t stop trying to keep his legacy alive.<p>Please feel free to reach out anytime (I&#x27;m at drbstillman@gmail.com). Thank you also for all the well wishes for myself and Athena, who I hope will be just like her Dad.</div><br/><div id="41207257" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41207257" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">steve_adams_86</span><span>|</span><a href="#41206550">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41206760">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41207257">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41207257">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I didn’t know Jake’s work, but I’m going on vacation tomorrow and this thread has moved me to get copies of his books and start reading them while I’m away.

One in particular is that insight into the <i>current</i> and <i>possible</i> state(s) of a tumor are are <i>really</i> difficult to assess.  With all our current imaging and testing capabilities, the human body is <i>still</i> largely a black box.  Especially after multiple surgeries, distinguishing new tumour growth from scar and necrotic tissues is difficult.<p>And ... for suitably aggressive tumours, even what appears to be complete removal (&quot;clean margins&quot;) ... often isn&#x27;t, and what minuscule remnants remain can grow back with discouraging ferocity.  I&#x27;d visited a friend a few weeks after they&#x27;d had a growth removed, and subsequently begun radiation treatments and chemotherapy.  <i>In that brief interval between surgery and treatment</i> the lips of the incision had spread apart by several centimetres.  That turned out to be an ominous portent.<p>Second-guessing is also par for the course, and without comparative study it&#x27;s hard to know if more immediate or aggressive treatment (e.g., immediate chemo in Jake&#x27;s case) might have helped.  Looking up survival stats on particular cancers can be illuminating.  The one which took my friend three decades ago <i>still</i> has a &lt; 20% five-year survival.</div><br/><div id="41206124" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41206124" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ewoodrich</span><span>|</span><a href="#41203548">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41205075">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41206165">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41206124">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41206124">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My dad discovered he had a very large solid tumor (a form of soft tissue sarcoma) in 2022 and due to the lack of solid data or population size no oncologist could even give a hunch as to the growth rate. Whether it had been developing slowly for a decade before it finally became symptomatic over a few months, or the terrifying possibility it was extremely fast growing during the year or so he began to notice symptoms which suddenly emerged and then steadily got worse.<p>Due to lack of evidence for chemo having any benefit for his cancer with devastating impact on quality of life he was instead put into several months of proton radiation therapy, a Keytruda clinical trial, and then surgery all within about 6 months. After about 7 hours into surgery we got a call from the lead surgeon who told us they were unable to get clean margins due to proximity to the bone but spent an extra several hours removing all visible cancerous which was the best they could do before they had to hand it over to the reconstructive surgeon. That was a horrible gut punch and I can still picture the expressions on my brother and mother&#x27;s face as we processed what we were hearing.<p>He survived the surgery, recovered impressively quickly, but we were all terrified waiting for the first 3 month follow up scan expecting the worse given the lack of margins and potential of being extremely fast growing. But it was clean, and so was the next 3 month, and he&#x27;s now through his 7th or so clean scan I believe.<p>I had read so much about survival rates but the data for his specific cancer was all so poor plus confounded by his tumor being huge (data says that&#x27;s very bad) but no systemic spread or to adjacent organs (data says that&#x27;s very good), no clean margins (bad) but no remaining tumor tissue (less bad).<p>Eventually I realized all the time I spent digging through PubMed for any scrap of a data point hadn&#x27;t actually given me any insight, reassurance or had any predictive value whatsoever. Which was tough to accept given how my brain is wired. So all I can really do now is be grateful for the extra time he&#x27;s already had and the possibility that seemed so unlikely pre-surgery that he may even have many more, but the future will always be unknowable either way and not worth obsessing about.</div><br/><div id="41206861" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41206861" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Hnrobert42</span><span>|</span><a href="#41203548">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41206124">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41207007">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41206861">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41206861">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It sounds like the reading helped you, though.

I found a paper comparing proton vs gamma radiation for soft tissue sarcomas and went down a rabbit hole. His oncologist at OHSU was very supportive of the idea and it all seemed to perfectly fall in line with my coping strategy believing technology <i>had</i> to have advanced somehow somewhere and we just needed to find it.<p>No way to know for sure whether that actually improved his quality of life vs gamma or was more effective but I believe it had to have helped and gave him and us more confidence he was getting the most cutting edge treatment modern medicine had to offer.<p>My dad was an early adopter of basically every technology trend going back to the first handheld sized cell phones and I could tell it gave both him and I some comfort being able to endlessly read about this brand new promising tech. And gave him some new optimism he might not inevitably lose his entire quality of life like his mother’s last few years of miserable chemo before her cancer ultimately killed her. The combination of Keytruda and proton radiation took a toll on him but he was still able to keep up with his routine of jogging and swimming a couple times a week which meant a lot to him.<p>Looking for proton centers then led my parents to the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle [1] who both had a proton therapy center and were conducting research on soft tissue sarcomas which led to enrolling him in the Keytruda trial that was desperate for eligible patients almost overnight.<p>My parents felt so much more trust and confidence there vs his original OHSU oncologist who made of point of emphasizing that my dad’s subtype of cancer wasn’t something they really had experience with or a specific treatment plan beyond the generic cancer treatment checklist.<p>I guess I ultimately did find something tangible and my medical techno optimism wasn’t purely escapism. So maybe it wasn’t as futile as it felt by the end, re-reading the same research over and over for months on end and still unable to form a mental model of the severity and most likely outcomes&#x2F;survival odds for my dad.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fredhutch.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;patient-care&#x2F;treatments&#x2F;proton-therapy.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fredhutch.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;patient-care&#x2F;treatments&#x2F;proton-...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41206165" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41206165" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aurornis</span><span>|</span><a href="#41203548">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41204534">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41205075">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41208101">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41206165">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41206165">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The earlier posts wishing for more aggressive treatments in the past should be read in conjunction with later posts about the realities of overtreatment.<p>Specifically, the post titled &quot;More isn’t always better: death and over-treatment as a downside of agenticness&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jakeseliger.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;07&#x2F;29&#x2F;more-isnt-always-better-death-and-over-treatment-as-a-downside-of-agenticness&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jakeseliger.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;07&#x2F;29&#x2F;more-isnt-always-better-d...</a><p>One of the difficult realities of cancer treatment is that everything comes with tradeoffs.

The biggest thing I learn when I gain expertise is just exactly how much <i>we don&#x27;t know</i>.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41205833" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41205833" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wizzwizz4</span><span>|</span><a href="#41204279">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41205117">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41205225">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41204878">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41205833">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41205833">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>Think about how difficult it is to make a significant contribution in your particular field of expertise that is not about to be done right now anyway because the time is right.</i><p>I independently reinvented my entire field of research <i>by accident</i>, because I didn&#x27;t know it existed; and I&#x27;m pretty sure I did a better job. There are a few puzzle pieces and key insights it probably would&#x27;ve taken me a few years (or decades) to discover, without which I couldn&#x27;t demonstrate (or, if I&#x27;m being honest, <i>know</i>) the immense superiority of my approach, but I&#x27;m pretty sure the majority of the field is obsoleted by the ideas I&#x27;ve had.<p>Oh, look at me, I&#x27;m so clever… right? Good guess, but actually no. When I ask the right questions to my peers (outside the field), they usually propose a similar approach. (The main differences can be attributed to the fact I&#x27;ve thought about this for years, and they&#x27;ve thought about it for minutes: a few of the obvious things don&#x27;t work, but then things get <i>elegant</i> when you replace them with ones that do.)<p>That must mean the time&#x27;s right, then? I did suspect it was this… until I found a few dozen publications by a widely-respected expert, from <i>half a century ago</i>, talking about a (slightly underdeveloped, idiosyncratic) version of the approach like it was common sense, remarking that people were a lot more receptive to this idea than they used to be, but still it was not being adopted.<p>A minor application of this approach to a different field would <i>completely</i> revolutionise it (even moreso than it does my field). I briefly fantasised about doing that, before dismissing as &quot;something to investigate later&quot; (i.e. &quot;a childish fantasy I haven&#x27;t found the holes in yet&quot;). But not only <i>does</i> that application work, it was implemented <i>and trialled</i>. The results were published <i>26 years ago</i>, in a paper that concludes by confusedly asking why nobody was doing this. After reading the paper (which I found <i>completely by accident</i> while looking for something else), I felt much the same way. (Still nobody is doing it, in case you&#x27;re wondering. It&#x27;s been cited six times – once in its field, two years after publication, and five times in other fields in papers where it isn&#x27;t really relevant.)<p>In physics, parts of chemistry, and parts of mathematics, there is room for revolution. I&#x27;m not sure any of the softer fields (counting mathematics qua philosophy as soft) are particularly good at being revolutionised. (Economics is particularly bad: nearly every economist knows that economics is wrong, and yet it persists.) And it&#x27;s not because new ideas are slow to be adopted: at least 10% of my field&#x27;s practitioners dropped everything to try to solve its Hard Problems with LLMs. (Those I know, I talked out of this, by describing – with non-rigorous theoretical arguments – what they would find. After years of work, the best result I&#x27;ve seen is only slightly better than the bound I predicted.)<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some way to solve this problem, but I don&#x27;t know it. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the solution has been identified, written down, published, forgotten, independently reinvented, tested, found to work, published again, ignored…<p>I don&#x27;t say this to cast aspersions on science, or the academic system; nor to blame people or institutions for their failings. This problem is well-known. It&#x27;s not a matter of people being stuck in their ways: if anything, academics are <i>too</i> credulous, too willing to believe that things work which don&#x27;t. But I don&#x27;t think adjusting the &quot;credulity&quot; dial, or the &quot;speed&quot; dial, or the &quot;try novel approaches&quot; dial, is a solution. Science, as it stands, cannot be done faster, because the system doesn&#x27;t know how.<p>All I&#x27;m saying is, watch out for this. Support people who think they have a better way, check the literature for interesting things (and then confirm them, if you can). Question not whether your current approaches are good, but what they actually <i>do</i> – and ask whether that is really what you want to be doing, or a proxy goal that everybody&#x27;s lost sight of.<p>And if you find yourself along with your peers, dismissing something out-of-hand without having tried it, maybe don&#x27;t lend your voice to the snubbing crowd. Maybe it&#x27;s bogus, maybe its proponents are wrong about its merits, but it <i>might</i> have merits. We can&#x27;t afford not to know.</div><br/><div id="41206244" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41206244" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wizzwizz4</span><span>|</span><a href="#41204279">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41205833">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41204878">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41206244">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41206244">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Also: Don&#x27;t get so enamoured by the idea of incremental progress, of scientific legacy, that you can scarcely imagine the idea that everybody you know might have taken a wrong turn 30, or 50, or 400 years ago.

Imo the technology is already at a point where it&#x27;s useful enough for me to invest in. If i wanted to today i could buy what i need for scouting and spraying a ~1000h farm from aliexpress.<p>The problem is the regulatory environment on two fronts. First ( in Canada) the pesticides I&#x27;d like to use are not registered for drone application, even if they are registered for application from helicopter or plane.<p>Second, I don&#x27;t have priority airspace rights. Which means I have to have a person watching both the drone and surrounding airspace for crop dusters or personal low flying aircraft. Even if I file a flight plan weeks ahead of time and a NOTAM [notice to all airmen] i am required to ground my drone if an aircraft with a person is nearby. Even if they have failed to file NOTAMs, which in the case of my local spray dudes is 100% of the time. This makes completing a scouting or spraying job more labour intensive than using a tractor because I often require a spotter at the far end of a field.<p>Until the regulatory issues are sorted out, and drones can be operated with Beyond Visual Line of Sight rules, you won&#x27;t see massa adoption of this tech.<p>My drone fleet is sitting and collecting dust at the moment, which is a shame because they do provide valuable information.</div><br/><div id="40467972" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40467972" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">matthewdgreen</span><span>|</span><a href="#40467756">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40472140">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40467972">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40467972">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In the US, at least, regulatory solutions happen when large commercial interests get behind them.

Is there any automated tech on the market you&#x27;ve seen to do the spotting for you, so you can dynamically ground drones as air conditions change?  Also, are you piloting all these manually (yknow, if they weren&#x27;t gathering dust), is it a preset flight plan, or are you already experimenting with AI control?  Would think even an LLM fed with air traffic sensor data could make the call to ground drones and switch between flight plans dynamically at this point - though I&#x27;d want it thoroughly tested and airing on the side of caution always.  Also - what kind of height do you require for drone dusting?  Could you get away with keeping it low to the ground, dusting only a few plants at a time at the expense of longer flight time and battery charging, but at least hopefully practically low enough to skirt any potential collision and legal issues, and potentially still entirely automated?  Would think that kind of specificity also allows for stuff like dusting individual crop areas differently according to need, too.<p>All just thoughts from a programmer here - very cool you get to experiment with this kind of stuff in a practical setting.

At least for these kind of crops, the field is seeded 100%. There are no gaps for the tractor wheels. Having said that, you rarely see tractors pulling a sprayer in the first place anymore. Most crops around here are sprayed by purpose built sprayers that have tons of ground clearance, have relatively narrow tires, very wide booms, and are comparatively very light vs. a massive tractor. They can be built so light because they aren&#x27;t used to pull heavy implements behind them. All they carry is the chemical, the spray booms, and the operator. Later in the season, it would be tough to pick out the path these things took through the field if you could at all.  As for costs, the spraying is often done on contract so the farmers don&#x27;t buy the sprayers in the first place: they pay for the service plus the chemicals.<p>For this kind of application, I think drones have a snowball&#x27;s chance in hell of getting any kind of traction with farmers in the area.

Actually, these devices are quite cheap, although buying them requires a big chunk of money, maybe even a loan. But calling them cheap is just because with a bit of simple math, farmers immediately see it as a good deal.<p>China might not have as much large-scale agricultural machinery, just like Africa doesn&#x27;t have as many landline networks, but that doesn&#x27;t stop everyone from using mobile phones, right?<p>Plus, there&#x27;s not much redundant regulation in the countryside, no need to submit plans, and most rural areas don&#x27;t care about approvals. They just want to grow more crops. It&#x27;s not about fearing hard work, worrying about toxic pesticides, or not being able to endure the sun and wind; they simply want to make the barren land produce more food.<p>In fact, many farms only have a second-hand van worth a few hundred dollars. Some even use tricycles to transport these expensive devices. Many farmers don&#x27;t understand English and operate based on memory of the icons, and that&#x27;s enough. They buy lots and lots of batteries, working from dawn till dusk. After finishing their own work, they help neighbors with spraying at a low price, just to quickly recover the costs.<p>Many people think that tractors combined with large machinery are efficient, but actually, it depends on the situation. Fragmented small plots contracted to households are used for planting high-yield rice to maximize production.

I told them that there was one way to make sure it never would hurt them and that was to get into drone spraying themselves.<p>A large majority of farmers will want someone else to do it for them.  I said you know the customer, you know their fields and are well versed with the chemicals.  They said I don&#x27;t know, but you could see they were thinking hard.

A 100 horsepower tractor will be expected to deliver 100 horsepower for 15 hours without stopping (it is common to eat while driving, though you will stop for a bathroom break here and there).  That means you need to have a 100 horsepower engine. Contrast a Tesla which is rated at 600 horsepower - but realistically only can give you that for a few seconds before you are at speed and then only needs to deliver about 20 horsepower.  The batteries in a Tesla would run that 100 horsepower tractor for maybe an hour, so a 20 horsepower engine in a Tesla could easially extend you a lot of range.<p>I work for John Deere.  I don&#x27;t speak for the company.  I can tell you that we are looking at electric for small tractors - there are a lot of people who only use small tractors for a couple hours per day (or less). We have hybrid tractors for some applications, but there are others that hybird isn&#x27;t useful. The rules of chemistry tell us that a battery will never be useful for large tractors, and even small tractors it is questionable if batteries can ever be good enough to go all day (if you look at our electric mower the dealer is required to examine your lot to make sure it isn&#x27;t too big).

They have to fly very low across a field then turn around at the end - if anything goes wrong (not seeing a power line at the end of the field) you have no altitude to recover. Only a few pilots will even fly them and they tend to be in demand which means when a farmer wants the work done sometimes they can&#x27;t get it done.

You carry less product, but you need to use less, and therefore you have to purchase less.  There are also the environmental benefits of not applying herbicide where it not actually needed, and benefits of not expending energy and resources to produce a wasted product.<p>Also you are underestimating the cost differential between the drone and a crewed aircraft.  The article says this guy&#x27;s drone costs  $50,000. $500,000 is going to buy you a 30 year old clapped out pile of crap with a radial piston engine and a belly full of corrosion. A new crop duster, for example a very common, and fairly small, Air Tractor AT-600, is going to be $1.7-2.0M depending on options.<p>And, you have not accounted for the extraordinarily high recurring cost of operating a small turbine aircraft, including flight crew, ground crew, maintenance, storage and insurance. Fuel burn is 75 gallons per hour at $6.25 per gallon (That&#x27;s today&#x27;s price at the duster base in Linton, North Dakota, 7L2 airport. Say hi to Mike the chief mechanic for me.) So a direct operating cost of $500&#x2F;hour right off the bat, whether you are spraying or commuting.  And the cost of maintaining a fixed base of operation (i.e. an airport.) Costs which mostly go <i>poof</i> with a drone you can throw in a pickup truck.  And of course the cost of operating in a highly regulated industry such as ongoing training and certification, maintaining an anti-drug program and workforce monitoring, etc.<p>And yes, this would clearly be marketed as a service for hire, as many existing agricultural services are.  That is not novel in the industry.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40471061" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40471061" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bri3d</span><span>|</span><a href="#40467199">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40467640">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40467218">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40471061">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40471061">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">DJI spray drones are quite an old idea, a much better value than Hylio drones, and very popular in China. They&#x27;re especially favored in smaller-acerage targeted application scenarios like orchards as well as specialty applications like terrace farms where tractors are less efficient, but they work OK on large-scale fields as well. An Agras T50 is $25k. That&#x27;s not that bad compared to a normal tractor and really, really cheap compared to an Air Tractor, especially when you start considering wet cost.<p>The big issue preventing you from seeing more of these the US is regulatory. Right now, agricultural drones are a huge pain to fly, although the situation has been improving:<p>* The drone needs both an operator and a visual observer.<p>* The drone needs to be within line of sight (this is easier when it&#x27;s huge, but still a significant limitation).<p>* The operator needs an FAA Part 107 license. Until this year they also needed a second-class medical as part of the overweight waiver process, but now third-class medicals are OK.<p>* The operator needs a Part 137 spray license.<p>* The drone needs to be on a special list to get a 49 USC Section 44807 exception (basically, a carve-out to Part 137 allowing certain drones above 55lb to be used for agriculture). Until recently, this process was horrible and required specific authorization, experimental certificates, and all kinds of waivers, but thankfully it&#x27;s been cleaned up.<p>Hylio got a waiver to allow up to 3 simultaneous flights and no visual observer. If more of these exemptions are issued (or the overall regulation loosens), I suspect spray drones will actually become quite popular. Even with the current pilot limitations, it&#x27;s already possible to run an agricultural spray business using DJI drones that easily beats traditional crop dusting in terms of price-per-acre. The main issue is acres available, since the current setup is so inefficient - there just isn&#x27;t enough supply to really disrupt the crop dusting market when it comes to large megafarms. Once a single operator can observe autonomous flight from tens of drones at once, things will become quite competitive - you can buy a lot of T50s for the price of an Air Tractor.<p>Fixed-wing spray drones are an even better idea than inefficient quadcopters, and I look forward to seeing more of these designs, like the Pyka Pelican, hit the market as well.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40467218" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40467218" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lettergram</span><span>|</span><a href="#40467199">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40471061">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40467292">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40467218">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40467218">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; These tractors can cost up to half a million dollars to purchase and about US $7 a hectare to operate.<p>I was about to say...

Most agriculture pumps orders of magnitude more Energy into the farm to make fewer calories of food. Petroleum becoming food is indeed useful as it is fungible for human consumption.<p>2. As soil productivity is dropping around the globe given pesticides and fertilizer usage, the EROI is dropping.<p>3. The future of farming, few believe is in making more from less as the hidden subsidies disappear.<p>---<p>apcnf.in is one of the world&#x27;s largest natural farming transitions with a few bits of contrarian genius that could be highlighted here:<p>1. Rather than dumping a lot of nitrogen into field they innoculate it with a microbial power few months before the rain. This &#x27;pre monsoon dry sowing&#x27; uses many times less fertilizer and uses time and daily breathing cycles of earth for a few months to spiral in microbes. Look up ghana jeevamruta on youtube for details.<p>2. They use foliar sprays which urges plant leaves to develop filament like needles on leaves turning them hygroscopic. There is much more water in the air than in rivers + freshwater bodies on every continent.<p>3. They try to trigger mineral - fungus - bacteria - root rhizosphere - plant synergies rather than pumping nutrition by brute force. These small spirals become larger and larger and are highly highly multithreaded natural algorithms.<p>4. Science has recently discovered that seeds contain millions of microbes. They coat the seeds with beneficial coating as seed balls and plant them few months before the rains. The day and night cycles of breathing in and out, with rythmic background of dryness and wetness urges them to grow. They also auto deploy at the right time, vs being artificially timed by irrigation.<p>5. They work on fundamentals of plant immunity which leads to wild grass like resistance and endurance in plants without artificial irrigation. These plants are also pest resistant and the produce has lower perishability in tune of weeks.<p>6. They discovered that good fungus extends and grows into the plant body like rails that carry microbes. The microbial &#x27;water&#x27; is coated with thick cell walls and doesn&#x27;t dry as easily as irrigation water.<p>7. They keep the field under 365 day green cover via 5 layers of plants. This might not be equally possible in all bioregions but helps protect the soil from blazing heat.<p>These are just some of the points I noticed in their attempts to lower the net input cost at farming. Most developed economies do not have to think of this today given financial, logostic and govt subsidies but as inflation grows and supply chains become fragile, I feel this way of thinking has a lot of merit for those trying to make things work under sustenance economics.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40470461" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40470461" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kkfx</span><span>|</span><a href="#40472094">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40467471">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40470461">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40470461">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It would be more interesting how to use smaller machines directly powered by agrivoltaic, to finally start reducing diesel in agriculture.

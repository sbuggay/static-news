On one hand this makes the work much more interesting. On the other-hand sometimes solutions become trivial, if you see the person doing their work.<p>anecdote: a person was filing a bug report about occasional weird behavior when submitting data. We soon found out, that the behavior was the same as if the shift-key was pressed while submitting the form. We researched our software and found no issue. We looked at the desktop PC and found nothing. We installed a keylogger temporarily and found out, that the shift-signal really was received. We changed the keyboard and the issue went away. But only for a couple of days&#x2F;weeks until it returned. At this point or QA chief drove out to the customer and was standing behind them while working. After some time the bug happened again, and the QA-guy saw the reason: The user spends &gt;4h per day on a different software, where she has to press shift-enter to submit data, and it became eventually muscle memory for her, since she was working really really fast. When she switched back to out software, she still has the muscle memory, and presses shift without noticing it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37477595" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37477595" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pixel_tracing</span><span>|</span><a href="#37477885">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37477595">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37477595">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Also fellow ex-Apple here :wave:<p>I actually quite liked Radar, the focus on Radar hygiene, finding cause-bys, diagnosis, discussion comments and attached sysdiagnose reports were quite helpful compared to previous companies I worked at.<p>But you are right there were moments in my time there where just by looking at the build configuration I could rule out an issue immediately</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

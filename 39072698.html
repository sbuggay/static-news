But I&#x27;ll bite.<p>First, human beings are not bees or ants. Our nature vis-a-vis reproduction is quite different. Most human beings do reproduce as that is our nature, or certainly most of us used to with the exception of periods of social collapse (think of Rome). We&#x27;re in that sort of condition now, where we are having little or no children in the developed world. This does not bode well and at some point the decline of such a society will become irreversible.<p>Of course, you are right that not everyone <i>must</i> reproduce, that there is no particular obligation for anyone to reproduce, and that those who do not can still contribute to the well-being of their families, the human species, and the common good. And indeed, if you are, say, a Catholic, you would say that while having children is the natural course and the normal path for most people, a small minority are called to sacrifice this natural end for the sake of a higher supernatural, spiritual end, e.g., the priesthood, by which one becomes a spiritual parent in place of a biological one. Certainly, we can be parental figures in non-biological ways as well. Even biological parents do that.<p>But that&#x27;s not that we&#x27;re seeing behind the present demographic decline. Something like the priesthood is an exception, not the rule. Most who can have children of their own are not having them, or many of them, not because of some kind of exceptional higher calling, but rather for morally dubious reasons. Children are demanding. They require sacrifice. They demand the love known as charity. A consumerist is going to view a child not as a gift, but a burden. Furthermore, our society demonizes families, especially large families (perhaps in part stemming from Protestant attempts to restrict Catholic populations in the US). Having many children used to be seen as a blessing, a privilege. Today, we both think we&#x27;re <i>entitled</i> to having children (IVF is a testament to that), and refuse to have them.</div><br/><div id="39076187" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39076187" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">safety1st</span><span>|</span><a href="#39074956">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39075801">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39075942">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39076187">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39076187">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m downvoting this because of the arrogant and dubious notion that people who&#x27;ve chosen not to have children are somehow morally flawed. The fact of the matter is that successfully raising, educating etc. a child is dramatically more expensive than it was a few generations ago. While we can debate the various reasons for the decline in the reproduction rate there&#x27;s no doubt that this is a big one, not as many people can <i>afford</i> to raise kids.<p>The factual and pragmatic view today is that if you can&#x27;t afford a large home, one parent taking a lot of time off of work, and $120K+ in education bills then you are not setting your offspring up for success, this is not based on your personal morality, it is based on economics, and on statistical observations of the population.<p>Ergo your lionizing of people who have have children actually amounts to a defense of the economically privileged, and you assert that the benefactors of the systemic increase of wealth inequality in our society are the most moral people. It&#x27;s despicable really. Go eat your cake, pig.</div><br/><div id="39076464" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39076464" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eks391</span><span>|</span><a href="#39074956">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39076187">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39076476">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39076464">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39076464">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t believe whether ones finances allowing someone to have children is the factor for whether they will.

Even I used to want a large family until I acquired a higher standard of living and certain luxuries that I would likely have to give up if I got married and had kids.<p>There&#x27;s a popular line of thought that motherhood is below a working woman, and men and woman alike are enjoying increased ease of living and a consumerism lifestyle. The folk who still have to stretch and sacrifice to make ends meet already have the mindsets needed for children (sacrifice, hard work) and aren&#x27;t affected by the line of belief that motherhood is &#x27;below&#x27; since they already have learned not to compare themselves to others.<p>Again this is speculation.

Having children is more expensive than ever, and purchasing power has continued to drop for decades. Not to mention the drastic increase in specific &quot;raising a family&quot; essentials&#x2F;barriers like housing costs, medical debt, educational debt, and childcare expenses. I don&#x27;t have numbers to back this up, but my intuition (based on observation and casual reading) is that more working class people who actively want to have children are not doing so because they are stretched too thin than we saw in the 1970&#x27;s (when people could work part-time to pay for all 4 years of college and expect a high paying career out of their degree).<p>Also, a 15% drop in 50 years is nothing to scoff at. In America, we are below the replacement fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman. Currently it is at 1.7, so our population would be declining without immigration. [1] This is not a bad thing in my opinion, but it is extremely significant in terms of politics, culture, and economics. If our fertility rate continues to drop expect to start hearing about it more often and at higher volume from many different corners.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;data&#x2F;vsrr&#x2F;vsrr028.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;data&#x2F;vsrr&#x2F;vsrr028.pdf</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39075785" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39075785" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wruza</span><span>|</span><a href="#39074956">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39075338">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39075693">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39075736">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39075785">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39075785">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>So if you fail to reproduce you will break that billion year old chain of evolutionary success.</i><p>True to an extent.

How would evolution slowly build blood but no blood vessels or heart? How would evolution slowly build a network of blood vessels but no blood to carry or heart to pump?<p>You start with a fluid-filled body cavity where oxygen is transported by dissolution from the outside to the inside. This fluid already contains oxygen-transporting cells. Then you section off part of the cavity to enable oxygen-transporting cells to move more efficiently. At this point the OTCs are completely separated, so the fluid inside the conduits can be called blood. The animal can pump blood by squeezing its body during its normal locomotion. Eventually muscle cells are added to the circulatory system to enable oxygen circulation independently of the animal&#x27;s movement, as well as to circulate it even more effectively. Later on the muscle cells become centralized as it&#x27;s more efficient, not to mention that a big single muscle can pump more strongly than a distributed system of tiny muscles. Each step of the way you have a functional organism and each form performs the function of transporting oxygen more effectively.<p>I know you&#x27;re going to say that this is a &quot;must have&quot; explanation, but you merely asked for <i>an</i> explanation.

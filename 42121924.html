It&#x27;s not even just an issue between the feedback giver and receiver. It&#x27;s a huge cultural issue that every company I&#x27;ve ever seen consistently underestimates the difficulty and value of. The entire company needs to demonstrate that it&#x27;s safe and valued to give and receive feedback and even criticism.<p>I&#x27;ve been on teams where this is done well on the team-level. I could give feedback to my teammates without worrying about offending them, and they would work on the issue. I could receive criticism from my teammates without worrying they hated me or that this would impact my job. This also meant there were almost never huge personal issues on the team, any issues were handled before they became a big deal. But even there, this didn&#x27;t extend beyond the team. If we had an issue with another team or with management, suddenly any criticism or feedback we gave was interpreted as an attack and was impossible to solve.<p>To give actionable feedback you need to be in a culture that shows you it&#x27;s safe to make mistakes, and that improving is noticed and appreciated. A high-functioning team can do this. But I think it&#x27;s hard (borderline impossible) to do this on an organizational level because this requires a certain level of mutual respect and trust that is frankly just not there when there are huge asymmetrical power relationships at play.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42122886" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42122886" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nlawalker</span><span>|</span><a href="#42124085">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42122635">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42122886">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42122886">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My additions:<p>You&#x27;re telling them what they already know - For constructive feedback to actually be <i>feedback</i>, it has to have a little bit of novelty.

The frame bad feedback or poorly received feedback as “crossing the wires” where the receiver wants affirmation but gets coaching or evaluation.  This throws them into a spiral.  Recognizing this can make you better at receiving feedback and giving as well.<p>There’s a bunch of little things like “publicly praise, privately criticize” and that it’s way better to make time for feedback rather than waiting for the right time.

It gives everyone a chance to share feedback with each other in front of the rest of the team.<p>Yeah, this can’t generally be sound advice. Feedback that can be interpreted as critical is best delivered in private. There may be the rare constellation of individuals who take it very well in a team setting, but that is not a norm. If you have intense amounts of history, trust, emotional intelligence, and communication skills and extremely low ego and office politics this might work — more likely the guy who pushes for this and thinks this works thinks of themselves as emotionally intelligent but actually aren’t and is extremely oblivious to how much damage they are causing to morale and team dynamics.<p>I have heard of similar approaches being used at e.g. Nvidia and elsewhere for top leadership to allow everyone to learn from each others mistakes but there are cultural requirements here, as well as factors including the degree of personal stakes in successful outcomes at the group level, and the nature of the hierarchy and selection&#x2F;exclusion process for members.<p>What you often do want to encourage (typically through example) is people choosing to celebrate the sharing of individual learnings from failure in group settings. The ability to be vulnerable and take accountability for mistakes while sharing those mistakes in a way others can learn from them can be highly valuable and build trust.</div><br/><div id="42123050" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42123050" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mistercow</span><span>|</span><a href="#42122847">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42122961">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42123050">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42123050">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think this is also a property of <i>relationships</i> rather than just individuals, and for that reason, it&#x27;s not something that will scale. It&#x27;s especially fraught when you add someone new to a team that&#x27;s already very high trust about feedback, particularly if that person is especially insecure and&#x2F;or has had bad experiences where they felt humiliated by public feedback in the past.<p>That exact same person might have done fine with public feedback had they been there from the beginning, but you can&#x27;t just toss someone into an established dynamic and expect them to have the same level of trust as the founding members.<p>Also -- and this is a thing that a lot of companies&#x2F;teams who strive for ultra high emotional trust seem to neglect -- <i>some people do act in bad faith.</i> When you lean too hard into the &quot;bring your authentic self&quot; school of thought, you strip your team of crucial emotional protections that corporate environments are designed to provide, and all it takes is one high-functioning person with deep seated personality issues (and that describes a <i>large</i> portion of the general population) to cause serious emotional damage in that kind of environment. Even if you have leadership with the abnormally high emotional intelligence and agility to navigate and repair that damage when it happens, it&#x27;s going to be an enormous drain on them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42122961" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42122961" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SilasX</span><span>|</span><a href="#42122847">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42123050">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42123404">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42122961">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42122961">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah that was my reaction as well.

The CTO forbade us to take notes: it seems the fad of the week was that note taking is what makes meetings a waste of time. The meeting took two hours. Afterwards, the four of us had about eight different opinions of what had been decided. No follow-up actions were ever taken.<p>This is still the case in many companies I (founder of a small troubleshooting company; we search out problematic large, cash rich companies like these; they all have failing processes and IT all over the place) meet with; sometimes it&#x27;s frowned upon, but often simply <i>no one</i> takes notes. Which shows these meetings (almost <i>all</i> meetings I go into) are a complete charade of managers wanting to show they have &#x27;something important to do, really!&#x27; (somehow there are often 10+ people there). I am in meetings (including Zoom etc and irl) where i&#x27;m sure no-one really heard or understood what anyone else said (different accents of English from different countries and background and of course, no one can say anything because we all have to respect people etc); no notes, no recordings (and of course, the captions of the video chat or my phone didn&#x27;t understand anything that was said either), while someone was explaining quite difficult, in depth stuff, for 2-3 hours. Afterwards, the stuff is rehashed in a 15 minute <i>text</i> chat with the person who explained the difficult stuff; why didn&#x27;t they write it down in the first place and forgo the meeting? Because half(that&#x27;s generous, it&#x27;s more like 80%) of the room should have no (high paying) job; they are just there for being there.<p>Ah, the enterprise world, such joys; I enjoy it as I threat it like a cosmic joke; it&#x27;s a comedy show, not unlike The Office including the main characters high pay.</div><br/><div id="39688060" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39688060" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Brajeshwar</span><span>|</span><a href="#39688018">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39688538">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39688060">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39688060">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In almost all the meetings I attend, I&#x27;m always the note-taker by choice unless I have earmarked someone to take notes.

If you exclude people based on them being unlike you, you will likely be choosing poorly.<p>He says he believes in diversity but contradicts himself a few sentences previous. I find this typical with a lot of people who claim to believe in diversity: they don’t actually believe in true diversity, they believe in people agreeing with their pre-existing beliefs. And if someone doesn’t agree, there’s no hope for them at least according to the author. That’s not someone who believes in diversity.<p>And I actually believe the greatest software projects have a single strong voice with a strong vision and strong competency that drives the entire project. Look at Steve Jobs with Apple and the iPhone, Linus and Linux, Elon Musk with Tesla, Zuckerberg and Facebook. You don’t find a lot of collaboration, what you see is a brilliant visionary with strong opinions and not much diversity in opinion.

It seems to me that the software engineering salary distribution is bimodal. I&#x27;m simplifying a bit here, but basically into those that make &lt;100k USD or &gt;200k USD a year. What makes the difference?
Is it management vs codemonkey? FAANG vs &quot;small&quot; &lt;10k employee corporate?
I like engineering, but my impression is that management often lies to engineers saying &quot;oh, 80k USD is a high salary&quot;, when it&#x27;s clearly not.

The big layoffs are a first part of the correction, and a quieter adjustment will happen as non-cash compensation (options, stock grants, etc) calibrates itself into today&#x27;s more grounded economy.<p>The managers saying &quot;80k is a high salary&quot; to you are give-or-take correct (assuming you&#x27;re in a mid&#x2F;low cost of living area).

For background, I have 40 years of programming experience, about 20 or 25 professionally, depending on how you count. My first system was a Commodore Vic-20. I&#x27;ve done assembly and COBOL and mainframes and I&#x27;ve been doing web stuff since it was called &quot;dhtml&quot;.<p>If you zoom out far enough, programming has changed very little in the last 40 years, and a valuable programmer 40 years ago could be just as valuable today. Distill programming down into its basic essences, and you get abstractions described in a way that machines can implement. I have occasionally helped introduce non-programmers to programming, and abstract thinking is the biggest and most difficult hurdle by far; the rest is just nuts and bolts, implementation details.<p>Of course, as you zoom in to tricky patterns in object-oriented programming, or lambdas, or the sharp edges of CAP in distributed systems, and so on, things get a bit more nuanced. A lot of that simply wasn&#x27;t a part of typical software development 40 years ago. I&#x27;ve met a lot of older developers that found a niche and stayed in it and didn&#x27;t participate in the broader field.<p>I just recently worked with one such developer on a project that the average HN reader would recognize. He was brilliant; I&#x27;m a trial-and-error developer, a little bit sloppy, but I rely on tooling and following best practices to tune up my code. Usually, that&#x27;s good enough. His code was horrifically hard to follow; he dogmatically avoided any of the common habits that had developed over the last 20 years, so his code was built out of piles of functions that were hundreds of lines long and had all kinds of tricky branching logic and would return arrays of values and so on. But, he could stare at it for a while and model the entire damn thing in his head. We went together like oil and water. He is someone I think of as a good cautionary example of what happens when you decide all the new stuff isn&#x27;t worth your time.<p>Still, though: he really was brilliant, and could be a valuable member of lots of different development teams.<p>So, conversely, there&#x27;s this widespread assumption that if you&#x27;ve been slinging code for more than 10 years and you haven&#x27;t moved into management or have some really big-wow project on your CV, then you&#x27;ve done something wrong and you&#x27;ve stopped learning and nobody should hire you. Every single place I interview with acts like they have some kind of special, one-of-a-kind tech infrastructure, and if I&#x27;m not already an expert in <i>that</i>, then I can&#x27;t provide any value. Most of the people I interview with have never ventured outside of web development, so it&#x27;s cruelly ironic that they are the stick by which my ability to adapt is measured.<p>I have a hunch that there&#x27;s a subconscious incentive for hiring managers and lead developers to keep stitching together ever more esoteric tech ecosystems because it limits competition. If you build infrastructure out of all the latest stuff you can find, you not only develop your own expertise at it (resume-driven development), but you also reduce the number of viable candidates that the company might be able to hire to work with you.<p>All in all, I still enjoy most of software development, I still do it as a hobby in some of my free time, and I&#x27;m more productive and skilled than I ever was, but I&#x27;ve also never been as disillusioned with the state of <i>the industry</i>, and I&#x27;m no-joke considering pivoting into becoming a personal trainer.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39687071" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39687071" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">masto</span><span>|</span><a href="#39686367">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39686387">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39687071">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39687071">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I too got my start in 1984, when Santa brought me a Commodore 64.

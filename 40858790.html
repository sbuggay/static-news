The author goes out of their way to describe a structural problem as being regularly blamed on the wrong cause - executives - and then proceeds to blame it on a different wrong cause - engineers. I appreciate the point of the article as written, which I think is to encourage engineers to push harder against the grain when their plans for the product really are the right idea, but to me the very obvious conclusion is that the structure of the business is wrong.<p>That is an unsatisfying conclusion as the general structure of Google is unlikely to ever change, but it does seem correct to me.<p>The real structural problem is that the needs of the shareholders and by some extension the needs of the high level executives and managers at Google are simply not aligned with the needs of the users. This is why the “nudges” inch along in a direction which is often at odds with the needs of the users.<p>The solution to this broad class of structural problem in our economy, as argued by economists like Richard Wolff, is to build our economy out of firms which are largely cooperative in structure, where the workers and members of the co-op are representative of the users of the product or service. For example if your local water company is a co-op of users, with cooperative decision making power, the co-op isn’t going to vote to raise water rates unnecessarily against their own users.<p>A middle ground in many cases is unions. So if anything this article is unintentionally making a case for a tech workers union at Google. This would change the structure at Google in the most significant way currently possible under today’s legal system.<p>I think the idea that engineers should take more responsibility is a noble one, but it’s not the real problem here. The problem is the structure of the firm.</div><br/><div id="40888506" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40888506" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tempodox</span><span>|</span><a href="#40888441">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40888497">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40888506">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40888506">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; …when their plans for the product really are the right idea…<p>And who gets to define what “right” is?</div><br/><div id="40888731" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40888731" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TaylorAlexander</span><span>|</span><a href="#40888441">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40888506">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40888906">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40888731">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40888731">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In that sentence? That was talking about my interpretation of the OP, which suggests individual engineers advocate for themselves in traditional organizations when they believe in their ideas. So it would be the individual engineer deciding if they believe in their idea, though in traditional orgs it would be the managers that have some say in what gets implemented.<p>However I also see people respond to me when I talk about co-ops who somehow think I want to be Joseph Stalin, where in the imagined case they are skewering me for wanting all the decision making power.

Or at least, it doesn&#x27;t seem well supported.<p>The article seems to be trying to argue that company leadership are not the ones responsible for the &quot;evil&quot; things that companies do. But this:<p>&gt; If you’re an engineer at Google, Facebook, Apple, or Microsoft, it’s always easier to propose architectural changes that don’t hurt the bottom line, or perhaps bolster it by accident. Conversely, if your proposal stands to wipe out a good chunk of revenue, you either self-censor and don’t bring it up — or you end up getting sucked into endless, futile arguments.<p>strongly implies that company leadership are indeed the ones responsible.<p>Like, I think what the article is trying to say is that, Manifest V3 was designed due to real-world privacy concerns, not for profit motives. It just happened to get the right amount of support and buy-in from leadership due to being something that -also- aided profit motives.<p>In other words, when a company leader has a variety of possible projects to invest in, she will naturally tend to invest in the ones with a long-term profit motive for the company. This also necessarily means -not- investing in other, potentially good and helpful and consumer-positive projects, that simply aren&#x27;t as promising from a profit perspective. This phenomenon is what the article calls the &quot;asymmetry of nudges&quot;.<p>But I guess what I&#x27;m failing to grasp is how this means it was the engineers&#x27; doing and not leadership. Yes, the engineers came up with the idea. But in this scenario, it seems like the engineers were the ones who were well-meaning, and just doing their jobs. Whereas leadership were the ones chasing dollar signs at all costs. This is precisely in alignment with what most people posit when they say that big corporations are evil, no?</div><br/><div id="40888970" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40888970" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">saurik</span><span>|</span><a href="#40888497">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40889097">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40888970">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40888970">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why must responsibility be with one party or the other?

If you have no paper birth certificate you are not born...<p>Finland has had much higher digitalization for decades. You have a person number and authorities store everything centrally. A big brother nightmare for Germans.<p>20 years ago many processes in Finland went quickly, much more smoothly than in Germany. However, recently more and more authorities went into meltdown. It takes 3 or 6 months to renew a passport (or you queue in the street for many hours to get it done without an internet reservation). Certificates needed for inheritance processes delayed for many months each, so in the end heirs don&#x27;t get access to their property until years later. If an elder person needs a legal guardian because they are unable to handle banking or similar anymore, you are more or less openly told: Does not make sense queuing, they will die first.<p>Where the degradation came from I have no idea. At least digitalization is not a guarantee that things work smoothly.

Then about 1-2 weeks later you can go and pick up your new passport.<p>Driving license not much different.<p>For most people, paying taxes is a non-event, and tax returns happens automatically in most cases.<p>Then the bad:
- Firearm licenses: more like months if not years in some cases. 
- Birth and marriage certificates: 4-6 months
- Permission for building&#x2F;construction&#x2F;alterations: Don&#x27;t even waste your time.
- Healthcare: get private insurance if you value your life.
- Public transport: lol<p>It&#x27;s interesting how in sufficiently large and complex bureaucratic systems (Governments, Microsoft, etc), you get little pockets of excellence because somewhere in the mess of it all, there is someone who <i>cares</i> about their job, and they put the effort in to make it better for their users&#x2F;customers.<p>In South Africa&#x27;s case, these pockets of excellence are often and frequently replaced, because they are being measured by different metrics than what we as citizens care about, and deemed lacking: Party first, enable corruption, etc. So then you have these government institutions that every 10-15 years or so get renewed, and then coast on that renewal while it gradually goes to shit, before someone steps in and fixes it all up, before them being fired again for not allowing the right amount of corruption to take place.

PhD holders typically fit the &quot;we only want the best of the best&quot; position of the Republicans (even if we accept the conspiracy that they actually hate all minorities, it&#x27;d be a convenient way to &#x27;wash&#x27; that image, without having to accept all that many minorities), and for Democrats it would be a very easy &quot;look, we&#x27;re slowly working to fix immigration&quot; action.</div><br/><div id="39964920" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39964920" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">api</span><span>|</span><a href="#39963509">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39964815">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39964664">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39964920">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39964920">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don’t like to both sides many things but immigration is definitely one case.

She actually got quite depressed about it, and reached out about state sponsored integration courses as the language lessons she was taking were expensive and she wanted to do something more holistic.

And that baggage is slow, paper based, and becomes a significant barrier for doing anything. In many countries the kind of paperwork you have to slave over here just doesn&#x27;t exist in the first place.<p>FWIW my wife and I got married in Denmark. It was impossible for my wife to provide an up-to-date (less than six months old) translated copy of her Chinese birth certificate. Theoretically she could have traveled back to china (in the middle of the pandemic) and begged her backwaters local police authority to print a new copy but they weren&#x27;t obliged to issue her one. Denmark was happy with her passport and some declarations from the local authorities in Germany.<p>Some days I really wonder why I continue to put up with the hassle, probably just sunk cost at this point and stubbornness.

The train networks are fairly extensive, can be quite cheap depending on how you travel, and consistent across the country, but a lot of Germans would much rather complain about how late they are than recognise anything positive about the system. The general public transport networks (i.e. transport inside towns and cities) are amazing, and one of the things that I would most miss if I went anywhere else.<p>I think part of it is just that if you&#x27;re German, you rarely see these systems from an outside perspective, so you only see the points that chafe regularly.

And don&#x27;t get me started on healthcare.<p>Your sentiment is part of the problem to be honest: Germans are always complaining, it&#x27;s fine as it is bla bla. It is if you compare yourself to third world countries. But we compete with Japan, Switzerland, the nordics and so on. Also note that this is not a sentiment that is only found in Germans but also a lot of (high value) immigrants who move on after touching base.

Yes, improvement is possible and necessary, but it&#x27;s also nice to celebrate the successes of your country, and having a single system that covers pretty much all of the country, that integrates regional and intercity travel, that has a transparent and reasonably cost-effective pricing structure, that includes deals like the Länder-Tickets and the 49€ ticket, that is clean, and many other things besides feels like a success to me.<p>Do there need to be changes and improvements?

I would say that somehow, France and Germany are quite similar, it&#x27;s just that one suck more than another on specific areas and vice-versa.
The net salary is somehow higher in Germany but the amount of subsidies you can get from the state is lower also so it&#x27;s pretty much the same.
I prefer the decentralized aspect of Germany (unlike France where everything is just centralized in Paris and the rest is just Silent Hill) and also the fact that you can just live without a car.
From France I prefer the more liberal views on &quot;What the state consider to be a family&quot; which is light years ahead of Germany. This said, if you are a married couple with children, you&#x27;ll get more money from the state in Germany I believe. I believe that Germany is more suitable for mid-40&#x27;s traditional family, younger&#x2F;wilder that that, it can be quite boring.<p>But all of this is just child play compared to how easy things are in China in terms of settle down (based on the experience of someone who has a job with a local company).
I am tired of the pretentious western europe politics&#x2F;administration point of view that immediately ranks everything (including good ideas) coming from Asia&#x2F;global South as &quot;not transposable to Europe&quot; or just &quot;not as good as our ways&quot;.</div><br/><div id="39967612" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39967612" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jonathanstrange</span><span>|</span><a href="#39963509">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39967577">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39963991">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39967612">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39967612">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">China has 0.07%, France 10.3%, and Germany 18% immigrants.

What&#x27;s wrong specifically with regard to notarys as a third party in property sales in Germany is that the amount of work involved in being this third party does not really scale linearly with the value of the thing to be transferred, but the system by which the price of the notaries&#x27; work is determined assumes that a property transfer is twice as laborious (and thus must be twice as expensive) if the property is twice as expensive as some other property. Which is BS.</div><br/><div id="39963495" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39963495" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">StefanWestfal</span><span>|</span><a href="#39961940">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39963405">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39961965">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39963495">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39963495">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Indeed, my mistake and agree.

I consider that to be common knowledge among HN users after about 10 years of having those discussions regularly.<p>Also, property ownership can get ridiculously complex really fast. If just one person owns something, that&#x27;s simple. But in reality, quite often multiple persons own something together (sometimes some of these persons aren&#x27;t even humans, but legal entities). In that case there are a gazillion different ways in which such shared ownership can be implemented, with far-reaching implications with regard to what will happen if people disagree, split up, modify or sell the property further down the road. You cannot simply model this complexity with an SQL database because it involves legal contracts that specify the details in which a properties&#x27; ownership is shared exactly. And the notary is actually responsible in such a case to write these contracts, ensure that every participant knows about their role and rights within these contracts and isn&#x27;t shortchanged.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39964726" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39964726" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nottorp</span><span>|</span><a href="#39961940">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39963495">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39963571">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39961965">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39964726">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39964726">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Side question: why don&#x27;t i hear horror stories about identity theft from those areas that have those evil bureaucratic notaries authenticating everything?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39961965" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39961965" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">morkalork</span><span>|</span><a href="#39961940">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39963093">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39962676">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39961965">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39961965">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Wow and I thought realtors getting a % cut on sales was a scam, at least in NA when you get to the notary, it&#x27;s a flat fee.</div><br/><div id="39962113" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39962113" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">namaria</span><span>|</span><a href="#39961940">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39961965">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39963717">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39962113">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39962113">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In Brazil notaries get a cut of real estate deed transfers, and the position was hereditary until the 1990s.</div><br/><div id="39965372" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39965372" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ProjectArcturis</span><span>|</span><a href="#39961940">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39962113">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39963717">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39965372">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39965372">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In Italy, getting something notarized costs $1-2k.

I have been involved in founding five companies (four GmbH and one GmbH &amp; Co. KG) and closing one down in the last 10 years and I would have no qualms to go for another one. Each founding took about 6-8 weeks from first filing to entry into the registry. Getting a VAT ID can take a few weeks longer -- or in one case months longer -- but you can do business with your normal company tax ID and sort it out at the end of the year. If you are really in a hurry, buy a shell company for a few grands plus corpus and you can be running within a week or two. Notaries are really helpful in that case.<p>From my point of view there are also not many fees and none of them are recurring. IIRC, you have to pay the notary, the registry and the tax office for services rendered. Once you are registered, there are other fees, e.g. IHK (trade association) membership or insurances, but that is not part of the registration, that is cost of doing business.<p>Liquidation on the other hand takes 12 month (a transitory period required by law) and a few weeks before and after the liquidation for notary appointments. That&#x27;s it. All in all it took maybe 18 month from decision point to deletion from the registry and the main part of the extra 6 month was deliberation what needed to be done before the transition started.</div><br/><div id="39967035" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39967035" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">data_maan</span><span>|</span><a href="#39962830">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39965054">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39962861">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39967035">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39967035">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Can you recommend any company in that area that offers these services to buy a &quot;ready to run&quot; shell company?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39962861" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39962861" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TillE</span><span>|</span><a href="#39962830">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39965054">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39963641">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39962861">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39962861">[32 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Germany loves endless bureaucratic paperwork which absolutely must be done in person (and good luck getting an appointment in Berlin), despite the many years of bleating about <i>Digitalisierung</i> which has apparently amounted to nothing.</div><br/><div id="39962922" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39962922" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">robert_foss</span><span>|</span><a href="#39962830">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39962861">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39963601">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39962922">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39962922">[28 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">From what I heard the cut the public funding for Digitalization by 90% last year.

The other neat aspect of stacking a holding company on top of the operating company is that capital gains are not taxed in the event of a sale. That goes for investing into ETFs for example, but more importantly if the holding company ever sells the operating company then that sale is tax-free for the holding company.

After a couple of harsh phone calls (from their end, they were yelling) they simply kept it and told me I could file a &quot;Verwaltungsklage&quot;.

I got my money back a year later (which got worse and worse over time). Simply kills you, If you have to pay the bills and try to route your little boat through the stormy seas.

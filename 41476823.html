Thank you for posting this.  I am fifty years old.  In 1989 my best friend, Geof Allen, and I spent an entire year planning to walk the AT after high school.  During long nights in my parents basement we literally mapped out every step by figuring out how many steps were in a mile, and then multiplying.  Life happened.  He walked the entire AT from Spring Mtn to Mt Kahdin.  I reluctantly followed my parents wishes and went off to college.<p>Even in high school Geof was unlike anyone I ever knew.  He did not have the best life, but he always smiled.  When we were winter-camping together Geof knew how to make your frozen feet not-so-bad.  When we were lost deep in a cave in Newport, Virginia, Geof showed no signs of worry, while I openly panicked.<p>After walking the AT Geof joined the Navy, and when a slot opened up he became a Blue Angel...not a pilot, but still a prestigious position with a flight suit as a uniform.  He married his high school sweetheart, and after the Navy, moved back home and became a police officer.<p>I had totally lost contact with Geof, and was working in IT across the street from my local police department.  As I was walking to my car one afternoon I saw Geof standing in the parking lot.  We chatted and caught up a bit, and then lost contact again.<p>The next time I heard Geof&#x27;s name was years later.  He had committed suicide.  I almost want to say that he didn&#x27;t have a choice.  You see, he had watched all of the other males and one female in his fathers bloodline be taken away by Huntington&#x27;s Disease.  I found out later that Geof was in the early-stages, and it was easy to deduce that he needed to take action while he was still able.<p>We were all from the same hometown.  I knew his Uncles and his Aunt, and watched what Huntington&#x27;s did to them, and I was there the day his father committed suicide.<p>I found Geof&#x27;s picture on athikerpictures.com.  He is second from the left.  Blue pants and white shirt.  I am certain that he made life easier for the three hikers pictured with him.  His trail name was Alpha.  Alpha Geof Allen.</div><br/><div id="41479055" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41479055" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">michelb</span><span>|</span><a href="#41477351">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41477452">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41479055">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41479055">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you for your touching story.

I do however vividly recall the photo archive at Rusty&#x27;s Hardtime Hollow just off the Blue Ridge Parkway section of the AT a few miles but was well worth the trip.<p>Rusty had polaroids of hikers going way back, they lined the walls of every building, when he built new bunkhouses, he started new annual collections.  There were thousands of them.  Every night he would roll his truck down into the parking are blast James Brown and feed what he could to whatever he had or whatever hikers could bring.  Wood fired hot tub, sauna, huge garden, it was a paradise after almost a 1000 miles on foot.<p>I hope the ATC was also able to recover Rusty&#x27;s photos, because he had a real gold mine.  The few years after hiking when I lived in the area I would bring beverages and hot dogs for the hikers.  I lost touch with Rusty after I went west.  I was hiking recently in Maine and talking to another thruhiker who went through in the 2000 and she said the Hollow is gone now which would be a shame of his archive could not be recovered.</div><br/><div id="41478084" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41478084" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">michelpp</span><span>|</span><a href="#41477433">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41477547">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41478084">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41478084">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I found my pic, they spelled my trail name a bit differently: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;athikerpictures.org&#x2F;hikers&#x2F;2329" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;athikerpictures.org&#x2F;hikers&#x2F;2329</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41477547" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41477547" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SaggyDoomSr</span><span>|</span><a href="#41477433">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41478084">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41477725">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41477547">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41477547">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I thruhiked in 2001.

I think I met up with her a few days after this photo was taken. I was envious of her being able to thru-hike - but I made the time to go visit her along the trail and probably did about 400 miles of it, on and off.<p>Excited for a time I can just say screw it, and walk off into the woods for as long as I want. Always felt most at home living out of a bag, calorie starved enough to take immense pleasure in eating things I would never buy in my normal day to day - but filled to the brim with energy. The rush of hill after mountain after hill is greater than the most doomscrolling-optimized feed, and you feel it with all your senses.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41477304" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41477304" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thepuppet33r</span><span>|</span><a href="#41477880">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41477771">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41477304">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41477304">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Between January and April 2009, 12,779 images representing over 18,000 Appalachian Trail hikers were carefully removed from old notebooks, barcoded, scanned at 600 dpi, and placed into archival quality sleeves and slip-covered albums.

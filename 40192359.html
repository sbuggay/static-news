In Mac land Apple has been progressively dumbing down their interfaces, in Windows land Microsoft is more focused on extracting maximum value from their users than trying to meaningfully improve their platform. In Linux land there are some interesting things happening with Nix&#x2F;Guix around declarative system configurations, and around Fedora with its layered images+Flatpak distros for making systems more reliable, and System76 may be doing something novel interface-wise with Cosmic marrying powerful tiling&#x2F;tabbing window layouts with intuitive controls and the niceties of an all-in-one desktop environment.

I had this discussion not too long ago about this. I&#x27;d love to have a combination of a library (Personal Knowledge Management style), data ingestions, and a current world view&#x2F;state.<p>The PKM is the stored info to write to and query against (both for LLMs and humans). The data ingests are just a pipeline of digital inputs to the system, like chat logs, maybe (transcribed) webcam feeds, files i&#x27;m currently editing on desktop, browsing history, etc. The current world view is the interpretation of what i&#x27;m doing - to tie all the ingests together and give them context. Eg in isolation browsing some Rust crates might not be that useful. But if i&#x27;m also editing Project X on my computer then it&#x27;s reasonable to assume the searching is related to X. However if it&#x27;s been 8 hours since any Project X activity, it&#x27;s less likely related. Same goes for context-less chat logs (as happens frequently in my house) where they are extensions of a voice conversation, etc.<p>All of this stuff is of course insanely privacy invading, so i&#x27;d only implement this locally. I also wouldn&#x27;t even store most of it for fear of data invasion, but using it to fuel a PKM automatically seems pretty sexy. Like browser history, but for your life.<p>This is all just wishful thinking though, LLMs have been moving too fast for me to even bother toying with this.

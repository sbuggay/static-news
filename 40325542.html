Instead, you had a much narrower focus of acceptable work and topics, with the result that artists were all engaged with basically the same art forms and the same topics, across the entirety of the artistic community. For example, both da Vinci and Raphael were painting Madonnas [2], whereas today you&#x27;d certainly never have two world-famous painters in direct competition working on the same type of painting – because their value is determined by their individuality and self-expression, not their expertise&#x2F;skill.<p>This is a widespread post-modern culture thing and not limited to art, of course, and probably won&#x27;t go away for a long, long time, or at least until you get a massive society-wide idea like Christianity to take root again.<p>1.

Just completely threw in the towel.<p>To this day, every method of printing has a very limited color space that fails entirely to capture the vibrancy and brilliance possible with paints. Paintings like the Blue Boy are impossible to truly convey in CMYK and painters like Hans Holbein the younger were capable of photorealism in the 16th century that took until the mid to late 20th century to replicate with photography, with the added benefit of artistic license.<p>I think it&#x27;s entirely artists&#x27; fault that they lost the plot in the 19th and 20th century. It wasn&#x27;t until graphic design software took away their advantage of the imagination-to-paper pipeline that they were truly doomed.<p>Sidenote: I think impressionism predates photography becoming a competitor. It doesn&#x27;t predate the first photographs, but the movement started decades before photography was good enough to threaten artists.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40330077" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40330077" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anigbrowl</span><span>|</span><a href="#40326700">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40326783">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40330082">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40326795">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40330077">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40330077">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>There&#x27;s probably an essay or book out there covering the two intertwining topics, but I can&#x27;t think of any offhand.</i><p>&#x27;The work of art in an age of mechanical reproduction&#x27; by Walter Benjamin is a great read.

My cynicism says that people like him, people who create psychologically dense pieces for the BBC, are actually on the side of conformity. I&#x27;ve felt since I was young that we are being sold our revolutions. They&#x27;ve firmly commoditized the opposition.<p>I&#x27;m tired of the politicization of everything. Even in this piece, there is an implicit call to political action underneath his attempted reframing of individualism. He wants us to see the <i>power</i> in being a member of a group. It is some kind of call to group-think, to pretend you are an individual and yet still act within a political body seeking power.<p>The real question I have is much deeper. Sapolsky has been on the podcast circuit pushing his new book that insists we have no free will whatsoever. Žižek claims that we are locked inside our ideologies. But I keep going back to ancient Greek philosophical ideas that entreat me to &quot;know thyself&quot;.<p>I heard on a podcast recently that Sartre&#x27;s lament that &quot;hell is other people&quot; is best interpreted as the observation that our instinct to mimic others invades our own freedom. When our peer group expresses strong virtues we are pressured to conform by threat of ostracization. This leads to anxiety as our own sense of virtue may be misaligned according to the group.<p>Yet I have a growing belief that finding my own virtue, something that completely originates within myself independent of external influence, is the real key. And Curtis here is suggesting that technology can be used to that purpose, to unite like-minded individuals based on their genuine virtues.<p>I suppose it is the power-seeking aspect of this piece that sits poorly with me. That I would (or should) seek other like-minded people for the purpose of exerting some political influence. It seems to me that just identifying and remaining true to virtues that I feel originate within myself is hard enough.

Viewers should understand that Curtis is highly selective in what he takes and puts together. Viewers should carefully consider any decision to watch while under the influence of substances that tend to make you suggestible or impressed.<p>The amount of archival footage Curtis riffles through for his pieces is an impressive part of the story of his storytelling. It should also be its own implicit warning.  The runtime of the footage he watched and did <i>not</i> include dwarfs the runtime of any single piece of his you might see. To be well read on any particular event, much less time period, that he jaunts through would take a stack of books and a lot of serious attention.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40331403" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40331403" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hi-v-rocknroll</span><span>|</span><a href="#40331793">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40331129">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40331403">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40331403">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hyperindividualism lends itself to the footguns of narcissism, entitlement, and drama while diminishing empathy, solidarity, and community.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40331129" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40331129" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">backtoyoujim</span><span>|</span><a href="#40331403">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40327330">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40331129">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40331129">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Capitalism is about self-expression&quot; is a garbage statement that made me wish I hadn&#x27;t read that far into the article.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40327330" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40327330" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Karellen</span><span>|</span><a href="#40331129">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40326984">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40327330">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40327330">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; There is another definition of freedom which simply says, “In whose service is perfect freedom.” By giving yourself up to the Lord, you free yourself of the narrow cage of your own desires and your own selfishness.<p>...and that&#x27;s where they lost me.</div><br/><div id="40332862" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40332862" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">e4325f</span><span>|</span><a href="#40327330">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40332855">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40332862">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40332862">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It doesn&#x27;t have to be &quot;the Lord&quot;, that&#x27;s just an example, albeit a poor one.

Self-expression is how we can fix that. Unfortunately many parts of the system are working to suppress self-expression and hence prevent the fix.<p>Self-expression is only dangerous for the individual who possesses it. For society, it is always a positive. Contrarians are the heroes of free society, this is true regardless of how vile their views are. They are essential for maintaining the right level of chaos to have a free, functioning society. Extreme contrarians define the boundary for freedom within which everyone else can roam without fear. Contrarians are a minority by definition so they are not a threat to a functioning society.<p>Self-expression and individualism are critical because it&#x27;s the best mechanism that humans have to prevent their political systems from declining into totalitarianism and poverty. Without self-expression, we get total compliance, an entire society fully compliant to all the whims of the elite; if the elites are good, then lucky for you, until the next regime change. If the elites are bad, then you&#x27;re in for a miserable time. Not to mention that the people who seek power and who are willing to take irrational risks to attain it aren&#x27;t usually the friendliest bunch on average.<p>With self-expression and individualism, society can protect itself against idol worship. The intentions of the elite doesn&#x27;t matter as much because they can be easily replaced.<p>Without self-expression, society will fall into one delusion after another... By the time it wakes up from its current delusion, it will be too late, the backlash will be so sudden and massive that it will guarantee that it will fall victim to yet another delusion in the opposite extreme.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40327172" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40327172" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">katmai</span><span>|</span><a href="#40326719">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40327172">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40327172">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">are you mental cuz?

I&#x27;ve used it personally, pedagogically, and professionally. I recommendeded it to others for their desktops and servers. If you wanted to use Linux, I&#x27;d tell you there are two options that are stable and well-supported: Red Hat and Debian. Red Hat has died recently. RIP.<p>I&#x27;m no longer confident that Fedora will continue to be a thriving open-source project. If IBM is killing RHEL clones now, why risk Fedora being next?<p>I hear you saying &quot;RHEL is derived from Fedora&quot; and &quot;Fedora is a separate open-source project&quot;. The thing is, RHEL is derived from Centos Stream *now*. Why does Fedora need to exist? Or rather, why does Red Hat need to provide engineering and infra to Fedora? It&#x27;s true that Fedora is a separate project, but its mostly contributed by Red Hat employees. If IBM decides tomorrow to stop paying for Fedora because Centos Stream is enough, can Fedora stand alone?<p>Maybe this is just FUD, but I no longer have confidence in an IBM owned Linux distro. I&#x27;ve already moved to Debian for personal machines, and I&#x27;ve been advocating it professionally as well. It&#x27;s just irresponsible for an org that spends significant engineering time customizing their Linux installations to base on an uncertain Red Hat&#x2F;IBM backed distro over a fully open-source project with no strings attached. Fool me once shame on you but fool me twice and, well, IBM isn&#x27;t going to get me again.</div><br/><div id="37009950" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37009950" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">INTPenis</span><span>|</span><a href="#37009729">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37009962">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37009950">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37009950">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;RHEL is derived from Centos Stream <i>now</i>.

While at DEC, he got Linus to the right places and meet the right people, so that his &quot;hobby, nothing big or professional&quot; OS entered the trajectory to become what we know today.<p>I&#x27;m about 30 years younger than Jon Hall, so I couldn&#x27;t be familiar with his accomplishments other than by oral&#x2F;written accounts. Since he hasn&#x27;t written big hit books I could read or software I could use (alright alright, Linux for Dummies), I constantly saw people calling him a legend but never understood why. I finally asked around in the Linux kernel community, and was explained the extent of his contribution: he was Linus&#x27; mentor in a way. When they met in 1994, Linus was a 25 yo student and Jon a 44 yo DEC marketing manager. I like to think of their conversation as something like <i>&quot;Listen to me kid, this is what you gonna do&quot;</i>.<p>With this in mind, a line in Jon Hall&#x27;s wikipedia bio stands out: <i>It was during his time with Digital that he initially became interested in Linux and was instrumental in obtaining equipment and resources for Linus Torvalds to accomplish his first port, to Digital&#x27;s Alpha platform.</i>. Another one in his linkedin work history reflects this view: Senior Marketing Manager, DEC, 1983-1998: <i>In 1994 met Linus Torvalds, recognized commercial value of Linux, obtained funding for port of Linux to 64-bit Alpha processor, opening up a billion dollar line of Linux-based High Performance Computing Super Computers</i>.<p>WP: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jon_Hall_(programmer)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jon_Hall_(programmer)</a><p>LI: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;maddog&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;maddog&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37007662" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37007662" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cbm-vic-20</span><span>|</span><a href="#37006851">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37010140">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37007954">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37007662">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37007662">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">While on an Alpha team at DEC, I was in a meeting when maddog walked in, and I fanboyed a bit- he was the first famous &quot;computer person&quot; I&#x27;d ever met.

While the Copyright Office&#x27;s interpretation of copyright law is not always affirmed by the Courts or Congress, more often than not it is – so, it would not have been an unreasonable assumption in 1972 that the answer to &quot;Are computer programs copyrightable under US law?&quot; was likely &quot;Yes&quot;. I don&#x27;t know whether the same answer would have been true 3 years earlier or not, but quite possibly it would have been – it is an interesting historical question, when was the first copyright registration for a computer program which they accepted?<p>I also found a journal article [1] which says (p. 1748, my emphasis):<p>&gt; There was considerable debate in the 1960s, during the gestation of the legislation that became the Copyright Act of 1976, about whether computer programs could, or should, be protected by copyright law. <i>Although no one seriously questioned that source code forms of programs could be copyrighted as written texts</i>, there were two principal concerns about applying copyright to machine-executable forms of programs...<p>So, according to that, the debate was primarily about whether <i>object code</i> was copyrightable, as opposed to <i>source code</i>. At the time, distributing software as source code was extremely common – indeed, configuration files were rare, configuration was commonly hardcoded in the source code, making compilation a necessary part of the installation process – which meant that source code being much more clearly copyrightable than object code would have been less of an obstacle to commercial software distribution than it would have been in later decades, when object code only distribution became much more common.<p>[0] Catalog of Copyright Entries.

But you are entitled to have certain freedoms with that software. These freedoms include running as many instances you&#x27;d like for whatever purpose, and giving away copies of that software for other people to use. So the constructive result of these freedoms is that the cost of software is anchored around the cost of distribution, rather than an arbitrary cost set by the developer.<p>Now personally, I think it would be fantastic if someone were able to come up with some sensible pay-to-use libre license that still retained most of the freedom. The libre community is desperately missing straightforward funding like the proprietary software ecosystem. But it would be necessary to reduce freedom to do that, and it&#x27;s not particularly clear how to best do that specifically. Any concept of &quot;license instance&quot; to charge based on results in assumptions about how the software is run, that basically undermines the ability to run it on a new type of thing. If the license is per core, then about &quot;serverless&quot;? Or let&#x27;s say someone forks the software and makes substantive changes - does the original maintainer get to stick around charging rent despite not continuing development?<p>But what Redhat is doing here really isn&#x27;t really a full on attempt at that.

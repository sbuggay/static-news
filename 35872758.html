I told one of my housemates that I was interviewing with them and she fired up, angrily telling me that I needed to go over there and tell them to stop changing things. Her experience of using Facebook was basically that she’d just figure out where the button for something was, and then they would redesign it for seemingly no reason and she couldn’t find anything again. I asked her a bunch of questions (since this is great stuff to talk about in interviews). I hadn’t appreciated how upsetting redesigns are to people who just want to use the software.<p>But you also need to make your software good for you as a programmer too. As programmers we’re like builders. What we build today becomes our workspace tomorrow. Leaving a codebase neat and tidy makes it easier to spot bugs and make changes down the road.

I’ve seen this with senior DBA’s and CEOs alike. They are not objectively good judges of “what works” for anyone except themselves because of this huge conflict of interest.<p>I sincerely believe you see the same thing with the elderly at a certain point - I’ve known a few people that after like 85 have zero interest and feel zero compulsion to “stay on top of” new ways of doing things, whether it’s software, vehicles, whatever.

There was some software that let you read Mac disks on a PC, but it was somewhat flakey, and then you were left with the fact that the base file format on the Mac with resource and data forks was much different, and then of course you were probably using different spreadsheet and word processing software.  Overall it was just barely possible to share files if you really worked at it.<p>What you tended to see was that most everyone used PCs except certain industries&#x2F;jobs that needed the graphical capabilities of the Mac.  For example, if you were in a newsroom, everyone would be using Macs because there really wasn&#x27;t good desktop publishing software for the PC until about the early nineties.<p>The Amiga had a niche in video production because there really wasn&#x27;t anything comparable to the video toaster for the Mac or PC until much later.  You&#x27;d also see various types of workstations used for CAD, and in the nineties, SGI was the only game in town for high end 3D graphics.  Hardly anyone bought a NeXT because they were so expensive and therefore didn&#x27;t have enough software.  They were pretty good for rapidly developing GUI software though, so there were a few companies, specifically banks, that used some of them for internally developed software.</div><br/><div id="35883315" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35883315" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alwillis</span><span>|</span><a href="#35878673">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35879449">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35882852">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35883315">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35883315">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was pretty involved with the NeXT community back in the day.<p>If you recall, NeXT started as a workstation for higher ed.

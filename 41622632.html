The advantages of digital ordering for both customers and restaurants are:<p>- staff <i>can</i> keep the menu up to date, basically realtime (they have to do it tho)<p>- orders can directly land in the kitchen instead of through the waiting staff, which may or may not be coming<p>- payment can also be done thst way<p>Of course there are more advantages for the restaurants that may or may not go counter to the interests (or rights!) of their customers. E.g. the ability to easily build profiles and sell that data to the highest bidder.<p>There are downsides too:<p>- digital menus can fail more easily than paper menus<p>- congrats you are a waiter, and now IT-support as well<p>- customers without phones, no&#x2F;sucky internet or devices that fail to display the menu are out of luck, so you have to provide offline alternatives&#x2F;own devices that need their own maintenance<p>- options that are not in the menu and fields that are not offered cannot be filled, e.g. can be a problem if you are allergic rtc.<p>- unpersonal.

They allow you to refill your drink as many times as you like within 60 minutes of purchasing it, and the way this restriction is implemented is by having you scan a QR code they print on your receipt at the drink machine. I scanned the QR code with Binary Eye (android app that reads all sorts of barcodes, highly recommended). It contained some numbers I couldn&#x27;t immediately recognize as interesting, a timestamp in a format similar to 202409231049, and a UUID.<p>Now, the UUID is probably the ID of the order in their internal system, so the question is: does the drink machine only read the timestamp or does it also use the UUID to query the internal system to re-validate it?

Then, when the kids grow out of it, the blackboard ends up on e-bay.<p>So, when I moved places, I used the opportunity that I already had a moving van rented and picked one up from someone selling one who was quite nearby, paying €50 for it.<p>When I opened it, I realized that it had chalky deposits all over it that didn&#x27;t go away with normal cleaning products.  So I had to use a brush-bit for a power drill to scrub it clean.<p>Then I found that I only have dry walls with hollow spaces beneath that can&#x27;t carry the load (it weighs maybe around 100kg), so I made a technical drawing specifying a stand and went on etsy to look for a metal-worker who could make me that stand.<p>All-in-all, it was just laying in a corner in my office for about a year until I finally finished the project of setting it up.<p>So, it ended up being a lot more hassle than I thought it would be, but now I&#x27;m quite happy that I have it.</div><br/><div id="38978278" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38978278" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bjornbsm</span><span>|</span><a href="#38978050">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38977465">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38978278">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38978278">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is paint that can make whatever you are painting supposedly gets a blackboard surface.

Watching someone reason with a writing implement in hand is an incredibly valuable learning exercise, since effective technical problem solving is largely done that way in practice. Students should also be practicing solving problems directly at the blackboard, with the teacher and other students as an audience. (Writing on an overhead projector or some kind of projected ipad screen or something could be an alternative, but these are higher-tech for no real advantages in an in-person lecture context, and make it much harder for multiple people to participate together. Writing on paper is an okay substitute if there are no more than about 3–4 students per teacher.)<p>A handout or slides or video is an opaque one-way tool, a prepared polished document that students can see but typically have no easy way to imitate. It affords the lecturer more chance to put effort in up front into making a clearer document, but robs students of the chance to witness their teacher doing some of the work in real time, and ultimately leads to a relative loss of basic problem solving skills involving writing&#x2F;drawing, trading them away in favor of immediate gratification. Sometimes this trade-off is worth it (e.g. Grant Sanderson&#x27;s work largely couldn&#x27;t be replaced by blackboard lectures <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw</a> ), but when the school&#x27;s entire pedagogy moves that way, the loss is tremendous in my opinion, an erosion of some core tools of a centuries-old mathematical&#x2F;scientific culture.</div><br/><div id="38977845" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38977845" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lisper</span><span>|</span><a href="#38977465">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38977743">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38977684">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38977845">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38977845">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  Watching someone reason with a writing implement in hand is an incredibly valuable learning exercise, since effective technical problem solving is largely done that way in practice.<p>I vehemently disagree.

Writing imposes a speed limit on the lecturer, and forces them to verbalize the whole reasoning process. In slides it is <i>much</i> easier to skip past the meat of the work, and much harder to be responsive in writing&#x2F;pictures to questions and discussion.<p>&gt; <i>can&#x27;t remember a single class where a professor actually walked us through the process of figuring something out</i><p>This can&#x27;t really be blamed on the tool of the chalkboard. I promise you this does happen in some classrooms. It certainly happens all the time in informal discussion between professionals. In my opinion schools should strive much harder to induct students into a problem-solving culture than teach specific content trivia. A blackboard is an invaluable tool for the former.<p>&gt; <i>often solved by writing code</i><p>Writing code is a narrow and constrained tool with much less freedom than writing on paper, and thoughts made first in code are substantially blinkered in my experience compared to thoughts worked through on paper. Many of the best programmers I know do their most important work on paper (sketching, planning, doodling, drawing diagrams, ...) before ever touching the keyboard. And that is far more true still for mathematicians, physicists, etc.<p>What is true is that many programmers are not very effectively taught to use paper to its full advantage as a tool for thought, and either never learn or largely figure it out on their own. Our typical computer science pedagogy is frankly terrible at this, and professionals&#x27; on-the-job training isn&#x27;t much better.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38977684" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38977684" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">leidenfrost</span><span>|</span><a href="#38977465">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38977590">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38977605">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38977882">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38977684">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38977684">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thing is, making you write what you hear improves meomory and info retention and retrieval.<p>PDFs Are a nice tool for the big books where you need lots of texts, images and diagrams.

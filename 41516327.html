The &#x27;fake it till you make it&#x27; approach can be especially helpful for building confidence and momentum.<p>I think the key is finding that balance between pushing ourselves to grow and being kind to ourselves when we need to rest. It&#x27;s okay to take a step back, recharge, and prioritize our own well-being.

E.g. here are a few issues I encountered in my current project at work in the last month: &quot;their framework makes assumptions that don&#x27;t apply to our code, so we reimplemented the metrics instead of trying to integrate their version&quot; or &quot;the data was labelled wrongly, so we had to work around that&quot;, or &quot;this coding convention is slowing us down&quot;. Once I tried digging down, it turns out they were all people problems in disguise, and they could all be solved by &quot;stating the obvious&quot;. Do you never encounter issues on team &#x2F; across teams, where in the end it turns out a lot of issues are just people not talking to each other or misunderstanding each other?

If you extrinsic your interactions you&#x27;re all-ways going to come away with a lack of agency, stress and&#x2F;or frustration. if you intrinsic your interactions, you&#x27;re going to be more in control, accountable, and over-all indifferent to other people.<p>For example well at work, I&#x27;m being compensated to participate in the organization to work towards its goals, wants, needs and&#x2F;or desires. Those have nothing to do with me, nor do i really care about it. I will engage with people at work, colleagues and managers, how-ever if later they don&#x27;t volunteer engage back - such as being cordial, I don&#x27;t re-engage because I consider it to be intrusive.<p>Now let say you have co-workers who have a glaring communication problem. It it pretty obviously that you can do anything about it. So you engage their manager of lack of communication, and lack of professionalism. If their manager doesn&#x27;t want to rectify the problem then you communicate it with your manager but at the same time be professional about it that you do not have the capacity to deliver on the deliverables within your current roles.

Just like ripping off a band-aid.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of times when wining a conflict is far better than avoiding it. And I see articles like this, books like Nonviolent Communication, ideas like &quot;emotional intelligence&quot; (check it out, no such thing exists) - as misguided as it always puts you in the defensive&#x2F;de-escalating role even when you might be better served by letting things play out or even attacking, baiting your opponent into attacking, etc.<p>Violence is sometimes the right answer. When to apply it and when to avoid it is the hard question. But we didn&#x27;t evolve an amygdala for nothing, and especially not for a &quot;coach for leaders&quot; (what the hell is that?) to tell us to always ignore it as an unquestioned premise for a promotional blog post.

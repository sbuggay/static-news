Sadly though, that functionality has historically difficult to be successful with due to bugs, inconsistencies and API friction.<p>- Pragmatic drag and drop is low level wrapper around web platform drag and drop and is attempting to provide a fast, safe and (hopefully) easy way to successfully unlock the power of the web platform<p>- You can use Pragmatic drag and drop with any tech stack (svelte, vue, react, vanillajs etc) and you can use it to build _any_ drag and drop experience you like<p>- We have optimised Pragmatic drag and drop for performance and flexibility. It consists of a small core and lots of optional pieces. The big idea is that folks only ever need to include the code they need for their experience. Small pieces also allows folks to borrow as much as they can and only build the specific pieces they need for bespoke experiences. More details: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5SQkOyzZLHM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5SQkOyzZLHM</a><p>- We make it easy to attach data for external windows and applications, and to receive data from them (and you only pay code for that functionality if you want it!)<p>- Pragmatic drag and drop is already powering drag and drop in some of the biggest software products, including Trello, Jira and Confluence.<p>- We have design guidance and accessibility guidance and outputs which folks are welcome to use, or you can create your own design and accessibility solutions<p>- It works with multi drag. We already have multi drag in a few places in production, but we currently don&#x27;t have public guidance or an example (work in progress!)<p>I am happy to answer questions folks might have.

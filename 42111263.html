I tried teaching fractions the way I was taught ... but after several days, a test showed it just wasn&#x27;t working <i>at all</i>. Frustrating <i>for most</i> too.<p>One day about a week later I drew a box on the blackboard, and called it one dollar (still worth something at the time.)<p>I then drew a single vertical line through it, pointed at the left half and asked &#x27;what&#x27;s this worth?&#x27; Slight delay ... &#x27;50 cents?&#x27; Then I added a horizontal line, pointed at the upper right corner: &#x27;what&#x27;s this worth?&#x27; Soon it was becoming easy! Sixths, eighths... &#x27;take away 3 sevenths, what&#x27;s left? ... After a couple more hours of this, most of the class easily solved &#x27;simplify 3 sixths&#x27; or &#x27;how many quarters to make 2 and a half&#x27;. Every few weeks later, we revisited to see what stuck.<p>Works the same in the sciences, for many anyway.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42180418" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42180418" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dawnofdusk</span><span>|</span><a href="#42181194">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42111970">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42180418">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42180418">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The content of the book looks really nice, but I&#x27;m not sure why one needs a book that explicitly aims to &quot;engage students&quot; and is also targeted at upper-level undergraduates or graduate students.

Perhaps many seem interested due to peer or economical pressure.<p>Meanwhile economy needs proper new recruits which is impossible statistically at this point.<p>We also, back in the day, did not immediately grasp the beauty, and also the need, for programming logic (prolog) or certain discrete structures - things people learn in the universities.<p>Yet we learned ourselves to debug and code - by trial and error, by working in friends groups, and loved it. Loved to write code and see things move on the screen. We were just kids in high schools, right, makes us what - 14 at the time? Nobody has ever pushed me or chased me do that.<p>Since I started teaching Perl in 2003 (and did so for 10 years on university grounds) I got absolutely convinced that people learn better when they can see the result, when they entertain and generally when something gets to convince them the matter is not so hard at all.<p>So, kudos for the book.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42180855" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42180855" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chaps</span><span>|</span><a href="#42180418">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42180971">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42111970">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42180855">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42180855">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a person who just dives into things, these sorts of resources are helpful to bridge many gaps.

You can&#x27;t understand Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetism without calculus.<p>Now there are many universities and majors which will give you physics before calculus (forgetting that the original argument were in reverse) or will give some majors what is called Algebra based physics. Which is kind of trust me these are the equations to solve this problem, you just need to solve this algebraic manipulation of numbers. So if I give you any physics problem that requires any further manipulation or derivation then you will realize you did not understand physics well.<p>There is also benefits of studying calculus in itself. For example, a lot of optimization techniques that is being used by programmers and ML are rooted from calculus methods.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42180463" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42180463" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">readthenotes1</span><span>|</span><a href="#42111970">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42181024">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42180568">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42180463">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42180463">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I once used it to get reimbursed properly for local salary taxes I had to pay while at a job site.<p>Converging series.

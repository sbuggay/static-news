Maybe your donation management approach handles this?<p>Finally, &quot;api access to third parties without being able to monetize it&quot; - the request isn&#x27;t so much for <i>third</i> party access, as first party - primarily for artists, maybe optionally for patrons.  (This one is a little less important if you have a broad enough range of artist-CRM options, but really, noone has before, api support for developers is a great way to let other people fail fast so you don&#x27;t have to...)  Also, the API in question is something slightly less sophisticated than &quot;a single google sheet per artist&quot;, it&#x27;s not going to be <i>that</i> expensive.<p>I&#x27;m definitely curious about what you come up with, especially if you get traction with artists - but only about half a dozen of the artists I support through patreon are outside the US anyway, so until you work out US support I&#x27;m probably not going to notice.  Good luck, though.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37808706" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37808706" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jaggederest</span><span>|</span><a href="#37808663">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37808767">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37808708">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37808706">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37808706">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; &quot;by works&quot; payment model is illegal.

I cannot speak for all countries but I would say most have a law that requires you to get a sole proprietor license or incorporate as company when you are getting income from repeated transactions. Customers have various protections so they must know the identity of the seller. Not that they want to, mostly they don&#x27;t, but by law they must be able to get that information, possible even receive an invoice that lists this information. Not to mention that if you are buying works for business purposes, VAT might get involved and other legal and tax complexities.<p>If you are making a platform you must make it universally usable. Just because one creator does not like or is missing some thing, you just cannot bend the platform to suit his needs. It just does not work like that.<p>Personally, I have solved the anonymity issue. It&#x27;s not hard to do but it requires legal layering, which sounds way more complex than it actually is, but i don&#x27;t want to get out my solution in here.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37808916" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37808916" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BlueTemplar</span><span>|</span><a href="#37808663">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37808708">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37808685">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37808916">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37808916">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You are confusing anonymity and pseudonymity.

And idk about you, but I&#x27;ve done this without a moment&#x27;s thought about how the other end will be warm. The action feels fairly automatic in the same way walking outside in winter has an automatic response of grabbing a jacket.<p>Of course, this could be because (and likely is) a more complex equation is formulated in my mind but just operated outside the conscious part. But I think that just illustrates how the lines blur. Especially since many conscious actions turn into unconscious ones. Think about when you first learned to drive a car and how involved you were compared to now many years later. In fact, you WANT to have automated responses as these are quicker, but they come through experience. Do we call this foresight and planning? I think you can argue either side. You can easily argue that some algorithm with explicit foresight and planning was encoded into the subconscious.<p>I guess I&#x27;m just trying to say that it is quite complicated and we should be ensuring this complexity is known (the existence of complexity, not necessarily all the details), or it will be difficult to interpret.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39813756" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39813756" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">inglor_cz</span><span>|</span><a href="#39811680">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39812431">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39812692">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39813756">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39813756">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The jumper explanation is interesting, but it has a hidden catch.<p>While the Stone Age people who first came up with clothing certainly didn&#x27;t understand heat flow equations, they still had to think in advance about the coming cold snap and make preparations: hunting down some game for its coat, skinning it etc. Quite a sophisticated set of actions, not a mere instinctive response to changing temperature.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39811928" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39811928" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">slothtrop</span><span>|</span><a href="#39811680">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39811928">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39811928">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Here we go again anthropomorphizing creatures that live 1-2 years by misrepresenting data for clicks.</div><br/><div id="39812194" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39812194" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RoyalHenOil</span><span>|</span><a href="#39811928">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39812015">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39812194">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39812194">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What aspect of it is anthropomorphizing?

It’s completely automatic and is not obvious.<p>A human bounces the ball: the connotation of play. Something or an animal bounces the ball: mechanical movement. Somehow, it feels like a different action.<p>In a more drastic version: a human is learning = self-fulfillment, becoming a better person and better member of society, advancement and progress, basic right; machine learning = consuming a dataset to create a black box that can “predict” the next token if you give it one.<p>If you see “bounces the ball” accompanied by “play” when talking about an animal, it can feel like the intent is to use one version of bouncing in place of another to anthropomorphize an animal (although it’s not clear what would be the alternative for the same mechanical action). I think it can be true that animals play, but someone who doesn’t think so can see it as sensationalizing and misleading public into being taken literally.<p>In a similar vein, a statement “LLM learns” could seem normal to some, but rub someone else wrong if they think attributing humanness to LLMs is sensationalizing and misappropriating industry term into being taken literally (probably to benefit the big tech).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39812015" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39812015" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BriggyDwiggs42</span><span>|</span><a href="#39811928">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39812194">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39811990">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39812015">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39812015">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Octopuses are crazy smart and theres tons of evidence for it; not sure where this comment comes from even if the article is mediocre.</div><br/><div id="39812648" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39812648" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lpfnrobin</span><span>|</span><a href="#39811928">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39812015">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39811990">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39812648">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39812648">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What happens after the bottle?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39811990" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39811990" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kaycebasques</span><span>|</span><a href="#39811928">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39812015">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39811990">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39811990">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I know that you&#x27;re correct to generalize most octopuses living for that timeframe but I was very interested to learn of this one <i>brooding</i> for <i>four years</i>: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mbari.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;deep-sea-octopus-broods-eggs-for-over-four-years-longer-than-any-known-animal&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mbari.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;deep-sea-octopus-broods-eggs-for-...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

The senior&#x27;s (personal) objective is not to get fired, maintain their position as the most senior so they can get the payrises and promotions, etc. So they sort of have an incentive to choose something that is going to be easier to understand for them than for others e.g. juniors, a kind of &quot;moat&quot; to protect their position of power and high salary getting attacked by lower paid juniors who don&#x27;t yet have the experience to understand complex abstractions over manual tasks they haven&#x27;t yet done themselves.<p>I mean obviously that&#x27;s not a kind thing for a senior to do, nor something that&#x27;s in their employer&#x27;s interest, but on the other hand it is rational given their incentives...</div><br/><div id="36642348" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36642348" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">josephg</span><span>|</span><a href="#36638068">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36642236">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36638540">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36642348">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36642348">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Senior here. I think this is an overly cynical take.<p>You want to pick a set of tools which will help you get the job at hand done most effectively. It’s often easier and cheaper to hire or train a team to use a framework or library than it is to reimplement the functionality that library provides from scratch. Eg, if I was building a big single page app, I’d rather use react than reimplement react’s functionality, badly, on top of jquery or something.<p>Projects last years. An engineer with solid fundamental knowledge can get up to speed with most of these tools and libraries in a few days. The math usually checks out to make them worth using.<p>But I still acknowledge your point. There are plenty of terrible senior engineers out there making bad choices on tools. And there is a lot of damage a bad tool choice can make to a project. Libraries and frameworks rarely tell you when they’re buggy messes. And coworkers rarely tell you when learning some new tool feels beyond them. So I’m sure there’s plenty of projects out there trying to use fancy tools which have a net negative effect on team productivity.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36638540" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36638540" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">88913527</span><span>|</span><a href="#36638068">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36642236">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36638371">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36638540">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36638540">[66 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Everyone needs to learn to do calculus by hand before advancing to the calculator.

A software developer is focused on developing a certain feature or fixing a certain bug within the context of an architecture that&#x27;s already determined, rarely making decisions about how to structure the overall data or control flow of a system or what abstractions the system uses, but accepting what&#x27;s already there; meanwhile, a software architect is going to be making those more broad abstract philosophical decisions that form the framework of how further features are implemented.<p>This is not to suggest that there is a rigid distinction between the two — all software architects are going to also be software developers in the process of building an architecture, or when new architecture is not needed, and many software developers will occasionally act as software architects. Nor is this intended to suggest that the architecture of a software project must be planned out in advance with all of the concepts and data and control flow either — just that there are points in the process of developing software where these large-scale architectural decisions about what abstractions to use and the flow between them must be made. But there do seem to be two somewhat distinct &quot;hats&quot; people who program wear.</div><br/><div id="36641364" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36641364" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">leemcalilly</span><span>|</span><a href="#36638068">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36640107">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36642132">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36641364">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36641364">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">does what you’re making matter to people or not?

Possibly not.<p>I suspect that what makes a framework easy to learn is, above everything else, good documentation.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Games&#x2F;Tutorials&#x2F;2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Games&#x2F;Tutorials&#x2F;2D_...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;excaliburjs.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;excaliburjs.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36639620" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36639620" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">7speter</span><span>|</span><a href="#36638450">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36639260">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36641417">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36640484">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36639620">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36639620">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Its resonance may sustain because theres always people entering the field who are trying to build something, and either get caught up on a frameworks hypetrain or have fond enough memories using a given framework to build something quickly, and then getting burned trying to build something ambitious with a given framework because its opinionation proves to be too rigid one way or another, and a perpetual new influx of these sorts of people are happy to know it isn’t just them who hate (or at least were burned by) frameworks.<p>Or maybe thats just me.</div><br/><div id="36640089" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36640089" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">codetrotter</span><span>|</span><a href="#36638450">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36639620">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36640878">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36640089">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36640089">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One of the very first times I was paid to professionally develop software for someone else I totally fucked it up by trying to build some kind of “modular” “reusable” contraption, that in reality was a vague collection of ill-defined ideas for what I wanted to make.<p>I have since come to believe that this is a trap that many people fall into.<p>Even a colleague of mine at my current job might be sort of in this track himself at the moment I think.

JS has gone through so many &quot;you need a factory factory factory&quot;, and now we have gone back to basic principles. A few examples I&#x27;ve lived:<p>- Browser incompatibilities. You couldn&#x27;t just do X, because in other browsers X might behave differently. So you would write X blueprint and use an X factory that would auto-generate code for the different browsers. This applies to both JS, CSS and HTML BTW.<p>- Then the modules+bundlers came. Initially they were &lt;script&gt;, but when you had multiple you wanted to concatenate them for performance ofc, and in Node.js you wanted a way to import them. So a tool for each was created, then a tool on top of both was created, and thus a factory of factories of sorts was created.<p>- Then ES6+ came, which was similar to the first point so I won&#x27;t bother you with it.<p>- Then Webpack and all of its derivates promised to solve all of the problems above, at the same time (with Babel and whatnot), and the era of mega-factories came to be.<p>Luckily nowadays we have standardize mostly around ES6+, and using ESM for imports&#x2F;exports everywhere, so if you write plain JS and use ESM both in your code and in library code you don&#x27;t need any more factories. You can still use a tool to bundle all your code, or to use more advanced coding paradigms like React*, but that&#x27;s nowhere the peak of complexity we&#x27;ve lived.<p>That&#x27;s one of the reasons I dislike TS BTW, because now that we are in &quot;bliss plain JS&quot; some people were not happy and had to add complex tooling again with TS.<p>*I draw the line here and declare that JSX is not JS, and thus this complexity thing doesn&#x27;t apply there. If you are writing JSX you are writing it against CRA&#x2F;Vite&#x2F;Next, while plain JS you are writing it against the browser, so only things built on top of JSX, like TSX, can be considered factories from that point of view. If you think it&#x27;s not fair, I&#x27;ll argue it&#x27;s as fair as JS, since in the end every browser is a &quot;factory&quot; of JS -&gt; low-level code.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36640878" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36640878" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sublinear</span><span>|</span><a href="#36638450">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36639620">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36640089">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36640484">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36640878">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36640878">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Which is precisely why a framework is necessary, but knowing how to write what you want without the framework is even more necessary.<p>If you only know how to code within the constraints of the framework, you&#x27;re gonna fail for anything non-trivial.

It might make the average developer more productive on an average project. But most projects are not average, and neither are most developers. Everyone has some unique combination of strengths, just like every project has special cases that don’t fit within the box of a framework.<p>A framework is great if you don’t know much about the domain and just want to get something together quickly. But if you’re working on anything novel, then eventually you’ll bump against the walls of the framework. Hopefully you designed the project in such a way that you can break out of the framework for these inevitable special cases.<p>And I like frameworks! I’ve used a few in various languages and think they do a good job organizing the code for the basic cases. But every professional project I’ve worked on has eventually been trapped by piling workarounds on top of the framework to make it work for some unsupported or complex case, or an inevitable architecture fail which the framework has not considered an escape hatch for.<p>Just like developers and their tools. I have an IDE and nvim at work. The IDE has a lot of power for major refactoring and hinting features, and it’s reasonable enough for an untrained dev.<p>But it is very slow for the other 99.8% of my job where I’m not doing a big “find and rename all instances”. I am usually wading through a large project and jumping between files to try to understand a complex system. Once I understand it, I’m jumping between those files again to make my changes.

I <i>love</i> well-designed opinionated frameworks. Whenever I want to do something simple, I agree that a framework may be overkill. A micro-framework is nice for those scenarios though.
However, whenever I build a project that will be maintained or extended by many people, opinionated frameworks give me the advantage that they force you to do things in a particular way.<p>Django is a perfect example. If all I am doing is two or four pages that just return static HTML, then why would I pick that at all? A new django project creates a specific file structure: urls.py, models.py, settings.py, views.py, middleware.py, etc. If I get a new Django developer that is not familiar with the project, I can pretty much drop him in and he will not what is going on quickly. I don&#x27;t need to explain what a viewset is because chances are that the dev has used Djano Rest Framework before. Whatever changes are made, will follow the same patterns, so maintainability overhead is reduced.<p>When you add a project that is built from scratch without using a framework that has strong stances on how files should be organized, all bets are off. You have to spend a lot of time trying to wrap your head around the custom abstractions that have been built - and it is hard to argue that some of that will translate to a different job.<p>Yes, of course when you want to do something else that forces the opinionated framework to do things that it was not designed to do, it is a true pain - but you have to ask yourself if for that particular case it makes sense to use that framework at all (most likely not).<p>Frameworks also evolve. I use to curse constantly when I had to touch a Backbone JS project in the past, but now, I can jump and look at a React project that uses Redux and get to make changes right away without paying high cognitive cost. It may not be perfect, but it gives me structure and pre-defined patterns to worry about solving the actual problem I want to attack - and not waste time trying to create yet another leaky abstraction.

But you could also design it such that each mime type comes with a separate class, like a HTMLTreeBuilder, or something like that, which would be horrible and way too constrained.<p>Elaborate type systems can, in some cases, seduce this kind of overengineering.

These get stored away to be used “next time.”<p>&gt; Sooner or later the first system is finished, and the architect, with firm confidence and a demonstrated mastery of that class of systems, is ready to build a second system. This second is the most dangerous system a man ever designs. When he does his third and later ones, his prior experiences will confirm each other as to the general characteristics of such systems, and their differences will identify those parts of his experience that are particular and not generalizable. The general tendency is to over-design the second system, using all the ideas and frills that were cautiously sidetracked on the first one.

The entire game is to separate it from the accidental complexity. My career&#x2F;life was revolutionized by a paper that is 100% focused on this very topic:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;curtclifton.net&#x2F;papers&#x2F;MoseleyMarks06a.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;curtclifton.net&#x2F;papers&#x2F;MoseleyMarks06a.pdf</a><p>The solution to eliminating accidental complexity is ultimately presented as a flavor of relational model, which I simply read as &quot;please just use SQL for most things&quot;. This perspective has served me exceptionally well over the last ~4 years now.<p>A quote I like from Chapter 8:<p>&gt; The relational model [Cod70] has — despite its origins — nothing intrinsically to 
do with databases. Rather it is an elegant approach to structuring data, a means for manipulating such data, and a mechanism for maintaining integrity and consistency of state. These features are applicable to state and data in any context.<p>Chapter 9 offers an actual proposed solution - Functional Relational Programming.<p>At the end of the day, suffering in a cesspit of complexity is a choice. The relational model is <i>the answer</i> for untangling highly-complex (aka high-dimensional) problem domains, <i>especially</i> ones that require arbitrary downstream views of the data. The central piece of magic with the relational model (as applied to the real world) is the query planner. You should start thinking of this as an <i>actual</i> code-writing super AI that can answer optimization questions 1000x faster than your best developers. All you have to do is give it a tiny pile of hints to work with, and almost any arbitrary request will be satisfied in a nearly-ideal amount of time.</div><br/><div id="36640723" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36640723" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">john-tells-all</span><span>|</span><a href="#36638076">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36639925">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36638284">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36640723">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36640723">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For others: this is the classic Out of the Tar Pit paper, which I also adore so so much.

LWN is consistently a source of rabbit holes that I can&#x27;t help but descend into, and I both begrudge them and love them for that, but $9&#x2F;mo is just... a bit high.  It competes with too many &quot;I like it but don&#x27;t feel a strong need for it in my life&quot; things.  But I don&#x27;t blame them for choosing that level, processing fees are no joke.<p>This is not intended as a comment on LWN&#x27;s subscription setup or the article or anything actually relevant.  I&#x27;m just feeling a bit depressed at the state of funding-of-good-things.

Or perhaps better yet, to roll them into <i>taxes</i>, which would avoid some issues going through banks would cause, and offer a nice symmetry to how one-time purchases work.<p>To me, all those subscriptions have a management overhead that&#x27;s often greater than their sticker price. Here, $30&#x2F;month is actually <i>better</i> than $3&#x2F;month, because there&#x27;s only so many $30 things that will fit into my &quot;I like it but it&#x27;s not a strit necessity&quot; monthly budget. But that same budget will fit 10x as many $3&#x2F;month subscriptions, and the amount is small enough that it&#x27;s easy to ignore, and it&#x27;s easy to lose track of all such subscriptions (and then tracking them down and re-evaluating whether you need them feels like <i>more effort</i> per subscription than that $3 or $1 or whatever).<p>The bigger overhead, however, is <i>relationships</i>. Each subscription is a business relationship, and one I <i>do not want to have</i>. This is where the tax angle, and aforementioned symmetry with one-time purchases, would come into play: for regular one-time payments for goods and services, I <i>do not</i> need to establish ongoing relationships with the providers, because <i>government does it for me</i>. It rolls them all into a neat package by means of generic consumer protection laws, which allow me to not care or remember about any particular vendor if all is right, and if something goes wrong, <i>all I need</i> is to have a standard proof of purchase (receipt or invoice), and a set of standard keywords to put into an e-mail (&quot;warranty&quot;, &quot;non-compliant goods&quot;, &quot;GDPR&quot;, etc.), and things magically right themselves most of the time. Worst case, I need to also remember which form to fill to get courts involved.<p>That&#x27;s such a huge win, that most people don&#x27;t even see it. Whenever you go to buy your daily bread, or get a haircut, you do not need to stick to the same vendor, or sign a contract with them, or otherwise care about ongoing relationship. You can, if you want, but <i>you do not have to</i>, and that&#x27;s despite the vendor very much wanting you to. The relationship exists, but it&#x27;s managed for you, centrally, by your local regulator - making purchases O(1) with respect to number of vendors. Whether you shop at one place or a thousand, the overhead is the same.<p>I would like that to extend to recurring services too. There is absolutely no need for a random SaaS to force me into having a relationship with them. I would prefer to have a standardized process of billing and resolving disputes that lets avoid having to study everyone&#x27;s individual ToS, or dealing with vendors&#x27; dark pattern bullshit. I want to focus on making use of the service, not on who provides it. That&#x27;s the symmetry rolling subscriptions into tax system would provide.</div><br/><div id="37259485" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37259485" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">p_l</span><span>|</span><a href="#37258626">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37258866">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37259045">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37259485">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37259485">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There was, at one point, a very positive, non-ad related, Google project targeting microtransactions for supporting content on the net without having to create full business relationships etc. - Google Contributor.<p>Like many google things touching payments, it unfortunately started in such limited area that it couldn&#x27;t have any future other than cancellation for lack of interest, because most interested people couldn&#x27;t use it...</div><br/></div></div><div id="37259045" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37259045" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">FridgeSeal</span><span>|</span><a href="#37258626">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37258866">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37259485">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37259509">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37259045">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37259045">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Would be nice to be able to centrally manage subscriptions through your bank.<p>In Australia we’re getting a new system called “PayTo” which will be replacing all current direct debits.

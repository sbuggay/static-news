I started with a prototype 3D printed model last year: the creators are friends of mine, and I wrote the LED status display code for them.  I also dropped the prototype down a flight of concrete stairs (sorry!  It still works though).<p>I now have a production model with the white clicky keyswitches.  Ultra happy with it.  I&#x27;ve been using Kinesis Advantage2s for a shade over two decades - the same model DanielDK used for a long time.  The Glove80 is simply better.  I prefer the clicky keyswitches.  Ergonomics are great.  It&#x27;s really repairable - everything is held together with screws (spare parts for my Advantage2s are not available, and the function keys are not repairable).  Open firmware so you can make it do wacky stuff if the need arises.  Small and light enough for travel - I should get a proper case but it&#x27;s survived a fair few trips stuffed into my backpack.<p>Yeah, adaptation to new keyboard layouts is hard.  I used a layout that mimicked my old Advantage2 - so I&#x27;d paid the cost to learn columnar already.  I found the default Glove80 layout was better, but switching meant a month of confusing Ctrl and Shift.  All better now!</div><br/></div></div><div id="37377475" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37377475" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">henrik_w</span><span>|</span><a href="#37378178">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37377526">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37377475">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37377475">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had severe problems with RSI many years ago, to the point where I thought I had to give up programming alltogether. I also got an ergonomic keyboard, which helped, and an argonomic pen-like mouse. However, I would say that even more important in getting rid of my problems was the use of a break program. It reminds me to take regular breaks, and prompts me to to stretches throuhgout the day. The combination of these things meant that I recovered completely from my problems.<p>More info here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;henrikwarne.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;02&#x2F;18&#x2F;how-i-beat-rsi&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;henrikwarne.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;02&#x2F;18&#x2F;how-i-beat-rsi&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="37378149" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37378149" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">atoav</span><span>|</span><a href="#37377475">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37377599">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37378149">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37378149">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As someone who sits in front of computers way above the average and never had any issues with eyes or hands (while others my age had issues there) I think this is the key:<p>Try to get into the habit to stretch your wrists&#x2F;fingers when you are not using them and try to do the same thing with your eyes (eyes are muscles too), by e.g. focusing onto something far away, rolling your eyes, etc.<p>If you are of the type that gets lost in work some reminder can help, but I think it is better to form habits of using thinking breaks to do the stretching. Nobody types regularily for 3 hours straight without interrupting to think at least for a bit once every few minutes. If you use these breaks to stretch, you will be fine.<p>Ultimately a person with good habits will be able to work healthy with seemingly unergonomic setups, while a person with bad habits will be able to use even the most ergonomic setup in unhealthy ways.<p>Everybody knows that collegue who has that incredibly expensive ergonomic chair and sits on it like a bored prototypical teenager.

And every ergonomic chair can be misused. A person with good habits can sit healthy on a rock, a person with bad habits can sit unhealthy on a custom made ergonomic chair.<p>The same is true for the hands. As a life-long multi-instrumentalist with trained hands and fingers I could totally see someone with a laptop and the right habits ultimatly acting healthier as someone with the wrong habits and the best ergonomic keyboard that exists for them.<p>And this is the truth: Everything that involves the human motor system is never just about the objects we interact with, but always also to a major degree <i>how</i> we interact with them.

Why not hook it up then and power it through USB? There are handy split cables with which you can hook up both halves in one go. Some people even disconnect the batteries.<p><i>Maybe I am wrong but aren&#x27;t two movable parts a bit annoying as well?

Personally I just put my arms how I find them comfortable and then position the halves to align with that.

(Side note: Iâve spent the last three years critically thinking about, learning, and designing a few handfuls of keyboard layouts and keyboard layout analyzers&#x2F;generators. At the moment, the layouts which works best for me are MTGAP and Graphite, both of which work really well in both an ortholinear and rowstagger configuration. (I also used Dvorak for 15 years prior to switching). Though, the layout iceberg goes pretty deep, so if you donât like the layouts I mention, there are tons of other layouts to pick from).<p>The only reason I bring up `in` and ignore the rest of the keyboard is because `in` is right up there with `th` in terms of frequency. Worsening it has a significant and noticeable effect IMO. Though, I could also point to another reason which might make ortholinear not ideal for some people. Consider the left middle finger column on qwerty: EDC. E is simultaneously the most common letter, and also combines with basically every other letter (consider typing `decided`). Itâs very common for qwerty typists to use alternative fingerings to avoid the same finger sequences. Commonly youâll see index finger used for D and C. An ortholinear layout used with qwerty moves D and C further away from the index finger, making the alternate fingerings more difficult&#x2F;cramped&#x2F;impossible.<p>Tangentially, something I think works in the glove80âs favor however is the scooped design. While `in` is pushed further apart, I imagine that the curvature of the keyboard in utilizing the 3rd dimension helps reduce this distance somewhat.<p>EDIT: Hereâs a video demonstrating someone using an ortholinear keyboard with qwerty at an impressive 170+ wpm: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HHFK-GbECWA">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HHFK-GbECWA</a> Note, my comments above have to do with ergonomics.

ZMK can also be built in a github action which makes tweaking the layout easier. Would recommend.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

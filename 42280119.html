It&#x27;s not a bad idea, but at least for me software development is more about long term issues coming up, team communication, features that create short term value but long term problems. How to organize big piles of code.<p>A lot of abstractions don&#x27;t make any sense in a 2-3 days project and you are better of hacking away a script than looking into &quot;properly&quot; modelling things.<p>My impression is always that as a junior you learn how to do stuff. Then you learn to do complicated stuff. And becoming a senior you learn how not to do complicated stuff.<p>This takes some of the fun out of it as well. Deploying a feature that is simple and that just works without any issues does not create nearly as much excitement as &quot;saving the company&quot; with a big hack and high risk deployments, although it is much better to not have to &quot;save the company&quot; in the first place.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42287016" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42287016" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gherkinnn</span><span>|</span><a href="#42286908">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42285952">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42287016">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42287016">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Ultimately those tools have to model reality, and to do that, we need an interpretation of reality.<p>Conversely, reality slowly changes to be easier to model in software.

You&#x27;re in heaven.<p>Now imagine someone who loves classical music, but can&#x27;t play. You see the fortunes being made by piano players, so you decide to learn. Which takes years of doing tedious stuff like learning scales. Then you get a job playing hip-hop (a music style you abhore) for a band you don&#x27;t like... Then you discover the business crap of &quot;music business&quot;.<p>Programming is the same. If you love it, it&#x27;s fantastic. But to those in it for the salary it&#x27;s a mind-numbing hunt for tiny bugs, days spent searching for a missing comma, wading through the same old crud, doing the same task over and over, locked to a desk, dealing with sub-par teammates, inflexible management, projects that get canceled, crunch time, stupid users (and I can go on.)<p>The passionate thrive because the joy dwarfs the pain. (Also, because they tend to be -very- good so can largely ignore the bullshit. They&#x27;re paid well doing something they&#x27;d do for free.<p>As a -job- though, every part of it is objectively terrible. From the interview to the firing. (Go on, write a job description of what you do all day. Now consider that description in light of someone who doesn&#x27;t actually -like- programming...it&#x27;s terrible right?)<p>Naturally there&#x27;s good money in it. If it&#x27;s not your passion, then by all means, do it for the money. Find your joy elsewhere, that&#x27;s OK, but do find it.

They&#x27;re paid well doing something they&#x27;d do for free.<p>I&#x27;ve thought to myself many times that I still can&#x27;t believe someone is paying me to code, whether that&#x27;s an investor or an employer. I happily do it for free even when unemployed, or practically for free for years on end when working on early stage startups as a co-founder. I&#x27;ve often wondered what this must feel like for people who don&#x27;t actually like any of it, when for many of us it feels like play.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42286482" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42286482" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">syndicatedjelly</span><span>|</span><a href="#42286091">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42286482">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42286482">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As someone who does play music, although not professionally, I don&#x27;t really agree with the analogy that writing code is like playing music.<p><pre><code>    You don’t expect to learn how to play the piano by reading a book, but you might expect to pick up a programming language or concept because you read about it.

I&#x27;m aware of code katas, but I bet close to 0 of the great programmers regularly spend hours a day just writing loops in C, just to REALLY make it second nature. Yet many great musicians do just that, except with exercises. I&#x27;ve spent months or years straight practicing an extremely easy to understand, but hard to execute riff. The dexterity and muscle memory needed for certain musical patterns on an instrument like guitar or piano can take many, many hours to develop.<p>I just don&#x27;t know of anything even remotely similar to this in programming. Learning how to type fast is the closest analogy I can think of, but being good at typing is almost entirely unrelated to being a good programmer. It would be like a pianist not being able to play chords, yet still being considered a (technically) good pianist.<p>---<p>If one develops a good technical understanding of their programming language, and reads a lot of code, they could produce some quite good code in that language on their first try. In this case, it would help to have a very solid technical understanding of first principles as well. Asa result, I really think programmers with very strong discrete math skills, for example, can pick up any idea in programming.</div><br/><div id="42286691" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42286691" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aeim</span><span>|</span><a href="#42286482">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42287032">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42286691">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42286691">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">i hear you ;)<p>although i&#x27;d counter with the idea that it isn&#x27;t code-writing which we practice continually to master the art, but world modelling: we model the world within the constraints of code in our mind, to become experienced <i>enough</i> to do so reliably, then usefully within different contexts<p>code is the instrument, not the music</div><br/></div></div><div id="42287032" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42287032" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AlotOfReading</span><span>|</span><a href="#42286482">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42286691">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42286825">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42287032">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42287032">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The specific analogy with music isn&#x27;t great, but it makes more sense if you step back and say that a large part of software is aesthetic rather than technical concerns.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42286825" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42286825" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tonyedgecombe</span><span>|</span><a href="#42286482">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42287032">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42286825">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42286825">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you write a lot of C code then you will write a lot of loops.

My wife came into my study the other day and asked what I was doing so I started to explain it. After she ran away I counted up the number of concepts I needed to know to understand the twenty five lines of code I was looking at. There were nearly forty in that short piece of code.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

She came to the conclusion that ‘such practices were mere nonsense’ – but that did not stop her continuing to play them.<p>It would be interesting to know further how seriously these rituals were taken.<p>Most societies have some sort of magical thinking, but it seems to be that fervent belief in omen-like phenomenon decreases as the metaphysic of a given culture becomes more naturalistic and mechanistic. Magical thinking tends to emerge in situations of uncertainty and disorder, and even if there&#x27;s no honest conscious belief in a supernatural process, there&#x27;s often a vestige of comfort and romanticism in being able to influence a system with technically uncontrollable parameters. Bronisław Malinowski talks about this in his anthropological work on traditional Pacific Islander cultures:<p>&gt; They have, in fact, a whole system of principles of sailing, embodied in a complex and rich terminology, traditionally handed on and obeyed as rationally and consistently as is modern science by modern sailors. How could they sail otherwise under eminently dangerous conditions in their frail primitive craft? But even with all their systematic knowledge, methodically applied, they are still at the mercy of powerful and incalculable tides, sudden gales during the monsoon season and unknown reefs. And here comes in their magic, performed over the canoe during its construction, carried out at the beginning and in the course of expeditions and resorted to in moments of real danger. If the modern seaman, entrenched in science and reason, provided with all sorts of safety appliances, sailing on steel-built steamers, if even he has a singular tendency to superstition— which does not rob him of his knowledge or reason, nor make him altogether pre-logical—can we wonder that his savage colleague, under much more precarious conditions, holds fast to the safety and comfort of magic?</div><br/></div></div><div id="38678949" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38678949" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Jun8</span><span>|</span><a href="#38679413">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38677702">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38678949">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38678949">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;(It was customary for couples kissing under the mistletoe in the 19th century to remove a berry each time a kiss was had.

on a fire: ‘If a nut cracked and jumped away from her then the suitor with that name would not be true; the one that stayed and was burnt alongside the chestnut with her name would remain true and they would consequently marry.’<p>My guess is that games of chance involving potential mates have always been a popular activity when a bunch of young single women got together.

The photos are carefully curated to prominently display their most attractive attributes or eschew visual insecurities. Most men throw caution to the wind and swipe on everyone, while a few select women do their best to sift through the deluge of attention.

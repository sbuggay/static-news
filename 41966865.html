Smart isn&#x27;t the limiting factor of progress, often it&#x27;s building consensus, getting funding, waiting for results, waiting for parts to ship, waiting for the right opportunity to come along. We do _experiments_ faster than natural selection, but we still have to do them in the real world. Solving problems happens on the lab bench, not just in our heads.<p>Even if exponentially more intelligent machines get built, what&#x27;s to stop the next problem on the road to progress being exponentially harder?

I think the implication is that the primary advancements would come in the form of software. IMO it&#x27;s trivially true that we&#x27;re not taking full advantage of the hardware we have from a software PoV -- if we were, we wouldn&#x27;t need SWEs, right? From that it should follow that self-improving software is dangerously effective.<p><pre><code>  once this new computer is running, how much power does it require?

I mean, lots, sure. But we allocate immense resources to relatively trivial luxuries in this world; I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any reason to think we can&#x27;t spare some giant computers to rapidly advance our technology. In a capitalist society, it&#x27;s happily&#x2F;sadly pretty much guaranteed that people will figure out how to get the resources there if scientists tell them the RoI is infinity+1.<p><pre><code>  I&#x27;d be satisfied with a Large-Language-Model which

But if the answer is &quot;yes, we can&quot;, then there is little doubt that beings more intelligent can be constructed shortly thereafter.<p>I find it bizarre how often these points are repeated. They were both obviously wrong in 1993, and obviously wrong now.<p>1) A nitpick I&#x27;ve had since grad school: the answer to &quot;can we create a machine equivalent to a human mind [assuming arbitrary resources]?&quot; is &quot;yes, of course.&quot; The atoms in a human body can be described by a hideously ugly system of Schrödinger equations and a Turing machine can solve that to arbitrary numerical precision. Even Penrose&#x27;s loopy stuff about consciousness doesn&#x27;t change this. QED.<p>2) The more serious issue: I sincerely have no idea why people believe so strongly that a human-level AI can build a superhuman AI. It is bizarre that this claim is accepted with &quot;little doubt&quot; when there are very good reasons to doubt it: how on earth would such an AI even know it succeeded? How would it define the goal? This idea makes sense for improving Steven Tyler-level AI to Thelonious Monk-level; it makes no sense for a transition like chimp-&gt;human. Yet that is precisely the magnitude of transition envisioned with these singularity stories.<p>You might defend the first point by emphasizing &quot;can <i>we</i> create a human-level AI?&quot; i.e. not whether it&#x27;s theoretically possible, but humanly feasible. This just makes the second point even more incoherent! If humans are too stoopid to build a human-level AI, why would a human-level AI be...smarter than us?<p>I just don&#x27;t understand how anyone can rationally accept this stuff! It&#x27;s so dumb! Tech folks (and too many philosophers) are hopped up on science fiction: the reason these things are accepted with &quot;little doubt&quot; is that this is religious faith dressed up in the language of science.</div><br/><div id="41967981" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41967981" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">glhaynes</span><span>|</span><a href="#41967808">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41967887">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41967981">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41967981">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My dumb guy take on it: suppose we build a human-level AGI and it turns out to be limited by compute and memory.

Anyway, more substantively:<p>The simple answer is that people have thought about it in depth, most famously noted doomer Eliezer Yudkowsky in <i>Intelligence Explosion Microeconomics</i> (2013)[1] and its main citation, Irving John Good&#x27;s <i>Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine</i> (1965)[2]. Another common citation that drops a bit of rigour in the name of approachability is Nick Bostrom&#x27;s 2014 <i>Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies</i>[3].<p>[ETA: to put it even simpler: a system that improves itself is a (the?) quintessential setup for exponential growth. E.g. compound interest]<p>For the time-bound, the most rigorous treatment of your concern among those three is in Section 3 of Yudkowsky&#x27;s paper, &quot;From AI to Machine Superintelligence&quot;. To list the headings briefly:<p>- Increased computational resources<p>- Communication speed<p>- Increased serial depth (i.e. working memory capacity)<p>- Duplicability (i.e. reliability)<p>- Editability (i.e. we know how computers work)<p>- Goal coordination (this is really just communication speed, again)<p>- Improved rationality (i.e. fewer emotions&#x2F;accidental instincts getting in the way)<p>Let&#x27;s drop &quot;human&quot; and &quot;superhuman&quot; for a minute, and just talk about &quot;better computers&quot;. I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re a software engineer. Don&#x27;t you see how a <i>real</i> software dev replacement program could be an unimaginable gamechanger for software? Working 24&#x2F;7, enhancing itself, following TDD perfectly every time, and never ever submitting a PR that isn&#x27;t rigorously documented and reviewed?

The points about Intelligence Augmentation are particularly relevant for us now as current AI mostly complements human intelligence rather than surpass it... At least AFAIK?<p>Current AI is somewhat surprising though in the way that it can lead both to increased understanding or increased delusion depending on who uses it and how they use it.<p>When you ask an LLM a question, your use of language tells it what body of knowledge to tap into; this can lead you astray on certain topics where mass confusion&#x2F;delusion is widespread and incorporated into its training set. LLMs cannot seem to be able to synthesize conflicting information to resolve logical contradictions so an LLM will happily and confidently lecture you through conflicting ideas and then they will happily apologize for any contradictions which you point out in its explanations; the apology it gives is so clear and accurate that it gives the appearance that it actually understands logic... And yet, apparently, it could not see or resolve the logical contradiction internally before you drew attention to it. In an odd way though, I guess all humans are a little bit like this...

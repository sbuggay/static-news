He would go around to people&#x27;s farms with his 25 horsepower steam engine and win tug-of-war competitions against 100 horsepower combustion engines.  He&#x27;d then give lectures on why this was possible.<p>The crux of the matter is that horsepower is an instantaneous measure.  There&#x27;s a sweet spot just after the combustion where a 100 hp engine is indeed producing 100 hp, but it doesn&#x27;t last for very long.   Steam engines generate power more evenly (more area under the curve) so ones that are rated for less power may in fact be capable of more work.<p>There wasn&#x27;t much about him for an eight year old to appreciate, but every time I see an article on steam power I end up wishing he&#x27;d have lived longer so I could&#x27;ve known him as an adult.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38482368" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38482368" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">leetrout</span><span>|</span><a href="#38483073">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38483519">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38482368">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38482368">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Pasting a comment from yesterday. The linked video talks about how the double cylinder engine works and shows an up-close of the valves at around the 48 min mark.<p>If you enjoy videos, Proper People did a fantastic video about a 115 year old steam engine that still works that used to pump water for a city in Massachusetts.
Great watch full of info and some beautiful shots.

Assuming that the temperature is held constant (which apparently was stipulated in Woolf&#x27;s patent) this is true according to the ideal gas law.<p>It is not clear where Woolf&#x27;s model breaks down, but this part seems reasonable.<p>It is possible that the temperature was <i>not</i> held constant in his device, and, working off of the caloric theory of heat, assumed that the issue was leakage of either the original steam gas or of the caloric. In a sense, losing heat (caloric) would be to Woolf&#x27;s model the same thing as having a leak.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

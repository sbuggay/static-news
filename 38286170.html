They were one step away from being ousted from their own CMS by the likes of WPBakery, Visual Composer and Elementor. If your CMS becomes just a glorifed container for third-party solutions, it&#x27;s just a small jump from there to having your users move to a completely different backend built by the aforementioned authors.<p>I still don&#x27;t get why did they had to reach for such a needlessly complex solution. A few weeks ago I tried building a small project for a client by writing bespoke blocks  for custom logic and storing.<p>I found it was waaay easier and even waaay quicker to learn laravel to scratch than try to wrap my brain around the weird custom superstructure they built around React, their suggested approach on how you should write a version of each block for previewing, another for editing, some glue code between those that is not extremely clear how you should be interfacing, etc. Their developer guide is the equivalent of the &quot;Draw the fucking owl&quot; tutorial.<p>Even looking for exisiting examples, every one of the default wordpress blocks does things their own way, the whole thing felt over-engineered and extremely brittle.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38286871" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38286871" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">skilled</span><span>|</span><a href="#38287091">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38287106">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38286871">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38286871">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The problem is that WordPress lost the plot with its block editor, Gutenberg.<p>Automattic started to get more interested in money than they did in polishing their core product, WordPress. Instead of implementing a lot of these features into the core (which would then make room to actually make interesting plugins), they&#x27;re acquiring companies left and right and delivering a new WordPress release every few months promising &quot;100+ performance improvements&quot;, etc.<p>How come those &quot;performance improvements&quot; never actually do anything?<p>Not only that but WordPress ecosystem right now is extremely fractured because of this &quot;block editor&quot;. It alienates more than 20,000+ themes because they&#x27;re built on the &quot;old&quot; WordPress principles, and at the same time - nobody really wants to use block themes because it means starting from scratch.<p>I have played around with block themes as recently as a few months ago, and they&#x27;ve definitely gotten better than they were ~1 year ago, but they are only good if you know what you are doing. And, if you even have the patience and the will to make a custom site for yourself.<p>This is turning more into a rant of me than anything though, but maybe that&#x27;s precisely the point, that&#x27;s where WordPress is right now and the only thing I can see is that maybe Automattic is &quot;afraid&quot; to alienate plugin developers and cause a backlash.</div><br/><div id="38287142" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38287142" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tambourine_man</span><span>|</span><a href="#38286871">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38287025">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38287142">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38287142">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I understand why Automattic needed something like Gutenberg.

I mean, the hello world of a block downloads 50k files through npm, I shit you not. And you now have to deal with JSX and need a build step for the web, which is heartbreaking for me. We have PHP, which is superior as a templating language in every possible way, and it’s right there already.<p>Anyway, whenever I start a Wordpress project I’m faced with using the block editor or falling back to ACF.

Most sites have fairly &#x27;boring&#x27; needs, and hence the plugins they use solve &#x27;boring&#x27; problems. Like a contact form, improved SEO or security, etc.<p>If you did a similar survey for the most popular plugins for almost any other CMS, I&#x27;m sure the results would be similar. Mostly normal business site logic, the shop system of the day (unless the CMS is for a shop itself), and some minor fixes to things people find lacking in the default settings.<p>For other examples, one of the most popular vBulletin plugins&#x2F;mods back in the day was VB SEO, a paid SEO system that was basically the Yoast&#x2F;AIOSEOP of its day, and one of the most popular XenForo plugins right now simply adds a bunch of BB code options for other video hosting sites and services.<p>Heck, even real life kinda does this. If you polled people about the 20 most popular home appliances bought in the last 10 years, the majority would be &#x27;boring&#x27; things like a kettle, toaster, microwave, washing machine, fridge, etc.  Nothing wrong with that, just that for most people, the most &#x27;original&#x27; appliance equivalent would probably be a video game console, and the rest of their needs would be just the usual domestic house stuff.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38287115" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38287115" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hobofan</span><span>|</span><a href="#38287106">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38286884">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38287115">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38287115">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Those aren&#x27;t just the top plugins, they are also each accompanied by companies providing these plugins as paid products.<p>Yes, Automattic could provide a lot of those things out-of-the-box nowadays, and pay for the required development efforts, but that would probably kill the whole commercial plugin ecosystem around Wordpress pretty quickly. So this situation is kind of the extreme flip-side of what happens if you don&#x27;t step into competition with your ecosystem suppliers, which a lot of other companies are being criticized for. I think Automattic is overall doing it in a quite fair way - Akismet, WooCommerce and Jetpack from the list are plugins&#x2F;products maintained by Wordpress.<p>What I also wouldn&#x27;t underestimate is the cargo culting that&#x27;s happening in the WP plugin ecosystem. As the author noted, there are a few plugins (especially the one for &quot;securing&quot; the WP install) that are usually not needed, and don&#x27;t actually do anything useful on modern WP installs anymore.

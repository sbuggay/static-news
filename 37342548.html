Because if they were, they would ask &quot;does this service get my XY password if I enter it here?&quot; and unfortunately, trying to get this answer will lead them down a rabbit hole of auth flows, OAuth2 vs. OpenIDConnect and whatnot, because it&#x27;s only ever documented for implementers.<p>The normal user is to just believe in its trustworthiness, which may on a technical level be warranted or not, that&#x27;s not the point. If you keep logging in with XY to different services, you become conditioned to not question anymore whether it&#x27;s correct to enter your password right now, and where the login form, which always looks the same across different services, comes from.<p>But oh well, I don&#x27;t know what the solution should be here, maybe mandatory 2FA yet again, or passkeys.

I have filed IC3  FBI complaints for far worse and they don&#x27;t even so much as reply.

In the 80s and early 90s for example, big cities were a crime horror show because cops  couldn&#x27;t catchup enough and the reward, relative to potential reward of law abiding life was dismal compared to today (well, that and lead babies!).

Not every Asian or Latin person, or even most of them I know, use non-ASCII characters in their name, and very few businesses or applications require you to enter a full legal name that needs to be accurate the the language used to name you. I work at a company with a large amount of international employees and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve seen anyone with a non-ASCII character in their name, and I&#x27;m pretty sure Active Directory and Slack support Unicode. So while it would be a mistake to not have Unicode support, I am curious how much it would actually cause an issue.

Should I release this now, and try to capture the market, move fast and break things, adapting functionality as I go, with quality important but not <i>that</i> important?<p>Or should I spec out a complete and formal design, maybe formally verify it, implement to that spec and thoroughly validate it all afterwards? There&#x27;ll be no product for five years but that&#x27;s OK.<p>This latter category does exist, but isn&#x27;t especially visible because it&#x27;s not very sexy, it doesn&#x27;t have &#x27;hero&#x27; engineers, and there are few techbros getting rich off it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37348239" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37348239" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MattPalmer1086</span><span>|</span><a href="#37343686">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37344173">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37345960">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37348239">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37348239">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Right.

Einstein wanted to be a physicist, but no university was interested in hiring him. So he went to work at a patent office, while continuing to pursue his love of physics. And that patent office is precisely where he would end up writing some of his most influential papers on a number of topics, including special relativity. In fact his paper on special relativity, &quot;On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies&quot; offered exactly 0 academic references, but did cite his patent office coworker Michele Boso for assistance and suggestions.<p>So in modern times, are we creating a culture where people are going to be enamored by and intellectually curious about the past? Or one where people might have little interest in such or even regard it with disdain?<p>This solves the problem in two ways. The first is by creating people who will find a way to make things work, in spite of adversity. The other is by making your suggestion happen naturally. A person grows up with a love of history but, perhaps out of necessity, is unable to pursue it in earnest. However, they become successful in other fields, and then naturally choose to become a patron of their passion, for the next generation.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38010148" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38010148" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">madaxe_again</span><span>|</span><a href="#38007146">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38010015">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38008680">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38010148">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38010148">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Based on pay in archaeology and history, the knowledge evidently is <i>not</i> valuable in the slightest.<p>Despite the Indiana Jones fantasy, Archaeologists typically live in their cars or in tents, and historians in an unheated hovel.

  - whether a developers feel like they can push back on requirements,
  - whether deadlines &#x2F; expectations allow for sustainable pace of product development,

It just seems nearly impossible to say something evidence based about this topic.  Perhaps rewriting the entire Linux kernel along with all its drivers in Rust might be a nice approach.  If it were done in parallel, starting in 1991.<p>Also, applying results from studies in one domain to another is a red flag to me: if productivity drops for construction crews working extra hours, I fail to see how one can conclude that the same holds for software developers. Of course the conclusion is likely, but I don&#x27;t need a scientific paper for that.  The study was from 1980, mind you.<p>Too bad, because the premise is really interesting and thought provoking.

Those projects are reliable because Qt translation files are identified as TypeScript and it turns out that, per line of code, giant dumps of config files from another project don&#x27;t cause a lot of bugs. It&#x27;s like saying that a project has few bugs per line of code because it has a giant README. This is the most blatant classification error, but it&#x27;s far from the only one.<p>&gt; For example, of what they call the &quot;top three&quot; perl projects, one is showdown, a javascript project, and one is rails-dev-box, a shell script and a vagrant file used to launch a Rails dev environment. Without knowing anything about the latter project, one might expect it&#x27;s not a perl project from its name, rails-dev-box, which correctly indicates that it&#x27;s a rails related project.<p>There are other major problems with the study, but that one is sufficient to make the results invalid.</div><br/><div id="35734671" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35734671" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">_match</span><span>|</span><a href="#35734047">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35734480">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35738849">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35734671">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35734671">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are you the author of the meta analysis?

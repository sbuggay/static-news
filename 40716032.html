Umbra doesn&#x27;t provide realtime global coverage, any location is only visited once per week. The chances of a specific location being captured right as a rogue airliner is flying over it are basically zero.<p>I also wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it didn&#x27;t record any data over the open ocean. The vast majority of it is just waves, and nobody is ever going to pay for petabytes of empty images, so why bother? Same with capturing airlines <i>at all</i>: they are essentially always image artifacts, so I would expect them to be deliberately filtered out quite early in the pipeline.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the US military had the capacity to track airplanes from space. But tracking <i>every single commercial airliner</i>, on the extremely remote chance that one of them goes rogue over a remote ocean? Not a chance, it&#x27;d be extremely expensive and provide zero strategic benefit.</div><br/><div id="40736461" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40736461" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">robxorb</span><span>|</span><a href="#40735898">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736426">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736004">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40736461">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40736461">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This kind of makes sense, but to me, in a post-9&#x2F;11 world, the US military would definitely be scrambling whatever they have to track a rogue airliner that&#x27;s gone completely dark, yet is still verifiably flying (sat pings).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40736004" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40736004" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TMWNN</span><span>|</span><a href="#40735898">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736426">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736317">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40736004">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40736004">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; If 16cm through clouds and rain has been publicly available for three years, what does military have and for how long?<p>It is my understanding that phased-array antennas, of the type Starlink satellites carry, are also excellent for phased-array radar.<p>It&#x27;s known that Starshield covers both military use of the civilian Starlink network, as well as military-dedicated satellites for communications and other functions. I suspect that during wartime Starlink will be the world&#x27;s most comprehensive (and, thanks to its scale, most survivable) space-based radar system.</div><br/><div id="40736469" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40736469" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">WJW</span><span>|</span><a href="#40735898">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736004">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736273">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40736469">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40736469">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Phased array antennas are indeed usable antennas for radar purposes and many modern radars use them. That said just having a suitable antenna is not enough for having a radar system, you also need sophisticated equipment for both transmitting powerful enough pulses and receiving the (extremely weak) reflections. The power of the reflections drops with the fourth power of the distance to the target. From a quick look at the starlink satellites I very much doubt they could effectively function as a radar system. There&#x27;s just not enough solar panels to power a big radar on there.<p>Background: I used to be an weapons engineering officer working on future radar systems back in my Navy days.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40736273" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40736273" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RF_Savage</span><span>|</span><a href="#40735898">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736004">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736469">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736317">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40736273">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40736273">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">At least the civilian Starlink sats will not be able to do that.

The satellite operator will be taking paid orders to scan over specific areas of the earth, about 4km in width or so.<p>So you have to have a pretty good idea where the carrier is, and then you get an image delivered with some latency as the satellite will need to pass over a ground station that downlinks the data.<p>So it isn&#x27;t free (although umbra has a CC BY 4.0  license for their data, much more permissive than other providers. Nor is it easy to search huge amounts of the ocean for the carrier.<p>What most entities probably do is tip and cue, which is use a sensor with coarser resolution to get an approximate location and then use a sensor with finer resolution to look closer.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

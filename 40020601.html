Its best for you to be a pilot, or proof of concept, or pet project for a sponsor to show a concept they want the enterprise to do.<p>Pick your customers and product integrations carefully where the work will pay for the enterprise capabilities most likely to win your next sale.

In other words, this is about improving their deal flow. It also probably helps filter the flow, since now anyone seeking early stage funding from Sequoia will do the work to try to fit to this framework before wasting anyone’s time, and their pitch will also be easier for Sequoia to understand and evaluate.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

Social media easily turns completely normal human interactions into something perverse.<p>Eg, say you&#x27;ve just exited to the cinema and vent to your friend that this movie sucked. What were they thinking? Who had the brilliant idea to change directors mid trilogy? There&#x27;s a bit of venting, but quickly things settle down. There&#x27;s a bit of bonding over the shared experience. Nobody is hurt, you&#x27;re just having a private talk with your friend.<p>Take that to Twitter, use the same words, and now the same thing is an addition to the torrent of hate aimed at the movie&#x27;s director. You might have meant to reach your 10 followers, but search, recommendations, hashtags, retweets, etc can easily pull your statement out of its intended context.<p>Then there&#x27;s what it must be like to end up on the other side of that. This happens organically, people aren&#x27;t organizing around it for the most part. So the torrent of hate can regain its strength at random, wherever some person posts about it 3 years later, it makes #2 in some countdown on Youtube, comes up on the top of AskReddit, etc. In real life most things settle down, the Internet allows rehashing old stuff effectively forever.<p>And I think human interaction breaks at those scales. A single person can&#x27;t meaningfully interact with a million random people which mostly spontaneously decided to flood you with messages. You can ask a prominent one or two to leave you alone, but more can show up at any time.</div><br/><div id="37735568" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37735568" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">steveBK123</span><span>|</span><a href="#37735033">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37735199">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37735568">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37735568">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One issue with social media not scaling is that ~5% of the population is insane.<p>In day to day real life, you don&#x27;t notice 95% of the time, and when you do, you avoid that person in your life going forward.<p>Online, the 5% insane are over-represented, and a constant presence in any social media interaction beyond a few eyeballs.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37735199" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37735199" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jddj</span><span>|</span><a href="#37735033">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37735568">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37735621">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37735199">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37735199">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And to add another case, you step out of the cinema and make some rather tasteless remark about the lead actor.<p>Your relatively well-chosen circle of friends reacts to that negatively and you concede that you were probably being unfair.<p>The online equivalent of that is more like a splitting of universes.

I wouldn&#x27;t be so defeatist about technological solutions though. I can think of a few technologies that we already have which have allowed intimate, important and meaningful discussions to scale (imperfectly) in our past.<p>1. Parliamentary proceducers. This is a tool that allows debate to scale up to a few hundred&#x2F;thousand people. It provides rules for how topics can be chosen for discussion, altered, debated and how to reach consensus during a discussion. It&#x27;s a social technology that is not easy to apply, not obvious, but used by dozens of countries and I&#x27;ve no clue how many large organizations.<p>2. The judicial and academic systems. Again, not flawless, but these ones show that we can have asynchronous debates over long periods of time where people reference and use old cases and studies.<p>There may be other mechanisms which humans have used to structure conversation, facilitate debate and allow for important expression. All of these require training and only work when participants agree to certain rules. To my knowledge none of these apply to online media. But, who knows, maybe it will take a few hundred years for us to discover some social technology that does. The examples I bring were not obvious to society and took similar timescales to develop.</div><br/><div id="37734857" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37734857" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">high_5</span><span>|</span><a href="#37733876">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37734976">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37734857">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37734857">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Both 1 and 2 provide good layout for important and meaningful, but not intimate discussions.

In almost all cases, that group tends to be on the order of 5--9 or so individuals.  This would mean that, say, the US Cabinet (28 members) would have a much smaller core group, with the most powerful positions generally being considered as the Secretaries of State, Treasury, and Defence.  Along with the National Security Advisor and perhaps the Attorney General, this would give a core counsel of six members, including the President.<p>Parliaments virtually always operate in terms of both <i>committees</i> and <i>parties</i>, with each of these being further subdivided.  US House and Senate committees still tend to be large, roughly 25--50 members.  Taking the US Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for Defence (one of twelve Appropriations subcommittes), there are 17 members, divided amongst the majority (9) and minority (8) parties.  Taken by party, this gets us to my five-to-nine member core working group.  There&#x27;s typically further breakout by ad hoc working groups, and as I understand there are unelected staff (that is, subcommittee participants who are not themselves elected members of Congress) as well.<p>There&#x27;s little actual work which occurs in full sessions of a legislature.  Votes (based on Committee work), speeches (largely for public consumption, and often to an empty chamber), ceremonial proceedings (swearing in, State of the Union), and with exceptions such as impeachment proceedings or the largely-but-not-entirely-it-seems perfunctory functions of certifying national election results.  What parliamentary procedures <i>do</i> provide for is smooth function of <i>subdivisions</i> of full legislatures (e.g., committees and subcommittees), as well as rules for overall operation of the largely pro forma full-chamber sessions.<p><i>That said</i>, procedures <i>are</i> key in those functions.<p>The Judicial system is interesting in that courts often operate highly autonomous, with individual judges having extreme discretion over the operations of their courtrooms, and courts collectively of dockets.<p>A US trial court consists of a single judge.  If held before a jury, there are usually 12 jurors in civil and criminal cases (fewer in some state courts), though jurors don&#x27;t <i>actively</i> participate in the trial proceedings themselves, but rather observe the prosecution &#x2F; plaintiff and defence, as well as judge&#x27;s orders and rulings.  After completion of the trial phase, the jury members deliberate amongst themselves to reach a verdict.  Witnesses are fully independent (and are often excluded from hearing one anothers&#x27; testimony), legal teams are also typically small in all but the very largest cases.<p>Other countries have various different systems, often with civil or criminal cases being tried before a panel of judges (frequently three).  US appeals trials operate similarly, though in significant cases an <i>en banc</i> hearing with <i>all</i> the judges in the district hearing the case (six to twelve, I believe, depending on the circuit).  Appeals courts and Supreme courts, whether at the state, Federal Circuit, or Supreme Court levels are the only overview of individual court judges and judgements in the US.  Which is to say, again, that the structure is <i>highly independent and autonomous</i> and based on <i>small groups</i>.<p>Academia is another interesting situation, again with relatively high autonomy amongst <i>tenured</i> faculty, though that&#x27;s been decreasing.  Academia is divided into disciplines, universities, colleges, and departments.  Typical department sizes again tend to fall into the 15--50 full-time permanent members (there may be many more teaching assistants, lecturers, and other part-time or contingent positions).<p>You didn&#x27;t mention business organisation, though that would be another useful model.  I <i>believe</i> the terms are M-Type and D-Type for monolithic and divisional corporate structures, respectively, with the latter emerging at firms such as DuPont and General Motors (particularly under Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., at GM), or terms to that effect.  Again, the goal is to reduce dependencies between organisational divisions whilst also achieving efficiencies of scale.<p>(Charles Perrow devoted much of his academic life to studying organisations, and wrote survey text on the topic, <i>Complex Organizations</i>, which discusses much of the prior work in the field.)<p>All of which again generally show that <i>communications scales poorly</i>.  Where it <i>does</i> scale, it almost always does so by <i>hugely simplifying the content communicated</i>.  Markets, where prices substitute for a whole host of other qualities, would be an example of this.  (That prices communicate complex qualitative differences and nuances <i>poorly</i> is another well-known challenge.  Complexity will out.)  Information automation does expand processing capability, but that tends to end up in a Red Queen&#x27;s race, and often seems to consume free budget in additional processing, effectively a form of economic rent, rather than delivering improved profits, a&#x2F;k&#x2F;a the Solow Productivity Paradox.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37733444" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37733444" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bawolff</span><span>|</span><a href="#37733876">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37733283">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37733444">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37733444">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Talking about intimacy of discussions happening in a public forum is a weird contradiction of terms.<p>Like in real life - if you were giving a conference presentation you wouldn&#x27;t have any expectations of intimacy.<p>I don&#x27;t know why people would communicate in public spaces if they don&#x27;t want to interact with the public.

Oh, and admins of the originating and any recipient instances as well.<p>The problem is that the followers-only scope is set <i>for each toot within a thread</i>.  I&#x27;ll often face the question of responding to another person&#x27;s FO toot, and doing so myself FO, which means that <i>my</i> set of followers can see what I&#x27;m saying and potentially glean context, or as a DM.  I&#x27;ll often reply DM so that only the recipient sees my response, particularly if there&#x27;s any sensitive information involve.<p>On platforms which have a post-and-thread mechanism, such as here on HN, but moreso sites such as the late Google+, Diaspora*, and from my understanding, Facebook, <i>responses are already scoped by the top-level parent&#x27;s visibility</i>.  (On HN that&#x27;s pretty boring:  posts are either visible globally or not at all, it&#x27;s more interesting elsewhere.)  Microblogging systems such as Birdsite and the Fediverse ... don&#x27;t have that, so context collapse within FO threads is far more likely.<p>Google+ also had the notion of &quot;Circles&quot; ... clunky, but usable, which were defined by the <i>poster</i> and which could be the target audience of a given post, <i>and</i> (in time) Communities, which were shared groups, public or private, open-admission or moderator-approved, to which third parties could subscribe themselves.  (Similar to subreddits, generally.)  Both did provide ways of defining scope and context of discussions, with some reasonable bounds on privacy.<p>There&#x27;s also the challenge that multiple participants within such a thread may not be, and in all likelihood <i>are not</i> mutually visible to one another, so that the view of all participants but the thread parent author is likely to be partial, with fragments of the discussion open, and broken threadlets appearing and disappearing as followers and non-followers comment.<p>Then there&#x27;s the whole notion of setting <i>my</i> privacy scope by <i>who has chosen to follow me</i>, which is to say, an action I&#x27;ve virtually no control over.  The Fediverse has an additional setting which can somewhat manage this by requiring <i>specific authorisation</i> of follow requests, but that itself is clunky and cumbersome.  It seems to me to be far more sensible to <i>define a group</i> either by explicitly joining one, or by defining one myself, and setting the posting scope <i>to that group of my explicit choice or definition</i>.<p>The upshot for all of this remains largely the same:  using the Fediverse for highly-personal communications is probably a poor choice.  But, see my earlier reply on thread,[3] people&#x27;s sense of &quot;public&quot; vs. &quot;private&quot; online seems to be quite poorly tuned and not easily addressed by any means, technical or otherwise.<p>________________________________<p>Notes:<p>1. Excluding various block mechanisms which are ... complex in their own way.<p>2. The exclusion of hashtag visibility from Unlisted toots strikes me as among the more profound design&#x2F;architecture failures of Mastodon.  It&#x27;s quite often that I don&#x27;t necessarily want public-timeline exposure but <i>would</i> like hashtags used to be visible to those with a specific interest in them.  Recent changes (v. 10.4) with some really useful search improvements (as in, it exists at all, but also specific filters and criteria) make this much less painful.<p>3. &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37733680">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37733680</a>&gt;</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37733680" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37733680" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dredmorbius</span><span>|</span><a href="#37733444">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37733550">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37733848">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37733680">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37733680">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In real life it is <i>usually</i> fairly easy to determine when you&#x27;re addressing a single individual, a closely-held group, or a large gathering.  And large gatherings themselves are still generally constrained:  it&#x27;s difficult to directly address more than about 50 people without some sort of public-address system in use.<p>Online the level of exposure and amplification are difficult to judge.  Your direct environment may be entirely private --- alone in a room, with a screen and keyboard (of various descriptions).  Or you might well be out in public, but the <i>immediate</i> public and the public you&#x27;re reaching online are themselves almost completely independent of one another.  One of the more common complaints or statements I see is to the effect that other, uninvited people are barging into a private or limited discussion.  But at the same time, that discussion is occurring in a highly public space.<p>There are a few interpetations of that:<p>- It could be a &quot;simple matter of training&quot;, of educating people to understand that what is online is inherently public.  See xkcd&#x27;s 10,000 for the scale that&#x27;s involved, and multiply that by roughly a factor of 80 to reach global scale.  That&#x27;s a lot of painful confusion endured <i>every single day</i>.<p>- People holding this position could well be disingenuous, know full well that they&#x27;re monopolising a public discourse, and are seeking simply to exclude conflicting voices and viewpoints.  I&#x27;m told that such things happen....<p>- The principles might simply be wired too deeply into our psychology.  We have an inherent sense of rooms and spaces and friends and groups, and think that we&#x27;re having discussions amongst them even when the reality is that we are not, and much as optical illusions and legerdemain still work and fool us <i>even when we know the trick</i>, there&#x27;s no engineering around this.<p>I&#x27;m divided among all three of these viewpoints, though I put strong weight on the third.  And there may well be others I&#x27;m not considering.<p>But the point remains that attempting to have intimate discussions at scale really presents fundamental and insurmountable contradictions that can&#x27;t easily be resolved.<p>(Original author &#x2F; submitter.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="37733848" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37733848" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bb_avin</span><span>|</span><a href="#37733444">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37733680">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37733541">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37733848">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37733848">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I like this take.

There are any number of ways to determine who a person is, or even to narrow down the probable set of individuals, often with only the thinnest of data.  Given the prevalence of sensors, tracking, and physical-space monitoring (facial recognition, device tracking by WiFi and Bluetooth sensors, license plate readers, purchase and credit card data, and more), odds are pretty good that an online persona could be narrowed down to a few score of potential targets reasonably quickly by a motivated entity.  Doing that at scale might be more challenging, but seems to be at least roughly possible by some state-level actors.<p>And that level of surveillance many well not be necessary, only the <i>threat</i> of such actions.<p>For discussion, semantic analysis, time(s) of activity, correlation with other known factors (travel or commute patterns, power or communications outages correlating with non-active periods, and the like), there&#x27;s a lot of data to go on.<p>The biggest protections seem to me to be far less technical measures such as encryption, obfuscation, and pseudonymity, than they are strong privacy laws, civil rights, legal protections, rule of law, and civil institutions which are strong, robust, highly-trusted and trustworthy, effective, and dedicated to their mission.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that technical protections aren&#x27;t <i>necessary</i>; I absolutely believe that they are.  However they are not <i>sufficient</i>, and often prove to be highly brittle:  affording strong protection until at some point, whether due to a technical fault or lapse in tradecraft, they aren&#x27;t.

Admins might benefit from such tools, however.<p>But the larger problem remains that <i>people really can&#x27;t and don&#x27;t</i> grasp the distinction between truly-global-scale-public and <i>intimately private</i> within online discussion contexts, and they&#x27;ve kept on not grasping this for decades now.  You can go back to the 1960s with Joseph Weizenbaum and the ELIZA Effect as an example of how not only how much people will disclose personal and intimate details online, but with how <i>engaged</i> they get with such systems and the discussions.<p>Another possibility for AI is, of course, to provide an interactive discussion mechanism itself, much explored in fiction and film.  Any number of issues could arise there.<p>One issue I&#x27;d identified years ago is what I call the Pennyworth Problem.  Bruce Wayne has a private personal butler.  AI and centralised computing services could give us all Pennyworths (and we do already have Alexas, Siris, Cortanas, and, hey! Google!).  But where Pennyworth might hypothetically betray Wayne specifically, PennyworthAI could betray all of Gotham, all of the United States, and all of Earth, whether to the legitimate operators of the service, to a government demanding control over it, or to some third party identifying an opportunity and availing themselves of it.  And do so with disclosure rates and fidelity hugely greater than that of any human.

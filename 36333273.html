The EPR is a so-called “evolutionary” reactor, that is to say that its design is based on that of existing reactors, the French N4 type nuclear reactors and the German Konvoi . It thus benefits from proven technologies and operating feedback from its predecessors.
It is a powerful reactor with a production capacity of 1,600 megawatts (MWe) compared to 1,450 MWe for the latest reactors built in France (type N4). It is designed for a service life of 60 years .

It sort-of-works as an insurance scheme, but currently in the US it&#x27;s more like a payment scheme (and prices blow up), and in most of the EU is like a redistribution scheme (and amount of care is highly minimized until your condition is really serious).<p>- Housing in desired areas is heavily influenced administratively by zoning and other stifling norms (hello, SF), and also lack of land in desirable areas (hello, Manhattan). If you agree to live far from bustling megacities or posh suburbs, houses are relatively affordable. (But how are you going to earn the money then?)<p>- Privacy is not something you <i>want</i> to sell on the market; the whole point is to prevent it. So market forces can&#x27;t solve it directly. You can buy e.g. an iPhone that gives you more privacy, or use a paid search engine and, a paid email provider, a VPN, etc if you agree to pay more for preserving your privacy; here the markets work well.<p>- Climate change is again not about trading and competition, because its downsides were not priced into any goods, and mostly are not yet still.

There were a couple of teething issues (as expected given these were the first two EPRs to enter service), but they are now running great.<p>According to Yves Bréchet [1], former head of the French Atomic Energy Commission, the main difference is not regulation, government or public support. It&#x27;s something that should speak a lot to the engineers on HN, but is almost always absent in public debates: the lack of technical expertise. Think expert welders, pipe-fitters, boiler makers, etc. The expertise required when making a nuclear power plant is very high, including and especially when it comes to welding, quality of steel, etc.<p>Costly mistakes were made while welding critical parts of Flamanville 3 for instance, requiring expansive and expensive rework. I don&#x27;t think Hinkley Point C is faring much better. On the other side of the world China has been building nuclear power plants relentlessly: they have all the expertise needed. If you allow me a slight exaggeration, given France and UK massive de-industrialization over the last few decades, we are now amateurs compared to China.<p>Again, it&#x27;s not an issue of regulation. It&#x27;s just that when you don&#x27;t build things the know-how gets lost very very quickly.

Consequently, less Seismic Category I building volume is required to house the safety equipment (approximately 45 percent less than a typical reactor).

The use of heavy lift cranes enables an “open top” construction approach, which is effective in reducing construction time.<p>With new computer-modeling capabilities, Westinghouse is able to optimize and choreograph the construction plan of an AP1000 unit in advance by simulation.

Or maybe the coal industry simply was more successful at curbing regulation. After all, it was was a more mature industry financially and politically.<p>My theory might be speculative and totally off the mark. But when you compare deaths per TWh of energy produced, coal is responsible for almost 3 orders of magnitude more deaths than nuclear.

Some other countries will quote DC so there may be a discrepancy. You can find harmonized comparions in things like the IRENA generation costs report, the ITRPV or the frauenhofer photovoltaics report. The US is also almost all single axis tracking where other countries may have fixed tilt as dominant.<p>New fixed tilt utility solar in 2023 is about 50-60c&#x2F;Wdc or 80c&#x2F;Wac.

The (admitted) costs per watt of the chinese nuclear program have also increased substantially since 2008. Even with these, the claimed capex per MWh is comparable to solar in the west, but the O&amp;M would make it much more expensive.

It&#x27;s not a local problem specific to the US either. It happens everywhere.<p>A few of his observations were that renewable projects are among the best performing large scale energy projects currently and nuclear projects among the worst. The big differences between the two are:<p>- on site vs factory based manufacturing.<p>- complexity<p>Nuclear plants are built from scratch in the field. This has lots of risks, requires lots of ad hoc problem solving, and any emerging problems lead to costly delays. That also means that a lot of learning effects are lost because there are a lot of contractors involved that have to solve a lot of site specific issues and in between projects years&#x2F;decades can pass so the next project has to re-learn a lot of things. And as each site is slightly different there are also site specific risks and uncertainty. The learning effects are negative because each project inherits the mitigations from the previous projects and then has to add completely new solutions based on any new problems.<p>With renewables, most of the difficult stuff happens in a factory. That factory produces lots of cheap modular units that are than shipped and assembled on site. Each unit is relatively cheap. Assembly is relatively uncomplicated. With a wind tower for example, the components are large (tower, turbine, blades, foundation) but mostly pre-assembled. So, on site assembly is relatively straightforward and does not require a lot of problem solving. With solar it&#x27;s even better because the parts are more plentiful, smaller, and assembly does not require a lot of heavy equipment or site preparation. Doing this at scale means there is a large positive learning effect.<p>So, estimating a wind or solar project is possible with a high degree of accuracy. These projects can be scaled up or down as needed. With Nuclear it so far is the opposite.<p>As for modular nuclear reactors, which the article barely talks about, this is a promising but as of yet unproven way to produce reactors in factories. It&#x27;s promising because it duplicates some of the advantages of renewables. It&#x27;s unproven because we won&#x27;t know it works until lots of these have been assembled and deployed. Which is a thing that seems to be blocked on a lot of mundane things like regulations, approvals, investor enthusiasm, etc. And there&#x27;s also the notion that the nature of nuclear reactors is that so far bigger seems better in terms of efficiency and overall cost. Which goes against producing lots of small reactors that are two orders of magnitudes smaller than their traditional multi GW counterparts. Likely at least for the first few ones, cost and time budget estimates are probably not that accurate.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36336768" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36336768" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">photochemsyn</span><span>|</span><a href="#36337010">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36333591">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36336768">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36336768">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Engineering for Black Swan events is always going to be expensive.

Nuclear concrete typically has multiple closely-spaced reinforcing bars that can be difficult to arrange properly (the Royal Academy of Engineer’s 30-page Guide to Nuclear Concrete mentions “congestion” 13 times). Concrete placement issues have plagued every recent nuclear project and are frequently the source of delays and cost overruns. Examples abound: a 6 month delay from incorrectly placed rebar on Vogtle 3 and 4 in Georgia, a 4 month delay on the VC Summer plants for similar reasons, and a 9-month delay from poor concrete composition at the Olkiluoto 3 in Finland.<p>&gt; The difficulty of meeting requirements, combined with the lack of construction expertise due to long periods without constructing new plants, means that any new construction inevitably struggles as the builders learn how to meet the high level of stringency required. Delays at Vogtle Units 3 and 4 were partially due to a contractor unprepared for the difficulty of nuclear construction. Similar issues seem to be responsible for delays and cost overruns on Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland.<p>Some of the other QA&#x2F;QC issues are likely due to over-regulation, but you&#x27;re probably not going to find any person in a management position in overseeing these projects who would agree to reducing those regulations.  Nobody wants to be the person making the call to &quot;cut corners&quot; which then creates an accident, and there&#x27;s good money to be made in adhering to the regulations.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36334367" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36334367" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">User23</span><span>|</span><a href="#36333591">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36333774">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36334367">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36334367">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Because of how much time and money is spent on deciding the color of the bike shed of course![1]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;1448236.Parkinson_s_Law" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;1448236.Parkinson_s_Law</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36334230" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36334230" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">WalterBright</span><span>|</span><a href="#36333774">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36334434">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36334230">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36334230">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Lawsuits.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36334434" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36334434" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">credit_guy</span><span>|</span><a href="#36334230">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36334434">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36334434">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Those who oppose nuclear power fall in two camps: people who honestly believe there is something insurmountable about nuclear technology, and antihumanists, who think humanity as a whole is bad, and the planet would be much better if we were fewer, the fewer the better (see for example Club of Rome [1]).<p>In the past few years we&#x27;ve had so many discussions about nuclear here on Hacker News.

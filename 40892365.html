It was the accumulation of astronomical observations and the refinement of ever and ever exacter measurements that provided the basis for the transition in ther scientific community from the heliocentric to the geocentric system, that took between one and two hundred years, depending when on lets it start (Copernicus or a predecessor) and end (Galileo, Kepler or Newton).<p>If we look for example at the career of Kepler, we see that he had to accumulate expert knowledge of both systems and that he arrived at his later so-called laws not by a sudden insight, but through tireless work, trying again and again over several years to make sense out of series of measurements that did not really make sense in either the Ptolemaic or Copernican system.<p>It was not the epicycles that worried the late medieval astronomers, but the fact that according to their geocentric theory the earth was not really exactly in the center of the deferent. Correspondingly, however, the sun was not really at the center of the Copernican system either. Both systems lacked elegance, and both systems were more or less equaly in accordance with the observational data. To solve this debate and to make progress, the strategy of the most famous astronomer of his time, Tycho Brahe, was to collect better measurements. And it were these accumulated measurements that enabled his pupil Kepler to develop a solution. In a sort, he was lucky. Only the data for the planet Mars, which he considered first, was exact enough to match an ellipsis. His data for Jupiter or Saturn would not have allowed him to come up with one.<p>Accumulated knowledge was not an obstacle, but the basis for Keplers insights. That we might get a different impression is a result of simplifications that happen after a scientific community reaches a conclusion. At that stage such a theory becomes textbook knowledge: a student needs no longer acquire the accumulate knowledge of the previous period, but only the successful doctrine. These doctrines appear and are all too often presented as ingenious insights from geniuses, instead of cumulation points of a collective work of generations of scientists and scholars.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40896181" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40896181" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">contingencies</span><span>|</span><a href="#40894273">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40892430">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40896181">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40896181">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The cost of complexity is inherently wicked.

Like I grew up hearing stories about institutions being crazy effective compared to the ones I actually encountered. Sure, humans have always had folly, but the society we currently occupy is obsessed with often nonsensical metrics, rewards con artists disproportionately for gaming those metrics, and creates significant barriers for anyone trying to navigate the world through other means. There is no faculty in any academic institution untouched by the Reagan-era push to make colleges into degree factories, the administrative bloat caused by incursions of the demands of an increasingly muscular and obtuse finance sector (that also affects most other institutions), or the pervasive instinct to automate decisions based on dubious metrics, and most adults understand this at an intuitive level<p>We are in a period of widespread outright institutional collapse. Institutional decay should be the null hypothesis when considering the causal factors behind any widespread problem</div><br/><div id="40895335" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40895335" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gary_0</span><span>|</span><a href="#40892558">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40894295">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40895335">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40895335">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Institutional knowledge is even actively destroyed. There is only so much you can maintain with written procedure; rather, for all of human history, institutions have mainly relied on the <i>people</i> and <i>culture</i> that make them up. But the &quot;modern wisdom&quot; is that you avoid such reliance on people--the <i>employees</i>, the rank-and-file--at all costs. Executives must maintain absolute leverage against workers, so institutional knowledge has to be ignored as a factor. Every employee must be maximally expendable and easily replaced. You know that one senior team who knows how to reliably carry out some important function? Too bad, we&#x27;re firing them (or denying them raises, or replacing their manager with a toxic sycophant, same diff) and then we&#x27;ll just have to manage.<p>Even non-commercial organizations where a healthy culture might still form are affected due to carry-over from the much larger corporate sector.

This thesis is easily tested by zooming away from the US for a second (I know, very hard exercise). The burden of knowledge is visible everywhere even in countries that have drastically improved their governance. Lee Kuan Yew used to lament the increased levels of education at the expense of family formation, experts are getting older everywhere from India to China, to Indonesia and South Korea, making the same gains in computing performance is harder and harder regardless if you&#x27;re in Taiwan or Arizona. Capital required for economic growth, or drug discovery cost or any other reasonable proxy for the cost of new ideas also increases everywhere.<p>Institutional collapse is completely coincidental to the basic mechanism that is perfectly well laid out in the article. To build better knowledge you need to account for the old knowledge and then some, so pretty much by definition it&#x27;s an information theoretical necessity that better ideas get more expensive.<p>Try to imagine a world where the theory is actually true that there is no burden of knowledge and the reason is institutional collapse. Then you&#x27;d have countries where the life expectancy grew faster than when we invented soap and antibiotics. You&#x27;d have places that make advances in computing as we did in the 80s and 90s. You&#x27;d have places where VC&#x27;s invest less money every year but get more returns every year.

The University is unique in that on campus, being brilliant is socially acceptable. Furthermore the fabric of the academic world is so sturdy that it can absorb the most revolutionary ideas.<p>&gt; But it is not only a refuge for the restless minds, it is also a reservation for them. It does not only protect the restless minds, it also protects the rest of the world, where they would create havoc if they were let loose. To put in another way, the fence around campus is essential because it separates two worlds that otherwise would harm each other. The fence ensures that we have relatively little direct influence on the world &quot;out there&quot;, but we would be foolish to complain, for our freedom to be as radical as we like is based on the fact that, for at least the first 25 years, industry and the world-at-large ignore our work anyhow. Currently, there seems to be a world-wide tendency to try to lower the fence; the effort strikes me as ill-directed.<p>He had also been writing similar things in 1986 [1] and 1994 [2].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.utexas.edu&#x2F;~vl&#x2F;notes&#x2F;dijkstra.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.utexas.edu&#x2F;~vl&#x2F;notes&#x2F;dijkstra.html</a><p>[1]

Capitalists try to claim credit for all the progress in science and innovation that&#x27;s happened since the industrial revolution, but the institutions that evolved into what we now consider academia predate it significantly, and it&#x27;s important to note that they were not always viewed even by their benefactors as having immediate value in a direct economic sense. Most of their educational capability is a side effect of developing competency in training new researchers. People who fell off this track still often got a quality education and became better-rounded, and also people who could get to a university tended to be high-status, so for a while it was a decent-fidelity signal for the competence-status mix that hiring decisionmakers cared about.

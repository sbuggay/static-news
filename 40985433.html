I bought some cheap Chinese cameras in 2020 that by default send the video stream to a Chinese server, which you can watch with an app on your phone.  The cameras were about $40 on Amazon, so my guess is the manufacturer was getting paid maybe $15-20 for them.<p>Bandwidth to and from China is not that cheap, and you could be running this stream 24x7.  The streaming service still works 4 years later even though the company whose name is on the camera has vanished.<p>So, who is paying the server&#x2F;bandwidth bill?  The camera is too cheap to afford indefinitely providing this service, so you can only presume that you&#x27;re paying in another way.  Probably there is some third party in China that the camera manufacturer makes a deal with.

Get POE cameras.  Get a powered switch with sufficient power to power the cameras.  The cameras and the switch form their own subnet.  Get a PC with two Ethernet jacks (or an Ethernet and a WIFI).  Install NVR software, Blue Iris, iSpy, ZoneMinder, etc, on the PC to record and process the videos from the cameras.  These softwares are all good with RTSP and ONVIF, with easy camera detection via port scanning.  Connect the PC to the switch on one Ehternet jack and connect it to your general network with the other one (or WIFI).  The cameras are running in their little isolated subnet.  The NVR PC sits between the camera subnet and the general subnet. Access from outside reaches the NVR PC only, not the cameras.  You can even open the WAN firewall to reach the PC&#x27;s WIFI side to access the videos from Internet.  Some of these NVR software can stream videos to outside phone apps or web apps.</div><br/><div id="40990579" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40990579" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mv4</span><span>|</span><a href="#40987972">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40990131">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40988124">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40990579">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40990579">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This will absolutely work if you know what you&#x27;re doing.

I was responding to OP.  Your products look good.  Here&#x27;s a bit of my experience on using NVR if that helps in better product design.<p>Most NVR&#x27;s are PC + powered switch built into one. I found them to be running very hot most of the times since they need a fairly beefy power supply to power the cameras and the PC itself.  The WIFI only NVR&#x27;s are much better and the only power drawn is video processing on the PC.  Blink Module is a good example.<p>Another problem is the tight integration of hardware.  When I have more cameras than the PoE jacks on the NVR, it becomes obsolete.  When some hardware fails on the NVR, the whole thing fails.  My last integrated NVR developed a problem in the disk controller and the whole thing couldn&#x27;t be salvaged.<p>In the next round of setting the system up, I decided to de-couple all the pieces for better maintenance and upgradibility.  The sweet spot I found is: cameras + powered switch + PC + NVR software + external USB storage.  It has work great so far.  The old PC was underpowered and I swapped it out without impacting the other pieces.  I added more disks as needed with minimum fuss.  I replaced some of the cameras without much problem.<p>You&#x27;re right in that ordinary customers probably won&#x27;t do all those.  For a customer product, a NVR that works with WIFI cameras makes the easiest sales.  It has much lower hardware requirement thus keeping the cost down.  WIFI cameras are easier to set up and thus plentiful.  If it has an Ethernet jack, you can sell a separate powered switch to make it work with the PoE cameras.  Basically it&#x27;s a souped up Blink Module that works with other cameras, with storage, and can stream to apps and web.<p>I mean you can sell a whole package of the pieces, plus phone apps and cloud storage, to offer a complete solution.  Most of the pieces are off the shelf, but you can still offer a complete solution with some critical proprietary pieces like your NVR software.  Of course you can offer piece by piece as needed, as long as all the pieces can fit together.  There&#x27;re a lot of cross selling opportunities.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40988124" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40988124" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mv4</span><span>|</span><a href="#40987972">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40988050">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40990131">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40989589">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40988124">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40988124">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Mine are ONVIF-discoverable and will expose RTSP (H264 and H265) URLs and a snapshot URL.

For example, the Lorex MCNB2151 is a Hikvision DS-2CD2032. I think they had Hikvision and Dahua models prior to 2018; maybe it&#x27;s all Dahua now.<p>&gt; Lorex cameras aren&#x27;t banned for personal use in the US, but face restrictions for government agencies due to cybersecurity concerns.<p>Not entirely sure the first half of this is true. iirc not only are many banned for government use under the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, but also they&#x27;ve stopped issuing FCC approvals for many of these under the Secure Equipment Act of 2021.<p>It&#x27;d be easy to get around this ban, but I won&#x27;t. I believe Dahua and Hikvision are active participants in the Uyghur genocide. They&#x27;ve made custom software specifically to support this genocide (ethnic feature identification models) and have contracted to install their cameras themselves at &quot;re-education camps&quot;. See e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2021&#x2F;sep&#x2F;30&#x2F;uyghur-tribunal-testimony-surveillance-china" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2021&#x2F;sep&#x2F;30&#x2F;uyghur-tribuna...</a><p>I am still using some Hikvision and Dahua cameras I bought prior to learning about this. My network configuration does not allow them to contact the outside world. My NVR connects to them via RTSP. This is the only way to do it with cheap, untrustworthy closed-source IP cameras.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40990372" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40990372" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mv4</span><span>|</span><a href="#40989713">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40990008">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40990737">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40990372">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40990372">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">fyi the list of manufacturers banned by the FCC:

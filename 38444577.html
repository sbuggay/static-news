She lives in an old home and has a neverending list of projects, many of which she took up during the pandemic. She would often livestream her rehab at nights just to connect to people as she worked.<p>One night she was streaming the teardown  of a bathroom wall. There, in between the walls, was a clipboard with some notes. She slowly took the clipboard up and started reading. Of course we couldn’t see what she was reading, but she started to cry and sniffle.<p>The clipboard had a list of wiring and installations. Had been written in the 70s. But the front page was a note, she told as she started crying, that said that rehabbing is hard and sometimes lonely work. But to keep at it because one day it’s worth it!<p>That moment arrived at a particularly lonely part of the pandemic for her and those of us watching. Whoever wrote that note and left that documentation from 50 or so years ago of course had no idea how it would find the reader(s) but could there have been a more perfect, beautiful moment than the moment my friend found it in the wall?</div><br/><div id="38455364" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38455364" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kaycebasques</span><span>|</span><a href="#38455114">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38457006">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38455364">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38455364">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My uncle lives in an old house in Lodi.

I made short YouTube videos for everything like turning the water on&#x2F;off, hose bib and sprinkler shutoffs, device pairing, etc.  I put dozens of hours into documenting my home, and felt a sense of accomplishment that I was doing a “warm handoff” of the home.<p>The new owner sold the home after two years.  From the listing photos she had ripped out most of the smart home stuff and had crappily remodeled (painting river stone hearth, etc).  YouTube showed zero hits on it he videos I made.  I sincerely doubt that she even bothered to look at the binder I handed over.<p>I will never put that amount of effort into documenting a home again.

It is germane to this thread:<p>Back in the early 90s — on a recommendation from a realtor who was a close friend of my brother&#x27;s — I hired an inspector who was close to retirement. He worked with his wife who served as his assistant tasked with, in essence, taking dictation of her husband&#x27;s near constant commentary as he conducted an incredibly thorough inspection. Every outlet tested for proper ground, every nook and cranny looked at, wood moisture content, HVAC pitot readings, masonry, roof … just a super-duper detailed inspection that took about 6 hours to complete.<p>At the end of the inspection, he summed up by saying the house was good and that he had no qualms recommending the house.<p>Two days later, he stopped by with a three-ring binder that contained his inspection report. It first contained a summary that concisely covered the positive and few negative aspects of the house. Then there was a section about the history of the house: the year built, the name of the builder, changes in the neighborhood since it had been built, earthquakes it had gone through, flood events in the area, and so on. It also included the manufacturer names of things such as the windows, door hardware, etc.<p>The third section was lengthy, covering the precise state of the electrical, plumbing, structural, envelope, etc, and included all the notes his wife had taken during the course of the inspection. It included a sub-section with warnings about certain materials that likely contained asbestos and would need to be dealt with if we ever did remodeling.<p>Finally, the largest section was what he called a &quot;maintenance work order&quot; arranged as a schedule for the ongoing, recurring upkeep of the house but beginning with things he thought needed to be done immediately, replacement of the circuit breaker box, splash blocks under each outdoor faucet, tuck-pointing some of the chimney&#x27;s brickwork, etc. And then his estimates as to when he thought systems might need to be replaced, the water heater, furnace, roofing, etc. As I discovered when the water heater burst, his estimates were pretty much spot-on. Over time, I added notes as we upgraded things, added low-voltage wiring, and remodeled the basement.<p>Nine years later, when I sold the house, the buyer was elated to have this owner&#x27;s manual and I am fairly certain that the book was key to a very fast sale of the house which we did without a realtor.<p>As I look back on it now, I realize that inspection was perhaps the best $350 I have ever spent.<p>When we bought our next house, the inspection took about an hour and produced a few page report, most of it boilerplate.</div><br/><div id="38456620" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38456620" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bowmessage</span><span>|</span><a href="#38454290">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38456410">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38454864">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38456620">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38456620">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sounds like you found a good one.<p>Though I wonder why they didn’t recommend preventative maintenance on the water heater- if it was electric, why not replace the sacrificial anode?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38454864" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38454864" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">20after4</span><span>|</span><a href="#38454290">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38454612">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38456410">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38454979">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38454864">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38454864">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That sounds like $600 well spent.

We had bought it in 04, i was working at Microsoft at the time. We raised our son there. 
I even built a 8’x8’x8’ brick oven for baking pizza and bread (plans from Ovencrafters).
I rented an excavator for a week and dug around the entire house and put in 12’ deep footing drains, with clean-out pipes every 20’ down the 100’ to the road.  A new 2” pex water main. 1” pvc sprinkler lines buried 3’ deep.
I completely gutted and remodeled the basement.
I kept a 3” binder with everything in it. Every sprinkler line, footing drain, how my gravity fed recirc system worked, electrical wire, even the pictures of every stage of the six month long brick oven project, including how to move it if needed (10k lbs, but doable with a forklift)
When i sold the house, i flew back there just to hand it to the new owner, some nuevo amazon guy. I went through everything with him, and although he listened, there was no interest or appreciation in what i had handed him. Fine. Whatever.<p>I moved back to Seattle a few months ago, and my 17 yo son, who was literally born in that house (on a Murphy Bed i built, also included in the manual (the plans, not that my son was born on it, how weird do you think i am?) went and knocked on the door, and he asked if he could look around (outside). They apparently looked at him as if he was deranged, but said sure.<p>He reported back that they had razed the brick oven, the one thing i thought would out last me in my life. I hoped that one day, maybe some kids would be eating pizza from this oven 100 years from now and no one would know where the oven came from.<p>Yeah, I haven’t had a house since then, but i will do it again, document everything. I will just be pickier about who i sell it to.</div><br/><div id="38455430" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38455430" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Larrikin</span><span>|</span><a href="#38454418">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38454678">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38455430">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38455430">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;I will just be pickier about who i sell it to.<p>Honestly this kind of mindset is a huge problem in the US. You built the oven, you enjoyed the oven, and you decided to sell the house. Why do you feel the need to dictate what the owner does with the house after? If you wanted to keep the pizza oven as some kind of monument to yourself you could have kept the home.<p>This kind of mindset leads to stale neighborhoods, where some locals feel the need to dictate neighborhood look and feel. You end up with regulations that don&#x27;t allow new construction and can even dictate dumb things like paint color. All to preserve a memory of something that is only important to the people that got to enjoy it when it was new.<p>This is not say nothing should ever be preserved if there is actually something of historical importance that happened there, but it seems like there&#x27;s a mindset to preserve things that are trivial to the many and important to the few.

The house was sold when my grandmother died a few years back. And she died in that home, for most of my friends the houses were sold when the elder had to move to assisted living (or worse when the house was lost for lack of income).<p>Generational homes were a thing when people didn’t need to move around, but my own parents moved 4 times just in my lifetime.

The RV came with two thick manuals, one for the RV chassis, and one for all of the appliances that were factory installed. I am not the first owner of the RV. My brother, a meticulous military man kept the documentation for every appliance and gadget he installed in that RV.<p>And since I took ownership of it, and have I been ever grateful that he documented it, I have done the same too, for the WiFi, for the networking, for the tool shed, for sit-to-stand desks, for the oven, for the plubming, and so forth.<p>And I&#x27;ve applied the same rigorous principle to the house now as well for about the past three years. I kept documentation prior, but nothing so deep until the RV came along.<p>Two thick ring binders, one for the house &quot;chassis&quot; and one for the appliances in the house.<p>Instructions on how to reset the internet, instructions on how to &quot;reboot&quot; the water heater, instructions on how to change the AC filters, the model numbers required for the filters, and why there is no &quot;air return&quot; vents on the AC for the next owner, and also as a reminder to myself. Documentation on the maintenance of having the black water lines replaced after one of them collapsed, how to access the clean out hatch on the black water lines. Where wires in the walls are run too. The circuit breakers are each carefully labelled too. It gets written up in OneNote so it is searchable, and then it gets put in to the three-ring binder, with sections for each area, e.g. garage, master bedroom, kitchen, etc. And lots of paint codes for each individual wall.<p>It doesn&#x27;t take long if you do it step-by-step rather than try to boil the ocean all at once, and you will be grateful you did it for years to come.

I love this. I’m going to copy the hell out of this.<p>I’m a proud “organized person” and have documentation for family and relatives. I’ve got the “Inventory” for most major appliances and long-term items in the house. On my wife’s side, they are a massive Indian family with 20+ cousins across each generation living in large mansions spanning a tiny community. Most of the time, the wife or I would call from across the country to ask where “that was kept,” which services go where, and which cable (I labeled most of them) to look for when the Internet goes down. The in-laws would keep a list of what to set up, fix, and organize when I visit next.<p>I’m not in favor of using any software or tools for these. I want to stay with OpenFormats, plain-text, PDFs, etc, organized in files. Since the pandemic, I have been slowly documenting and collecting the medical records of my immediate family. This has helped a lot when the father-in-law had to go through an extensive heart-related treatment last year.<p>Thanks for doing this. This is a big inspiration, though a tad more micro and technical than I wanted. I suggest others who haven’t started something — stay simple and keep it to files — something that would have worked 20 years ago and will likely work in the next 50 years.

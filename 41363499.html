The best way to build two way doors is to push for industry adoption of a particular API. In theory the backend of these APIs matter little to me, the developer, so long as they are fast and consistent. Some examples that come to mind is that Apache Beam is a &quot;programming model&quot; for Data pipelines, Akka is a &quot;programming model&quot; for stateful distributed systems, OpenTelemetry for logging&#x2F;telemetry, and Kubernetes for orchestration.

It means vendors each get to make their own services &amp; backends &amp; tools, but it&#x27;s greviously limiting the effort as a whole, makes even an open spec like OTel a one-way door.<p>Ideally OTel would be more than observability, imo.

The system to observe computing should in turn also be the system to react &amp; respond to computing, should be begetting more computing elsewhere.

The one point I have issue with is that the dominance of object storage in today&#x27;s distributed systems is very much due to economics, not technology. There&#x27;s basically cheering every little step S3 takes towards a POSIX-like distributed file system like HDFS - &quot;consistent listing of files, yeah!&quot;. Last week it was preconditions for writing files. There&#x27;s still huge gymnastics needed in Iceberg&#x2F;Delta to work with S3 given the lack of atomic rename.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41365021" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41365021" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">willvarfar</span><span>|</span><a href="#41364792">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41364925">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41365021">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41365021">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Something I anticipate is smarter storage that can do some filtering on push down predicates.

The promise of spark, once. It would be a huge win, definitly. Hmmm.<p>But opens up also a threat vector. And you have competing users running their predicates. So one has to think also about queues and pipelining and so on.

With the concept of GraphQL Federation, it&#x27;s possible to &quot;extend&quot; Entities by defining their (primary) keys in a GraphQL Schema. If we&#x27;re combining this with Async APIs, e.g. NATS or Kafka, we can enable teams to build APIs around events, while still being able to distribute the implementation of how certain fields can be resolved.  The Federation Router then joins the Stream with additional data from synchronous services, a very powerful pattern I believe.

One example that comes to mind from one of my courses that I took in software engineering is research around mutation-based testing. That form of testing is where you generate random variants of your test by doing things like deleting a statement, adding a statement, changing a less than sign to a greater than sign, etc. Then you check to see that at least one of your tests fails for each variant. If it does not, you either add a test or mark that variant as being effectively the same program. I forget what the term is for it. At any rate, I think there is still research being done on this topic, for example how to effectively generate programs that do not generate as many functionally identical programs. Software testing in general is a big part of software engineering, and I think there is still a fair amount of research that could be done about it.<p>In my opinion, the intersection of cognitive psychology and software engineering is also ripe for a lot of research. I feel like we as software engineers have a lot of intuitions about how to be productive, but I would love to see various things that could indicate productivity measured in a controlled lab setting.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38577151" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38577151" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gmadsen</span><span>|</span><a href="#38574510">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38576061">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38576567">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38578796">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38577151">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38577151">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would assume something like this? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dspace.mit.edu&#x2F;handle&#x2F;1721.1&#x2F;79551" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dspace.mit.edu&#x2F;handle&#x2F;1721.1&#x2F;79551</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38578796" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38578796" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tdeck</span><span>|</span><a href="#38574510">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38576061">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38575638">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38578796">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38578796">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It seems to vary a lot from school to school.

There is never a time when it is a appropriate to write your own cryptography. OTOH, most large compiler and interpreter projects have handwritten parsers, and many of them have handwritten lexers too.<p>Writing a parser can be simple enough to fit into a take-home assignment, and hand-written parser code ends up looking pretty similar to an LL grammar anyway. Parsing is also the easiest part of writing compiler or language tooling, so if a handwritten parser is too high a bar for the team then the entire project might questionable.<p>I&#x27;m not saying never use a parser generator, but I would personally prefer to work on a project with a well tested hand-written parser than a project using a parser generator.

If we&#x27;re disciplined, we write more code to test the scenarios we can think of, which is an extremely arduous process, that even with the most thorough testing practices (e.g. SQLite) still can&#x27;t produce failproof software. This is partly because, while we can control our own software to a certain degree, we have no control over the inputs it receives and all of its combinations, nor over the environment it runs in, which is also built by other humans, and has its own set of bugs. The fact modern computing works at all is nothing short of remarkable.<p>But I&#x27;m optimistic about AI doing much better. Not the general pattern matching models we use today, though these are still helpful with chore tasks, as a reference tool, and will continue to improve in ways that help us write less bugs, with less effort. But eventually, AI will be able to evaluate all possible branches of execution, and arrive at the solution with the least probability of failing. Once it also controls the environment the software runs in and its inputs, it will be able to modify all of these variables to produce the desired outcome. There won&#x27;t be a large demand for human-written software once this happens. We might even ban software by humans from being used in critical environments, just like we&#x27;ll ban humans from driving cars on public roads. We&#x27;ll probably find the lower quality and bugs amusing and charming, so there will be some demand for this type of software, but it will be written by hobbyists and enjoyed by a niche audience.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38574078" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38574078" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sanderjd</span><span>|</span><a href="#38572596">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38572790">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38572831">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38573146">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38574078">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38574078">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Their stuff has bugs too.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38573146" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38573146" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Dalewyn</span><span>|</span><a href="#38572596">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38572790">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38577399">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38573146">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38573146">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A saying that I once heard and appreciate goes like this:<p>&quot;A programmer who releases buggy software and fixes them is better than a programmer who always releases perfect software in one shot, because the latter doesn&#x27;t know how to fix bugs.&quot;<p>Perhaps similar to the saying that a good driver will miss a turn, but a bad driver never misses one.</div><br/><div id="38574520" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38574520" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MaxBarraclough</span><span>|</span><a href="#38572596">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38573146">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38577399">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38574520">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38574520">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s backward.

So if you are learning how to do steep turns, for instance, the altitude standard is +- 100â. Youâre taught, âthatâs the minimum, you should be trying for 50ââ and then 20â, then the absolute best performance would be where you do your turn, the needle doesnât move, and as you roll out on a calm day you fly through your wake.  But the goal is âbetter, always better, what can I do better?â  And flying is not graded on the overall performance, if you donât do satisfactory everywhere you fail.  Culturally satisfactory, isnât, itâs the starting point.<p>That encourages a much more collaborative model I feel like. Iâve only worked one or two flying jobs that were not collaborative.  In the outside world it sometimes feels the opposite.  In flying, you truly want everyone to succeed and do well, and the company does.  Even the guys I hated that I flew with, I didnât want them to fail.  If they failed, I was partially responsible for that.<p>It wasnât always perfect, and I worked with some legendary assholes while I was flying, but truly, they supported me and I supported them, and if I screwed up (or they screwed up) the culture required that we found a way to minimize the future potential screwups.<p>Youâre actually trained on what quality means in a wide variety of contexts too, and flight operations quality assurance (FOQA) is a big part of many airlines.  In smaller bush operations where I worked, it is significantly more informal, but we truly had a âno faultâ culture in nearly all the places I worked.  Itâs not perfect, but thatâs the point, âok how can we make this better?â<p>If someone had an idea for how to do something better, there may have been friction, but that was rare if it actually was better, and as soon as you could show how adoption was fast even at the less standardized operations I worked at.<p>Not saying itâs all unicorns and rainbows, but I feel like quality, and decision making, and âdoing the right thingâ were an integral part of the culture of aviation.  âThe weather is too bad and I cannot do this safelyâ grounds the flight, you donât blast off into the shit (at reputable operators) to get the job done anymore (itâs not 1995), and it feels like this new industry is the opposite.<p>The entire concept of a âminimum viable productâ is somewhat illustrative of the problem.  It shouldnât be the âminimum viableâ it should be the âminimum quality product weâre willing to accept as a starting point.â  But that doesnât roll off the tongue in the same way.<p>We shouldnât be striving for anything thatâs the âminimum.â  The minimum is only the beginning.</div><br/><div id="38572875" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38572875" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">randomdata</span><span>|</span><a href="#38572232">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38572683">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38572541">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38572875">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38572875">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; But the goal is âbetter, always better, what can I do better?â</i><p>Is that not the case in software?

You can be struggling to get a team to improve and then you hire a somewhat normal individual with a very different background who makes a sizeable impact on quality and the culture of this in the team.

Like, is this still an area of active research or did it all go by the wayside back in the early 2000s when it showed up?  The fact that all the papers are showing up from Turkey makes me concerned it was a momentary fad and the reason it didn&#x27;t spread to other countries was because it doesn&#x27;t accomplish anything.  Although, I suppose it could be a best kept secret of Turkey.<p>Renamed programs are defined to have identical complexity, which is pretty intuitively untrue, so I&#x27;ve got my concerns.<p>EDIT ^ 4:  Doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to take data complexity into account.  So if you&#x27;re dividing by input, some inputs are going to cause division by zero, etc.  You might be able to jury rig it to handle the complexity of exceptions, but it looks like it can mostly handle static code.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really going to handle dynamically calling code that throws very well.  I also don&#x27;t think it handles complexity from mutable shared references.<p>Nice try, but unless there&#x27;s a bunch of compelling research that no actually this is useful, I&#x27;m not sure this is going to cut it.  And at the moment the only research I&#x27;m finding is more or less just defining functions that qualify as a cognitive measure under the Weyuker principles.  I&#x27;m not seeing anyone even pointing it at existing code to see if it matches intuition or experience.

But the code quality is high, there are no TODOs hanging around, no extra development focused logging, no duplication of code, no leaky abstractions.<p>That is a 100% fail in leadership&#x27;s eyes, unless you have a really good story on why z didn&#x27;t get shipped (and code quality is NOT that).<p>All those things I listed will have to be addressed at some point, and the longer they go without being addressed the harder they will be to address.

Well written and well understood code means itâs very obvious what you are doing.  Later, when the code has a bug or needs to be rewritten, then it will at least be clear what you were trying to do so that it can be fixed or extended in some way.<p>So then the question is how do we train people to have these skills?  In school, science experiments are a good way to teach logical reasoning and communication â here is what I thought would happen, here is what I did, here is what happened, and here is what it means.  Math teaches you how to reason abstractly and, again, prove your point with logic.  Itâs a slightly different beast in that itâs harder for a math experiment to go wrong.  Itâs also harder to come up with and overcome novel scenarios in the lab with math, so in all it complements science well.  And of course reading and writing English build your ability to express your thoughts with words and sentences.  Many other high school subjects combine these in various measures â history for example is data gathering, fuzzy logical deduction, and reasoning in written language.<p>The bottom line is that quality software starts by working with well educated people and conversely all the most abhorrent heaps of over coupled illegible nonsense Iâve seen has come from people who, to be blunt, just ainât that smart or well rounded, intellectually.<p>Itâs a principle I carry over to hiring: smart and well educated wins out over pure-smarts.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38575401" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38575401" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tanepiper</span><span>|</span><a href="#38579764">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38574590">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38575401">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38575401">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Maybe a spicy take (FWIW I&#x27;m also self-taught)<p>Software engineering quality isn&#x27;t something you teach, it&#x27;s something you learn.</div><br/><div id="38575533" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38575533" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">withinboredom</span><span>|</span><a href="#38575401">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38575815">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38575533">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38575533">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Usually, the hard way.<p>I&#x27;ve worked on so many poor-quality projects.

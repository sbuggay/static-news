I&#x27;ve done some experiments in this area with simulations and am currently designing some test circuitry to be fabbed via Tiny Tapeout.<p>Reversibility isn&#x27;t actually necessary for most of the energy savings. It saves you an extra maybe 20% beyond what adiabatic techniques can do on their own. Reason being, the energy of the information itself pales in comparison to the resistive losses which dominate the losses in adiabatic circuits, and it&#x27;s actually a (device-dependent) portion of these resistive losses which the reversible aspect helps to recover, not the energy of information itself.<p>I&#x27;m curious why Frank chose to go with a resonance-based power-clock, instead of a switched-capacitor design. In my experience the latter are nearly as efficient (losses are still dominated by resistive losses in the powered circuit itself), and are more flexible as they don&#x27;t need to be tuned to the resonance of the device. (Not to mention they don&#x27;t need an inductor.) My guess would be that, despite requiring an on-die inductor, the overall chip area required is much less than that of a switched-capacitor design. (You only need one circuit&#x27;s worth of capacitance, vs. 3 or more for a switched design, which quadruples your die size....)<p>I&#x27;m actually somewhat skeptical of the 4000x claim though.  Adiabatic circuits can typically only provide about a single order of magnitude power savings over traditional CMOS -- they still have resistive losses, they just follow a slightly different equation (f²RC²V², vs. fCV²). But RC and C are figures of merit for a given silicon process, and fRC (a dimensionless figure) is constrained by the operational principles of digital logic to the order of 0.1, which in turn constrains the power savings to that order of magnitude regardless of process. Where you can find excess savings though is simply by reducing operating frequency. Adiabatic circuits benefit more from this than traditional CMOS. Which is great if you&#x27;re building something like a GPU which can trade clock frequency for core count.</div><br/><div id="42702555" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42702555" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mikepfrank</span><span>|</span><a href="#42697368">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42698567">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42702555">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42702555">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hi, someone pointed me at your comment, so I thought I&#x27;d reply.<p>First, the circuit techniques that aren&#x27;t reversible aren&#x27;t truly, fully adiabatic either -- they&#x27;re only quasi-adiabatic. In fact, if you strictly follow the switching rules required for fully adiabatic operation, then (ignoring leakage) you <i>cannot</i> erase information -- none of the allowed operations achieve that.<p>Second, to say reversible operation &quot;only saves an extra 20%&quot; over quasi-adiabatic techniques is misleading. Suppose a given quasi-adiabatic technique saves 79% of the energy, and a fully adiabatic, reversible version saves you &quot;an extra 20%&quot; -- well, then now that&#x27;s 99%. But, if you&#x27;re dissipating 1% of the energy of a conventional circuit, and the quasi-adiabatic technique is dissipating 21%, that&#x27;s 21x more energy efficient! And so you can achieve 21x greater performance within a given power budget.<p>Next, to say &quot;resistive losses dominate the losses&quot; is also misleading. The resistive losses scale down arbitrarily as the transition time is increased. We can actually operate adiabatic circuits all the way down to the regime where resistive losses are about as low as the losses due to leakage. The max energy savings factor is on the order of the square root of the on&#x2F;off ratio of the devices.<p>Regarding &quot;adiabatic circuits can typically only provide an order of magnitude power savings&quot; -- this isn&#x27;t true for reversible CMOS! Also, &quot;power&quot; is not even the right number to look at -- you want to look at power per unit performance, or in other words energy per operation. Reducing operating frequency reduces the power of conventional CMOS, but does not directly reduce energy per operation or improve energy efficiency. (It can allow you to indirectly reduce it though, by using a lower switching voltage.)<p>You are correct that adiabatic circuits can benefit from frequency scaling more than traditional CMOS -- since lowering the frequency actually directly lowers energy dissipation per operation in adiabatic circuits. The specific 4000x number (which includes some benefits from scaling) comes from the analysis outlined in this talk -- see links below - but we have also confirmed energy savings of about this magnitude in detailed (Cadence&#x2F;Spectre) simulations of test circuits in various processes. Of course, in practice the energy savings is limited by the resonator Q value. And a switched-capacitor design (like a stepped voltage supply) would do much worse, due to the energy required to control the switches.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sandia.gov&#x2F;app&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;210&#x2F;2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;Comet23-slides_SAND.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sandia.gov&#x2F;app&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;210&#x2F;2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;Comet23...</a>

Yes, without reverse circuits you are limited to quasi-adiabatic operaton. But, at least in the architectures I&#x27;m familiar with (mainly PFAL), most of the losses are unarguably resistive. As I understand PFAL, it&#x27;s only when the operating voltage of a given gate drops below Vth that the (macro) information gets lost and reversibility provides benefit, which is only a fraction of the switching cycle. At least for PFAL the figure is somewhere in the 20% range IIRC. (I say &quot;macro&quot; because of course the true energy of information is much smaller than the amounts we&#x27;re talking about.)<p>The &quot;20%&quot; in my comment I meant in the multiplicative sense, not additive. I.e. going from 79% savings to 83.2%, not 99%. (I realize that wasn&#x27;t clear.)<p>What I find interesting is reversibility isn&#x27;t actually necessary for true adiabatic operation. All that matters is the information of where charge needs to be recovered from can be derived <i>somehow</i>. This could come from information available elsewhere in the circuit, not necessarily the subsequent computations reversed. (Thankfully, quantum non-duplication does not apply here!)<p>I agree that energy per operation is often more meaningful, BUT one must not lose sight of the lower bounds on clock speed imposed by a particular workload.<p>Ah thanks for the insight into the resonator&#x2F;switched-cap tradeoff. Yes, capacitative switching designs which are themselves adiabatic I know is a bit of a research topic. In my experience the losses aren&#x27;t comparable to the resistive losses of the adiabatic circuitry itself though.

In particular, 2LAL does a lot better than PFAL.<p>&gt; reversibility isn&#x27;t actually necessary<p>That isn&#x27;t true in the sense of &quot;reversible&quot; that I use. Look at the structure of the word -- reverse-able. <i>Able</i> to be reversed. It isn&#x27;t essential that the very same computation that computed some given data is actually applied in reverse, only that no information is obliviously discarded, implying that the computation always <i>could</i> be reversed. Unwanted information still needs to be decomputed, but in general, it&#x27;s quite possible to de-compute garbage data using a different process than the reverse of the process that computed it. In fact, this is frequently done in practice in typical pipelined reversible logic styles. But they still count as reversible even though the forwards and reverse computations aren&#x27;t identical.
So, I think we agree here and it&#x27;s just a question of terminology.<p>Lower bounds on clock speed are indeed important; generally this arises in the form of maximum latency constraints. Fortunately, many workloads today (such as AI) are limited more by bandwidth&#x2F;throughput than by latency.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to know if you can get energy savings factors on the order of 100x or 1000x with the capacitive switching techniques you&#x27;re looking at. So far, I haven&#x27;t seen that that&#x27;s possible. Of course, we have a long way to go to prove out those kinds of numbers in practice using resonant charge transfer as well.

I haven&#x27;t heard of it before.<p>No, even with a fully adiabatic switched-capacitance driver I don&#x27;t think those figures are possible. The maximum efficiency I believe is 1-1&#x2F;n, n being the number of steps (and requiring n-1 capacitors). But the capacitors themselves must each be an order of magnitude larger than the adiabatic circuit itself. So it&#x27;s a reasonable performance match for an adiabatic circuit running at &quot;max&quot; frequency, with e.g. 8 steps&#x2F;7 capacitors, but 100x power reduction necessary to match a &quot;slowed&quot; adiabatic circuit would require 99 capacitors... which quickly becomes infeasible!</div><br/><div id="42705420" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42705420" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mikepfrank</span><span>|</span><a href="#42697368">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42704337">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42698567">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42705420">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42705420">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah, 2LAL (and its successor S2LAL) uses a very strict switching discipline to achieve truly, fully adiabatic switching.

We really do find in our simulations that we can achieve 4 or more orders of magnitude of energy savings in our logic compared to conventional, given ideal waveforms and power-clock delivery.

So that&#x27;s I²R unavoidable power dissipation.<p>I must be sufficient to fill and then discharge the capacitor to&#x2F;from operating voltage (V) in the time of one cycle (1&#x2F;f). So I=2fCV. Substituting this gives 4f²RC²V².<p>Compare to traditional CMOS, wherein the gate capacitance C is charged through R from a voltage source V. It can be shown that this dissipates ½CV² of energy though the resistor in the process, and the capacitor is filled with an equal amount of energy. Discharging then dissipates this energy through the same resistor. Repeat this every cycle for a total power usage of fCV².<p>Divide these two figures and we find that adiabatic circuits use 4fRC times as much energy as traditional CMOS. However, f must be less than about 1&#x2F;(5RC) for a CMOS circuit to function at all (else the capacitors don&#x27;t charge sufficiently during a cycle) so this is always power savings in favor of adiabatics. And notably, decreasing f of an adiabatic circuit from the maximum permissible for CMOS on the same process increases the efficiency gain proportionally.<p>(N.B., I feel like I missed a factor of 2 somewhere as this analysis differs slightly from my memory.

The theory of reversible computing is based on invertible primitives
and composition rules that preserve invertibility. With these constraints, one can still
satisfactorily deal with both functional and structural aspects of computing processes;
at the same time, one attains a closer correspondence between the behavior of abstract
computing systems and the microscopic physical laws (which are presumed to be
strictly reversible) that underly any concrete implementation of such systems.
According to a physical interpretation, the central result of this paper is that it
is ideally possible to build sequential circuits with zero internal power dissipation.<p>A Scalable Reversible Computer in Silicon:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;2507539_A_Scalable_Reversible_Computer_in_Silicon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;2507539_A_Scalable_...</a><p>Reversible computing:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.eecs.utk.edu&#x2F;~bmaclenn&#x2F;Classes&#x2F;494-594-UC-F17&#x2F;handouts&#x2F;LNUC-II.C.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.eecs.utk.edu&#x2F;~bmaclenn&#x2F;Classes&#x2F;494-594-UC-F17&#x2F;ha...</a><p>&gt;In 1970s, Ed Fredkin, Tommaso Toffoli, and others at MIT formed the Information Mechanics group to the study the physics of information. As we will
see, Fredkin and Toffoli described computation with idealized, perfectly elastic balls reflecting o↵ barriers. The balls have minimum dissipation and are
propelled by (conserved) momentum. The model is unrealistic but illustrates
many ideas of reversible computing. Later we will look at it briefly (Sec. C.7).<p>&gt;They also suggested a more realistic implementation involving “charge packets bouncing around along inductive paths between capacitors.” Richard
Feynman (Caltech) had been interacting with Information Mechanics group,
and developed “a full quantum model of a serial reversible computer” (Feynman, 1986).<p>&gt;Charles Bennett (1973) (IBM) first showed how any computation could be
embedded in an equivalent reversible computation. Rather than discarding
information (and hence dissipating energy), it keeps it around so it can later
“decompute” it back to its initial state. This was a theoretical proof based on
Turing machines, and did not address the issue of physical implementation.

According to him, it is required, for the known laws of physics to be consistent, that intelligent life take over all matter in the universe and eventually force its collapse. During that collapse, the computational capacity of the universe diverges to infinity, and environments emulated with that computational capacity last for an infinite duration as the universe attains a cosmological singularity. This singularity is Tipler&#x27;s Omega Point.[7] With computational resources diverging to infinity, Tipler states that a society in the far future would be able to resurrect the dead by emulating alternative universes.[8] Tipler identifies the Omega Point with God, since, in his view, the Omega Point has all the properties of God claimed by most traditional religions.[8][9]<p>&gt;Tipler&#x27;s argument of the omega point being required by the laws of physics is a more recent development that arose after the publication of his 1994 book The Physics of Immortality. In that book (and in papers he had published up to that time), Tipler had offered the Omega Point cosmology as a hypothesis, while still claiming to confine the analysis to the known laws of physics.[10]<p>&gt;Tipler, along with co-author physicist John D. Barrow, defined the &quot;final anthropic principle&quot; (FAP) in their 1986 book The Anthropic Cosmological Principle as a generalization of the anthropic principle:<p>&gt;Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the Universe, and, once it comes into existence, will never die out.[11]<p>&gt;One paraphrasing of Tipler&#x27;s argument for FAP runs as follows: For the universe to physically exist, it must contain living observers. Our universe obviously exists. There must be an &quot;Omega Point&quot; that sustains life forever.[12]<p>&gt;Tipler purportedly used Dyson&#x27;s eternal intelligence hypothesis to back up his arguments.<p>Cellular Automata Machines: A New Environment for Modeling:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30735397">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30735397</a><p>&gt;It&#x27;s also very useful for understanding other massively distributed locally interacting parallel systems, epidemiology, economics, morphogenesis (reaction-diffusion systems, like how a fertilized egg divides and specializes into an organism), GPU programming and optimization, neural networks and machine learning, information and chaos theory, and physics itself.<p>&gt;I&#x27;ve discussed the book and the code I wrote based on it with Norm Margolus, one of the authors, and he mentioned that he really likes rules that are based on simulating physics, and also thinks reversible cellular automata rules are extremely important (and energy efficient in a big way, in how they relate to physics and thermodynamics).<p>&gt;The book has interesting sections about physical simulations like spin glasses (Ising Spin model of the magnetic state of atoms of solid matter), and reversible billiard ball simulations (like deterministic reversible &quot;smoke and mirrors&quot; with clouds of moving particles bouncing off of pinball bumpers and each other).<p>Spin Glass:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Spin_glass" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Spin_glass</a><p>&gt;In condensed matter physics, a spin glass is a magnetic state characterized by randomness, besides cooperative behavior in freezing of spins at a temperature called &#x27;freezing temperature&#x27; Tf.

In ferromagnetic solids, component atoms&#x27; magnetic spins all align in the same direction.

Instead of using electronic signals like a conventional computer, it relies on the motion of spherical billiard balls in a friction-free environment made of buffers against which the balls bounce perfectly. It was devised to investigate the relation between computation and reversible processes in physics.<p>Reversible Cellular Automata:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reversible_cellular_automaton" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reversible_cellular_automaton</a><p>&gt;A reversible cellular automaton is a cellular automaton in which every configuration has a unique predecessor. That is, it is a regular grid of cells, each containing a state drawn from a finite set of states, with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based on the states of their neighbors, such that the previous state of any cell before an update can be determined uniquely from the updated states of all the cells. The time-reversed dynamics of a reversible cellular automaton can always be described by another cellular automaton rule, possibly on a much larger neighborhood.<p>&gt;[...] Reversible cellular automata form a natural model of reversible computing, a technology that could lead to ultra-low-power computing devices. Quantum cellular automata, one way of performing computations using the principles of quantum mechanics, are often required to be reversible. Additionally, many problems in physical modeling, such as the motion of particles in an ideal gas or the Ising model of alignment of magnetic charges, are naturally reversible and can be simulated by reversible cellular automata.<p>Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata: John von Neumann&#x27;s Quantum Mechanical Universal Constructors:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22738268">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22738268</a><p>[...] Third, the probabilistic quantum mechanical kind, which could mutate and model evolutionary processes, and rip holes in the space-time continuum, which he unfortunately (or fortunately, the the sake of humanity) didn&#x27;t have time to fully explore before his tragic death.<p>&gt;p. 99 of &quot;Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata&quot;:<p>&gt;Von Neumann had been interested in the applications of probability theory throughout his career; his work on the foundations of quantum mechanics and his theory of games are examples. When he became interested in automata, it was natural for him to apply probability theory here also. The Third Lecture of Part I of the present work is devoted to this subject. His &quot;Probabilistic Logics and the Synthesis of Reliable Organisms from Unreliable Components&quot; is the first work on probabilistic automata, that is, automata in which the transitions between states are probabilistic rather than deterministic. Whenever he discussed self-reproduction, he mentioned mutations, which are random changes of elements (cf. p. 86 above and Sec. 1.7.4.2 below). In Section 1.1.2.1 above and Section 1.8 below he posed the problems of modeling evolutionary processes in the framework of automata theory, of quantizing natural selection, and of explaining how highly efficient, complex, powerful automata can evolve from inefficient, simple, weak automata. A complete solution to these problems would give us a probabilistic model of self-reproduction and evolution. [9]<p>[9] For some related work, see J. H.

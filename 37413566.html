I used to work security and they&#x27;d all line up along the wall and mingle, while waiting to get their medicine. Then they&#x27;d take their meds around 4:30 to 5 PM, go have a seat at the table, and eat. Some were assisted.<p>For the ones who liked to wander, they&#x27;d go back to their rooms afterwards, and then not more than 30 minutes later, they&#x27;d be lined up again, and have to be told that they just ate and to go back to their rooms.<p>But breaking it down... food is life, it is what we do when we are around family or friends. It does bring back some memories of earlier times, when certain smells arise.<p>My grandfather, who had dementia... towards the end of his life, he remembered two very specific meals, which were always his favorite: meatloaf and mashed potatoes and veal parmesan. Fortunately for him, his very last meal was the meatloaf, although pureed, but he smiled as I fed him. He then closed his eyes and never opened them again, dying three days later.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37442713" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37442713" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DoreenMichele</span><span>|</span><a href="#37443434">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37443231">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37442713">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37442713">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Toddlers put everything in their mouth because their tongue is their most developed sense at that point.

For me texture works to some extent in a similar fashion. I can remember the feeling of textures of different items that I haven&#x27;t touched since I was a child and the act of trying to make myself remember the feeling of touching them, brings memory back in a different that is more &quot;vivid&quot; than just thinking about their shape (color).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37443231" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37443231" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TedDoesntTalk</span><span>|</span><a href="#37442713">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37443231">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37443231">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;OpWs4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;OpWs4</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

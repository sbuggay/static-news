fear but use intellectuals. They need actual smart people to gain
power, but then who is more threatening than people who know how the
system works because they built it for you? So they are always
betrayed. Consider Oppenheimer. Many of the great scientists and
artists are put out to pasture once they&#x27;ve done what&#x27;s useful for the
party.<p>&gt; &quot;alienates the best thinkers&quot; seems like a good litmus test.<p>Almost the whole Frankfurt School were Jewish intellectuals who fled
to America.<p>I&#x27;ve written (probably in Digital Vegan) on how the Silicon Valley
Billionaires, once they&#x27;ve built their &quot;Social Media Digital Utopia&quot; -
a pageant of vanity, fear and cybernetic governance - would simply
dispose of the coders (perhaps not as directly as Stalin). Maybe an
indicator of that came early with the layoffs when some got a bit too
moist about &quot;AI&quot;. I think they hope that &quot;AI&quot; will be the <i>way</i> to
pull up the ladder, leaving no challenging class.</div><br/><div id="39967611" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39967611" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nonrandomstring</span><span>|</span><a href="#39964235">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39964953">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39965039">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39967611">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39967611">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Some wannabe treacherous tyrants didn&#x27;t like that being said out loud.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39965039" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39965039" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zztop44</span><span>|</span><a href="#39964235">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39964953">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39967611">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39965368">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39965039">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39965039">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you for this reminder to buy Digital Vegan.

Here&#x27;s why: the US had already had a feasible bomb design, the Uranium-235 based bomb, that was dropped at Hiroshima. Not only that, but it had an alternative to the Plutonium bomb too, the U-233 bomb. Glenn Seaborg, the guy who discovered Plutonium and a bunch of other elements, was tasked with doing a feasibility study of a bomb with U-233. He found out it can be done, and sure enough, a few years after the war the US build such a bomb and tested it. It was not done because the Plutonium bomb became possible (with von Neumann&#x27;s help). But again, if von Neumann had decided to spend his time on other problems, then the US could have focused on the U-233 bomb instead.<p>This leaves us at the end of the war, when the Soviets decided to steal the secret and build their own bomb. Stalin decided they&#x27;ll build an exact replica of the Nagasaki bomb, which they did and tested in 1949. If only U-233 and U-235 were on the table, they would have picked one of those, rather than explored an uncertain design.<p>From uranium bombs to boosted uranium bombs there&#x27;s a small step. So the world would have seen much bigger bombs than the ones dropped on Japan. Fission bombs were built and tested that got close to one megaton.<p>But the hydrogen bomb is fundamentally an implosion bomb. The hydrogen bomb was a side-effect of the deeper understanding of the implosion design. In particular, the US figured out that if you can do implosion with conventional explosives, you can do it even better with nuclear explosives, so it designed and tested a two stage fission bomb, the Castle Nectar bomb. It&#x27;s the only non-thermonuclear bomb ever detonated that had a yield above 1 MT (it was 1.8 MT).<p>The research into this two-stage bomb is what Ulam was doing, and he told Teller that maybe what works for a second stage that is a fission bomb could work for a second stage that&#x27;s a fusion bomb. Teller added his own insights, and eventually it was done.</div><br/><div id="39966206" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39966206" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dilyevsky</span><span>|</span><a href="#39963361">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39963762">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39966206">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39966206">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Implosion design would have been worked out eventually with JN or not.

To me, the biggest example would be evolution - Darwin was famous for it, but you will find others speculating about it before him, and famously he sat on his work and only published it once Alfred Russel Wallace was about to independently publish his discovery of the same phenomena<p>&quot;Connections&quot; by James Burke is a wonderful documentary that first helped me to really understand this.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39965390" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39965390" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">credit_guy</span><span>|</span><a href="#39963361">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39965084">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39965287">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39964555">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39965390">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39965390">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Slow down a bit.<p>First: it took many years for the Ulam-Teller design to be discovered. Teller came up with the idea of a fusion bomb in 1942. The actual Ulam-Teller design was invented in March 1951, basically 9 years later. In this 9 years, for at least 2 years, people were searching frantically for a workable design. It&#x27;s very easy to say, after the fact, that &quot;X-Rays thermal transport would have been discovered as well&quot; because we know this is what worked in the end. But before the fact, nobody was looking for X-Ray implosion.<p>Second: During WW2, plutonium was considered superior to uranium because it was cheaper to manufacture. U-235 was being manufactured via a very expensive separation process. But U-233 can be bred in a thorium reactor just like Plutonium is bred in a uranium reactor. They both come with their challenges (U-232 for U-233, Pu-240 for Pu-239), but in a scenario where the Manhattan project did not figure the implosion design in a hurry, the US would have shifted the resources to U-233. Here&#x27;s a quote from wikipedia [1]<p><pre><code>  &gt; A declassified 1966 memo from the US nuclear program stated that uranium-233 has been shown to be highly satisfactory as a weapons material, though it was only superior to plutonium in rare circumstances. It was claimed that if the existing weapons were based on uranium-233 instead of plutonium-239, Livermore would not be interested in switching to plutonium. 
</code></pre>
Now, I have no doubts that fission boosting would have been discovered. But with fission boosting, bombs would have gotten to the 1 MT yield, and that is plenty destructive for all war scenarios.<p>Crucially, such a weapon did not need to use any type of implosion.<p>In a scenario where the US does not develop the implosion knowledge because it can build a 1 MT weapon without, then it is not at all a given that someone else would have looked for an implosion-based design of a thermonuclear weapon. We would still have had the layer-cake design, but that is not a game changer, and it&#x27;s not clear that the extra yield was worth the extra complexity.<p>Now, in today&#x27;s world: Most of US&#x27;s nukes have yields around 100 kT [2]. They are thermonuclear but the same effect can be achieved with (boosted) fission bombs. The largest current US nuke, the B83, has a yield of 1.2 MT, but the US is looking to retire it, and replace it with B61, with a maximum yield of 400 kT.<p>My point is that a superpower can service all its deterrence needs with nuclear weapons with yields that are achievable with boosted fission.<p>Why did we then go and build thermonuclear monster bombs in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s? Because at the time the ICBM precision was limited, and you needed something with a mile-sized fireball to make up for the lack of precision. But the ICBM technology advanced at an incredible pace. If we had been 10 years late coming with the design for a thermonuclear bomb, it would not have been needed at all.<p>Yet another thing is this: the destructive power of a nuke does not grow linearly with its yield. Ten bombs with a 100 kT yield are more destructive than on single bomb with a 1 MT yield. Oppenheimer knew that, and advised the US to focus on more rather than bigger. He was not listened to, and the US build both more and bigger. But we do know that you can devastate the world with 100 kT bombs, just as much as you can devastate it with 1 MT bombs.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Uranium-233#Weapon_material" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Uranium-233#Weapon_material</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;W76" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;W76</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39964555" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39964555" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RcouF1uZ4gsC</span><span>|</span><a href="#39963361">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39963816">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39964555">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39964555">[18 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">von Neumann was the genius&#x27;s genius.<p>Even the people a at Los Alamos had a suspicion that von Neumann operated on a different level from themselves.<p>From wikipedia:<p>Nobel Laureate Hans Bethe said &quot;I have sometimes wondered whether a brain like von Neumann&#x27;s does not indicate a species superior to that of man&quot;.[29] Edward Teller observed &quot;von Neumann would carry on a conversation with my 3-year-old son, and the two of them would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us.&quot;</div><br/><div id="39965802" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39965802" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Jach</span><span>|</span><a href="#39964555">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39965071">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39965802">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39965802">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Relayed by Nick Metropolis: Fermi and von Neumann overlapped.

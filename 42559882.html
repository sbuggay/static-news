Often orgs can&#x27;t deal with the very real uncertainty in these efforts and waste lots of project time on high effort, low value tasks like producing gantt charts that are so beyond the planning horizon that they can only result in bad outcomes at best.<p>The point being is that unless you are on the frontier of knowledge and technical capabilities, it is almost <i>never</i> the tech that causes these efforts to fail.</div><br/><div id="42561356" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42561356" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">harrall</span><span>|</span><a href="#42560382">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42560968">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42561748">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42561356">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42561356">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When I read OP’s list of wants for an API, I don’t read it so literally.<p>I read it as an example of the complexity required to implement something like an API.<p>I agree that it’s also a people problem but I disagree that many of these failed initiatives aren’t due to bad tech as well.

They are a facade hiding 100s behind a legacy interface.<p>Vendor mitigation important and often neglected and also results in people producing balls of mud.<p>But there are a lot of distributed monoliths pretending to be micro services out there.  And we had decades of people producing fragile enterprise service buses that were built because people wanted to future proof their systems.<p>The sizing of components and balancing integration and disintegration drivers is incredibly hard, you will never get it right.<p>You have to leave options open, no matter if that is through abstractions or keeping biz logic centralized to assist in a easy rewrite of context boundaries that arise from scale or changing needs.<p>Obviously choices have benefits and costs, but for most needs you can keep options open, if not it is probably best to reevaluate the reason for choosing a solution.<p>Obviously there are predatory vendors like Oracle that base their entire income on captive customers, but that relates to the vendor mitigation above.<p>I think the US federal government de-risking guide is a good overview of that topic.

They solved the problem and no one cursed them out. I think the most important factor is they were both <i>small</i>.<p>They were very similar. I even reused the code. One was writing rules to validate giant forms, the other was writing rules to for decisions based on form responses.<p>Ok, just ranting on DSLs. Good DSLs take someone from can&#x27;t to can. A DSL that&#x27;s meant to save time is way less likely to be useful because it&#x27;s very likely to not save you time.<p>In both of my DSLs, it&#x27;s that we needed to get complex domain behavior into the program. So you either need to teach a programmer the domain, partner a programmer with a domain expert, or teach a domain expert how to program.<p>Putting the power in the hands of the domain expert is attractive when there&#x27;s a lot of work to be done. It frees up programmers to do other things and tightens the feedback loop. If it&#x27;s a deep domain, it&#x27;s not like you want to send your programmer to school to learn how to do this. If it&#x27;s shallow, you can probably have someone cheaper do it.<p>A DSL comes with a lot of cognitive overhead. If the other option is learning a full programming language, this becomes more reasonable.<p>A time saving DSL is where someone already knows how to write code, they just want to write less of it. This is generally not as good because the savings are marginal. Then when some programmer wants to change something, they have to learn&#x2F;remember this whole DSL instead of more straightforward code.<p>Actually, this makes a simpler rule of thumb.

Sometimes people think of writing DSLs for tests because they have to write a bunch, but it&#x27;s really easy for this to suck. I have a test turn red and now I have to learn a DSL to deal with it? Ew.<p>The second is fuzzier. It&#x27;s putting a DSL over something complex and hoping this will fix things. Writing SQL queries for this system takes a bunch of time and is error prone? Just put a DSL over it!

Every single DSL I’ve seen REDUCES the cognitive load, by allowing to express the concept in the mere language of the problem at hand, for which the SME should be more than familiar with.<p>About the second point: I see many critics in this thread based on DSls above SQL. Whatever somebody is doing above SQL and selling as a DSL, it is not. Period. I cannot think in any possible way of doing a DSL above a query language. No doubt people hate the idea.

This will usually lead to code that is more verbose and repetitive, but understanding the first example will be faster.<p>I think of cognitive load like a line. X is the number of cases you’re working with, Y is cognitive load [0]. For someone who already knows a programming language, the DSL is going to have a higher Y intercept since you have to learn something new before you understand the first case. Hopefully, it’s a shallower slope so as you deal with more cases the upfront cost gets paid back. If you have lots of people dealing with one case or doing it infrequently enough they have to relearn each time, this payoff never happens.<p>This model extends past DSLs to all abstractions. It’s why people often end up happier with test code that’s less abstract&#x2F;DRY. The access pattern supports it.<p>Looking at it this way also explains why a DSL for a non-programmer is more likely to be useful.

I should know, I spent years working on a Java-based ORM. So believe me when I say: ORMs are terrible. To use SQL effectively, you have to understand how databases work at the physical level -- what&#x27;s a B-tree lookup, what&#x27;s a scan, how these combine, etc. etc. You can often rely on the optimizer to do a good job, but must also be able to figure out the physical picture when the optimizer (or DBA) got things wrong. You&#x27;re using an ORM? To lift a phrase from another don&#x27;t-do-this context: congratulations, you now  have two problems. You now have to get the ORM to generate the SQL to do what really needs to be done.<p>And then there are the generalizations of point made above: There are lots of tools that work with SQL.

A DSL does not need a new syntax, is a collection of abstractions that allow to express problems in the language of the domain problem. It is not an API, because is not an interface for a functionality. Is not about exposing functionality, but to add semantic value to the upper layers. May (not necessarily, but may) be formed by a collection of functions, in that case similar to an API, in that sense. Sometimes may include indeed extensions to a language, but in that case by the standard means of abstraction preferred in that language: clases, templates, functions, structures. The key is to reduce the cognitive load for the end programmers, who could be expert in the problem at hand, but not in the underlying language of the embedding.<p>There is also the possibility of embedding in a non programming language, like XML (E.g. launch language in ROS), or S-exp in the Oracle listener config file.

Worst-case outcomes might be like &quot;the performance isn&#x27;t as good as we want&quot; or &quot;this code is difficult to work with.&quot; Software components are very flexible compared to anything physical, even in the worst cases.<p>&gt;We are still stuck in &quot;throw it away and do it over&quot; and constantly reinventing wheels because there is no way to make wheels fit. The nature of digital means there are no tolerances. The concept isn&#x27;t even valid. Things fit 100% or 0%.<p>I don&#x27;t know how one can look at the amazing array of libraries out there and conclude that we have no reuse. Sometimes people build their own solutions because they need something very simple and the libraries are too big to be worth importing and learning in those circumstances. That&#x27;s not a flaw in the libraries. It&#x27;s human nature.<p>&gt;We keep inventing languages. They don&#x27;t help. We keep inventing frameworks. They don&#x27;t help. We keep trying &quot;design patterns&quot; and &quot;methodologies.&quot; They don&#x27;t help. If anything all the stuff we invent makes the problem worse. Now we have an ecosystem with 20 different languages, 50 different runtimes, and 30 variants of 5 OSes. Complexity goes up, costs go up, reusability never happens, etc.<p>All of this is too pessimistic. These tools do help. Exactly how many languages do you think we should have? Do you think exactly one group is going to develop for each use case and satisfy everyone?<p>&gt;WASM has its uses but I can&#x27;t escape the idea that it&#x27;s like &quot;let&#x27;s build a VM and carry all the shortcomings of C into it.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not a web guy but this sounds silly.

It also makes the cost of onboarding new developers, changing the development team insurmountable. Your organization will be speaking 2 different languages.

It is very easy to get into a situation where the system is overconstrained and it&#x27;s impossible to make forward progress without relaxing some of the constraints.

For initial alerting, I want phase shift detection. One customer sending a few bad API calls on one specific minute is uninteresting and pretty much inactionable. That same error rate over 10 minutes is more interesting and more likely to be a systems problem I can actually resolve. But the raw AD stream is just too damn noisy for all sorts of reasons. This is why our alerting tools have a `duration` field: any signal above threshold must remain so for multiple observation periods before summoning human inspection. And why health checks have grace periods and retries before killing services.<p>Where anomaly detection works better, IMO, is post-alert analysis. At that point anomalies are welcomed as hypotheses, since the system features complex interactions between components. I&#x27;ve built a couple of dashboards using extremely simple math, like Laplace smoothing and time series correlation that help surface relevant information from the flood of metrics and logs collected. But critically, these tools generally don&#x27;t use the time domain as their baseline.

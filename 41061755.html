Does anyone know why he might prefer the latter? As context, I play D&amp;D weekly, love it, and am always interested in learning more. Dungeon World is designed to focus on creativity and shared storytelling with simpler mechanics to make the game more fluid. However, there&#x27;s nothing simpler than having a clear D&amp;D rule for something like fall damage, instead of having the party debate if a player survived the fall. Dungeon World doesn&#x27;t have fall damage calculator and instead relies in the narrative, presumably from the pre-written story or DM.</div><br/><div id="41062834" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41062834" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ipsi</span><span>|</span><a href="#41062635">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41063228">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41062834">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41062834">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Most people who prefer DW would say that D&amp;D <i>sometimes</i> has clear rules for something, but often has no rules, boring rules, or rules that aren&#x27;t necessarily &quot;fun&quot;. Combat, while tactical, tends to be slow and can frequently consume a lot of time in a session, plus the majority of rules and character powers are focused on combat.<p>If you&#x27;re playing sessions with a lot of RP, DW will have a much better balance of rules:session-time, it&#x27;s much easier to prep for, and given how rules-lite D&amp;D really is outside combat, will probably have about the same amount of narrative input. Note that it&#x27;s not necessarily the &quot;group debating if the player survived&quot;, but typically the GM giving the player a choice when they fail to climb the wall, like &quot;you fall and take a little damage, or you slip a little, cursing loudly and alerting the enemies at the top to you&quot;.<p>Done well, it gives the players a lot more agency, and much better buy-in for the story as they&#x27;re now shaping it, instead of just being along for the ride. I would also say that pre-written narratives aren&#x27;t really a thing for DW (at least, as far as I know!), so it&#x27;s really down to what the DM sees as an appropriate penalty or choice, often phrased as &quot;you succeed, <i>but</i> &lt;thing&gt;&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not really better or worse than D&amp;D overall, I&#x27;d just say that it&#x27;s <i>much</i> better suited for certain play-styles. If you enjoy tactical gameplay and using miniatures, then D&amp;D (or maybe Pathfinder) are much better options. If the thought of <i>yet another fight</i> makes you want to gouge your eyes out, I&#x27;d recommend giving DW a try.</div><br/><div id="41063476" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41063476" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sdenton4</span><span>|</span><a href="#41062635">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41062834">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41063228">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41063476">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41063476">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The player choices and handling of partial success in PBtA games (like dungeon world) really makes them sing.

I don&#x27;t know much about DW in particular, other than it&#x27;s an early PBTA hack and not generally considered one of the better examples of the system anymore, but it still has a lot of fans.<p>However, these games share a lot in common, usually including a focus on Moves. The GM determines if something is a Move or not. If it&#x27;s a move the player gets to roll for it, and if it&#x27;s not a Move, it just happens. Moves tend to cover very broad areas of actions and are lot less specific and nitpicky than D&amp;D rules.<p>Unlike D&amp;D, the GM <i>also</i> has Moves. These moves are usually tailored to the particular PBTA game and generally include various ways to keep pressure on the players in a way that fits the theme and setting and mood of the particular game. It codifies the GM&#x27;s job in a way that makes it more approachable for many. D&amp;D is among the most difficult systems to GM and it leads to a shortage of people wanting to GM vs those wanting to play. Experienced DMs over many years learn to be a little looser and how to wing things and improvise and make the jobs easier for themselves. PBTA games are designed to teach the GM how to do this from the start, partly by teaching the players that this is expected and correct.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41063763" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41063763" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">da_chicken</span><span>|</span><a href="#41062635">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41063228">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41063416">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41063763">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41063763">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Dungeon World is a Powered by the Apocalypse game.

This makes sense for a game about simulating small-squad combat (which is what D&amp;D started life as), but it&#x27;s not really what you want for a game about narrative and roleplay. It means combat tends to take up a disproportionate amount of playtime in D&amp;D (because you have all these mechanical rules, and the multiple-round system), when the combat actually isn&#x27;t such a big part of the narrative or the fun; I&#x27;ve found that most successful&#x2F;fun D&amp;D groups tend to skip the fiddlier rules (e.g. how many people actually bother with full encumbrance calculations?) and even handwave away entire combats (&quot;you kill the goblins, don&#x27;t bother rolling&quot;).<p>Think about how you handle conflicts in non-combat parts of the game. If you&#x27;re trying to persuade the King to overrule the evil chancellor or whatever, how do you do that? You certainly don&#x27;t have n rounds of following precise calculations and looking up tables about each step of persuasion. Generally you either have narrative steps towards your goal (you break into the chancellor&#x27;s vaults to collect the papers that prove he&#x27;s been embezzling, you bribe a reporter to frame him in a compromising position, ...), and&#x2F;or the GM decides whether your ideas were clever enough to succeed, or maybe the GM assigns a difficulty (modified by the previous two points) and then you do one roll.<p>In my experience even people who like D&amp;D tend to enjoy sessions where they&#x27;re doing stuff like that more than doing a series of combats (except for the occasional powergamer type who really does just want to kill as many orcs as possible for 90 minutes - but if you&#x27;re after &quot;creativity and shared storytelling&quot; then you&#x27;re presumably not that kind of gamer); often when people look back on a campaign their favourite session was one with no (or very few) combats but one where interesting character moments or story developments happened. (And conversely, more than once I&#x27;ve had a fun session where we were all doing some great roleplay, riffing off each other, and then we hit a big combat and everything just ground to a halt as we had to dig out dice and tables and stop the story for half an hour while we did a bunch of mechanics)<p>So what if you handled combat the way you handle other conflicts? The GM takes narrative reasons why one side should win or lose, gives the players points for creativity if they come up with a good idea, then comes up with a difficulty and you make one roll. Or maybe you do several rounds of that, but based on the narrative flow of the combat, not just crunching numbers. In my experience that makes for a much more fun, interesting game.<p>(I actually enjoy, like, Mordenheim or Kill Team, which is the kind of game that D&amp;D originally was. But that&#x27;s as a competitive game first and roleplaying second. Detailed mechanical simulation makes sense when you&#x27;re competing about who&#x27;s better at combat. But it&#x27;s a waste when you&#x27;re trying to do collaborative storytelling)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41063886" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41063886" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">arscan</span><span>|</span><a href="#41062635">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41062307">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41063886">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41063886">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have great trouble writing good descriptions of products I build at work (I’m in software).

These can provide exemplars for how to approach your own writing.<p>Consider a recent article in the Financial Times about rising sea temperatures [1][2]. The topic is vast and complicated, which is perhaps relatable to your perspective, yet it&#x27;s the job of the writer to produce the linear narrative that you mentioned. How does the writer do this?<p>---<p>The article presents the key idea up front with a headline (&quot;The dangerous effects of rising sea temperatures&quot;), and then adds context with a sub-headline (&quot;Scientists are increasingly concerned that the world’s oceans are approaching the limits of their capacity to absorb heat&quot;).<p>To ease the reader into the topic, the author then begins by focusing on a human subject by writing: &quot;In 30 years of studying the oceans, Matthew England has learnt to understand their irregular yet constant rhythms — the cycles of wind, temperature and atmospheric changes that interact with the masses of water covering most of the Earth’s surface.<p>The author continues: &quot;But what he has seen in the past 15 months has shocked him. Global sea surface temperatures have reached and stayed at record levels, fuelling heatwaves and melting sea ice. Temperatures in the north Atlantic waters he has been studying, including around the UK and Ireland, were described last year as “beyond extreme” by the EU’s Earth observation service.&quot;<p>The author later &quot;zooms out&quot; as a narrative technique—similar to the one described in the submitted article—that provides wider context for the problem that the interviewee is describing by presenting cases of natural disasters.<p>To get deeper into the subject, the author then includes perspectives from various other researchers who study the phenomenon, and then dives deeper into competing theories about the immediate causes behind these environmental changes.<p>---<p>So, in your context, you could begin describing how your software tool solves some problem by describing a human user who is facing a specific yet common issue that is frustrating. After the reader then grasps what the problem is, you could write about how your software tool fixes the problem.<p>But this is just one approach of many. Another author might have taken a &quot;lede-nut graf&quot; [3] approach, where the bottom-line conclusion is put in the first sentence as the &quot;lede,&quot; followed by the &quot;nut graf&quot; of a paragraph providing additional context and motivation to read the rest of the article. With this approach, you could skip the focus on a human user, and instead jump right into a sentence that claims your software tool solves a specific problem (especially if the problem is a well-known one).<p>One of the best methods I&#x27;ve found to get better at a particular skill is to immerse yourself in high-quality exemplars of what you&#x27;re trying to do. Even without taking notes, you can naturally pick up lessons from what you&#x27;re experiencing. For this reason, a habit of reading well-written articles could help with your own ability to describe complicated concepts in a way that&#x27;s more accessible.<p>[1] Link: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;76c3747d-f068-467a-98f9-4ed687dcb575" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;76c3747d-f068-467a-98f9-4ed687dcb...</a><p>[2] Gift link (viewable up to three times): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;on.ft.com&#x2F;3LJJmBT" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;on.ft.com&#x2F;3LJJmBT</a><p>[3] More on nut grafs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theopennotebook.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;29&#x2F;nailing-the-nut-graf&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theopennotebook.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;29&#x2F;nailing-the-nut-g...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41062307" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41062307" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jamesponddotco</span><span>|</span><a href="#41063886">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41062267">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41062307">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41062307">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve to write alt tags daily and I still suck at it, since I suck at describing things (which is weird, since I write documentation every day).

Provided you’re already comfortable with the game and setting, anyway.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41062300" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41062300" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pavel_lishin</span><span>|</span><a href="#41062267">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41063350">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41063981">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41062300">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41062300">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a DM, it&#x27;s certainly something that&#x27;s very easy to sink time into.

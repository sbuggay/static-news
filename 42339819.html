I&#x27;m Romanian and I&#x27;ll provide some more details on this:<p>The country has been a powder keg ever since the results of first round of the presidential elections, with Calin Georgescu coming out of nowhere to win the first round, with classical polling showing him below 5%.<p>The candidates need to report spending to a state organization overseeing elections and this guy reported that he spent nothing on his election campaign, which is impossible as there have been flyers with his face on them, plus ads on social media. This is against the law.<p>There are also a lot of TikTok influencers that have come forward claiming to have received payments through a third party company to present the candidate in a positive light, and the issue is that these videos should have been tagged correctly as &quot;electoral ads&quot; according to Romanian law, which did not happen.<p>With TikTok being owned by China and their imminent ban looming in the US, there is strong suspicion that state actors are behind this, pushing Calin Georgescu through the algorithm, though this is tricky to prove.<p>This is not a strong grass-roots movement supporting this guy, it was a targeted effort of massive network of bots spamming his name &amp; tiktok page on random videos on Romanian tiktok videos to push his popularity (this comes from the Romanian equivalent of CIA &amp; other security structures). Tiktok themselves when asked to comment have investigated themselves and found nothing wrong, though they do agree that there are bots on their network and they&#x27;ve removed millions of fake likes &amp; followers in Romania.<p>In a video posted this summer, Calin Georgescu expressed anti-NATO sentiment which he recanted after winning the first round of the elections. He has also previously declared that we could do with some &quot;russian wisdom&quot; and he&#x27;s a big fan of the Iron Guard (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Iron_Guard" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Iron_Guard</a>), which killed a bunch of political figures in Romania during their time. This organization as well as other fascist groups are illegal in Romania.<p>Candidates have to declare their assets as part of transparency and it seems Calin Georgescu has not declared all of his assets, which is illegal. There&#x27;s also suspicions about money laundering, with a house he bought for 250K in 2006 and sold for 1M in 2011 which is unusual. This is somewhat besides the current discussion, just adding some context that this guy is not exactly squeaky clean.<p>A criminal investigation has been requested by The Supreme Council of National Defence, which is the autonomous administrative authority in Romania invested by the Constitution with the task of organising and coordinating, by unanimous decisions, the activities related to the country&#x27;s defence and national security. This is right now in the first stages with no single person being put under indictment.</div><br/><div id="42343033" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42343033" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">returningfory2</span><span>|</span><a href="#42342055">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42342666">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42343033">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42343033">[121 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I appreciate the details, but ultimately I still don&#x27;t buy it.

(He didn&#x27;t like the outcome of the 2016 one and was trying to rationalize mechanisms of overturning it).<p>Lessig:<p>- <i>&quot;The framers believed, as Alexander Hamilton put it, that &quot;the sense of the people should operate in the choice of the [president].&quot; But no nation had ever tried that idea before. So the framers created a safety valve on the people&#x27;s choice. Like a judge reviewing a jury verdict, where the people voted, the electoral college was intended to confirm â or not â the people&#x27;s choice. Electors were to apply, in Hamilton&#x27;s words, &quot;a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice&quot; â and then decide. The Constitution says nothing about &quot;winner take all.&quot; It says nothing to suggest that electors&#x27; freedom should be constrained in any way. Instead, their wisdom â about whether to overrule &quot;the people&quot; or not â was to be free of political control yet guided by democratic values. They were to be citizens exercising judgment,  not cogs turning a wheel.&quot;</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;the-constitution-lets-the-electoral-college-choose-the-winner-they-should-choose-clinton&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;24&#x2F;0f431828-b0f7-11e6-8616-52b15787add0_story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;the-constitution-let...</a> (<i>&quot;The Constitution lets the electoral college choose the winner.

Youâve decided each state gets votes proportional to its population in the presidential election. How do you validate that the result you got from Georgia, two weeksâ travel from NYC, is trustworthy? Seals? They can be tampered with. What about special messengers? Someone could impersonate them.<p>Solution: send dignitaries that can vouch for each other. The elite of neighboring states is likely to know each other, and you establish a chain of trust up and down the coast. Great!<p>Except these are people with better things to do than to be errand boys. There has to be <i>something</i> in it for them. Solution: <i>they</i> get to cast the final ballot for President.

But that&#x27;s not necessary - Maine and Nebraska, by contrast, have proportional systems, where they split their vote proportionally.<p>So how to interpret the results from one state could be quite different (and potentially subject to rapid change) even if you know the results were genuine. So the results of states always would need to be converted, by the states, into e.g. 15 final votes.

According to many scholars, fascistsâespecially when they&#x27;re in powerâhave historically attacked communism, conservatism, and parliamentary liberalism, attracting support primarily from the far-right.[30]<p>So, rather than purporting to define &quot;fascism&quot;, the article acknowledges it has many definitions and it is contested which one is right. Read in the context of the whole section &quot;Definitions&quot;, I don&#x27;t think the opening sentence should be read as a <i>definition</i>, except in a very vague ballpark sense, which isn&#x27;t meant to be used in decisively answering the question of whether any particular thing is an instance of it.<p>Furthermore, it mentions key elements of historical fascism â anti-communism, anti-conservatism, and anti-liberalism â whose presence in Putin&#x27;s Russia is debatable. Putin has criticised communism, but he tends to go for nuanced and qualified criticism rather than the demonisation of it which was historically found in Mussolini&#x27;s Italy, Hitler&#x27;s Germany or Franco&#x27;s Spain. He isn&#x27;t anti-conservative either. Nor is he rhetorically opposed to parliamentary liberalism â he is accused of undermining the substance of it, but he pays it lip service, unlike Mussolini and Hitler who demonised it.<p>The first actual definition it gives in the &quot;Definition&quot; section is this:<p>&gt; Historian Stanley G. Payne&#x27;s definition is frequently cited as standard by notable scholars,[31] such as Roger Griffin,[32] Randall Schweller,[33] Bo Rothstein,[34] Federico Finchelstein,[35] and Stephen D. Shenfield,[36] [37] His definition of fascism focuses on three concepts:<p>And the first of those three concepts is:<p>&gt; &quot;Fascist negations&quot; â anti-liberalism, anti-communism, and anti-conservatism.<p>I say Putin lacks all three â he isn&#x27;t anti-liberal (you can say he is in a contemporary sense, but not in the historical sense that Mussolini was, which is I believe the sense Payne means), he isn&#x27;t anti-communist (again, not in the sense Mussolini&#x2F;etc were), and he isn&#x27;t anti-conservative.</div><br/><div id="42346585" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42346585" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">freen</span><span>|</span><a href="#42342055">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42346437">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42347291">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42346585">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42346585">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You are trying to align a governance type with a political spectrum.<p>Itâs a category error.<p>Fascism has nothing to do with the policies, and everything to do with whatever is necessary to retain power, given the society fascists intends to rule.<p>He canât be a monarchist, he doesnât advocate for mercantilism!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ur-Fascism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ur-Fascism</a></div><br/><div id="42348214" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42348214" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">roenxi</span><span>|</span><a href="#42342055">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42346585">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42346657">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42348214">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42348214">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That definition doesn&#x27;t make sense - everyone of every political persuasion is trying to retain power.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42346657" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42346657" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">skissane</span><span>|</span><a href="#42342055">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42346585">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42348214">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42347291">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42346657">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42346657">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So, when Ian Kershaw, the esteemed historian of Nazi Germany, said that &quot;trying to define &#x27;fascism&#x27; is like trying to nail jelly to the wall&quot;, you are telling me he was wrong?

Then ask yourself: what if the communism did not exist as an idea yet until after 1945, e.g. USSR being just another western democracy, and the holocaust and WWII still went the way they did, would Germany no longer be &quot;fascist&quot;? Somehow I asked myself that question right away, but none of the _notable scholars_ did.<p>This is why in this thread the fact that masses can be manipulated by wordplay seems more interesting than classification of societies. I&#x27;m more intellectually curious about what to do with that problem.</div><br/><div id="42348003" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42348003" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">skissane</span><span>|</span><a href="#42342055">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42347573">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42345923">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42348003">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42348003">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You seem to be using the term &quot;fascist&quot; to mean the same thing as &quot;authoritarian&quot;&#x2F;&quot;totalitarian&quot;&#x2F;&quot;tyrannical&quot;&#x2F;&quot;dictatorial&quot;&#x2F;&quot;oppressive&quot;&#x2F;etc.<p>If you use the word in that way, then the Soviet Union was a fascist state.<p>But, to someone in the period between the World Wars, that would have seemed nonsensical â the Stalinists and fascists were at war with each other, on the streets of Italy and Germany, in the trenches of the Spanish Civil War.

Of course, having seen the evils of communism, a lot of Slovenians (farmers, city businessmen) opposed communists (and they were right, from a historic perspective!).

Unfortunately, Americans allied with <i>partisans</i> (communists), so the <i>white guard</i> allied with Nazis.<p>Communists won, and wrote history. <i>White guard</i> is almost uniformly - in media, education etc. - known as the bad guys, traitors to the nation, etc. where in fact they were simply people fighting for their lives against communists (rightfully so, communists killed a lot of wealthy owners etc. after the war).

I live in a place where donations must be declared and are capped per person. This ensures we know where the money came from, and prevents disproportional influence from rich people.<p>An obvious hack to bypass this is to assemble &quot;a group of citizens&quot; who start spending money to campaign for a candidate without any direct connection to them, but in such case, there&#x27;s a special commission run by retired campaign finance people that analyzes the spending and can take action like demand a candidate to pay back over-cap portion of the money spent to advertise them, even if someone else paid for it. In the worst case, this can be escalated to the Supreme Court, who has the authority to scrap and re-run entire elections if the impact of illegal practices is deemed large enough to sway elections.<p>So far, this system has produced a very transparent campaign financing environment. It was heavily tested in the first few years and withstood attacks remarkably well. A shadow figure of a political party used a retail network they owned to run a huge advertising campaign for a keychain that depicted the mascot of a major political party in their colors. The party was never directly mentioned, but you were blasted everywhere with their colors and the same animal as their mascot. After years of legal battles, it was deemed an illegal donation and the party had to pay for it all back with penalties. It was such a financial blow that the party underperformed for the next few electoral cycles due to constrained finances. No-one dares to try these tricks since then.

And Georgescu really is a lunatic, so perhaps SPD decided they&#x27;d rather have Lasconi then him.<p><i>Except</i> now it seems SPD hasn&#x27;t fully decided this.

They are quite hated as representatives of the pre-Revolution communist Romania, and as very corrupt. Their traditional electorate are those living in rural areas, those living in poverty, those working in the state apparatus, and generally with a lower education.<p>Then there is one traditional right-wing party, the National Liberal Party (liberal here in the &quot;classical liberalism&quot; sense, basically free market), that is slowly dying off, mostly due to the extremely unpopular current president who was elected on their lists; and due to governing in alliance with the SDP. They also have often been accused of corruption. They are relatively right wing both on economic and social issues.<p>Then, there is a much newer centre-right party, the Save Romania Union, which has similar economic policies to the NLP and is more socially liberal. They coasted to some success on a powerful anti-corruption, Change message, but have since become embroiled in internal infighting. There are also several small parties that split off from them that have very similar policies. For both these and the NLP, their traditional electorate is people living in larger cities, wealthier, especially white collar workers, with higher education.<p>All of the above parties are pro-EU, pro-NATO collaboration, agree on providing funds to Ukraine and so on.<p>Then there&#x27;s the newest force, the hard right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR, which also means &quot;gold&quot; in Romanian). They ran on populist somewhat left-wing promises (cheap houses for everyone!), hard right social conservatism (anti-LGBT, anti-abortion, very religious minded). There&#x27;s also a splinter party with virtually the same promises, the SOS Romania Party, and a newer force, The Young People&#x27;s party. All of these three are various degrees of euroskpetic, NATO skeptics and against providing resources to Ukraine.<p>Typically when someone in Romania says &quot;the left&quot;, they mean the SDP; when they say &quot;the right&quot; they mean &quot;the NLP and SRU&quot;, and when they want to refer to the other group, they&#x27;ll either say &quot;far right&quot;, &quot;ultra nationalists&quot;, or their own preferred term &quot;sovereignists&quot; (from &quot;national sovereignty&quot;).<p>* There is one small European-style left-wing party that ran in this election for the first time, but they only won 2,3% of the vote</div><br/></div></div><div id="42344502" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42344502" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RealityVoid</span><span>|</span><a href="#42342185">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42344017">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42344705">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42342518">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42344502">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42344502">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The USR party is liberal right wing.

Then all those paper forms are centralized at the district (judeÈ) level, and then to the central electoral bureau. This is all done on hand, with paper forms, with numerous observers all along the process. There is a digital process based on scanning these paper forms, but that is only done to report partial results faster to the public (and the count only happens after the vote has ended everywhere in the country, so false information in the partial results can&#x27;t influence other voters).<p>So, even if the digital systems had been entirely compromised and under Russian control, that wouldn&#x27;t have mattered one iota for the final results. And even after all this, a full hand recount was carried out last week which found the same results, with very little difference and no doubt whatsoever that CG won more votes than any other candidate).<p>And even the news stories you shared, which are anyway irrelevant to the final paper results, have misunderstood what our authorities are saying. The part of the our secret services which handles the cybernetic parts of the election  (named the STS, Special Tellecomunications Service) has been very explicit, both in public declarations and in the classified briefing they gave to the President, that there were no risks to the core infrastructure, and that checks have been made before, during, and after the elections to confirm this.</div><br/><div id="42342838" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42342838" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">margalabargala</span><span>|</span><a href="#42341697">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42342710">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42342844">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42342838">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42342838">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Interesting.

This includes allegations of algorithmic skew by Tik Tok, allegations that Tik Tok ignored Romanian campaign laws that require electoral clips to proeminently show some registration numbers, of illegal contributions to CG&#x27;s campaign (including foreign, probably Russian, financing), of foreign nationals (again, probably Russians) coordinating to spread his campaign on Tik Tok and other social media, etc. The Supreme Council for National Defense (CSAT) papers that were declassified that triggered this late decision by the court were mostly about this.<p>To my mind, all of these might well have been disqualifying before the election, but give that the people have voted for him fairly, even if manipulated through social media, it&#x27;s absurd to cancel the entire process and restart it. Especially considering that this will move the elections to at least February or March, months past the regular end of the current President&#x27;s term. Consider also the huge costs for redoing this whole election, which we as taxpayers will cover.<p>I will note that the campaign financing fraud allegation is almost self-evidently true itself - CG has filed in official papers that his campaign was run for 0 RON. The fact that the authorities who received these filings months ago were unable or unwilling to do anything about it is absurd. I still don&#x27;t believe that canceling the entire process when it was two days away from finishing is an acceptable moment to right this.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hotnews.ro&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2024&#x2F;12&#x2F;HCC-32-2024.PDF" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hotnews.ro&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2024&#x2F;12&#x2F;HCC-32-2024.PD...</a> - PDF by a news source, couldn&#x27;t find it yet on the official site</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42342844" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42342844" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">culi</span><span>|</span><a href="#42341697">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42341775">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42341974">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42342324">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42342844">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42342844">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is nobody that is alleging the vote counts were illegitimate.

If he spent at least a decent amount of money for the campaign, $100.000 or whatever, he&#x27;d have a better chance at plausibly denying the connection with the tik tok amplifier people, who in truth, could very well be just &quot;fans&quot;, like Elon Musk was for Trump.
And there&#x27;s also the Iron Guard connections all over the place, that pretty much make you incompatible with the function, same reason the other candidate got removed from the list.
So the decision isn&#x27;t really undemocratic, although the moment it was given in was probably not quite legal&#x2F;right, should have been done after the second round, but that would have caused more uproar and give him more legitimacy if he had won, and the odds are that he would have, so that&#x27;s why they decided to cut it early, to minimise damage.</div><br/><div id="42345743" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42345743" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AdrianB1</span><span>|</span><a href="#42342029">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42343418">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42343362">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42345743">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42345743">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">He had no chance in the second round.

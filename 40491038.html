Consequently inspiring a vast chorus of LIRs applying for &#x2F;19 allocations over the years &quot;for SSL hosting&quot; and continuing to do so long past the introduction of SNI (RFC 3546). Saw this behaviour firsthand as a European LIR operator with friends at RIPE. Is it cracked down on now? Yes. Are there whole swathes of IPv4 space that remain unassigned or entirely unannounced? Yes. Does every large-scale DNS hosting service have some hackish way to workaround the prohibition of CNAME records at the zone apex? They sure do, and HTTP is why.<p>Paul Vixie saw it coming, the very first example in the original SRV proposal (RFC 2052, <i>1996</i>) is resolution of HTTP. Alas that this example was omitted in later editions. The new SVCB&#x2F;HTTPS RRs (RFC 9460, <i>2024</i>) are literally decades overdue.</div><br/><div id="40498022" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40498022" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jeroenhd</span><span>|</span><a href="#40494456">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40496114">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40498022">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40498022">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The SVCB&#x2F;HTTPS records won&#x27;t save us, because of the same reason TLS 1.3 pretends to be TLS 1.2: middleboxes everywhere have been configured to only let traffic to port 80 and 443 through.

It&#x27;s foundational for SIP, for example (IP telephony). Email remains a tremendously significant internet utility and SRV is used, albeit not universally, for discovery of client endpoints (SMTP submission, IMAP, CalDAV etc). However, SRV hasn&#x27;t replaced MX for SMTP between MTAs, perhaps because MX already does basically the same and was established years prior. And, well, Jabber is dead, but XMPP was another fully worked demonstration of SRV&#x27;s capability.<p>In more local environments SRV is used for resolution&#x2F;discovery in Active Directory (Microsoft) and Bonjour (Apple) - if you listen to the wire on any local network you&#x27;ll often see a ton of SRV over mDNS or DNS-SD. Perhaps ironically, one of the objections that sometimes arose to using SRV for HTTP was from Active Directory sites with zone cuts at _tcp.example.com and facing additional complexity in any transition.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40494860" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40494860" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">matt-p</span><span>|</span><a href="#40494456">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40494739">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40495865">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40494830">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40494860">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40494860">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That it was historically &quot;more difficult&quot; to have more than one website per IP address particularly if it was using SSL because doing that needed amendments&#x2F;extensions to DNS and other specs.<p>We now have it, but still need to use a hack to cname an apex e.g set Google.com to bah-bahs-tenant100.s3.amazon.com.

Under the auspices of the IETF.<p>IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force, the standards organization for the Internet. Most famous for being the entity that publishes TCP&#x2F;IP and the cherries on top.<p>LIR: Local Internet Registry, an entity that applies to be the holder of block-allocated IP address space. Typically ISPs and hosting companies that assign it for their use or onward customer use.<p>RIPE: The European peak body, a Regional Internet Registry (RIR), responsible for (amongst many other things) allocating IP space to the LIRs, ultimately under license from the global steward IANA. Sibling of ARIN, LACNIC, AFRINIC, APNIC (North &amp; South America, Africa, Asia-Pacific respectively).<p>SNI: Server Name Identification. Before SNI was introduced to SSL&#x2F;TLS, the only way to tell which HTTPS origin was being requested, was by server IP address.<p>SRV: A specific type of record in the DNS that allows lookup of a service (e.g. IMAP mail, XMPP messaging, LDAP directories) for a given domain name, to return a set of hostname(s) that actually provide that service, and the ports on which it is available. This enables multi-tenant services on shared IP addresses and thereby conserves IP space.<p>&#x2F;19 network prefix: A large chunk of IPv4 address space, corresponding to 8192 unique IPv4 addresses. Refers to the first 19 bits of the block of (32 bit) IPv4 addresses being allocated. Back in the 90s a &#x2F;19 was a common granularity of allocation from RIR to LIR and could be granted with a low bar to justification. Mathematically, 2^(32-19) = 8192.<p>Address record: A specific type of record in the DNS that maps a hostname to an IP address. Technically referred to as an &quot;A record&quot; for IPv4 addresses, or an &quot;AAAA&quot; record for IPv6 addresses which are literally 4x the binary length.<p>Allocation, Assignment, and Announcement: IP address space is <i>allocated</i> in blocks by RIRs to LIRs, who then <i>assign</i> smaller parcels of it to specific purposes such as retail hosting and internet access, and <i>announce</i> it at internet exchanges and to their peers for actual traffic exchange. Very often, the quantity of assignment failed to justify a large allocation, leaving space unassigned i.e. unused, and in some cases unannounced, but still hoarded, with incentives for hoarding becoming perversely stronger as the addresses ran out and the policy screws started to tighten ca.2005-2011.<p>Apex: in &quot;example.com&quot; it is the &quot;example.com&quot; rather than &quot;www.example.com&quot;. For marketing purposes, almost every entity wants their zone apex to be directly reachable as a website, which means placing an address record at the apex. This excludes using the apex address record for any other service but HTTP, which I have always regarded as downright antisocial. Since alias records (a.k.a CNAME records) aren&#x27;t permitted at the apex, it also makes DNS management harder when you have frequent changes to make, as in the highly dynamic world of cloud-based services, or even just want to point your website at a third party hosting service without having to edit your zones whenever their IP addresses change.<p>Normative: A formal declaration in one technical standard (e.g. SMTP) that it depends in whole or in part on another standard (e.g. DNS) for full specification. It is unusual for a TCP&#x2F;IP-based IETF protocol standard to omit DNS as normative or otherwise specify how they use the DNS for discovery, but HTTP has always been super vague about it.<p>Origin: Fancy word for your actual website.

I guess we need an official statement about that somewhere. [Edit: other than these quick thoughts below...!]<p>I personally think IPv6 is great (I was excited about it in the late 1990s when it was standardized, and gave some talks to promote it, and am happy to see it getting deployed and happy to find myself using it sometimes). I hope people will keep working on it and networks and services will keep adopting it.<p>However, people&#x27;s need for IPv4 address space depends enormously on <i>other people&#x27;s</i> behavior. IPv6 addresses are not a good substitute for IPv4 addresses when you&#x27;re providing a public service, if many of your <i>users</i> don&#x27;t have IPv6. A high fraction of demand for IPv4 address resources appears to come from organizations and networks that <i>already</i> support IPv6, because they need dual-stack support for compatibility with <i>other people</i>.<p>Even though IPv6 adoption has been happening, it&#x27;s easy to imagine that it&#x27;s &quot;almost done&quot; where that really doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case. (This is complicated by having very different statistics in different countries: some countries are now almost all IPv6 traffic, while others have almost no IPv6 -- so people in different parts of the world often have rather different intuitions about it.) We still see enormous economic demand for IPv4 address space and projections that IPv6 adoption <i>to a point where IPv4 would somehow no longer be useful or important</i> is likely still decades away. If that&#x27;s correct¹, we can still get a benefit from making 240&#x2F;4 usable because that process can be substantially complete during a time when IPv4 is still extremely important.<p>One thing that Ben (and one of the questioners at the end) argued in his presentation is that even if the adoption of IPv6 is unreliable or erratic, it might be <i>more</i> reliable than useful adoption of 240&#x2F;4. (This was kind of phrased in the converse direction.) I&#x27;ll have to think about models of that issue.<p>Edit: We have been sad when seeing how proposals to make 240&#x2F;4 usable were made in 2008, but not adopted at IETF. Among things that people said in 2008 was that IPv6 would make this irrelevant quickly. That turned out not to be right, but we lost years of opportunity to make 240&#x2F;4 more useful in the meantime, where billions of devices shipped in the interim could easily have supported it by default. So, we still have the opportunity not to have the same sense of regret in 2035.<p>¹ I&#x27;m also aware that there are other projections here; I recently interviewed a prominent Internet greybeard figure who theorized that Internet infrastructure growth as a whole has slowed so much that IPv4 demand may be satisfied in the future out of gradual conversion of residential ISPs to using primarily carrier-grade NAT for IPv4, and then selling off their number resources. In this account, IPv4 will remain important on the Internet for a long time, but economic demand for addresses will decline because most users won&#x27;t have native IPv4 at home or on their mobile devices (the latter already the case in many networks). The economic demand for IPv4 resources is something that has made reclaiming 240&#x2F;4 appear worthwhile, so in this model it would become less exciting, even without having IPv4 &quot;go away&quot;.</div><br/><div id="40494059" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40494059" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">schoen</span><span>|</span><a href="#40493723">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40494203">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40494059">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40494059">[24 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I want to say something else about IPv6 adoption! (Apart from how you can&#x27;t necessarily unilaterally stop using IPv4, even if you can unilaterally start using IPv6.)<p>There is a great level of IPv6 awareness and enthusiasm in sort of technically elite spaces. Like at Ben&#x27;s talk at RIPE that we&#x27;re talking about, the audience was kind of laughing together at the non-IPv6 outgroup.<p>Meanwhile, I keep helping people use Let&#x27;s Encrypt over on the Let&#x27;s Encrypt forum. One of the most common reasons that people are failing to get their certificates is ... misconfigured IPv6 on their servers or in their DNS! And people in that situation often (1) didn&#x27;t think of that as a possibility, (2) didn&#x27;t notice (!!), (3) didn&#x27;t necessarily care about it. Even worse, when people are told something like &quot;your certificate issuance isn&#x27;t working because your AAAA record is pointing at your old hosting provider rather than your current hosting provider&quot; their usual response is to <i>delete the AAAA record</i> rather than updating it.<p>Other forum members may also advocate this as a solution. &quot;Oh, just delete your AAAA record, you don&#x27;t need it.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not making this up, I&#x27;ve seen these things happen about 100 times on the Let&#x27;s Encrypt forum.<p>Now, these are primarily sites in the long tail of Internet popularity, the proverbial Joe&#x27;s Lamp Store rather than Gmail or Facebook or something. But the level of IPv6 awareness and interest among small-scale site operators and people doing small-scale IT stuff is very weak. And I&#x27;ve also seen that a surprisingly high fraction of web sites are IPv4-only rather than dual-stack.<p>I&#x27;m working on 240&#x2F;4 usability, but I certainly <i>don&#x27;t</i> want people to delete their AAAA records.

If my understanding is correct, then part of the problem of IPv6 adoption is people not really understanding what it is or why it might be useful, instead seeing it as a nuisance that they should avoid. Crucially, they&#x27;re not exactly _wrong_ with this viewpoint because IPv6 doesn&#x27;t really provide any benefits at the individual adoption level; the benefits are only realized if others adopt it as well, and that&#x27;s not likely to be a convincing argument to someone having a concrete, immediate issue with their servers that they can address (pun intended) by not supporting IPv6.</div><br/><div id="40494921" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40494921" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">schoen</span><span>|</span><a href="#40493723">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40494808">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40494575">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40494921">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40494921">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, exactly.<p>If you do have AAAA records, Let&#x27;s Encrypt (not unlike other software and services!) will <i>prefer</i> the AAAA records when doing domain validation for your domain.

And you can <i>tinker</i> with a development web-server on your home network — but if you want to actually <i>host</i> anything, you should go pay a cloud provider.&quot;<p>Whereas, in a world with no well-Internet-connected home PCs providing the <i>illusion of the possibility</i> of hosting a home server, only instead:<p>1. home PCs — which can compute well, but <i>can&#x27;t</i> be a network-ingress, and also might go down (often for laptops, less often for desktops, but both far more often than a real server would);<p>2. smartphones — which <i>can</i> network-ingress, but can&#x27;t spend long periods computing (without burning all your battery life), and which will go down &#x2F; out of wireless range <i>extremely</i> often; and<p>3. both commercial, and more importantly <i>ISP-residential</i>, edge-compute clusters — which would give tiny compute slices per workload, but ones with full network-ingress, and would <i>never</i> go down;<p>...then it&#x27;d be clear to all the people who had been thinking until that point that they could get away with p2p on home PCs using STUN&#x2F;TURN-based protocols, that they would have to <i>do something else</i>; that operating systems (esp. mobile ones) and their client-server&#x2F;p2p applications would have to evolve to become inherently edge-hybrid; that applications would need to evolve frameworks to embed persistent network-ingress &quot;edge components&quot; that could be shipped automatically and implicitly to the active network&#x27;s associated edge deploy environment as part of the application&#x27;s runtime; etc.<p>If you can&#x27;t picture that: think about a web server backend that automatically deploys&#x2F;updates an associated Cloudflare Worker whenever it boots up; and which then expects to be talked to through that Cloudflare Worker proxying requests to it; and where that Worker can also buffer requests, store data into its edge key-value store, etc.<p>But instead of a web server backend, it&#x27;s the Minecraft app on your phone; and instead of Cloudflare, it&#x27;s your residential ISP; and instead of the edge worker making a forward connection to your phone, your phone holds open an ngrok-like reverse connection to the edge worker to receive requests.<p>(Oh, and one other point of necessary evolution: that the &quot;server component&quot; of any p2p app would also be a mobile workload — not shiftable to the edge itself, but rather <i>through</i> the persistent edge workload <i>to</i> any [similarly reverse-connected, not always online] &quot;compute host nodes&quot; owned by the same user&#x2F;organization. Such that you could buy a little NUC&#x2F;NAS-like box to shove under your TV at home, whose marketed purpose would be compute+storage offload for the workloads launched on your phone; or such that your office could have some server racks for free auto-offload of &quot;server components&quot; of apps running on any employee machine — reversing the usual &quot;cloud app with local client&quot; relationship into &quot;local app with slaved cloud workload.&quot; Where, in either case, the relevant workloads are still <i>canonically</i> on your phone&#x2F;PC, so if the &quot;compute offload&quot; has to be drained for an update, the workloads just temporarily migrate back to your phone&#x2F;PC.)<p>From my perspective, this would actually be a much <i>better</i> Internet <i>in practice</i> than the one we have today. Individuals would be far more able to host persistent, accessible services on a whim, without investment into local infra <i>or</i> being beholden to a commercial provider with a ToU. Individuals would be paying their ISPs for edge hosting, yes (if they don&#x27;t have a server with a public IP to run an &quot;edge layer&quot; on themselves); but —<p>* those would be small fixed costs (as apps&#x27; network-ingress components would be small fixed workloads);<p>* and would likely be sold as free value-adds of data plans (just like web hosting, email, and access to locally-mirrored NNTP groups used to be sold as value-adds of residential Internet plans);<p>* and such workloads would only be smarter versions of the &quot;dumb pipe&quot; the residential ISP was already providing, not backends in-and-of themselves; and so wouldn&#x27;t be subject to a VPS-host-like &quot;you can&#x27;t host X&#x2F;Y&#x2F;Z on our servers&quot; type ToU, because users are not <i>hosting</i> anything per se;<p>* and as such edge workloads live on a very high-level abstraction layer, an edge-hosting ISP would be empowered to do all sorts of things to defend such workloads from DDoS attacks (e.g. putting the known-protocol workload behind a layer-7 WAF), that it can&#x27;t do for individual customers&#x27; single-homed single-IP single-port, arbitrary-protocol home PC server processes.</div><br/><div id="40495407" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40495407" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">caf</span><span>|</span><a href="#40493723">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40494556">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40493778">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40495407">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40495407">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t see this ever happening.<p>As you say, residential ISPs <i>used to</i> provide additional services to their customers like web hosting, email, NNTP, shell access, time synch, IRC, mirrors of popular archives.

My opinion has been the same through multiple proposals for this, though some have had minor differences to considers. There are two main reasons I believe this across all of them:<p>The first is, particularly on opening it up for public assignment, all of the compatibility issues mentioned. It&#x27;s not enough that in 2035 99% of things could be compatible when talking about existing internet infrastructure - it has to be 100% going to work (without hoping everyone just catches up, this isn&#x27;t a separate internet like IPv6&#x27;s rollout is) if you want to bet interoperability of the established internet on it. The alternative is let people use it but not on the internet, that way they own their own interoperability with themselves or anyone directly interacting with their internal network. If this were a security issue I&#x27;d have different feelings on it but it&#x27;s about convenience so it isn&#x27;t enough that it&#x27;s possibly more convenient to most 10 years from now. Especially since the problem and solutions will have evolved so much 10 years from now anyways.<p>The second reason is, even if it does work out 100%, it&#x27;s not much a solution to anything anyways. IPv4 pressure has started causing places with large blocks of old IPv4 space moving to NAT, carries deploying double NAT via CG-NAT, cloud providers looking at public IPv4 address fees, and the entire mobile world being IPv6 first with some going as far as IPv6 only with NAT64. Each one of these solutions already in place has resulted in more usable IP space than this would open up so this solution could neither replace them or stop them from being needed in the future. Each existing alternative (however non-ideal) is either a longer term mitigation or step towards a long term solution to the shortage instead of a small basket of addresses to throw on the fire. In particular the NAT64 and 464xlat solution have proven to be a long term permanent answer for the vast majority of the cases people thought they needed these kinds of addresses for that would have left them less prepared when these too ran out. I particularly don&#x27;t buy the idea that the world just so happens to need exactly a &#x2F;4 more of space and everything would be alright - it only looks that way because of the above methods being pressured into happening. Remove that pressure and it (at best) can hope to delay the rollout numbers of those methods by a decade.<p>All that said I&#x27;m still in support of opening it up for  private use cases like enabling 0.0.0.0&#x2F;8 in Linux [2] did (think use cases like another &#x2F;8 of space you can slap your Docker container NATs behind or your HA networks behind for software that doesn&#x27;t support v6). Not only do I think that would result in less pain for the internet at large I think it would actually result in a larger decrease in IPv4 pressure long term by giving more spaces to NAT to&#x2F;from for those not ready&#x2F;able to NAT64 all of their internal services.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39804231">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39804231</a>, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32796355">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32796355</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.kernel.org&#x2F;pub&#x2F;scm&#x2F;linux&#x2F;kernel&#x2F;git&#x2F;torvalds&#x2F;linux.git&#x2F;commit&#x2F;?id=96125bf9985a" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.kernel.org&#x2F;pub&#x2F;scm&#x2F;linux&#x2F;kernel&#x2F;git&#x2F;torvalds&#x2F;lin...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40491945" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40491945" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Latty</span><span>|</span><a href="#40493723">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40494126">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40491945">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40491945">[97 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;d really just rather get IPv6 working everywhere and not have to deal with NAT.

Used to do it often in the dorms when the uni&#x27;s DHCP server was on the fritz. Zeroconf&#x2F;Avahi wasn&#x27;t really a thing, so we&#x27;d use Network Neighborhood to get people&#x27;s IP addresses to browse files or play on servers they were hosting or whatever.

From the second paragraph of the Abstract of RFC 3927: [0]<p>&gt; IPv4 Link-Local addresses are not suitable for communication with devices not directly connected to the same physical (or logical) link, and are only used where stable, routable addresses are not available (such as on ad hoc or isolated networks).<p>&gt; The RFC even recommends not using the link-local address if any other address is available. It&#x27;s quite different from the way IPv6 works (as usual).<p>No, it&#x27;s also recommended when using IPv6 to not use link-local addresses if any other address is available. (Both because those addresses are only link-local, and because one usually needs to put an outbound interface specifier on the address when you go to contact another host, which is pretty obnoxious.) It just happens that IPv6&#x27;s address autoconfiguration has been upgraded to be useful for globally-routable addressing, too.<p>So, yeah, a usual mode of both IPv4 and IPv6 networks is to have autoconfigured addresses, as well as DHCP-assigned addresses. It just so happens that most of the time IPv4 addresses are not autoconfigured, and most of the time IPv6 addresses are not assigned by DHCP.<p>That&#x27;s equivalent complexity.<p>[0] &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc3927" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc3927</a>&gt;</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40495192" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40495192" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">quectophoton</span><span>|</span><a href="#40491945">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40494850">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40495379">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40497038">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40495192">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40495192">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And for the record, a backwards-compatible-ish way was proposed in 1993 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc1475" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc1475</a>), by using an option in the IPv4 packet header.<p>AFAIU it was &quot;just&quot; defining an option type; the IPv4 packet header itself didn&#x27;t even need to be changed.<p>1993 was more than 30 years ago.<p>So people who wanted to keep it backwards-compatible with IPv4 already had a chance.</div><br/><div id="40495332" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40495332" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throw0101b</span><span>|</span><a href="#40491945">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40495192">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40497038">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40495332">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40495332">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">From §8.3:<p><pre><code>    Each TCP&#x2F;IP v7 system, whether host or router, must be able to

[…]<p><pre><code>    On networks where ARP is not normally used, the method is to assume

    the assumption is confirmed.  If, after a short time, no IPv7

    appear in the application layers, this software will find those
    addresses unreachable; this is preferable to interacting with a
    random host.

Just like with IPv6, the IPv7 described in RFC 1475 would have needed libraries and data structures to be created. Also DNS A records were fixed sizes, and so a new record type would have needed to be created for IPv7 (like AAAA was for IPv6).<p>IPv7 would have had the exact same issues that IPv6 had with rollout.<p>There is no &quot;just&quot; when trying to expand a fixed-size data structure across the entire planet.</div><br/><div id="40496705" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40496705" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">theamk</span><span>|</span><a href="#40491945">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40495332">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40497038">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40496705">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40496705">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No they would not.

Then network inside LAN and the server need of course to understand IPv4-extended (let&#x27;s call it IPv5) packets, but still you only need to update the endpoint devices, and not the core of the network (fare easy, since that evolves more quickly!). You could also implemented a mechanism &quot;similar&quot; to NAT, where the router did for outgoing traffic compose the extended &quot;IPv5&quot; packet by combining the local IPv4 and the external IPv4, and did the opposite operation for incoming packets. That way really only the router needed to be updated, and not individual devices in your house. Thus being backward compatible in both ways.<p>Also adopting IPv6 these days would require to maintain still IPv4, this means that for example firewall rules must be made both for IPv4 and IPv6, something that adds a lot of work to IT technicians (and they thus disable the protocol that if you disable the internet still works, that is IPv6). Extending IPv4 would mean that the same firewall rules can apply, just considering again the upper 32 bits of the address.<p>Finally IPv6 is in general more complex, it has some obscure things like SLAAC or the fact that an interface can have multiple IPs, that not all IPs are routable, etc, even simply the notation for IPv6 addresses that is not even consistent among software (in some software you have to put it between [] to disambiguate with port numbers, in some other not), DHCPv6 implementations that are still these days quite broken, etc. Compared to IPv4 is quite a complication...<p>I&#x27;m the opinion that we are slow to adopt IPv6 since it&#x27;s too different from IPv4, and requires maintaining a network with two protocols, since everyone completes the migrations, this is unlikely to succeed in the next years (for example in my country, Italy, most ISP, even the most important one, don&#x27;t even bother to provide you an IPv6 address! I think that because it does increment the problems and thus the requests to handle in the customer service, thus they decided that you just get IPv4 that works reliably).</div><br/><div id="40495116" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40495116" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">quectophoton</span><span>|</span><a href="#40491945">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40494654">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40496131">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40495116">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40495116">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; You could have just extended the IPv4 header<p>Sounds like IPv7, from year 1993: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc1475" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc1475</a><p>&gt; I&#x27;m the opinion that we are slow to adopt IPv6 since it&#x27;s too different from IPv4<p>Doubt, seeing how IPv7 appeared around the same time as IPv6 (RFC1883, from year 1995) and we still don&#x27;t see IPv7 anywhere.<p>To be fair, IPv7 seems to have been deprecated in 2012 (RFC6814).

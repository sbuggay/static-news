I have a Monoprice Maker Ultimate (Wanhao D6, rebadged) that has a slightly larger build area, but otherwise it&#x27;s bare bones on the firmware. I reflashed it with Klipper, and have an Octopi attached to it, but that still requires all sorts of futzing about to get it tuned right.<p>With multi filaments, all the tuning wizardry, and the quick-change nozzle, I might consider this.<p>The big thing that gives me pause is the closed nature of the platform. My current printer might be &quot;just commodity parts&quot; or whatever, but that can be huge plus! This feels very much like deciding whether to join the Apple Ecosystem™ or to stick with a beige box so I can run whatever OS I want.

Really solid and well engineered device, and it&#x27;s delightful that Prusa acknowledge the open-source hardware and software they depended on to build their company.<p>BambooLab... well it is a nice machine, and they have definitely advanced the  the field with input shaping. But this machine is pretty much a Prusa Mini with linear rails, and I&#x27;d bet there is open-source in their firmware and slicer, but there&#x27;s no way to find out because their business model is to give nothing back to the ecosystem they have leveraged. That leaves a bad taste for me, but I&#x27;m sure many people will be quite happy to ignore such esoteric concerns and happily lock themselves in.<p>Until BambooLab have a bad financial quarter. Then the optional cloud integration will become mandatory with a subscription, and the spool detection system will start reject non-BambooLab filament.<p>Doctorow has struck a chord with his distillation of enshittification, and you are right on the money raising it here.<p>(Meanwhile Prusa has just released input shaping for the Mini.)</div><br/><div id="37621646" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37621646" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nebula8804</span><span>|</span><a href="#37620317">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37620812">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37621100">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37621646">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37621646">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You are letting your past experience color your objective opinions here. As someone who refused to even want to get into 3D printing.... last month in preparation for DEFCON, I was forced into entering this world in order to make a special project for the con.<p>Knowing absolutely nothing, I first picked the Sovol SV06 because is was a strong recommendation from Reddit for the price I was willing to pay.....turns out its nothing more than a toy. In fact all these bed slingers are. All this modding and manual work is not something a normal person wants to do. It like we are still stuck in the 1970s computer kit building era and everyone in the community is in denial.<p>Out of pure desperation and considering my hard deadline of DEFCON, I bit the bullet and bought a used Bambu Labs X1c. This machine is in a class of its own for 3D printing newbies. I just load the filament, slice my model in their easy to use software and click print. That printer saved me big time. I consider it the absolute bare minimum for 3D Printing for people that dont really care about 3D Printing.<p>I hope that the X1c or something like it eventually reaches a price point where it is accessible to the mass market and becomes the bare minimum standard of quality and ease of use. Anything less will keep 3D printing as a niche hobby. Kinda like how we went through decades of really awful inkjet and laser printers to now get printers that are cheap, accessible to anybody by being plug and play and straightforward and fairly ok in reliability: basically an extremely mature market.<p>One more note about open source: There is no &quot;open source&quot; desktop laser&#x2F;inkjet printer and people get on with their lives regardless.

Slow like in a 2 hours print becomes 12 hours print if it&#x27;s colored. And it wastes a lot of plastic (and doing so does a lot of noise, too).<p>- The printer can&#x27;t print things like ASA. Limited to PLA&#x2F;PETG&#x2F;TPU.<p>- While the design of the hotend and swappable nozzle looks nice at a first glance, the printer is a closed design and is not clear how well you can service it when needed. I&#x27;ve a Prusa MK4 and owned different Prusa Minis in the past, to print for a shop 24h, and if you want to print for production and not just for a few weeks hobby, you need to be able to fix those printers. Also Bambulab has a bad track in providing parts, when needed.<p>So yes, competitors like Prusa should do something to improve their printers and adjust the price point a bit (at this point the Mini is too costly, and its hot-end needs to be redesigned, and certain XL&#x2F;MK4 improvements back-ported to the Mini, like the load cell and the all metal nozzle design). But after the first days of printing colored things, a Prusa Mini is likely a much better printer for somebody that really wants to do something nice with a 3D printer, and not just a few colored miniatures.<p>Also Bambulab behavior in using open source software written by others, at least in the past was very questionable.

The main thing that is required to print well is auto bed leveling, that works well with the Mini as well. The Mini is very quiet so the noise canceling feature is not useful. Input Shaping is now available on both. So what remains is that the Mini is a printer that <i>provably</i> was able to print in what are basically miniature factories. I printed with 4 minis for a couple of years 24H, and everything that breaks you can either print it yourself, if it&#x27;s a plastic part, or get it for a reasonable price. If the A1 can do it, is to be seen, and we for sure know that the vendor itself discourages printing anything but PLA&#x2F;PETG&#x2F;TPU. Printing ASA is very useful for everything you want to put something inside your car under the sun or alike. Also Prusa has a long history in supporting the printer for a long time, so we can expect that the next Mini will ship with an upgrade kit.<p>However don&#x27;t get my wrong, I believe that the A1, especially without the multicolor gear, is a reasonable purchase, with some risk ahead because there is yet to see if it is a reliable printer. If you buy the multicolor gear you paid for more than the Mini, and I believe soon you&#x27;ll no be using it anymore in most cases, and just be left with a printer that in practice can&#x27;t be used so extensively as the Mini.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37621378" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37621378" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nullc</span><span>|</span><a href="#37621163">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37621317">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37621610">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37621378">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37621378">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Multicolor is not something you actually use often and is horribly slow.

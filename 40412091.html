American cards still have magnetic stripes that are very vulnerable to skimming.

That ID can then be used to open financial accounts, apply for a bank or car loan, or for some other dodgy purpose that could devastate their victims’ financial lives.&quot;</i><p>Does this seem a little far-fetched? The reporter lost $5000 - a lot of money! - but if it required a high-tech impossible-to-detect fake ID, layers of shadowy criminal gangs and cash mules it seems like there won&#x27;t be a huge profit left. It seems more likely that this kind of fraud is much less sophisticated, and is exactly the same technology used by adolescents to get into bars.<p>This feels like another argument that this is an unsolvable problem, and banks are helpless against mysterious dark web hackers.

You get a rash, some people never get over it. Others do get over it, and I did. Years ago I was in the black thumb club. I could stick my thumb in Urushi, and not get a rash. Since Urushi was a big thing in Japan (and other places), people who worked harvesting or packaging or using it either got over or did not. I have a friend who did not. He said he could walk down the street and detect if there was raw Urushi anywhere near by.<p>I still got a &quot;tingle&quot; even when I did not get a rash.<p>The way to tolerate the adaptation is hot water - spray water as hot as you can stand (without damage) on the affected area and you will get substantial relief for about 12 hours. The relief of hot water on an affected area cannot be understated. A friend used the word &quot;orgasmic&quot; and it fits. I can almost imagine someone purposefully getting the rash just to take a shower.<p>Finally in this bizarre world of Urushi - when it is cured (warm &amp; humid), NOT dried, the chemical properties change so the coating does not cause problems. If you see photos of Chinese or Japanese rice bows ls that are red or black they are probably wooden bowl coated with Urushi and cured. Urushi as used to make eating utensils.<p>There is more. There are an incredible number of decorative techniques. Supposedly each village had its own. One of the best is Rankaku.

Similar to poison oak (in irritant effect), we&#x27;ve also got poodle-dog bush out in California. It thrives in post-fire environments, and isn&#x27;t as well-known as poison oak. The reaction to it is often even worse than for poison oak. And so, before I was better versed in the &quot;fun&quot; plants of our local mountains, I had a run in with some poodle plants, and.. that was a rough few weeks.<p>I tried everything to make it more tolerable, and hot water was by far the best. The effect didn&#x27;t last forever, but it was remarkable how it a) was actually pleasurable and b) muted the itchiness for a fairly significant amount of time (although still not as long as I would have liked..).<p>It&#x27;s probably still best to avoid hot water until you&#x27;ve done a good job of getting the offending substance off (as best as possible). And near scalding water isn&#x27;t otherwise great for the skin, so it&#x27;s probably not something one should do all the time.<p>But wow, it was amazing for poodle-dog bush.</div><br/><div id="40413356" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40413356" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bbarnett</span><span>|</span><a href="#40409917">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40413140">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40413113">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40413356">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40413356">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A note, if you don&#x27;t want to dry your skin out by removing your own body oils (after you&#x27;ve cleaned the offending substance off, of course!)... use a hair dryer.<p>Same result, without having to get wet.

It doesn&#x27;t typically lead to anaphylaxis. It is caused by pollen allergy, where the food has a protein similar to one that&#x27;s in the pollen you&#x27;re allergic to. This is called &quot;cross-reactivity&quot;.<p>Personally I have OAS with raw carrots, which is likely cross-reactive from my birch pollen allergy. Raw carrots make my throat mildly itchy, but I don&#x27;t have a food allergy to carrots and I don&#x27;t get anaphylaxis. Cooked carrots are totally fine, the cooking destroys the protein.

Just wanted to note that my immunotherapy for pollen&#x2F;cat&#x2F;mold allergy is not oral, but subcutaneous. That is, allergy shots. Oral (probably sublingual) immunotherapy can be done also, but for these allergens I believe subcutaneous is more common. I am not sure of the reasons but they may be related to efficacy, safety (eosinophilic esophagitis does not occur with shots), or convenience (while shots are not exactly convenient they are only once a month vs. daily oral therapy).<p>If you have frequent reactions, I&#x27;d say you should really consider immunotherapy. Even if they haven&#x27;t been bad enough to kill you yet, the next one can always be worse. And if you have borderline anaphylaxis, waiting to administer the epi-pen can be fatal, as it can be less effective if you wait too long. Antihistamines will not save you from anaphylaxis, as while they reduce&#x2F;mask some symptoms they do <i>not</i> treat the specific symptoms that kill you (hypotension, and&#x2F;or airway swelling leading to suffocation).

The immunity obtained by immunotherapy is not necessarily the same as natural immunity. It may not be complete and it may not be long lasting. The immune system has a long, long memory and we do not have any reliable tests to determine if anyone&#x27;s immunity is permanent. For that reason allergists recommend continuing dosing <i>indefinitely</i> to maintain immunity, and continuing to carry an epi-pen. For the rest of your life. You will get sick of peanut butter.<p>All that said, we are doing sublingual immunotherapy for our son. But I am hoping that within his lifetime new treatments are developed that will free him from allergies completely.<p>Precise control of the immune system would be the holy grail of medicine IMO. Dysfunctions of the immune system are at the root of so many diseases, not just allergies.

This therapy works by gradually introducing the allergen in controlled doses, which shifts the immune response from a Th2-dominated profile to a Th1-dominated or regulatory T cell (Treg) profile. This shift reduces IgE levels and increases the production of blocking antibodies like IgG4, leading to long-term desensitization and reduced allergic reactions.<p>In particular environmental allergens (pollens, dust mites, animal dander, molds), insect venoms (bee, wasp) may respond well to immunotherapy but we’ve had poor success or disproportionate risk attempting to mitigate food allergens (peanuts, tree nuts, and shellfish), certain medications, and latex .</div><br/></div></div><div id="40409807" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40409807" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">echelon</span><span>|</span><a href="#40408132">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40409789">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40409923">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40409858">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40409807">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40409807">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re training a different kind of immune sensitivity.

It&#x27;s also foolish and dangerous IMHO, because it greatly contributes to the very thing you want to prevent:  amplification and creation of quack science to the gen pop.<p>Simply depriving these people of airtime does <i>NOT</i> quash their views and make them go away.  It fuels conspiracy theories such as about how big pharma is censoring ideas about natural (or already highly-available) treatments in order to make billions on devoloping their vaccines and using government levers to force people to buy them.  (They did try to do that too, though they got lucky in that none of the &quot;natural&quot; treatments seemed to really work.  But had they worked, their reaction would have been the same.)<p>It also means the discussions people see are going to happen on shows&#x2F;forums&#x2F;podcasts where the host <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> push back on them and offer challenges and critical thinking.  This not only sets a terrible example for people by demonstrating through social proof that one should accept these things uncritically, but it makes it appear as though the case is very strong and there isn&#x27;t a good counter-argument!  This double effect makes a strong impression on people in the exact opposite way that we want.<p>I think Joe Rogan has done more to bring sanity to these things than most people.  Have you ever watched those episodes?  He is very conversational but if there is ever a claim that doesn&#x27;t seem supported, he will ask Jamie (his assistant or producer or whatever) look it up, and they are highly skeptical and choosy of sources.<p>We should know by now that censoring information these days does not work.  We&#x27;re no longer living in the society where the average person only gets information from TV or books available at their library or local book store.  If there&#x27;s a quack theory out there, it <i>will</i> get to people through the internet.  The answer is not to shut down the internet.  We need to expose these ideas and defeat them using logical and scientific refutation, and we need to <i>encourage</i> and teach critical thinking skills.  This is a new world we are living in, and the tried and true techniques or censoring and book burning do not work anymore.

It’s already been demonstrated that if you try to have a public discourse on this kind of stuff that bad actors will just come in and sow misinformation. Attempting to have such discourse merely elevates the legitimacy of the quack’s claims, since you can have the most detailed of detailed takedowns but be countered with literal word salad nonsense and still “lose” in the eyes of gen pop. The quack has everything to gain, because by getting into a discussion with someone legitimately qualified in a public arena they are placed on somewhat equal levels with that person in the eyes of the public. A standing in society they absolutely do not deserve.<p>By the way, Rogan himself has a few entries on Quackwatch for promoting questionable supplements that he has a financial interest in.

Even if we want to suppress untrue information, it is extremely difficult to be 100% sure what is true, and the intellectual and popular discourse requires free expression of controversial ideas. If you don&#x27;t want to have your worldview challenged, there are many ways to tune out the stuff you don&#x27;t care for. The problem we have is that the authoritarians are threatened by the fact that someone out in the world disagrees with them. They can&#x27;t handle that because their egos are too fragile.

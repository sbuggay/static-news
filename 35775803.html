One hundred eight intervention and 107 control families provided six-week follow-up information with complete actigraphy data for 96 in each group: 96.9 % of intervention and 97.9 % of control infants had an average of 2 or more nightly wakes, a risk difference of −0.2 % (95 % CI: −1.32, 0.91). 4 % of intervention and 14 % of control infants had parent-assessed severe sleep problems: relative risk 0.3, a risk difference of −10 % (CI: 0.11, 0.84-16.8 to −2.2). Relative to controls, intervention parents reported improved baseline-adjusted parental depression (CI: −3.7 to −0.4), fatigue (CI: −5.74 to −1.68), sleep quality (CI: −1.5 to −0.2), and sleep cognitions: doubts (CI: −2.0 to −0.6), feeding (CI: − 2.1 to - 0.7), anger (CI: − 1.8 to - 0.4) and setting limits (CI: −3.5 to −1.5).<p>&gt; Conclusions
The intervention improved caregivers&#x27; assessments of infant sleep problem severity and parental depression, fatigue, sleep, and sleep cognitions compared with controls.<p>This is largely true for myself - sleep training is for the parents to get some semblance of their lives back.<p>The first 3 months of my daughter&#x27;s life - i&#x27;d never been more tired in my life.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35798670" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35798670" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dalyons</span><span>|</span><a href="#35798295">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35798572">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35798689">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35798615">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35798670">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35798670">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah I read that last time there was a big thread about this on HN.

My clearest takeaways from that were that doing sleep training too early is not recommended, and that there was no observed long term difference in kids either way. And that we shouldn’t judge folk who need or want to try such things because they’re working parents, depressed, or have other family problems caused by lack of sleep.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35798615" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35798615" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">melvinmelih</span><span>|</span><a href="#35798295">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35798540">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35798804">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35798615">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35798615">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just today we were being lectured by our pediatrician that our two year old <i>needs</i> to sleep in her own bed, in her own room.

We all want to do the best we possibly can for our children, and yes, being a parent comes with a willingness to sacrifice yourself for them.<p>The problem is that those kids depend on you for more than just their need in the moment. You can sacrifice your night&#x27;s sleep for theirs, but you still need to be able to take care of them the next day and the years after that.<p>At the end of the day, only parents can decide where the trade-off is, because only they are close enough to see what the baby needs and only they know how much they themselves can give.<p>There&#x27;s no shortage of people that will tell you about The Right Way. It doesn&#x27;t really seem correlated with any kind of medical degree either. Just remember that what worked for them, doesn&#x27;t necessarily work for you.

We are all only humans after all.<p>Naturally, we have higher standards for well compensated professionals and we do expect more than platitudes from such professionals.<p>All that said, your experience does bring up an interesting point though. At the end of the day, you are the parent. As it relates to the care for your kid, you outrank them ( with some exceptions, but those usually apply for a very good reason ). They are there to help you make a good decision, but you are not bound by their words.<p>Unfortunately, like in every profession, they can be &#x27;bad&#x27; doctors or ones that don&#x27;t want to learn new things or both. Not to search very far, the sugar debate is now mainstream and doctors I talked to recently acknowledged that a lot of that word of mouth &#x27;there is too much sugar in everything&#x27; has a point to it. In their defense, there is a lot of research that supports it now, but how long did it take to make it happen?<p>&lt;&lt;  today we were being lectured by our pediatrician<p>I hear you. It is an aggravating experience and unless there is a good reason to keep that doctor, I would consider making a change. The relationship should not be an unpleasant one. In my neck of the woods, ours recommended covid shot for our kid on the basis that &#x27;everyone does it&#x27;. Before I had a chance to go on a rant, my wife simply said no.

I know it&#x27;s truism, but the sheer realization of that makes me empty and desperate (jk).<p>Just trying to simulate realism who mean you take an object in your hand in VR, and are able to examine it closely, seeing scratches or others details.<p>Of course, these details must not be made using procedural generation. That would mean going back to square 1, a superficial world of shallow details. We want details that have a history.<p>So imagine you&#x27;re able to find a way to scan these details and reproduce them in VR. You&#x27;d have the same problem at a deeper level, say using a magnifier, only revealing the void of your digital life and nothing around has meaning.<p>Say now you&#x27;re able to scan details at deeper levels, even at an infinitely deep level. You&#x27;d have to store them, and that would probably mean using more storage that they are atoms in this world, so it would be impossible, or would it? Would it be possible to compress details, or vectorize them, so that they&#x27;d take less weight that their equivalent?<p>Another problem would be details for objects that exist only in VR. Here again, these details would need to have a history. That scratch would be here or there and in that shape for a specific reason. That would require a deep understanding of physical laws, and being able to reproduce them at infinitely smaller levels. And store them here again.<p>So I guess that makes the whole task impossible. I guess it&#x27;ll never be possible to transfer your soul into VR, and even if it were, you&#x27;d become crazy realizing your world is limited, not by the geographical limits you&#x27;re bound to, but by the depth of details you&#x27;d be able to explore.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38286196" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38286196" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">patcon</span><span>|</span><a href="#38287056">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38287116">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38286196">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38286196">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I love this, but I also feel they&#x27;re valorizing the high resolution simply because it&#x27;s their particular interest.<p>In some fields, what they are speaking about is called &quot;fine-graining&quot;. Looking up at the bigger picture is called &quot;coarse-graining&quot;. Moving up and down between the levels, and bringing learnings between levels, that&#x27;s where the work is. No one place of focus is better, as each environment can always change. Attention exists to hopefully guide us to the right level. I&#x27;d say we&#x27;re not &quot;built for high-res&quot;, because it&#x27;s the moving between that keeps our attention from getting stuck at one specific level of abstraction :)<p>There&#x27;s a great quote by supreme court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes that feel related to the crux of this stuff:<p>&gt; For the simplicity that lies this side of complexity, I would not give a fig, but for the simplicity that lies on the other side of complexity, I would give my life.<p>The &quot;simplicity on the other side of complexity&quot; is the coarse-grained explanation, the abstraction, that has done the complex consideration to collapse the appropriate aspects. We only need to fine-grain our attention to understand that appropriate reduction for the given situation we&#x27;re trying to grok. But the low-res is no less noble than the high-res, so long as you or someone else has done the hard work of finding the right abstraction... :)</div><br/></div></div><div id="38286716" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38286716" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ryanjshaw</span><span>|</span><a href="#38287116">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38286194">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38286716">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38286716">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This seems to be an article written for neurotypical people and I envy them somewhat in this respect.<p>I live my life in the detail and while it has benefits for my career, it has been a source of exhaustion and frustration when communicating with people who don&#x27;t live in the details i.e. the majority.<p>It seems much easier to live at the high level and choose to drill down into the details than to live in the details and remind yourself to step back, but I could be wrong.<p>For example: I edited this brief comment 8 times.</div><br/><div id="38286921" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38286921" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">movpasd</span><span>|</span><a href="#38286716">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38286194">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38286921">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38286921">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a non-neurotypical person myself, I sympathize with your feelings on the article, and felt them myself when reading it.

You think your memories and imagination are ethereal abstractions that have no meaningful size or resolution? False. Your memory and even thought takes up physical space in your head and whatever that physical space is it can be no smaller than the planck length. This limit puts a full stop on even the most ethereal abstraction you can think of.

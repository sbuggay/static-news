Writing shouldn&#x27;t be limited to experts, as long as person clearly identifies what it is and what it isn&#x27;t. Both in the title and introduction of article it clearly says that it is experience of person who is new to field. Which to me implies that whatever they are saying should be taken with grain of salt and that they might not have exhaustive or fully accurate knowledge. It doesn&#x27;t claim to be &quot;ultimate reference book for everything hardware&quot;. That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that that&#x27;s experience they got as beginner. It&#x27;s up to you decide whether reading beginners experience is useful to you.<p>On the other hand it also means that the problems person encountered are likely nothing extraordinary. And that it&#x27;s something other beginners should watch out and further research, as they are likely to encounter similar challenges. Beginner articles can also be useful for those who have no idea where to start as means to gather keywords for further reading.<p>Having beginners share their experience might not be useful for most experts. But it can be helpful to highlight common pain points and areas of potential improvements for educators and people making tools.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38226857" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38226857" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">davidhyde</span><span>|</span><a href="#38227787">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38228524">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38226857">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38226857">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This article initially upset me because it muddied my hardware honeymoon memories and attacked my perceived future.

While I&#x27;m not sure to what level their experience was, I can share the many times I&#x27;ve tried to answer a hardware question in many forums , I found the the individual who was asking was just looking for a quick working solution to their design idea (mostly a school project) and not really willing to take input on how to figure the solution out themselves. Many became hostile when I would not provide the schematic (with calculations) for them. That got old fast and convinced me to not try to help out any more.

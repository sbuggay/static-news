The analysis assumes all Alice&#x27;s light is emitted radially exactly outward from the center of the black hole. In reality, light is emitted in all directions, and anything emitted at even slightly different angles would get sucked into the black hole. But, Bob might still see it, because he can catch up with it. So when the article says Bob sees Alice cross the horizon when Bob crosses the horizon, it really means that Bob won&#x27;t see any photons they emitted from inside the BH until Bob crosses into the BH. But similarly, one second prior Bob will be encountering photons Alice emitted roughly 0.99 seconds prior to crossing the horizon, and so on, because those are all getting redshifted too.<p>It&#x27;s similar to if you and the car in front of you are accelerating at the same rate, they have a small head start, and they&#x27;ve got someone throwing fastballs at you at 100mph. When you get to the point where you are going 100mph relative to the ground, you&#x27;ll hit the ball that was thrown from exactly that spot relative to the ground. So, sure, crossing the 100mph barrier implies something interesting mathematically, but it&#x27;s not something that the observer would particularly notice. The math for GR isn&#x27;t exactly the same (baseballs won&#x27;t redshift), and in particular there isn&#x27;t even a piece of dirt to compare the photon&#x27;s motion to, as the horizon is just a mathematically-defined &quot;place&quot;, but to a first-order approximation, it&#x27;s the same thing going on with photons and spacetime distortion. It&#x27;s a continuous function.<p>There&#x27;s a bit more to it than can be explained in a comment, but the main thing to know is that (as far as we know) nothing special happens at the horizon if you&#x27;re falling in.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42300501" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42300501" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kobalsky</span><span>|</span><a href="#42300199">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42301866">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42300838">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42300501">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42300501">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">this is my uninformed guess.<p>why would bob see anything?

In that regime black hole horizons do have bumps raised on them: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Y1M-AbWIlVQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Y1M-AbWIlVQ</a><p>The black holes can&#x27;t rip apart though: everything inside stays inside.<p>I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t figure out what you&#x27;re talking about in terms of frozen in time, time dilation, or atoms compacting.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42302261" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42302261" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mtdewcmu</span><span>|</span><a href="#42301702">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42302043">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42301219">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42302261">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42302261">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Let&#x27;s see if I can state this properly.

We know the current semiclassical understanding of gravity is incomplete, but near the event horizon of black holes, QFT+GR are sufficient to model the physics. It&#x27;s only at the Planck level that the math stops working, due to UV divergence. And under QFT+GR, the math shows that black holes can form, that objects can pass the event horizon from their perspective, and the black hole will evaporate later. Not much has changed since the 70&#x27;s there.<p>Now, it&#x27;s entirely possible that a complete theory of quantum gravity comes out and upends our understanding of what happens everywhere in space, including at event horizons, and perhaps it&#x27;s the case that black holes are never formed. But to date, a fully consistent theory of quantum gravity has yet to be created. But just saying &quot;assume black holes don&#x27;t form, and all contradictions go away&quot; by itself doesn&#x27;t really help, because that just says get rid of GR and&#x2F;or QFT, but doesn&#x27;t say what to replace them with, beyond &quot;something that doesn&#x27;t produce black holes&quot;. Which, sure, would be great, but the devil is in the details. The more important thing to most people in the field is solving the UV divergence problem anyway, which will answer in detail questions about Planck level effects. Whatever comes out of that will (hopefully) unfold naturally into the answer to the information paradox too.<p>As far as the final question, nobody knows. That said, care is needed when describing events from different perspectives. The principle of relativity isn&#x27;t that all observers agree on all events. It&#x27;s that physics is the same in all frames of reference. Which is nuanced: what does one mean by &quot;the physics&quot;? In essence, it&#x27;s a layman&#x27;s statement of Noether&#x27;s Theorem, relating symmetries and conservation laws. So, depending on quantum gravity&#x27;s symmetries, different observers could see wildly different sequences of events, but they would agree that the conserved properties of the theory were indeed conserved. But until such a theory exists, it&#x27;s anybody&#x27;s guess as to what those symmetries actually are.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42302078" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42302078" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">af3d</span><span>|</span><a href="#42301042">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42301678">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42302546">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42302381">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42302078">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42302078">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Somewhat tangentially, what really perplexes me about Hawking radiation (HR) is this: What happens to the individual particles within the black hole as it evaporates?

But this seems to break down when it comes to black holes (it also breaks down in the various magical collapse interpretations of quantum mechanics, but the quantum wavefunction itself is also time-reversable)</div><br/><div id="42307673" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42307673" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">af3d</span><span>|</span><a href="#42301042">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42305028">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42302554">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42307673">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42307673">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; But basically the entirety of physics works in a time-reversible fashion: if you could flip the direction of all the particles in a system, it would evolve back to its previous state<p>What does that even mean though?

So, absent of measurement or some kind of collapsing of the wave function, pure quantum states are 100% reversible. So the question is, where does the transition happen from the quantum world to the world we know. Whence Einstein&#x27;s question about &quot;when I stop looking at the moon does it disappear&quot;. So far, nobody knows. So far, we haven&#x27;t observed any limits to how big a pure quantum system can get, and there&#x27;s no &quot;spontaneous&quot; collapse if we don&#x27;t measure something.<p>So the question is, could a pure quantum state model a meteor crashing into Earth? It doesn&#x27;t seem like it. Friction, heat, and so on cannot be reversed classically. The question of Schrodinger&#x27;s Cat even becomes moot because in an isolated system, the processes a body requires to sustain life (such as friction and heat) can&#x27;t be modeled in the first place, so the cat will turn into a sloppy goop before anyone pulls the trigger. So, what&#x27;s going on? Why does quantum mechanics seem to model everything that happens in the microscopic world, but in the macroscopic world we see things that it can&#x27;t? Where does that crossover between microscopic and macroscopic occur? If measurement is what causes quantum wave collapse, then would none of this happen if nobody was there to measure it? And what created the measurers? 99 years since Schrodinger&#x27;s equation, and we&#x27;re not particularly any closer.<p>Black holes also seem to violate reversibility. They absorb information, but the radiation they give off is random. So, it&#x27;s impossible to perform the process in reverse. This is spooky in a different way than the above because it&#x27;s purely mathematical. For &quot;regular&quot; micro&#x2F;macro quantum&#x2F;classical paradoxes, we&#x27;re generally talking about the classical realm of experiments. But for black holes, it&#x27;s pure math, of our two fundamental theories of nature, and showing that they don&#x27;t line up.

This is on the same order of magnitude as a supernova, as it is equal to the collapsed core of the star being converted into pure radiated energy!<p>An infalling observer accounting of the mass-energy flows must match this external view point.

How do you square the emphasized part with, &quot;Once the trapped region is formed, continued collapse is inevitable&quot;?  You should also note that your picture in your paragraph starting &quot;Infalling observers...&quot; is very different than theirs.<p>And then this choice statement and your previous paragraph in mixed order:<p>&gt; That was 37 years ago!

This was a nice way of saying that your &quot;relativity does <i>not</i> allow observers to disagree on observations of <i>what</i>&quot; is just wrong.<p>I gave you a google scholar link to the 37 year old paper paper so that it would be clear anyone with a slightly different academic background (and I hoped  you) that it&#x27;s a foundational <i>theory</i> paper. Frolov is the well-known author of two standard textbooks on the physics of black holes (with Novokov and with Zelnikov), both of which deal with Frolov&#x27;s 37-year-old paper in the context of evaporation and of different observers counting different particle numbers and how that an acceleration between past and future observers accounts for Hawking quanta.  Both Frolov textbooks appear early on the first page of google scholar results.<p>(The 37-year-old concern is especially funny.  Frolov&#x27;s 21st century textbook, like practically all textbooks on gravitational phenomena and theory, even reference papers which are now more than a hundred years old, oh no!  Choosing a recent GR textbook -- Carroll 2014 -- the author lists under Advanced General Relativity: Hawking &amp; Ellis 1973, de Felice &amp; Clarke 1990, Sachs &amp; Wu 1977; and in the Graduate section: Wald 1984, MTW 1973, Weinberg 1972, ...)<p>&gt; modern (2024-era) numerical methods<p>which are built to be compatible with ... what?

That&#x27;s 39 years ago!  &quot;We have performed an extensive series of tests [including] known perturbation solutions.&quot;)<p>One more kick at the ridiculous dead horse: at the bottom of p. 17 one finds, &quot;We are not the first to propose a picture like the one presented throughout this section. As far back as theoriginal discovery of the Hawking effect, similar ideas were invoked in [4], and by various comments of [2, 3]&quot;.  The dates of those are respectively 1974, 1975, and 1976.  Oh no!<p>Could it be that among the &quot;one or two things about black holes since then&quot; that &quot;We&quot; may have &quot;figured out&quot; is that early theory papers (the 80s are not early) turn out to have good support in things like astrophysics, magnetohydrodynamics, gravitational wave observations, Hulse-Taylor &#x2F; PSR J0737â3039 etc. etc.?<p>- --<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.aps.org&#x2F;125years" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.aps.org&#x2F;125years</a> but uh oh that was 2018 and surely the list would be totally different now!</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

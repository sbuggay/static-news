One thing I distinctly remember was when I tried to write JCL to move some datasets. Took me 2 days reading documentation and trying out things. Finally I just gave up. It is not fun when you have noone to help and Google isn&#x27;t very helpful. If you think Unix tools have no consistency, try JCL and z&#x2F;OS. Considering how alien JCL is and magic incantations I invoked with it, I&#x27;m convinced that there is Cthulhu in the mainframe machine.<p>Still, I&#x27;m quite proud I manage to write some JCL which saved us potentially days of manual work.<p>Other things I remember from that time was that passwords were only 8 characters long and case insensitive. My guess is z&#x2F;OS is secure only by its obscurity. Though maybe this was just our installation. No idea until today.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42538571" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42538571" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">donatj</span><span>|</span><a href="#42538672">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42519237">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42538571">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42538571">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Recently saw an AS&#x2F;400 on Facebook Marketplace. I was very tempted to pick it up, but I am trying to reduce AND knew dang well I would have no idea how to interact with the thing.<p>I recall in about 2009 working on a project where the clients inventory system ran on an AS&#x2F;400 and I knew literally nothing about IBM mainframes at the time. All we wanted was them to publish a simple JSON API we could poll hourly to update the front end we were building. In a conference call with umpteen of their engineers, they basically told us that was impossible. I thought this was ridiculous, but they were insistent.<p>Their counter proposal was that they would automate emailing us updates and we could parse and process those. I still have no clue how that could be easier for them but it sure would have been more work and infrastructure for us!<p>Eventually after literally weeks of back and forth they finalized landed on letting us use FTP to read hundreds of XML files they would generate nightly. They were often mildly malformed&#x2F;improperly encoded. It was simpler to deal with that than ask them to fix it. It was not a very fun project, but a major learning experience looking back.<p>I was a young hotshot who had only recently been promoted to lead developer, and having to interact with these people who clearly thought I was dumb for not knowing anything about IBM mainframes certainly knocked me down a peg. Kind of humbling to see you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know once in a while.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42519237" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42519237" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thrtythreeforty</span><span>|</span><a href="#42538571">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42538374">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42519237">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42519237">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a great missing manual for z&#x2F;OS tinkering (in the past I have also given up at the login prompt as the author said).

All sorts of weirdness by modern standards.  Also common at the time was record-oriented files, which are accessed not byte by byte but in a more structured manner.  For example records might be 80 characters at a time, corresponding to a punch card image.  Record oriented files naturally lend themselves to primitive but fast databases (evolved out of records on punch cards) and that&#x27;s why mainframe OSes supported them.  Similarly, file systems in those days were considered significant overhead so there&#x27;s provision for raw access by sector so apps can roll their own file systems if necessary.   z&#x2F;OS handles all these odd cases still.  And all this needs to be specified in a command language that could be parsed in like 24 KB or however much RAM it was that OS&#x2F;360 was originally designed to run in...<p>As the article says &quot;file&quot; is technically not the z&#x2F;OS term - they&#x27;re data sets.  That might give a hint as to just how divergent z&#x2F;OS is from just about everything else.<p>&gt; well Linux is just as complicated.<p>Linux has less baggage, probably.  Also the &quot;worse is better&quot; philosophy of UNIX kept things like quasi-database services out of the OS, for the most part.   For comparative purposes check out VMS; it has some of these same features like record-oriented files in a (relatively more) modern design.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m seeing no compelling reason for a developer to bother to learn or use z&#x2F;OS.<p>Don&#x27;t worry your vision is just fine. ;)</div><br/></div></div><div id="42538329" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42538329" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">timewizard</span><span>|</span><a href="#42519237">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42538058">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42538040">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42538329">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42538329">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; why creating a file takes a page of options?<p>You&#x27;re really creating a member of a data set.  What you get is far more flexible than a file but equally more complicated.  The options come in handy when you&#x27;re sequencing job steps together,  as they let you specify sharing, cataloging, and automatic deletion under one or more specific types of job results.<p>&gt; whereas IBM seems to be making no effort to bring z&#x2F;OS to the public, so why bother chasing it?<p>It&#x27;s a valuable and interesting part of computing history and understanding it&#x27;s workflows gives good insight as to why many organizations continue to use them.  They fill a very unique use case and exploring that is very interesting and enlightening.<p>The core concepts haven&#x27;t changed in 70 years.  You can even play with them today since a previous OS,  MVS,  was released publicly,  and has been maintained as an open source project in recent years.  If you get the Hercules emulator you can run a fully legal mainframe OS distribution right out of the box.<p>It&#x27;s a great gas.

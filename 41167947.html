But it seems the key invention here is some camming system that automatically increased the braking force as speed increased. So this system supposedly did not require a brake booster as part of the hydraulics.<p>I wonder what prevented this camming innovation from being transferred to the more conventional drum brake of the time?<p>I&#x27;m not an engineer, but I do have some wrenching hours under my belt. I see a flaw in the design: The two halves of the drum are held together by machine screws&#x2F;bolts. The braking pressure from the pads is applied directly to these screws. If they are not properly fastened, or if they are loosening over time, then braking force will be directly impacted. A failure could result in a total loss of braking ability. A conventional drum or disk brake is kind of fail safe in that regard: The mechanical pressure from the brake pads is not transferred through any fasteners. I see this design less resistant to poor maintenance practice. Maybe they somehow accounted for this and the article failed to mention it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41168323" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41168323" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xkzx</span><span>|</span><a href="#41168573">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41168413">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41168323">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41168323">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Looks more like a typical manual car clutch setup, but interesting anyhow.

Discs built into the hub (so you need to disassemble wheel bearings to take the discs off) or even worse, Jaguar&#x27;s inboard rear discs (reduced unsprung mass, but you needed to remove the driveshafts and they were buried in the middle of the car). Lots of premature optimization went on.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

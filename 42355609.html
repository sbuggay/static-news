The Ryukyuan languages aren&#x27;t all that different from Japanese in the first place, and the Ainu were subjected to forced assimilation that has made many ethnic Ainu unable to speak the language, and while I&#x27;m not sure of the speaker count in the 1940s, I doubt it was that high. While their imperial possessions at the time would have included lots of other ethnicities, incorporating Korean or Chinese code talkers wouldn&#x27;t have been that helpful (not that hard to find people who speak those languages), and the size of their Pacific Island groups would have likely struggled to produce enough adequate code talkers. Although the institutional racism of the country was probably enough to forestall any plans in the first place.<p>It&#x27;s also worth pointing out why the use of Navajo code talkers was so successful. Part of that is that it&#x27;s from a language family that was poorly known by linguists at the time. But even within that language family, Navajo is pretty different (compare how different English is from other Germanic languages, or indeed most Indo-European languages). It&#x27;s also a fiendishly complex language; like, there&#x27;s no regular verbs--that would make attempts to crack it via standard cryptanalytic techniques rather more difficult.

They tended be private about their culture - there were aspects that were for them not for us, sometimes plainly and other times more subtly. Dine sometimes had that feel, like it was a private name amongst themselves, not a public name for outsiders to use. In other ways it was similar to German vs Deutsch, just a different word in a different language.<p>It is more recently that some Dine activists have cast off the name Navajo as colonial and wish to be referred to as Dine, but as far as I can tell it still isn&#x27;t the majority opinion.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42382640" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42382640" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gerdesj</span><span>|</span><a href="#42382081">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42383373">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42382708">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42382640">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42382640">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;The Navajo are speakers of a Na-DenÃ© Southern Athabaskan language which they call DinÃ© bizaad (lit. &#x27;People&#x27;s language&#x27;).

Both the mention of them coming together when he returned where &quot;the ghosts will be laid&quot;. And also the mention of &quot;there was no âIâ in his war, only âweâ. We&#x27;re stuck in such an individualist culture where we&#x27;re told to work hard to stand out, and seem to be shamed if we&#x27;re weak and in receiving help from others.<p>2) Words as metaphors. Beautiful examples given in the post, but we should remember the roots of many of our words are also metaphors. My favorite being &quot;persona&quot;[0], coming referring to an actors mask that air goes through. Helps remind me that we&#x27;re always actors in the world, not some defined Self we&#x27;re stuck with. Good book[1] on that topic from Jay Garfield.<p>3) Explanation at the end of his &quot;Navajo Code-Talkers uniform&quot;. Mentions that yes, it&#x27;s more than ok to imagine clothes as images and have meaning beyond &quot;something to wear for efficiency&quot;. The Emerald podcast talks about these things, both ornaments in general from human history [2] and more specifically about guardians [3] which is what he considered the Navajo colors were for, to protect him.<p>The similarity of all these cases, to me, comes to they&#x27;re not all thoughts he had in his head as words, which is what we&#x27;re told to do from the smallest of ages. We&#x27;re told to think hard, and use words (like I&#x27;m doing here) to be smarter than others. When looked at, words and thoughts are nothing compared to the experienced feelings that come from community, imaginal metaphors like hopping rabbits that leave tracks in the snow, or looking at colors you&#x27;re wearing and feeling protected.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Persona" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Persona</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;press.princeton.edu&#x2F;books&#x2F;hardcover&#x2F;9780691220284&#x2F;losing-ourselves" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;press.princeton.edu&#x2F;books&#x2F;hardcover&#x2F;9780691220284&#x2F;lo...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.themythicbody.com&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;universe-adorned-ornament-culture-cosmos-consciousness&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.themythicbody.com&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;universe-adorned-ornam...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.themythicbody.com&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;guardians-and-protectors&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.themythicbody.com&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;guardians-and-protecto...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42385047" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42385047" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">new_vienna</span><span>|</span><a href="#42383380">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42383312">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42385047">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42385047">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;257&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;257&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42383312" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42383312" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shiroiushi</span><span>|</span><a href="#42385047">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42383312">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42383312">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s too bad there were never any good movies made about the code-talkers.

See also: Lysenkoism in the USSR, EU’s model of funding startups through grants.<p>I honestly think this one of the things the US does way, way better than other developed countries. We pay a price in cronyism and corruption, but we actually let industry experts with real experience both advise on policy and take key government positions.

They are investing their time and effort in the expectation that there will be significant returns in the market.<p>The Canadian entrepreneur problem is the TSX problem: it&#x27;s a struggle to convince oneself to invest in Canada, because generally the returns are lackluster. Rail, Banks, Oil and Gas are the consistent winners, all well-connected and deeply rooted, and rare is the startup that becomes a star on the TSX.<p>It&#x27;s not that there isn&#x27;t enough starving and unemployed talent, it&#x27;s that there&#x27;s something about Canada that suffocates and debilitates small and medium companies.</div><br/><div id="37973397" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37973397" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sidkshatriya</span><span>|</span><a href="#37971521">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972404">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972876">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37973397">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37973397">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  it&#x27;s that there&#x27;s something about Canada that suffocates and debilitates small and medium companies.<p>On the face of it, Canada should be a hotbed of entrepreneurship. The country has full access to the US market, has a good standard of living, has capitalism with good social nets, has great rule of law, well educated residents, allows qualified immigrants...<p>Every major economy is aging. Surely this cannot be the answer why entrepreurship in Canada is down.<p>Also, I object to the metric of entrepreneurs as a percentage of population used in the article. It is about how many successful companies are being born. You could have a very high entrepreurship rate with a high failure rate or you could have a low entrepreneurship rate with a high success rate. At the end it is the product of the two i.e. sustainable, successful businesses born per year that is a better metric. We also need to take future profitability and future-impact into account. Giving birth to one OpenAI per year is arguably better than getting 100 new dry-cleaner businesses per-year.<p>The article could have been better.</div><br/><div id="37973717" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37973717" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">raverbashing</span><span>|</span><a href="#37971521">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37973397">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972876">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37973717">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37973717">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes but, thinking about this:<p>Canada sells and sees itself as the good boys.

I mean, they are ready to go through whatever inconvenience a big corp may force them into, and still be fine about it. To Canadians, it&#x27;s just the way things are, inevitable evil. At the same time, an entrepreneur frequently starts by targeting a market niche and offering better quality or better service or a novel way of doing things. However, a market niche assumes that there are consumers with a niche demand. But if consumers are undemanding and are OK with keeping paying for something subpar, this leaves us with not so many market niches and thus opportunities.<p>At the same time, doing business is great in Canada. The tax system is simple (just 3 taxes). Reduced tax rates for small businesses. Registering a business can be done online for a small fee. The banks are OK. Abundance of decent business-related services - accountants, designers, etc. It&#x27;s relatively easy to sell to the government. Finding a good lawyer is a tough problem, though.

In 2015 you could have purchased a home in New Brunswick for $25,000..<p>Your 1.1 million dollar home you buy today will be worth 5 million in 50 years at least 2 million in 20 years.  Still as good of an investment as ever.<p>It&#x27;s like bitcoin sure it would have been great buying coins for 5 cents and today and you would be a billionaire but you weren&#x27;t able to make that bet.  If you want to buy at the 5 cent level you need to find another coin because that opportunity passed.  You weren&#x27;t able to buy a home in 2010 or 1947 so you are never getting those prices again.  You can buy today but don&#x27;t expect the same prices on the same properties as if you lived in the past</div><br/><div id="37972923" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37972923" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zinodaur</span><span>|</span><a href="#37971685">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972682">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37973232">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37972923">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37972923">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">yeah, but in 1975 the average household income was 50k.

My current employer is currently contracted for the federal government and it&#x27;s painful to do anything.<p>Just an example, I put in a request to order a $40 network module to replace a failed one. On our side it&#x27;s already painful enough, I had to get approvals from 3 different managers that have to align all of the budgeting before bringing it forward to the federal government&#x27;s representative for approval. The rep in tern has to bring it to his bosses for approval as well.<p>Typically this takes 12 weeks but this was put in as a critical priority because this was impacting about a hundred people. Probably costing the federal government (cause they&#x27;re footing the bill) about $12,500 a week in lost productivity because our teams can&#x27;t do their job properly. Thus their director got to it in a blazing fast 4 weeks.<p>$40 part. $50,000 in lost productivity because they couldn&#x27;t get a $40 approval for done faster then 4 weeks.<p>The other anecdote I&#x27;ve had is with the Canadian Firearms Center in Miramichi. For those that are unaware, Canadians are required to be licensed under a federal program to own a firearm privately. Miramichi handles much of the paperwork for firearms registration. This was a while ago but last time I saw, they were still manually entering in data from paperwork but also from electronic submission as well. Stuff that could be readily automated and something I demo&#x27;d in an afternoon.<p>As it turns out, the inefficiency is intentional because there&#x27;s a very real fear among the line staff of job reductions if they get too productive per person. And there&#x27;s not many jobs in Miramichi that pay as well as the federal government (or at least that was the case when I was visiting there probably 20 years ago). So unfortunately there is justification to be as inefficient as possible. But it&#x27;s always left me wondering how much how much further this attitude extends to other government departments.</div><br/><div id="37973501" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37973501" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BeefWellington</span><span>|</span><a href="#37971685">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972335">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972722">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37973501">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37973501">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ll two-up you:<p>I&#x27;ve worked at two very large tech companies in the past.

The cost to build the program should&#x27;ve been $119 million, with fees covering $117 million. The cost that the auditor general found was $140 million registration fees trying to cover $1 billion in costs that she could account for at the time. Didn&#x27;t help that her team didn&#x27;t have time to crunch the numbers. CBC went in and estimated that it was closer to $2 billion dollars[2].<p>The program was already controversial in the first place, but the problems just kept getting problem after problem thrown at it. In protest a man named Brian Richard Buckley sent in firearms registration for a Black and Decker soldering heat gun. There were already huge error rate in the registry at the time; something like 70% error rate of licenses and 90% error rate for registrations but that little stunt he pulled revealed a much deeper problem occurring. I can&#x27;t find the article anymore but the backlog had become so severe that the staff were instructed to no longer validate any of the information they were getting, even if it didn&#x27;t make sense.<p>All that to say that say, if things were being run inefficiently intentionally, that probably would&#x27;ve just given even more opposition even more ammunition to embarrass the government at a time when they were already taking a beating about the mismanagement of the new firearms program.

Most of it is fantasy. Canada&#x27;s social service programmes are really not great when compared to European social democracies; welfare and disability payments are actually quite low, and we have pretty bad homelessness in our major cities. Canada is no Scandinavian social democracy. It&#x27;s really just a fusion of aspects of both the UK and the US.<p>Universal healthcare is good but it&#x27;s been underfunded for decades, slowly coming apart, and inconsistent across the country.<p>Public education is <i>definitely</i> in a better state than the US, though. And I&#x27;d argue our higher education &#x2F; university system is superior in both cost and quality. So far.<p><i>Culturally</i>, Canada might be in a better state. The culture wars not as pronounced (depending on where you are). Abortion rights etc. mostly a given. Gay marriage and rights pretty much unassailable at this point. Legal cannabis, etc. etc.<p>But in terms of bread and butter supports for regular working people, it&#x27;s not that great. Though of course, again, the health care thing is a big caveat. US healthcare is great if you&#x27;re upper middle class, wayyyyy better than anything you&#x27;d get here. But the average working class person is definitely better off in Canada compared to the US, on the healthcare front.<p>Anyways, housing prices here are way worse (relative to earning potential) than any American city other than I guess Manhattan, at this point.

I think another crucial aspect is that the Canadian population is only 10% of the US, and the variation among states here is just like Canadian provinces or even countries in the EU. The US is very decentralized, and one of its secrets is that during times of great internal division the federal government becomes paralyzed while the states becomes empowered, and conversely during times of national unity the federal government can move mountains while the states take a back seat. Currently it’s a paralyzation moment, but that doesn’t really prevent anything from moving forwards as the system is pretty decentralized and individual-focused already.<p>On the healthcare aspect, there is no doubt the poorest people in Canada are the EU are treated better than the poorest in the US. I do have a suspicion that as the universal systems reach a breaking point they start to look a bit more like the US - where people pay more if they use more - to encourage better economization of scarce healthcare resources. I have heard some really fucked stories of cancer treatment delays leading to death which I don’t think is as common here (they will treat you in the US, but you might go bankrupt). It’s like, would you rather be rationed and die or get treatment and be bankrupt?

Toronto is as big as Chicago, and the population density in southern Ontario is as high as any of the US eastern states, and mostly contiguous with them and part of the same shipping routes, etc. etc..<p>It&#x27;s a population clustered near the border and really should be seen as one that is culturally and economically contiguous with the US, just not politically. In terms of <i>metropolitan regions</i>, much of Canada is really much the same as the US.<p>On healthcare &#x2F; public services, I will give you examples of where the US liberal biases about Canada just don&#x27;t line up.<p>At the tail end of the COVID-19 crisis, spring 2021 I went across to go skiing with a friend from Albany. I needed a test to get back across the border to get home. I was able to just go to a US pharmacy and get a molecular test for free, with almost instant results. I was told that if I tested positive I could get anti-virals, for free, immediately, without even showing citizenship.  Meanwhile in Ontario all public testing for COVID-19 was cancelled before the end of 2020. My elderly parents in Alberta just tested positive but had to fight to get anti-virals because despite being 1 year shy of 80 they didn&#x27;t qualify unless they had pronounced comorbidities. So... a country without a universal public health care system was able to offer  much better universal coverage (where it mattered) than here.<p>Another example: say you wanted a blood test for your kid to test blood lead levels. No doctor will offer that here, really. You&#x27;d have to really lobby for it and have a serious acute reason for it-- despite all the older cities here being full of lead pipes. I was down in the Finger Lakes a few years ago and there were signs for public clinics all over offering this as a free service.<p>It is by no means a black and white situation.

I’ve had a lot of ideas in my adult life that I felt passionate about, but doing business here is remarkably unrewarding. I can do what I enjoy and I’m good at with an American company for 2-3x what I’d realistically earn here working at least as hard on my own business.<p>I’ve consulted for several Canadian tech companies and their finances often seemed remarkably poor. I know some are doing well; I’m more so speaking about “regular people” businesses. Small private companies with staff around 10-20 people.<p>They work really, really hard for their incomes and the rewards really aren’t what you’d expect. This seems true outside of tech as well.<p>My wife works for the federal government on the other hand. She earns much less than I do, yet still dramatically higher than the average for our city and the rest of the country. She also has generous time off, training, an excellent union, interesting work, etc. Why in the world would she start a business? She actually could, too. She’s an awesome hydrographer with cutting-edge skills and knowledge. But she’d have to work herself to the bone if she went private and she’d have to work in wildly different and less comfortable contexts. And for what? 1.5x the income? 2x? After that’s chewed up by taxes, she has traded her family life for a career that barely pays more when you do the quantitative and qualitative maths.<p>Yet I think this is a huge problem. It isn’t really wise to work hard and innovate here, and I think it’s actually harming our workforce and economy quite seriously. Look to many countries and you can quickly point at many past and recent innovations and core competencies. But what do you see when you look at Canada? There’s certainly less, and seemingly less all the time. Our small population is a huge disadvantage here, but we have such immense opportunity for innovation.<p>I do think we innovate in extractive industries. We do a lot of environmental research around our primary industries, and that’s very valuable. Economically though, I don’t know… We aren’t much of a land of opportunity these days, and it doesn’t seem like much is happening to reverse this trend.</div><br/><div id="37971964" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37971964" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacquesm</span><span>|</span><a href="#37971330">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972660">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37971964">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37971964">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This isn&#x27;t Canada per-se but more of a SV versus the rest of the world (with a few other small exceptional pockets).</div><br/><div id="37973426" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37973426" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">logicchains</span><span>|</span><a href="#37971330">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37971964">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972575">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37973426">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37973426">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Only if you consider &quot;rest of the world&quot; to mean Europe + English speaking countries.

(A significant amount of said bureaucracy is private industry, but yes, most public qualifies too).<p>3. Internet access is controlled by a small group of monopolies who manage to (largely) keep access costs above anywhere else in the world, largely - and definitely higher than most of the USA.<p>4. Shipping is largely controlled by either US monopolies that aren&#x27;t reliable, safe or consistent, or Canada Post who&#x27;s been eroded repeatedly by Canadian Conservatives favouring their US friends.<p>5. US protectionism results in some businesses - especially supplies - either being shut down or bought up and moved US-side or the like.   This one goes back a long ways, but Conservatives provincially and federally have escalated it every chance they have.<p>In short - if your business idea requires a storefront, you&#x27;re likely paying 2-10x housing rent (or more), and your home will be 2-10x what it was renting for 1-3 years ago.   Business rents go up arbitrarily without any ability to negotiate (as the people renting out control it).   Household rent goes up arbitrarily, largely due to same.  While I&#x27;ve not seen direct proof, there are signs most real estate is either owned by foreign (eg USA based or other) for (artificially inflated) investment, tax evaders or money launderers.
Canadian real estate isn&#x27;t worth the price attached almost anywhere - especially when one qualifies that outside of some specific areas, it&#x27;s colder than most other places in the world.<p>At the end of the day it&#x27;s still possible, but if I could find a path to get a simple product to market without being swamped by amazon (and its cartels of forgers and thieves - most third party) or similar across other markets ... I would have long ago.<p>There&#x27;s one more cost of entry - NIMBYism and city zoning.

That is not aligned with entrepreneurship. Our culture is very poorly suited to it.<p>I know because I am one of those people.<p>For example, I have participated in numerous entrepreneurship accelerator programs, as have my friends. How many of us spent any time on our companies after finishing the accelerators? Zero. I know people who put the winning of 200K on their resume, went to get a corporate job, and just returned the 200K in prize money later, as the purpose of the prize was to be publicly named as winning the prize. This person now works for RBC as a software developer.<p>I won 20K with a friend a few weeks ago for our startup (which was generated just for the competition). We intend to hand the money back at the progress deadline, as he is a new grad and it helped him to get a job.<p>Canadians are also very suspicious of people who do go into business for themselves. American companies will hire entrepreneurs. Going to YC is not a career derailer. In Canada, we would assume that if you started a company that you couldn&#x27;t find a job. I have been in the (virtual) room as resumes are tossed as the hiring manager assumed &quot;Co-Founder&quot; was just a synonym for unemployed.<p>Anecdotally, Canadians need more money to work for a startup, not less as in the USA. Americans take pay cuts to work for startups in the hope of a giant return. Canadians demand a pay premium to work for a startup, over say RBC.<p>The other issue is that Canadian consumers also do not take risks. We don&#x27;t try new products or switch suppliers. Consider our high internet costs.

The conditions have been far from favourable for years in Canada.  Real estate is simply too expensive.  Sure commercial real estate for the plant or office or whatever facility you need is outrageously expensive, but then, when you wanted to hire somebody or try, they need to pay rent or a mortgage.  People aren’t demanding outrageous wages because they suddenly think they’re worth it. They just know how expensive it is to pay the bills and groceries.<p>Government policy, both the conservatives and the liberals, are very cosy to large corporations.  Most of their announcements, that supposedly help small businesses are simply far out of reach due to requirements for revenue or number of employees, and is essentially corporate welfare.  The BDC and EDC are a joke, both crown corporations run by people very disconnected from any sort of reality.<p>Of course it was driven by interest rates, but the insidious thing about interest rate is it allows zombie corporations.  These organizations that should’ve gone out of business being acquired or shut down, but because of their size and revenue were able to continue to borrow more and more and more money at extremely low interest rates.  of course it’s coming to an end now as financial reality hits. Many of these companies are forced to cut, but they were actually hopelessly dysfunctional so over time though finally either just be bought or go to business.<p>all of this to say, the last 20 years has been a terrible time to start a business in Canada but a lot of markers are indicating things could be getting better soon.  While it may be good for somebody starting a business isn’t good for necessarily the average person.<p>anyway, the thing I find absolutely laughable is that we need more education for entrepreneurs.  The funniest thing I’ve read all year.  there is no education that will make someone an entrepreneur, but someone may learn enough to be scarred out of taking the plunge.<p>finally, the idea that there’s a single definition of Canadians is completely stupid and misinformed.  culture varies dramatically from coast to coast and from the south to the north.  if someone thinks that nobody wants to work, or nobody wants to make money, it speaks about the people that they associate with not the country they live in.  I think that is true most anywhere.</div><br/><div id="37972761" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37972761" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cmrdporcupine</span><span>|</span><a href="#37972048">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972951">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37972761">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37972761">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yours is the most reasoned comment here, thank you. And you&#x27;re right to point the finger at both major parties.<p>While I agree that there&#x27;s no single definition of Canadian, I do think there&#x27;s a particular Canadian sickness that seems to think that policy that benefits and protects existing established interests is good policy.<p>Example: local rural zoning laws here in Hamilton area were being revisited some years ago. I live on a small farm so went to the sessions and read the documents, etc. And I have an interest in the wine industry, so noticed that in the bylaws they went out of their way to explicitly forbid winery development in any area but an area east of the city (towards Niagara.) Why? When I asked the zoning officer at a public meeting, she just stared at me blankly: &quot;Because that&#x27;s where the wineries already <i>are</i>.&quot;<p>She wasn&#x27;t corrupt. She wasn&#x27;t stupid. She didn&#x27;t care about the issue. But the thought that you might want to craft regulation in such a way to leave things open for <i>new</i> entrants and possibilities was ... confusing to her. But why <i>would</i> you close off a whole agricultural area to new developments like that? I don&#x27;t get the mindset, but I see it all the time. Maybe because we&#x27;re so used to being squashed by the US that we feel we have to protect the successes that we have? Bizarrely though we have very intense <i>internal</i> protectionism.<p>I see examples of this all over the place. From Alberta&#x27;s recent moves against the burgeoning renewable energy sector, to Ontario wine regulations, to the way the telecomms sector is run nationally, to the way grants and incubators etc are set up.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37972951" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37972951" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">FpUser</span><span>|</span><a href="#37972048">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37971980">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37972951">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37972951">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This article is such a load of BS (bar couple of sound points).

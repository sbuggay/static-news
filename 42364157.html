Like many other people, I largely stopped contributing to open source years ago because people don’t respect boundaries. If you point out that they are not respecting boundaries, many will try to argue that they are entitled to this behavior because reasons.

The new Redis license seems like it would be a non-issue for most users but because they had a more liberal license before and it was taken from them, they feel irrational sense of loss? (I realize there are also valid reasons why the BSD license was objectively better than the new custom license, like the ease of compliance.)<p>So maybe what Redis should have done is not to pull the existing rug, so to speak, but to leave it be and lay next to it a new, better rug and offer the users sitting on the old rug to move over, if they find the new features of the new rug outweigh the drawbacks of a new license.</div><br/><div id="42396711" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42396711" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">akalsey</span><span>|</span><a href="#42395955">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42396613">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42397347">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42396711">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42396711">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My wife runs an estate sale company, helping families dispose of property.

Almost all of them really, lately. So although they don&#x27;t have a boss (irt the software), they&#x27;re desperate to impress, and to please, and to network, and they feel a lot of pressure. Every request is like a demand, so when those requests are petty, or entitled, or feel like a nuisance, it&#x27;s like they have a <i>horrible</i> boss that&#x27;s yelling at them and trying to destroy them. They&#x27;re terrified of a fork; it&#x27;s like everybody getting up and moving to another table in the cafeteria when all you want them to do is like you. Also, it&#x27;s a lot of work, and can stack up, and you&#x27;re doing it for free as basically specwork. They also half the time have to do their real jobs that actually feed their kids, unless they can work on FOSS that their job is willing to pay for.<p>They shouldn&#x27;t do it for free, they should use every means and trick available to make it worthwhile for them to do and to get themselves paid. They need to survive <i>for</i> FOSS, for the software. Which means that they have to make sure the license is open and the source is available, and that it&#x27;s <i>ethical</i>, because that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s worth fighting for. So everything that&#x27;s ethical and open, very preferably GPL, do. If you have to write closed software to get yourself paid for your GPL software, do it. Eventually you can open that closed software up too, when (and not before) you can afford to. All FOSS licenses have different business implications, and ultimately income implications.<p>Morally, it&#x27;d be better if there were no software copyrights and everybody was allowed to inspect and modify all the code that they interacted with, and we all shared. You also have a moral obligation to feed yourself and your family and not go nuts, though, to have some security.<p>If you&#x27;re not one of those people, and it&#x27;s just a hobby and a charity thing for you, that&#x27;s wonderful and ideal, bless you. You may have already made all your money. If you have to make a living from it though, don&#x27;t let yourself be bullied into compliance and submission to the users because you need them to like you, to get work, to survive. Do whatever you have to do to be self-sufficient. It&#x27;s hard out there, and you might have to be hard. Not <i>mean</i>, just firm about the amount of care and interest you have about individual strangers&#x27; problems with what you gave them for free.<p>You can leave a lot of people disappointed that they&#x27;re not going to get more from you for free, yet still be <i>ethical.</i> Being ethical, being open, leaving people in control of their devices and in control of their lives, that&#x27;s the point. Keep ethics at 100%, and put pleasing the <i>most</i> people as a (far) lower priority than paying your rent, and taking a vacation every once and a while, with the kids, and having health insurance.<p>Taking care of yourself means more FOSS in the world, more people free of black boxes in more areas of their lives.

The comparison point for me would be 1920s Europe - in hindsight it seems likely they&#x27;d have had a lot of telegraphing in advance that things were about to go really badly wrong - disasters of the magnitude that engulfed them aren&#x27;t easily missed. The average person wouldn&#x27;t have been aware of it because the lack of an internet would have resulted in an insanely biased view of the data being presented that probably obscured just how bad things were getting. Today we have a much better level of information access available.<p>The answer in the 1920s if you can see the 1930s and 1940s coming wasn&#x27;t go local, it was some combination of fortify, fearmonger and&#x2F;or flee. People needed to be alerted that the situation was really bad and immediate action was required at all levels to avert disaster - but action wasn&#x27;t taken and we saw an economic crisis unfold, followed by a military one.</div><br/><div id="42355380" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42355380" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tpmoney</span><span>|</span><a href="#42354306">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42355123">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42354738">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42355380">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42355380">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The point appears to be that even if most people in 1920&#x27;s Europe could have seen all the telegraphing, how many of them could have done anything to make a difference for their given situation? How many people do we think were realistically in a position to make a change to the economic conditions and still uninformed? How many were in a place to make a change to the military conditions and similarly uninformed?<p>Hind sight is 20&#x2F;20, and its easy knowing a massive war was coming to say people should have been getting the hell out of Dodge. But moving your entire family to a new country let alone a new continent is a massive undertaking. How many people even if they had the warnings would have pulled the trigger on that move rather than wait and see? What sort of huge, global war scale negative things are being telegraphed today and what major life altering decisions on the magnitude of leaving your entire community and extended family behind and seeking asylum in a foreign country do you foresee yourself undertaking to address them in response to your unprecedented levels of modern awareness?<p>Or does your unprecedented access to that information simply make you feel helpless and hopeless? Are you actually better equipped to attend to the impending doom or do you just know that it&#x27;s there. One wonders if we had the ability to know the exact month and year we were going to die, would we think our lives were made better by knowing that, or would we find that having that knowledge does little to change the quality of the life we live in any positive way, and largely adds stress or other negative experiences.

It is hard to evaluate counterfactual but it is certainly plausible that if they&#x27;d actually understood how dire the situation was from better information the course of events was changeable. There are a lot of 1&#x2F;10,000 people out there. It really is just a game of convincing a few of them to behave sensibly and they move mountains politically.<p>I&#x27;d suggest that from your perspective it isn&#x27;t the information making you feel hopeless, your starting point is that of helplessness and hopelessness and the information is just making that more apparent.

But this simply accelerates the fragmentation we have seen in society, for how can you ever have empathy with others if you refuse to appreciate the suffering of anybody but yourself and what immediately affects you?<p>Maybe instead of sticking our heads in the sand, we should be taking this as a wakeup call that us trying to solve these problems will help not just our planet, but our own mental health and will be necessary to have a healthy populace going into the future.</div><br/><div id="42354473" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42354473" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lolinder</span><span>|</span><a href="#42354435">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42354586">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42354473">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42354473">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; how can you ever have empathy with others if you refuse to appreciate the suffering of anybody but yourself and what immediately affects you?<p>Anecdotally, I have not observed an increase in empathy from people who immerse themselves in negative news about faraway places. There&#x27;s sometimes an increase in the <i>performance</i> of empathy—you&#x27;ll see them bemoan the various crises, you&#x27;ll see them wonder aloud how anyone can go about their lives while ${STUFF} is happening—but I haven&#x27;t observed an increase in their ability to actually be empathetic to the perspectives and needs of people closer to home.<p>If anything it&#x27;s the opposite: the more immersed someone is in tragedies and crises on the other side of the planet, the more aggressive and thoughtless they are in response to hot topics locally. Instead of slowing down and developing empathy for those who disagree with them, they lash out. It&#x27;s like being immersed in extreme crises they can&#x27;t control causes them to perceive their local crises as more severe than they actually are and triggers fight or flight, which actually <i>stands in the way of empathy</i>.</div><br/><div id="42354600" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42354600" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Dalewyn</span><span>|</span><a href="#42354435">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42354473">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42354586">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42354600">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42354600">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Dunbar&#x27;s Number[1] could potentially be playing a role.

In a nutshell, there&#x27;s this weird tension between being kind of dismissive of it due to failed personal expectations, but also a desire to be as objective about it as possible, a &quot;fear of missing out&quot; if you will.  As such I consume news about AI and engage with the &quot;community&quot; online about it, but I struggle constantly between separating noise from signal, &quot;truth&quot; and bullshit.  It&#x27;s not so much that bad news gets me down so much as the fact that sensationalist hype and bullshit makes me irrationally upset.<p>The whole OpenAI strawberry thing is kind of a great example.  There was vague hype and speculation about it months before it was actually released, and in the end we got a model that is objectively impressive when it comes to benchmarks and is objectively better at certain tasks, but otherwise in my mind fell way short of the expectations being set by more &quot;enthusiastic&quot; commentators.<p>Now, normally if someone is prone to hype and sensationalism on the internet one would typically learn to ignore them and preserve your mental health, problem is that sometimes OpenAI employees (and other employees of frontier labs) can&#x27;t resist making sensationalist claims themselves, i.e. claiming that we&#x27;re a couple of years away from AGI or whatever.<p>On the one hand, it&#x27;s a smart and reasonable thing to bet on expert advice, on the other hand, the experts are making very bold claims that I just struggle to see coming to fruition.  The idea that you could simply scale an LLM until we achieved AGI always felt a little suspect to me.<p>Curious to see how others have felt about this.</div><br/><div id="42355304" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42355304" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neoconomist</span><span>|</span><a href="#42354578">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42353945">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42355304">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42355304">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The experts are often the ones most likely to be paid to lie.

Stop worrying</div><br/><div id="42354481" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42354481" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BoxedEmpathy</span><span>|</span><a href="#42354338">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42354423">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42354481">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42354481">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For me, none of that stuff bothers me. What gives me the social media heartbreak is seeing the hate. Seeing commenters get so upset with each other over misunderstandings and miscommunications.<p>I&#x27;ve tried completely avoiding comments, and I admit it makes my life less stressful, but it feels like closing your eyes to solve littering.<p>So now what I do is try to assume every positive commenter is a human and every negative commenter is maybe a LLM&#x2F;hatebot. This has given me just enough magical thinking to avoid the stress but not so much as to distort my world view... hopefully..</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42354423" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42354423" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lakomen</span><span>|</span><a href="#42354338">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42354293">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42354423">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42354423">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And what about all those murder movies, the horror movies, the gun shooting movies, the extortion murder rape kidnapping etc, crime in general, intrigue, blackmail, scheming?
We have a subscription to a package that has a lot of US content. HBO, Fox aka Star Channels.
80s &amp; 90s movies were better, happier.
The mood is mostly dark and dire nowadays.<p>And then there&#x27;s &quot;news&quot;, if you can even call it that anymore.
Mostly political propaganda, hate mongering and FUD.
I&#x27;m in a good mood, then I read &quot;the news&quot;.
I had a time where I completely ignored them, that was after 9&#x2F;11 and my mental health was superb.
But nowadays the planet is on fire and everyone in power is just starting more fires.
But &quot;the news&quot; are also pushing a certain mindset, at least in Germany, although there isn&#x27;t much difference between the outlets.
They all just more or less copy paste the same sources.
Paranoid schizophrenic mindset mixed with some Russian hate and foreign hate and radical right normalization.</div><br/><div id="42354508" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42354508" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Mountain_Skies</span><span>|</span><a href="#42354423">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42354293">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42354508">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42354508">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Don&#x27;t know how it is in Germany but in the US, it&#x27;s hard to escape the reach of &quot;the news&quot;. You can choose to not go to news sites and not turn on news channels but news feeds are everywhere and tv are in public places blasting out the fear or outrage of the moment. It&#x27;s difficult to not end up passively consuming it against your will. Even setting up a new Windows Server box will end up with MSNBC in your face because the first time you open a browser, that news feed is going to be featured on the default home page. You might have been trying to set up a new document server for the accounting department but now your brain is hijacked by the latest details of fighting in Syria. It really is pervasive.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42354297" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42354297" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">srslyskptcl</span><span>|</span><a href="#42354314">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42354297">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42354297">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So impressive the way MIT adds to the depth and breadth of human knowledge.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

At this stage, authorship becomes universal.<p>&gt; The ability of readers to create links allows annotation by users of existing data, allows to add themselves and their documents to lists (mailing lists, indexes, etc). It should be possible for users to link public documents to (for example) bug reports, bug fixes, and other documents which the authors themselves might never have realised existed. This phase allows collaborative authorship. It provides a place to put any piece of information such that it can later be found. Making it easy to change the web is thus the key to avoiding obsolete information. One should be able to trace the source of information, to circumvent and then to repair flaws in the web.<p>It envisioned some kind of a collaborative web where readers were also publishers, but it didn&#x27;t go into much detail. AFAIK this phase was never completed, and IMO this is a major reason why the web is so centralized today, why users have no control of their data, and why it&#x27;s primarily aimed towards consumers.<p>Had publishing content been as easy as consuming it was from the start, there would&#x27;ve been more tooling built around this concept, and publishing content would&#x27;ve been as easy as consuming it is today. I.e. we would have had publishing equivalents of web browsers, instead of web servers that are only meant for the technically literate. New web users would be educated that the web is a collaborative tool, and not just for consumption, and they would&#x27;ve had tools that would allow them to share their data in a granular way. This would&#x27;ve avoided the need for early web hosting services like GeoCities to exist, ISPs would&#x27;ve had to provide symmetrical internet connections, and the modern web landscape would&#x27;ve been very different.<p>This is something that TBL is trying to correct with his Solid project, but I think it&#x27;s too little, too late, as that ship has long since sailed. The current way the web works is so ingrained in culture, and giant tech corporations now define its direction, as long as it benefits their bottom line. Easy web publishing is _still_ not native to the web, and users have to rely on 3rd parties.<p>Opera had an interesting project in 2009 with Unite, which allowed publishing right from the browser, but it went nowhere for some reason. The modern decentralized web movement, a.k.a. &quot;web3&quot;, is too focused on the technology instead of the user, and I don&#x27;t see it gaining mainstream traction.<p>In many ways I&#x27;m disappointed with how the web turned out. It&#x27;s ruled by corporations, government agencies, and advertisers. It&#x27;s hostile to the user on every turn, and it&#x27;s literally impossible to navigate without software that blocks ads and trackers, which tech corporations are also actively fighting.<p>The sad part is that I&#x27;m not sure what the solution might be, or if there is one at all. All signals seem to point to an even more encroaching and hostile experience in the future.</div><br/><div id="38660169" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38660169" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">somat</span><span>|</span><a href="#38659814">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38661774">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38660169">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38660169">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the problem with that proposal. also the problem with Ted Nelson&#x27;s xanadu. and why the web was so successful are malicious actors, these can come in the form of antagonists and trolls but most often appear in the form of marketing. Most designs for information systems fail to account for malicious actors(the web is included in this category). and those that do, fail to get popular, mainly because secure systems are unpleasant to use.<p>The web is resistant to this despite not being designed in a secure manner because all graph traverses are one way, the owner controls all outgoing links.

The problem is that the Web was prototyped on a NeXTCube, and nobody could run it because nobody else had NeXT machines.  Most people&#x27;s exposure to the Web was through the linemode browser or Mosaic, and neither one implemented the full range of functionality that WorldWideWeb.app did (including content authoring).  Andreessen reportedly did want a way to do annotations in the browser but it didn&#x27;t happen precisely because the only way he could think to do it was by coordinating everything with a centralized service.<p>As for linking specifically, early versions of HTTP had a LINK method, but it was underspecified and eventually removed in later revisions of the standard.  If you operate the server, though, you can make it support whatever methods you want, so there&#x27;s no reason people couldn&#x27;t take matters into their own hands and bring it back so long as they&#x27;re able to figure out how it should actually work.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38660999" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38660999" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">_factor</span><span>|</span><a href="#38659814">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38661774">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38660539">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38660999">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38660999">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If only IPFS worked a little bit faster.

See as an example the difficulty in a grid with distributed renewables or how long websockets took to come along. Consider even an economy: you bring simply money to the store, not goods that you&#x27;ve created to barter, because of the complexity in figuring out the value of the offered goods, the cost of the negotiation, and potential mismatches in needs.<p>Maybe, just like with the electrical grid, we can start to get more creative now that the costs of &#x27;the usual way&#x27; are more well-known and can start being internalized instead of externalized - this is the case with air pollution and carbon for our electrical grid, for instance, which is helping to drive distributed generation.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38661558" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38661558" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bruce511</span><span>|</span><a href="#38659814">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38660320">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38661598">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38661558">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38661558">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would argue that we -did- get this, and where it was implemented it is almost universally terrible.<p>For example the comments section on any blog or video. Most of it is bland, chunks of it are spam.<p>Example 2 are the services that explicitly all people to write content. Facebook, Twitter etc. It&#x27;s a giant mess of mostly-terrible content. In some cases created with the explicit intention to cause harm.<p>Wikipedia is the opposite, mostly good, but largely because an enormous community spends countless hours undoing the work of bad actors, and effectively censoring most bad behaviour.<p>That the Web does not live up to some ideal is not the fault of Netscape or Mosaic. It&#x27;s not the fault of Facebook. It&#x27;s the fault of the people using the Web. It turns out there are plenty of us, willing to spew out mindless opinions (including this one) all night long.<p>Prior to the endless September it was possible to &quot;educate&quot; folk to the etiquette of the internet. But that education had a really narrow target market, and didn&#x27;t scale. Once Joe Public arrived there was no way to &quot;educate&quot;, nor was it desirable to do so.<p>People are people. Don&#x27;t blame the Web. Blame the people using it.<p>(And, anecdotally, if early users had had the opportunity to edit my Web pages, that &quot;feature&quot; would have been turned off almost instantly.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="38661598" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38661598" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jayd16</span><span>|</span><a href="#38659814">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38661558">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38661394">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38661598">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38661598">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think this is actually achievable with tech we have today.

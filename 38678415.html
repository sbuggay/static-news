That&#x27;s weight &amp; mass. But that mass usually has so much cost. (And it has so many inconveinences. Where do the pipes and wires go when you are working with stone? It&#x27;s not accommodating like framing &amp; drywall.)<p>This is so cool. This is so so so cool. It&#x27;s cheating, getting one of the best &amp; nicest things you can get, and doing it not by just cladding your world in thick concrete, but by creative use of negative spaces. By resonance. It&#x27;s a vast <i>unmaterial</i> triumph. Using much less matter but getting so many of the same upsides.<p>This is the arch of victory that embodies what I hope can carry us through the stars for a long time: getting so much from so little. Making stuff that is blisteringly effective. These are the triumphs that can sustain us as we voyage on.<p>(It also looks like something that would be pretty easy to mass produce!

We are technically capable to produce silent cars, yet we somehow try to workaround this by building houses of different materials? How backwards that is instead of just legally limiting the sound levels for newly produced cars. And eventually cars will have only rolling noice.<p>But then someone would say oh but then cars are dangerous when they are silent, let&#x27;s install speakers in them so pedestrians can hear approaching car and move out of the way. See what&#x27;s happening here? Instead of jus making a car unable (auto breaks) to hit a pedestrian, we are doing some silly workarounds (ok, no silly but cost saving) to emit noise and shift the burden of moving out of the way to the pedestrian.

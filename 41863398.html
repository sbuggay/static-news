This especially made clear that np.gradient wasn&#x27;t suitable, because it resulted in erratic switches between zero and the calculated derivative.

Let&#x27;s dream up a little use case:<p>Imagine you have a speed sensor eg. on your car and you would like to calculate the jerk (2nd derivative of speed) of your motion (useful in a range of driving comfort metrics etc.). The speed sensor on your car is probably not all that accurate, it will give some slightly randomly wrong output and it may not give that output at exactly 10 times per second, you will have some jitter in the rate you receive data. If you naiively attempt to calculate jerk by doing central differences on the signal twice (using np.gradient twice) you will amplify the noise in the signal and end up with something that looks totally wrong which you will then have to post process and maybe resample to get it at the rate that you want. If instead of np.gradient you use kalmangrad.grad you will get a nice smooth jerk signal (and a fixed up speed signal too).
There are many ways to do this kind of thing, but I personally like this one as its fast, can be run online, and if you want you can get uncertainties in your derivatives too :)</div><br/><div id="41864859" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41864859" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pm</span><span>|</span><a href="#41864206">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41864688">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41865843">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41864859">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41864859">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;d been researching Kalman filters to smooth out some sampling values (working on mobile: anything from accelerometer values to voice activation detection), but hadn&#x27;t got around to revising the mathematics, so I appreciate the explanation.

The output of a controller is measured, a function is applied to it, and the result is fed back into the controller. The output becomes self-balancing.<p>The applications in this case involve self-driving cars, rocketry, homeostatic medical devices like insulin pumps, cruise control, HVAC controllers, life support systems, satellites, and other scenarios.<p>This is mainly due to a type of controller called the PID controller which involves a feedback loop and is self-balancing. The purpose of a PID controller is to induce a target value of a measurement in a system by adjusting the system’s inputs, at least some of which are outputs of the said controller. Particularly, the derivative term of a PID controller involves a first order derivative. The smoother its values are over time, the better such a controller performs. A problem where derivative values are not smooth or second degree derivative is not continuous, is called a “derivative kick”.<p>The people building these controllers have long sought after algorithms that produce at least a good approximation of a measurement from a noisy sensor. A good approximation of derivatives is the next level, a bit harder, and overall good approximations of the derivative are a relatively recent development.<p>There is a lot of business here. For example, Abbott Laboratories and Dexcom are building continuous blood glucose monitors that use a small transdermal sensor to sense someone’s blood glucose. This is tremendously important for management of people’s diabetes. And yet algorithms like what GP presents are some of the biggest hurdles. The sensors are small and ridiculously susceptible to noise. Yet it is safety-critical that the data they produce is reliable and up to date (can’t use historical smoothing) because devices like insulin pumps can consume it at real time. I won’t go into this in further detail, but incorrect data can and has killed patients. So a good algorithm for cleaning up this noisy sensor data is both a serious matter and challenging.<p>The same can be said about self-driving cars - real-time data from noisy sensors must be fed into various systems, some using PID controllers. These systems are often safety-critical and can kill people in a garbage in-garbage out scenario.<p>There are about a million applications to this algorithm. It is likely an improvement on at least some previous implementations in the aforementioned fields. Of course, these algorithms also often don’t handle certain edge cases well. It’s an ongoing area of research.<p>In short — take any important and technically advanced sensor-controller system. There’s a good chance it benefits from advancements like what GP posted.<p>P.S. it’s more solved with uniformly sampled data (i.e. every N seconds) than non-uniformly sampled data (i.e. as available). So once again, what GP posted is really useful.<p>I think they could get a job at pretty big medical and automotive industry companies with this, it is “the sauce”. If they weren’t already working for a research group of a self-driving car company, that is ;)</div><br/></div></div><div id="41864699" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41864699" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">uoaei</span><span>|</span><a href="#41864206">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41865843">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41866406">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41864699">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41864699">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Basically, approximating calculus operations on noisy, discrete-in-time data streams.</div><br/><div id="41864883" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41864883" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pm</span><span>|</span><a href="#41864206">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41864699">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41866406">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41864883">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41864883">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is what I was thinking, but stated much clearer than I&#x27;d have managed.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41866406" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41866406" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">marmaduke</span><span>|</span><a href="#41864206">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41864541">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41866406">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41866406">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is really nice approach.

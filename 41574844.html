And the share of the workforce has fallen even faster, as the actual manufacturing has moved towards higher value items and greater degrees of automation.<p>The last part is missing something important though. If we&#x27;re measuring &quot;output&quot; in dollars and the US is doing the parts (like aircraft manufacturing) that globally don&#x27;t have a lot of competitors, the high &quot;output&quot; is from high prices rather than high production, and then what we&#x27;re doing is surviving in the markets where there isn&#x27;t a lot of competition and getting killed in the markets where there is.<p>There are three problems with this. The first is that it implies the US isn&#x27;t competitive in competitive markets, which is a sign that something is very messed up. The second is that the markets where other countries aren&#x27;t competitive tend to get eroded over time. The US essentially had a lock on the auto market in the mid-20th century; not anymore. What happens when China starts making globally competitive aircraft?<p>And the third is that supply chains matter. If you give up on the low margin stuff instead of figuring out how to make it competitively domestically (e.g. via automation) then foreign competitors have a leg up when it comes to making the high margin stuff for which the commodities are inputs.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think the government applying such levers to change how the market allocates capital probably won&#x27;t be a win for economic output or quality of life.<p>Relying on &quot;free markets&quot; actually requires free markets. If other countries are willing to subsidize their industries until they drive manufacturing out of the US, that&#x27;s not a free market. It&#x27;s the equivalent of a monopolist using dumping and tying to leverage their existing monopoly into new markets, but with a country acting as the monopolist and therefore being exempt from antitrust enforcement.<p>Doing the same thing in return is not likely to be an <i>efficient</i> strategy, but neither is the status quo. The main alternative would be to realize that the thing we&#x27;ve been calling &quot;free trade&quot; is not actually that and a country that subsidizes its industries until its US competitors exit the market has to be dealt with as an abusive monopolist, e.g. via tariffs and similar policy levers, since antitrust laws don&#x27;t apply to foreign governments.</div><br/><div id="41580075" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41580075" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bluGill</span><span>|</span><a href="#41575039">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41579627">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41580156">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41580075">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41580075">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We are not only measuring in dollars.

In addition to the usual causation vs correlation dilemma, in economics you can even have what looks like reverse causation that goes back in time, because intelligent actors anticipate the future.<p>(Silly example, if there&#x27;s a clear sky, and you see many people carrying raincoats and umbrellas, it&#x27;s likely to rain later.

(See eg how Amazon or Tesla or even Microsoft took ages to return capital to investors, but still had enthusiastic shareholders.)<p>I don&#x27;t know specifically about packet switching, but you hear similar arguments about the invention of the computer.<p>In our reality, programmable electronic computers owe a lot to government and specifically military funding.  But as a thought exercise, perhaps you can imagine an alternative history without WW2: IBM already made computing devices for business long before the war, and it&#x27;s relatively easy to see how they would have eventually come up with a programmable electronic computer.<p>Compare also Konrad Zuse&#x27;s work in Germany:<p>&gt; After graduation, Zuse worked for the Ford Motor Company, using his artistic skills in the design of advertisements.[14] He started work as a design engineer at the Henschel aircraft factory in Schönefeld near Berlin. This required the performance of many routine calculations by hand, leading him to theorize and plan a way of doing them by machine.[21]<p>&gt; Beginning in 1935, he experimented in the construction of computers in his parents&#x27; flat on Wrangelstraße 38, moving with them into their new flat on Methfesselstraße 10, the street leading up the Kreuzberg, Berlin.[22]: 418  Working in his parents&#x27; apartment in 1936, he produced his first attempt, the Z1, a floating-point binary mechanical calculator with limited programmability, reading instructions from a perforated 35 mm film.[14]
Zuse Z1 replica in the German Museum of Technology in Berlin<p>&gt; In 1937, Zuse submitted two patents that anticipated a von Neumann architecture. In 1938, he finished the Z1 which contained some 30,000 metal parts and never worked well due to insufficient mechanical precision. On 30 January 1944, the Z1 and its original blueprints were destroyed with his parents&#x27; flat and many neighbouring buildings by a British air raid in World War II.[22]: 426<p>&gt; Zuse completed his work entirely independently of other leading computer scientists and mathematicians of his day. Between 1936 and 1945, he was in near-total intellectual isolation.[23]<p>In our real history, the US and UK armed forces came first, but a world with more resources in the hands of the private sector (and also with less war) would have surely accelerated some of these private computing experiments (IBM or Konrad Zuse or someone else), and we would have seen computers at roughly the same time as in ours, or perhaps even sooner.<p>Similarly, the real history of packet switching is heavily intertwined with some US government projects.  But even just browsing Wikipedia <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Packet_switching" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Packet_switching</a> tells you about other attempts and projects going on around the same time.  So the government&#x27;s investment probably did not speed up things by that much, even before you consider that in our counter-factual the private sector would have more resources.</div><br/><div id="41581442" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41581442" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">woodruffw</span><span>|</span><a href="#41575039">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41580766">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41581293">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41581442">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41581442">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I know, imagining things is hard.

They also could just be outsourcing invoicing while CSR is a local provider.<p>Manufacturing is a simple concept that is heavily politically pushed. The other departments that are needed to support products seem to be ignored. ML has a great likelihood of perpetuating this with real-time vocal transitioning.

When it is not present, margins are higher and people get much less value for the dollar.<p>Right now, big grocery is wanting to do one more merger to basically put Krogers in charge of grocery stores, with its competition being Walmart and maybe Amazon.<p>So far, each merger has reduced the number of products available to people and higher prices.

I bring this up because I personally dislike Kroger and it is all about the much lower value per dollar.<p>How this all goes is political.

Is this ok because the US mains a competitive edge in the highest value most technically advanced products?<p>As for 1), you say &quot;The net result is that US manufacturing output in real dollars has increased 4x, in the past 70 years.&quot; Are you familiar with the term &quot;researcher degrees of freedom&quot;? &quot;manufacturing output in real dollars&quot; is an impossibly complicated statistical construct with infinite researcher degrees of freedom. There are infinite opportunities for &quot;Getting Eulered&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;10&#x2F;getting-eulered&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;10&#x2F;getting-eulered&#x2F;</a>  That is why I insist on starting with the most straight-forward numbers -- how many cars? How much steel? And then layering on adjustments on top of that. If steel is down but it is compensated by some other high value product being up, OK, but <i>show me the calculation</i>, show me the work. Otherwise your argument boils down to &quot;Trust the US government&#x27;s impenetrable statistical calculations, we are getting richer comrade&quot;<p>As for 2), when I first heard that argument from the most prestigious and credentialed economists twenty-five years ago, my toys and clothes said &quot;Made in China&quot; while advanced technical products like my computer motherboard was made in the USA. Now it&#x27;s OK that the motherboards are all made abroad and because the most technically sophisticated motherboards are made in the USA. Well, it seems to me like the areas where the USA has comparative advantage in making the most technically advanced products is becoming a smaller and smaller every year. Just this year we are made aware of how much Boeing has lost ground to Airbus. Seems to USA is increasingly reliant on low-tech exports like soybeans, or worse, exporting dollar bills. It seems to me like our trade deficit is gaping wide, which means our real export is living off our status as the global reserve currency. Which feels nice until ones military might is no longer able to support that status (see 16th century Spain). Seems to me that the US is losing ground on military relevant manufacturing -- particularly drones but also steel, ships, etc. And without that, it will not be able to maintain its status as reserve currency in the long run.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41582543" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41582543" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vehemenz</span><span>|</span><a href="#41575039">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41580748">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41581161">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41582217">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41582543">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41582543">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Whether manufacturing grows, on its own or as % of GDP, has nothing to do with any particular segment of manufacturing has grown or declined, or emerged or disappeared.<p>As a thought experiment, you can do the same analysis with any number of  technologies from the 20th century—typewriters, vacuum tubes, plate-based printing presses, analog telephones—and the point is obvious.</div><br/><div id="41582770" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41582770" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chlodwig</span><span>|</span><a href="#41575039">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41582543">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41582217">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41582770">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41582770">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I didn&#x27;t include typewriters on my list of goods.

They have multiple enormous manufacturing hubs connected by high speed rail lines over a wide geographic area. The US has no equivalent to the likes of Shenzhen and Guangzhou, where you can finish a PCB design in the morning and have the prototype in hand that evening. You can go to the Huaqiangbei Electronics Market and find exactly the right motor and controller for your specs, pick up specialized sensors, and build your next rev overnight.<p>I have lived in the Bay Area my entire adult life. We used to have Halted&#x2F;HSC, we used to have Weird Stuff. We used to have Triangle Machinery Co in Santa Clara. Now everything is gone.<p>I think it’s great that we built a semiconductor manufacturing plant. That’s important for strategic manufacturing. But we’ve so thoroughly destroyed our manufacturing base, let the factories rot, and financialized property value that the “weird place with random electronics” can no longer even afford to do business. Starbucks makes more money, so in it goes.<p>US politicians love to shout about manufacturing. “Manufacturing jobs jobs economy growth.” But these people DO NOT understand how things get made. They have no serious industrial policy. They do not know the value of a high speed train connecting manufacturing centers. And even if they did, the entire apparatus of our government is set up to stop it.<p>Manufacturing workers need education. They need housing, transit, health care, maternity and sick leave. They need secure jobs and extra income that allows them time off to take classes to learn new skills.<p>I’m glad we passed the inflation reduction act, and the CHIPS act. We need that investment. But it’s going to take much more than that to “bring manufacturing back” and I’ve have seen time and time again that we do not have the vision or capability to move in the ways that would be required.<p>I hope manufacturing comes back. We desperately need it.

Secondly because I notice they&#x27;ve been careful about which of the new AI upgrades are classified as Apple Intelligence, versus those which have been packaged into iOS 18 without fanfare.<p>I&#x27;ll give an example:<p>The iOS 18 photos app, without &quot;Apple Intelligence&quot;, still has an improved search function. This is driven of course by a new AI model that tags images with more detail and fidelity than earlier iterations.<p>However &quot;Apple Intelligence&quot; also features further upgrades to photo searching where a user can request images with highly specific details, expressions or interactions.

One of the cool things about the Blue Book is that it lays out exactly how to implement e.g. graphics primitives and even the object system itself. In fact, the implementation I linked above uses the exact implementation of these things as outlined in the Blue Book, just written in Java.<p>&gt; The first thing is that the Smalltalk environment wasn&#x27;t really an operating system the same way something like Mac OS was. It’s more like an IDE that runs on bare hardware.<p>I disagree with this. It is an operating system. Just because it doesn&#x27;t have barriers like a kernel and doesn&#x27;t treat debuggers as third-class citizens doesn&#x27;t make it any less of an operating system. It just makes it &quot;not Unix&quot;. Lisp machines were also very similar in this regard: there is no &quot;system&quot; in the Unix sense: your compiler, debugger, and runtime were a whole unit and that is what you booted into.<p>&gt; The Smalltalk environment was a revolutionary GUI, but it was still a system you would have had to have been a computer operator or something to really use.<p>Probably true. But I&#x27;d also like to mention the images in the GitHub link I posted are very early snapshots of Smalltalk-80 and may lack any features that were added later. More importantly, the author is missing that these machines came with a manual that  likely described how to use the interface. But I do have have to concede: these machines were extremely expensive and definitely not targetted towards &quot;everyday people&quot;, but can we even say the same about the Lisa? I know the Macintosh was definitely designed for everyday people, but the Lisa was pretty expensive even for its time, and many attribute its commercial failure to this.</div><br/><div id="36568286" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36568286" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jonhohle</span><span>|</span><a href="#36568167">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36569314">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36568286">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36568286">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; almost nobody has a three-button mouse laying around<p>With the exception of a trackpad or Magic Mouse (or whatever Apple calls it), doesn’t everyone using a mouse have a three button mouse?

You needed an extra license for about every feature. Italic text? Get a new license, ect. This probably hindered its success as much as its – by virtue of this licensing policy ever growing – price tag. Also, the Star&#x27;s still discrete processor may have been somewhat challenged at times. On the other hand, other than the Lisa, it feature full network integration. Regarding the end user experience, it was probably noticeable different from the Lisa, as there was no drag&amp;drop and direct manipulation on the OS side of things. Rather, it was: click to select, press keyboard key to select function, use mouse to execute. Technically, the Star relied on property sheets for objects, which could be either presented as menus, button arrays or dialogs.

Moreover, numerous tours to PARC and its software had been given to outsiders before (compare A. Goldberg), some of these tours even more complete.

It was like running c&#x2F;pascal&#x2F;assembler code on bare hardware with a loader and a system library.<p>&gt; You can’t even move or resize a window by clicking and dragging.<p>The &quot;Direct manipulation interface&quot; was made popular by the Mac.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Direct_manipulation_interface" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Direct_manipulation_interface</a><p>A good idea to compare those systems is to check how early applications looked and worked.

There were many variations in how GUIs worked, some of which were minor and others of which were quite significant. None were predestined to be the final word in what constitutes a good GUI. In fact, one could argue that the Macintosh (and particularly the Macintosh of 1984) did <i>not</i> prevail. Far more people use Windows to this day, and most people will interact with touch interfaces more often than desktop interfaces. Those touch interfaces have ditched most of the traditional forms of interaction and the metaphors they are based upon.<p>As for the interface as an IDE, I think a lot was lost when the developer tools were separated from the OS. That&#x27;s not to say people should be required to use them, but the ability to probe more deeply and modify if desired is amazing. The presence of such tools doesn&#x27;t have to take away from usability either. Just consider the developer tools found in most web browsers. Everyone has those tools (at least on desktop browsers), they don&#x27;t take away from the UX either.</div><br/><div id="36569758" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36569758" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xkriva11</span><span>|</span><a href="#36568559">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36569359">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36569758">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36569758">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">An example of what was possible on the living Smalltalk-78 system: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=eEz08IlcNMg">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=eEz08IlcNMg</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36569359" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36569359" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lovelyviking</span><span>|</span><a href="#36568559">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36569758">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36569174">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36569359">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36569359">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you for your thoughts.

The Lisa and the Mac were truly revolutionary, introducing many GUI concepts that we take for granted today.<p>Another rather interesting Xerox PARC technology in the history of GUIs is the Xerox Star interface, which actually beat the Apple Lisa in releasing a GUI with a desktop metaphor.  The Xerox Star was a commercial workstation and was this one of the first GUIs that customers could actually purchase.  However, it was very expensive (more expensive than the Lisa, which failed partly due to its $10K [in 1983 dollars] price point).<p>Even though the Xerox Star preceded the Lisa when it came to the desktop metaphor, the UI would be unfamiliar to Mac and Windows users, featuring rather complex mouse and keyboard gestures to use GUI features, compared to the Lisa’s conventions, which have largely endured to this day, to the point that it shouldn’t take too long for a Mac or Windows user to learn how to use a Lisa.</div><br/><div id="36568674" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36568674" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AlbertCory</span><span>|</span><a href="#36567821">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36568174">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36568674">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36568674">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; the UI would be unfamiliar to Mac and Windows users<p>True.

Nowadays, cut &#x2F; copy &#x2F; paste have become the universal operations, and mouse button chording &#x2F; two finger press have become the equivalent of the PROPS key. Also, Star had no menu bar across the top, another thing that would be pretty confounding for a modern user.<p>That&#x27;s not to say dedicated keys were the right idea!

They are probably somewhat undeserved in the shadow of what was still early (and often inconsistent) experiments.<p>And, yes, the first commercial GUI systems were expensive, as they required fast processors and comparably lots of RAM, which was expensive. It was probably still too early for consumer oriented systems and the systems that were had to address special niches, like knowledge workers and experts. Even the Mac just barely managed a certain level of affordabilty, and this only by (initially) including just a barely viable amount of RAM.

Notably, the (in)famous PARC visit was coordinated in fulfilment of a condition for an exchange of stocks between Xerox (who had advanced Apple on the matter) and Apple, when Apple was still a private company. So Apple actually co-owned part of Xerox PARC. (In this regard, it may be even a bit ironic that the Apple delegation was shown less than what had been the usual program for similar tours, of which there had been many before this.) Nevertheless, Apple licensed quite a bit from Xerox.<p>Also, it may be important to note that the focus at Xerox PARC and Apple was quite different. If there had been inspirations initially (of course, there were), these developed quite differently, even radically so. You may also say, Xerox had a fair chance with the Star, being on the market without competition for years before the Lisa was eventually released.

The software, PostScript, of course, came from Adobe, the founder of which, John Warnock, had come from PARC.

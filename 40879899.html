Conceptual skills are cross-domain applicable and is a good measure of your ability to gain new technical skills whereas &quot;technical&quot; in the context I&#x27;m using it refers purely to your ability to pierce abstractions in the domain you&#x27;re working in.<p>eg: I would be confident stepping in as a technical manager in a software team but if I were to work in eg, aerospace, I&#x27;d still have strong conceptual skills but I&#x27;d be distinctly non-technical. There&#x27;s a pretty shallow set of abstraction layers beyond which, I just don&#x27;t have the education. If I were to go back to school for aerospace engineering, I&#x27;m sure my strong conceptual foundation would mean I could master the material 4x faster than anyone else but it would still be a lot of grinding work doing the math and using the software and building prototypes and testing so I could learn. And like, at this stage in my life, the ROI simply cannot pencil out, which is why it&#x27;s so important to build the foundation when you&#x27;re young.<p>I&#x27;d say almost every strong non-technical manager is strong on the basis of their strong conceptual skills but that still makes them a non-technical manager and there is a distinct difference.</div><br/><div id="40880535" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40880535" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fhd2</span><span>|</span><a href="#40880366">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40880452">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40880309">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40880535">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40880535">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">True!

I&#x27;ve been programming for 19 years give or take, starting as a kid I&#x27;m now 29.<p>There are many parts of software engineering in several domains that are just second nature to me at this point, I don&#x27;t think deeply about how to write or structure the code, it&#x27;s simply an intuitive action and it&#x27;s usually somewhat solid code when I finish producing it. I just write good code without having to think about how to write good code.<p>I&#x27;ve also become competent in several other domains as I&#x27;ve continued in the field and I can write good code in those domains, low level systems engineering as an example, however, I have to think through systematically how to structure the code and how to avoid memory issues etc etc. I&#x27;m competent, but it takes a bit longer and I&#x27;m actively considering structure etc, checking papers, reading docs more deeply.<p>I can say I&#x27;m competent and even good in those differing areas, but the amount of effort needed to achieve the perception of being good is a lot different between them. Some areas are basically effortless and some are effortful.<p>That&#x27;s the distinction between unconscious competent and conscious competent as I would define it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40880298" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40880298" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">teractiveodular</span><span>|</span><a href="#40880060">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40880169">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40880238">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40880177">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40880298">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40880298">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">These are the standard four stages of competence in psychology:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Four_stages_of_competence" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Four_stages_of_competence</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40880177" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40880177" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">treme</span><span>|</span><a href="#40880060">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40880169">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40880298">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40880397">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40880177">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40880177">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">having to stay conscious to do the task vs being able to do it on auto-pilot.</div><br/><div id="40880233" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40880233" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">paulmooreparks</span><span>|</span><a href="#40880060">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40880177">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40880397">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40880233">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40880233">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This concept is also covered in a Taoist story about The Dexterous Butcher: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bopsecrets.org&#x2F;gateway&#x2F;passages&#x2F;chuang-tzu.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bopsecrets.org&#x2F;gateway&#x2F;passages&#x2F;chuang-tzu.htm</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40880397" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40880397" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bjornsing</span><span>|</span><a href="#40880060">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40880232">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40880397">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40880397">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a bit hard to digest for me who have lived most of my life in a culture where technical skills are not valued but soft skills are (Sweden).

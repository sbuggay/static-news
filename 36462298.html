Not as high as climbing, I guess, but much easier to add to any day of the week for short or long runs.<p>I owned a motorcycle for some years, but then sold it. Years later, when I got diagnosed with cancer*, I broke up with my then girlfriend (not a healthy relationship) and bought a new 1000ccm sports bike. That was a big tipping point in my life. I went from depressive moments with thoughts of &quot;I want to die&quot; to depressive moments of &quot;I hate this, I want out, but I want to live&quot;. The motorcycle gives me freedom I don&#x27;t feel in a car, makes my head clear up, and I feel happier after. I guess most of the change in thought patterns was because of the Cancer looking-over-the-edge-at-death experience, but the motorcycle adds life quality in daily life that is worth the risk.

You accept a risk every time you get in a car, but you still get in a car, they are just on different levels of risk reward, what you are willing to accept for what type of reward is entirely subjective so please don&#x27;t judge others if they are happy doing what they are doing and understand the risk.</div><br/><div id="36464488" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36464488" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ke88y</span><span>|</span><a href="#36463795">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36464267">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36464575">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36464488">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36464488">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; because it can be considered a subset of trad</i><p>Yeah, this 100%.

I&#x27;m not trying to pull a &quot;no true Scotsman&quot; here, they are genuinely much different.<p>What you list are activities that have risk. But in all of these activities there are considerations to implement safety to preserve the participant as much as possible. Most of these activities the participants have multiple layers of safety in case something happens in order to minimize the risk. Sky diving, Nascar, Plane Flying, Space exploration, deep sea diving, all prepare for the worst and implement safeguards to minimize it. The risk is continually minimized.<p>Of the activities you list, trad-climbing&#x2F;sport-climbing would be the free-solo equivalent. This the relatively safe method of rock climbing that most people participate in. There is still risk and people still die. But you can make mistakes and the safeguards generally protect you from death.<p>Free soloing is a level above that. In free soloing, the risk of imminent death is a feature, not a bug. It is embraced as the core of the activity. The only comparable activity equivalent I can think of to Free Soloing is wing suit base jumping, although even that is often done with backup safety systems, so it still puts it a tiny step ahead.<p>In other words, you could think of all those activities as something people choose to do DESPITE the risks, but free soloing is done BECAUSE of the risks. That makes it very different from other adventure activities.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that the last two examples (drug running and coming clean to your mother-in-law) are just a matter of necessity and survival. While there&#x27;s technically choice in both activities, it is only done as a last resort despite the risks, which put those into a 3rd category.

Do Not Fall zones aren&#x27;t unique to free soloing. This is also true for ALL ice climbing, but also for a lot of trad and aid climbing. And even in some cases for sport climbing and bouldering. In fact, free soloing is -- for many practitioners -- a natural extension of the run-outs found on sparsely protected lines. I&#x27;ve taken more risks with my life on the sharp end than out alone. I think that&#x27;s probably true for most climbers. And the closest I&#x27;ve come to death was a stupid trundling mistake on a to-be-developed sport climb.<p>2. Life is dangerous. Free soloing a juggy ledge-strwen route below 5.5 definitely feels WAY, WAY less dangerous than the drive home. For example. You are more likely to die on the drive home. More to the point -- you are more likely to die on rappel or from rock fall.<p>3. Free soloing routes that I know up to 5.6 is no more dangerous -- for me -- than hiking on an exposed trail. And in some cases feels way safer than climbing with a rope and gear (see #1; also, climbs at that grade rarely have clean falls). I suspect that for me free soloing up to 5.9 is probably less dangerous than mountain biking or most skiing.<p>That said, the sort of soloing Austin was doing is definitely of the riskier &quot;fuck that&quot; variety. Oh, and dangerous soloing is definitely correlated with mental health events. The trope of guys doing a ton of free soloing after bad breakups exists for a reason.<p>Anyways. This is a hard topic to talk about -- especially online -- because &quot;the first rule of free soloing club is...&quot;. So you don&#x27;t have the usual &quot;first hand experience&quot; vs &quot;hypothetically thinking about this&quot; split. IMO it&#x27;s time to be a bit more open about it, particularly given the mental health thing. I spent a lot of time free soloing. Some of it was dangerous, but some of it was probably no less irresponsible than driving late at night or skiing a bit to aggressively on a groomer. The dangerous stuff happened when I was in a bad place. Let&#x27;s talk about that more.

It can be painting, mountain biking, playing piano, anything.</div><br/><div id="36463522" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36463522" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sfink</span><span>|</span><a href="#36463224">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36464410">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36463522">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36463522">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s different for everyone, but I think climbing has a bit more reason to make a claim here.

There are numerous videos of Adam Ondra, Dave Graham, etc just belaying with their hand off the brake strand, or their finger fully pushing on the cam of a GriGri while not paying out slack, and when people criticize them, other people just perform an appeal to authority and say &quot;he climbs more than you, he knows what he&#x27;s doing&quot;.</div><br/><div id="36463606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36463606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pcthrowaway</span><span>|</span><a href="#36463169">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36463348">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36463419">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36463606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36463606">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree that poor belaying technique in general shouldn&#x27;t be accepted, if for no other reason than that it sets a bad example.<p>That being said, the pro climbers can probably catch the non-brake strand of rope with their bare hands (they&#x27;re strong enough to grip the rope with their full weight on it), so if they have a hand on the rope at all, they&#x27;re probably fine whether or not the belay device is catching the fall.<p>There&#x27;s a famous situation (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;tHQh0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;tHQh0</a>) where Alex Honnold and Emily Harrington (another pro climber) were starting a simulclimb (a type of climbing where two people climb at the same time). Emily Harrington was on the wall and getting to the point where Alex would start climbing. The rope was going through his Grigri (auto-locking belay device). But Emily fell far above her last piece of protection, and the rope started to pool on the ground next to Alex&#x27;s feet.<p>Normally a climber would fall at least double the distance between them and their last piece of protection, so if you are 2 meters above your last piece, you may fall anywhere from 4-7 meters before stopping (rope stretch and the amount of rope and slack in the system are additional factors)<p>When you fall, the rope also falls, until you get to your protection and continue falling, after which it pulls the rope back up. The fact that Alex was able to react to the rope pooling suggests she was falling a pretty incredible distance, I suspect at least 5-6 meters, before reaching her piece.<p>Had Alex caught her with the brake strand, she may have fallen up to 3 times as far, possibly hitting the ground and sustaining much worse injuries or death. Instead, he plucked the rope out of the air so she fell a much shorter distance, and caught the fall with his grip strength and body weight alone.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36463419" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36463419" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">foobarbecue</span><span>|</span><a href="#36463169">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36463348">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36463606">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36463616">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36463419">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36463419">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s a good point.

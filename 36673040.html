If I sell you a book, I cannot place a restriction on that sale saying you can&#x27;t resell that book (first sale doctrine). You&#x27;re allowed to do that because you own the <i>copy</i> of the book. You can&#x27;t copy the book and sell it, because you don&#x27;t own the <i>copyright</i>, but you can sell the original copy, show it to whomever you want, etc. It&#x27;s not that &quot;copyright is okay with transitive licensing&quot; but more that &quot;copyright simply prevents you from copying a work you didn&#x27;t create (or otherwise don&#x27;t have copyrights over)&quot;. That&#x27;s all it does.<p>If you want to place downstream restrictions on your content then you have to license it (and get someone to agree to your license). You have rights over how you <i>license</i> content. Yes. And users may agree that they&#x27;re only &quot;viewing&quot; a copy and don&#x27;t in fact own it when engaging with your licensed content, sure. But my main point was that you don&#x27;t get to publish content to the public domain and then say oh wait no I didn&#x27;t want Meta to see that oops #privacy #cancelmeta. And further that it&#x27;s kinda silly to imagine a world where everyone licenses every little toot they make. At some point we&#x27;re in a public forum and we just all need to understand what that means, including that someone you don&#x27;t like might be listening.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t think licensing content is a positive thing for society. It may benefit media conglomerates, but not individuals. Arguably, creators <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be allowed to say &quot;Netflix you can stream this content to users but not in Brazil&quot;. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a sealed deal that downstream restrictions on content distribution are healthy or in any way in the public interest. Charging a royalty for a views&#x2F;streams of some show is one thing. Saying &quot;only on Tuesdays and not in Brazil&quot; gives too much control to creators to dictate how their art should be interpreted. And nobody can prevent you from using Netflix to stream a show to your Brazilian friend on the couch next to you... nor should they ever be able to. That would be really really bad technology, were it to exist.<p>So short of attaching licenses to every post you make, no, there&#x27;s not a socially healthy, let alone even viable, strategy to control content distribution in the &quot;fediverse&quot;.</div><br/><div id="36702515" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36702515" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wpietri</span><span>|</span><a href="#36699688">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36702305">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36703248">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36702515">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36702515">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; So short of attaching licenses to every post you make<p>I think you have this backwards.

How would a discussion transpire without a shared understanding of how the content is allowed to be used on any network?<p>---<p>And I mean if you really want to get into the weeds, copyright prevents you from e.g. playing a digital music file on your computer since the bytes need to be copied over the network, into memory, onto output devices, etc. This was the original observation: copyright basically prevents you from doing anything digital with any digital media. That&#x27;s why everyone needs a license and we&#x27;re in license hell. In digital it&#x27;s copying all the way down so hit it with the copyright hammer.<p>Imagine if we applied our digital understanding of copyright to traditional artwork. I have a painting. You visit. By shining light on the painting I&#x27;m reproducing the image on your retinas. You say copyright violation? I say preposterous! What if I take a picture of the painting that I own and show you? Uh oh.<p>Copyright just doesn&#x27;t make sense when applied to a public social network. At all. And it doesn&#x27;t make any sense because a social network isn&#x27;t about artists trying to make money off their works, it&#x27;s about anons trying to win internet points for the day.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36702718" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36702718" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">giaour</span><span>|</span><a href="#36699688">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36702305">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36702737">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36702567">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36702718">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36702718">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; but you can sell the original copy, show it to whomever you want, etc<p>The license associated with physical media does have restrictions.

There couldn&#x27;t be because there would be no way to economically do it.<p>Software would thus only be made by hardware manufacturers- and would need specialised hardware for every task.<p>For evidence of this alternate reality I point to an era when thus was the case. In the 60s and 70s there were a number of hardware companies who all wrote the software for their specific machines. You paid for yhe hardware, not the software.<p>This model flowed into the fame consoles of the 70s (atari, intelivision and so on.)  PCs started either this model, although software-only plays start appearing. They make money selling games, visicalc etc. Microsoft famously licenses Dos to IBM  but non-exclusivly. Suddenly hardware is a commodity and clones appear.<p>All the big companies today are software companies. The cloud is proprietary software running on commodity hardware. The ability to grow, to make big bets, to develop is predicated on the existence of copyright.<p>But wait, Linux right? That surely negates my argument. Leaving aside the distinction that it&#x27;s copyrighted, not public domain, Linux is a clone of a commercial system. That inspiration came from somewhere. It exists because Linus had a general-purpose computer, which arguably only existed because of copyrighted software.<p>Aside all that, original Linux was pretty primitive. It grew in part on revenues supplied by other software companies. While it would be fun to imagine a world with only Linux, it&#x27;s harder to imagine how that world is funded.<p>SQLite is in the public domain. Its an example of what can be done. It&#x27;s an amazing fantastic bit of software. For all that it&#x27;s built on the proprietary work of others (SQL). And it&#x27;s far less capable than proprietary database engines of the 90s (oracle, informix et al.)<p>So while I understand your viewpoint, it&#x27;s also earth noting that copyright built the world we are in now, and the alternative would look very, very, different.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36704740" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36704740" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mattigames</span><span>|</span><a href="#36699688">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36702233">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36702305">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36702634">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36704740">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36704740">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is Facebook supposed to scan all Twitter everytime you post something to check if it&#x27;s not violating the copyright of someone there?

They don&#x27;t realize that in the 90&#x27;s and 00&#x27;s free speech was a place of refuge for liberals to escape from evangelical attacks on everything from LGBT rights to Pokemon.<p>They also don&#x27;t appreciate that the &quot;come one and all&quot; nature of the internet back then led to many people crossing the fences and experiencing viewpoints they&#x27;d never seen or heard before. This is an atmosphere we desperately need to return to.<p>Present day censorship, &quot;gotcha&quot; moderation, and algorithmic manipulation of emotion have led to hyper polarization. We should 1) deescalate the intrusion of these systems and remove them from our day-to-day experience and 2) reinforce the fundamental rights we all deserve.<p>Social media networks with over 100,000,000 daily active users should not be considered as &quot;private companies with a right to free speech through censorship&quot;. They are effectively public squares that we have all elected and chosen to share. Right and left alike.<p>Public companies tend to censor to protect profits, but small individuals (such as Reddit moderators and Fediverse instance maintainers) do it from either a position of laziness or political retribution. The latter is a form of disgust and hatred for fellow humans and should be called out as such, even if the other party is guilty of the same.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the free speech argument twisted into &quot;right wing figures trying to force their views into everyone&#x27;s feed&quot;, but that need not be the case. There are tools for individuals to block. And if we&#x27;d finally divorce ourselves from platforms and federation and escape to true p2p social networking, we&#x27;d all have maximum individual control: we could institute any blocking, boosting, ingestion, sharing, and ranking criteria we wanted. Many amongst the left obsesses over what the right is doing (and vice versa), which tells me people enjoy rubbernecking rather than tuning out. It&#x27;s a game of &quot;neener-neener&quot; high school football rivalry.<p>But back to the core point - you shouldn&#x27;t get to choose who people talk to if you&#x27;re not a first party in that conversation. You shouldn&#x27;t get to choose who can publish openly or who can read public broadcasts. If you want to keep your words private, share them in private. Your choices should be limited to blocking what you personally dislike at your own consumption level, and it should be that way for everyone. Because that&#x27;s fair.<p>The pendulums of politics will swing. One day liberals will need the free speech refuge again. Preserve it now even if you want to get rid of it. Question yourself if you find yourself wanting to mute or persecute others. If you&#x27;re angry with my words right now, please ask yourself why you want the other party to shut up.<p>I want to emphasize that I do not agree with the far right. But I will fight with my last breath to preserve the right to free speech for us all. If we lose it, we will slide into tyrannical oppression from those in power.<p>I wish we could all just get along. I know that&#x27;s not going to happen in my lifetime, but we should make best attempts at deescalation and maintaining open communication with one another.

Algorithms may exacerbate the forum but plain old upvote behavior is plenty to surface it.</div><br/><div id="36706102" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36706102" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fsckboy</span><span>|</span><a href="#36699688">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36703231">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36704988">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36706102">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36706102">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>low quality pithy responses</i><p>pithy means the opposite of low quality, <i>concise and meaningful</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;pithy" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;pithy</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36704988" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36704988" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mcpackieh</span><span>|</span><a href="#36699688">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36703231">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36706102">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36703634">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36704988">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36704988">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hacker news is an algorithmically influenced discussion board, the comment voting system shared by both HN and reddit influences the way people conduct themselves, and not always for the better.</div><br/><div id="36705135" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36705135" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Karrot_Kream</span><span>|</span><a href="#36699688">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36704988">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36703634">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36705135">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36705135">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Usenet had no upvotes and still had plenty of flamethreads.</div><br/><div id="36706113" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36706113" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fsckboy</span><span>|</span><a href="#36699688">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36705135">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36703634">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36706113">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36706113">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">that doesn&#x27;t mean that voting doesn&#x27;t make the problem worse.

Moderation is a necessary precondition to any kind of online forum actually, y&#x27;know, <i>working</i> as a forum.<p>In order to actually have effective moderation, you need scarcity of identity. In a completely P2P network, you can just <i>make</i> new identities to spam people with, so blocking them has no effect. Centralized platforms have a certain magic to them in that they can make identities cost money without actually charging people for them. That&#x27;s why everything wants a phone number now - because phone numbers cost money, and they can limit sign-ups to a few per number per year. The closest Mastodon has to this is domain names, which is why defederation is the first thing instance operators run to when dealing with rule breakers.

I am legitimately curious. Email is often given as an example, but imo that a perfect example of a decentralized system BECOMING centralized. Sure, other players exist but the vast majority of people are on gmail, apple, or outlook (which is much smaller than the other two). Things tend to follow power distributions due to the momentum force being critical. In network systems (e.g. twitter,facebook,HN,email,ISPs,Walmark,etc) the utility&#x2F;value is not linearly proportional to the userbase, but super-linear (this was one of the big problems with cryptocurrencies too. &quot;Gotta have money to make money&quot;). In these systems resources are &quot;attractive.&quot;<p>So with this in mind, how is a decentralized paradigm any different than an attempt to just reshuffle the top players? (i.e. re-centralize but with a different group at the top) I just don&#x27;t see the mechanism that prevents centralization.</div><br/><div id="36701468" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36701468" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jdp23</span><span>|</span><a href="#36699688">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36701074">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36701213">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36701468">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36701468">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s certainly a challenge.

So there&#x27;s the weird dynamic that people generally have better experiences on small instances (as long as they&#x27;re well-admined) but the vast majority of the current fediverse is on large Mastodon instances.

A lot of people don&#x27;t use the word to refer to the pure sense but rather the practical.<p>A pure monopoly (a single story) is rather uncommon and usually associated with government direction. Generally these don&#x27;t exist without government intervention because if anyone is able to create a company, in any form, and sell the same product&#x2F;service (in any form&#x2F;price) then it&#x27;s technically not pure. So doesn&#x27;t happen unless it&#x27;s illegal or some other factor. Whereas an effective monopoly refers to dominance in market share.<p>The reason a practical monopoly is used is because we need to look at the reason to why we discuss monopolies in the first place. Usually it is because they are bad (but they aren&#x27;t always). The reason they can be bad is because abuse of power: they are able to dictate the market and force prices that are unreasonable.<p>So with this understanding, we usually call things like Coke+Pepsi a duopoly despite a combined market share of 68% (48% + 20.5%). Or we talk about oil despite OPEC not even being 40% (followed by Persian gulf, oapec, then US), and all of these are multiple players. Similarly we say the same about ISPs. The problem with these isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s single player control, but rather significant market share and the leverage that comes with that, which includes the ability to reduce competition and effectively cornering the market.<p>I want to give this explanation so we can discuss on the same page and understand what each other means. Because when I&#x27;m referring to email (context clues should tell you I don&#x27;t mean pure -- I mentioned multiple players) I&#x27;m referring to these companies abilities to force aspects onto others. Maybe a more clear example is browsers because Chrome&#x27;s pressure is frequently discussed here and Explorer&#x27;s previous history also shows similar influence.<p>I&#x27;m not saying decentralized services will become 100% centralized by a single player (it would be incredibly naÃ¯ve to interpret my words to mean that), but that people will collect into a small set of servers (likely seeing a power distribution) who then have a clear ability to use their leverage and dictate the format of smaller servers. Effectively this is not too different than the power that Salesforce has over Slack. While not absolute power, it is closer to that end of the spectrum than a fully decentralized system. If you make the mistake of creating two bins -- centralized vs decentralized -- you are missing the entire point of decentralized systems. At least the point that is philosophically argued.<p>Try to realize that when people are talking they have different priors than you. Language is messy and communication is about the exchange of ideas. So even if you disagree with my definitions (neither of ours are objective) you can still argue my points. Just claiming semantics is problematic because it derails the conversation or creates artificial contention.

If another instance&#x2F;admin was publicly known to comparably engage in pervasive user tracking (both on and off their own websites) and algorithmic attention monopolization, would we not expect many other actors in the fediverse to defederate or otherwise distance themselves from those practices&#x2F;that instance? Obviously, several instances have decided to do so by premptively saying they will defederate. I&#x27;m just saying that I think it makes sense to at least consider it.

That&#x27;s not the case on something like Twitter and Instagram. Good and actually interesting content is drowned out between your average tweets and posts about nothing at all. Or all the content sucks and is there for the sake of exposure, likes, clicks etc.

Mastodon has consistently been great before this while Twitter fiasco. I wish it never happened, I don&#x27;t want the space I have liked for years to change and be ruined.

Going to different domains to talk to different groups of people makes sense, and we can have the modicum of privacy offered by a semi-private chat server like discord, so that your messages don&#x27;t get indexed by google and archived forever.

It could even be the same application - Kbin is another AP service which has separate tabs for &quot;link aggregation&quot; and &quot;microblogging&quot; (Reddit and Twitter, respectively).<p>With Lemmy, the way a large corp could come in and push it around is by simply creating it&#x27;s own version of the top 100 (or N, whatever) communities, and automatically subscribing users into them based on their interests (already known, due to existing accounts&#x2F;profiles elsewhere).  c&#x2F;linux on lemmy.ml has ~6k subscribers, and is the largest Linux community on Lemmy, afaict.  It&#x27;s not unreasonable to think a large corp willing to pull in its existing userbase couldn&#x27;t increase that by an order of magnitude in very short order.  Overnight, those communities become <i>the</i> place where conversations are happening on those topics (maybe even with some pre-seeded content) and the existing lemmy communities stagnate.<p>Fast forward a while and one day BigCorp decides to pull the plug.  Existing non-BigCorp Lemmy users are now separated from the communities they&#x27;ve been in and need to create BigCorp accounts.  You could argue that those non-BigCorp Lemmy users are no worse off than they are pre-BigCorp-federation, but they&#x27;re effectively migrating their communities all over again.<p>As far as why, I think it&#x27;s pretty invaluable for Facebook to:<p>1) appear to be &quot;playing ball&quot; from a regulatory aspect
2) eat a competitor&#x27;s lunch

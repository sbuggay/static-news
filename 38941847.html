And the easiest places where people run into energies are light bulb wattages and nutrition facts, and the latter always seemed more interesting than the former, so the idea was “The Biophysics of Weight Loss” as a first physics course.<p>As an example of how this looks a bit different to a physicist, most people go to an online calculator to get their TDEE or RMR, some measure of how much energy per day passes out of their body. If you&#x27;re a physicist, you can&#x27;t help but measure this at two different weights, current and target. So that gives you a slope, a delta: kilocalories per day per kilogram of fat lost. Except there is also a rough measure of how many kilocalories to lose to lose a kg of fat, so in dimensional analysis terms, this is really just a time constant. I forget the exact amount but it works out to something like nine months or a year or so.<p>And then you realize that that&#x27;s a half life. You choose a lifestyle, you start living as if your weight were W, then after a year you will get halfway there, after another year you&#x27;ll get halfway closer, and so on, and so on.<p>But that&#x27;s not how anybody thinks on a diet. They are thinking, I&#x27;m going to intervene, get my life under control, then I can return to the lifestyle I had before but without the weight. But what you are describing is a severe lifestyle shift, “I became a marathon runner and my friends are all marathon runners and that is our new lifestyle.” Polar opposite of intervention.<p>But it&#x27;s also, there&#x27;s a selection bias. If the actual cause is depression related, and marathoning worked because it gave a new sense of purpose and self, how would you notice?

Discovered in 1994, leptin is a hormone that signals the availability of energy reserves in the body. &quot;High leptin levels are interpreted by the brain that energy reserves are high, whereas low leptin levels indicate that energy reserves are low&quot;, the latter causing the body to enter a resource-minimizing starvation mode [1]. More recently, leptin has also been shown to regulate &quot;neuroendocrine and immune function and [play] a role in development&quot; [2].<p>Why is leptin so important to obesity? &quot;Most obesity occurs in the presence of increased leptin levels&quot;, which suggests a form of &quot;leptin resistance&quot; in obese individuals [2].<p>Leptin changes our understanding of body fat, also called adipose tissue. We generally think of body fat as simply stored energy reserves, so fat can be burned by decreasing our caloric intake (diet) and increasing our energy usage (exercise), forcing our body to dip into its reserves. This approach is generally referred to the calorie-in&#x2F;calorie-out (CICO) model. While true to an extent, this perspective is too simplistic, given one key fact: leptin is primarily produced in adipose tissue [1]. This fact means body fat is actually an endocrine system organ.<p>Consider this: an obese individual has elevated leptin levels. A decrease in adipose tissue causes a decrease in their leptin production. Due to leptin resistance, low leptin levels causes the body to enter starvation mode, and hardcore dieting causes leptin levels to drop further, which makes weight loss even more difficult. What they mean by &quot;metabolic adaptation&quot; may be understood as &quot;leptin adaptation&quot;, though I&#x27;m just speculating there.<p>It&#x27;s strange that so many articles talk about weight loss and &quot;metabolism adaptation&quot; without mentioning the hormone signalling energy availability. With leptin, we clearly see the body has an energy availability feedback loop, and fighting the intrinsic dynamics of a feedback loop rarely leads to good outcomes.<p>On this vein, I want to highlight slothtrap&#x27;s comments:<p>&gt;The more frequent the dieting and steeper the caloric deficit, the worse metabolic adaptation gets, and the longer it takes to return to normal.<p>&gt;I wonder if those who sustained higher levels of exercise were actually in a steeper caloric deficit.<p>&gt;perhaps it&#x27;s fair to say that if you&#x27;re going to exercise, you best sustain it.<p>These comments align with present understanding of leptin dynamics. A steep caloric deficit pushes the obese body into starvation mode, so net energy expenditure from high levels of exercise will be decreased. Weight loss will be maintained once the body adjusts its leptin production and usage, which, as of now, can only be accomplished with habit.<p>It&#x27;s also worth mentioning here the hormone ghrelin, which was identified in 1999 and is nicknamed the &quot;hunger hormone&quot; [3].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Leptin" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Leptin</a><p>[2] DOI: 10.1146&#x2F;annurev.physiol.62.1.413<p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ghrelin" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ghrelin</a></div><br/><div id="38943445" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38943445" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwup238</span><span>|</span><a href="#38942521">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38942869">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38943445">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38943445">[49 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; This approach is generally referred to the calorie-in&#x2F;calorie-out (CICO) model. While true to an extent, this perspective is too simplistic, given one key fact: leptin is primarily produced in adipose tissue [1]. This fact means body fat is actually an endocrine system organ.</i><p>This part I think needs more explanation. The reason calories-in&#x2F;calories-out model is too simplistic (I would call it almost useless if not completely wrong) is because of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins [1] that control how much energy in the protein gradient gets converted to ATP and how much is lost to waste heat. These uncoupling proteins are upregulated by leptin so when your leptin levels fall, your body literally changes how efficient its metabolism is to do more work with fewer calories. Body fat isn&#x27;t just an endocrine organ, it might be the primary metabolic controller with a nasty catch 22 feedback loop - which would help explain why a certain minimum percentage of body fat is required or else a person enter organ failure.<p>That&#x27;s why there are some people who don&#x27;t seem to gain much weight despite eating a lot of food: their bodies are naturally less efficient and lose a lot more energy to thermogenesis. Without taking that metabolic adaptation into account, CICO is nothing but harmful dogma that needs to die. Otherwise people are fighting what might be one of the most important biological adaptations humans have.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Uncoupling_protein" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Uncoupling_protein</a></div><br/><div id="38943729" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38943729" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ninkendo</span><span>|</span><a href="#38942521">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38943445">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38948032">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38943729">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38943729">[33 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">CICO doesn’t work across individuals for reason you outline (just because I lose weight with a certain level of calories, doesn’t mean you will, etc.)<p>But for a single individual, working to establish your base metabolic rate by counting every calorie and weighing yourself regularly, you can <i>always</i> find a way to be successful with the CICO model. If you establish a baseline that your metabolic rate is (say) 2000 calories a day, then eating 1600 calories a day will cause you to lose roughly a half-pound to a pound per week. It does <i>not</i> mean that every individual’s baseline metabolic rate is the same.<p>As you also outline, your base metabolic rate also changes as your weight does, so re-baselining by continually measuring caloric intake and your weight to recalibrate is always going to be necessary.<p>Given the above CICO almost seems tautological: Measure the weight loss you actually observe at a given calorie level, and that tells you… how much weight you will lose at that given calorie level. So it is almost useless as you describe.<p>BUT, the main reason I’m still a proponent of CICO is that it simplifies dieting away from thinking about <i>what</i> you eat, and instead focuses on <i>how much</i> you eat. If I establish that I need to eat 1800 calories a day, I can still have a Big Mac meal and drink some beers. But I may not be able to eat much else that day. That alone makes it useful for me. What <i>isn’t</i> useful to me, are diets that essentially limit the <i>type</i> of food you eat and tell you to just go nuts and eat however much you want: I will often find myself hating the foods I’m restricted to, and the quantity I eat may end up being such that I gain weight anyway.<p>To me, CICO is simply a technique that says “actually measure how much you’re eating”, no more and no less.

Here&#x27;s some great quotes from the book &quot;The Obesity Code&quot; (which I&#x27;ve just recently found and find an excellent book):<p>&gt;The abrupt increase in obesity began exactly with the officially sanctioned move toward a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet.<p>&gt;A 30 percent reduction in caloric intake results in a 30 percent decrease in caloric expenditure.<p>&gt;Total energy expenditure is the sum of basal metabolic rate, thermogenic effect of food, nonexercise activity thermogenesis, excess post-exercise oxygen consumption and exercise.<p>&gt;Since hormones control both Calories In and Calories Out, obesity is a hormonal, not a caloric, disorder.<p>&gt;If hormones regulate fat growth, then obesity is a hormonal, not a caloric disorder.<p>&gt;Sugar will increase the blood glucose level and provoke an insulin response from the pancreas. Olive oil will not...[cause] significant increase in blood glucose or insulin. The two different foods evoke vastly different metabolic and hormonal responses.&quot;<p>All of this is to say that it&#x27;s not enough to simply adjust calories. Yes, calories matter to a point, and everyone knows that starvation (e.g., 0 calories for an extended period of time) is effective in the long-term, but starvation will also harm your body, and no reasonably-minded person can suggest it as a viable approach to weight loss.<p>The best available scientific evidence shows that continuing to decrease caloric intake can make weight loss more difficult for an obese person.</div><br/><div id="38944837" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38944837" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ninkendo</span><span>|</span><a href="#38942521">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38944710">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38944477">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38944837">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38944837">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>whoosh</i><p>That was the sound of you zooming <i>right past</i> my argument and pretending I was saying something I wasn’t.<p>I’m not saying CICO is a good idea.

I&#x27;ll first explain the process (because I want to highlight why IF matters), and then I&#x27;ll answer your question directly. It&#x27;s going to take a little bit to properly elaborate, but I believe it&#x27;s worth your time to read.<p>We first need to choose which of the following macronutrients contribute most to weight gain: protein, fat, or carbohydrates. Proteins (or, rather, amino acids) are not known for contributing to body fat in any significant manner. Fat was once thought to be the main contributor when calories--not carbohydrates--became accepted as fattening. However, modern science shows fat has little significant contribution to body fat and that the real contributor to body fat are carbohydrates. The discovery of leptin about 30 years ago finally shows why.<p>Carbs are sugars. Sugars, such as glucose, are the main source of fuel in the body, as they are eventually synthesized into ATP. Blood glucose levels are regulated by the hormone insulin. Elevated blood glucose levels increases insulin production, whereas low blood glucose decreases insulin production (with glucagon helping stabilize blood glucose levels). High insulin levels promotes anabolism, whereas low insulin levels promotes catabolism. Creating body fat is an anabolic process, whereas burning body fat is a catabolic process. Putting it all together, eating carbs inhibits the essential catabolic processes for burning fat.<p>While entirely cutting out carbs should be the answer, it&#x27;s not. Many obese people report failure to lose weight on ketogenic diets. Why? The hormone leptin. See, leptin levels increase with insulin levels. Leptin signals the availability of energy reserves in the body. Adipose tissue (that is, body fat) is the primary producer of leptin. Importantly, leptin levels vary exponentially with body fat. The obese individual&#x27;s body is so oversaturated with leptin, the body becomes resistant to leptin.<p>Decreased leptin levels will cause body fat to be burned. On a ketogenic diet, catabolic processes initially cause a reduction in body fat, which then decreases leptin production. Because the obese body has leptin resistance, the leptin production decrease is interpreted by the brain as a severe drop in available energy reserves, causing total energy expenditure to be immediately reduced and placing the body in &quot;starvation mode.&quot; At this point, eliminating body fat actually becomes more difficult, as excess carbs become anabolized into body fat due to decreased energy expenditures.<p>So, to finally get to your question, how do carbs matter with respect to leptin? To lose weight over months and years, an obese person needs to eat carbs to (1) keep their leptin levels stable over the course of each week to prevent the body from entering starvation mode while (2) maximizing the efficacy of catabolic processes. As the body gradually recovers from its leptin resistance (which will likely take time), the body will shed fat without triggering the energy-minimization mode.<p>In this paradigm, your total energy expenditure determines how fast fat will be burned. According to the book &quot;The Obesity Code&quot;, &quot;total energy expenditure is the sum of basal metabolic rate, thermogenic effect of food, nonexercise activity thermogenesis, excess post-exercise oxygen consumption [(EPOC),] and exercise&quot;. Of these five factors, EPOC is mostly likely underutilized. A simple 10-minute HIIT routine every other day will regularly drive EPOC, which causes ATP synthesis. When an person isn&#x27;t eating carbs, the body dips into fat stores to acquire the necessary glucose for ATP synthesis. Note that with this approach, exercise isn&#x27;t strictly necessary but becomes extremely beneficial to maximize the efficacy of catabolic processes.<p>Intermittent fasting should work as long as the specific protocol doesn&#x27;t decrease leptin levels such that the obese body enters starvation mode. In my opinion, the most workable approach for people is to try their best to completely eliminate carbs Monday-Friday, eat all the carbs they want on the weekends, and do the bare minimum of a 10-minutes HIIT routine every other day.</div><br/><div id="38948774" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38948774" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">com2kid</span><span>|</span><a href="#38942521">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38948455">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38945641">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38948774">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38948774">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Intermittent fasting should work as long as the specific protocol doesn&#x27;t decrease leptin levels such that the obese body enters starvation mode.

Some people have a faster (I think the more appropriate word is inefficient)  metabolism, and can lose weight or stay thin despite eating more calories compared to someone with a slower&#x2F;efficient metabolism, controlling for body size, age, and other factors. There was a thread on Reddit a while back where formerly or current obese people shared their old diets, and many people were commenting that it did not seem like much food. Even though people are generally bad at self-reporting calorie intake, that&#x27;s called having a crap metabolism.<p>Imagine two individuals who both both need 2,500 calories&#x2F;day to feel satiated, but the second individual stores anything above 1,500&#x2F;day as fat, and a second individual stores anything above 3,000 as fat.  The first person will constantly be fighting his body to not overeat and will feel hungry constantly. The second individual can eat to fullness and not gain weight.<p>Some men , particularly the formerly obese, have such slow metabolisms that anything stored above 1,200-1,700&#x2F;day is stored as fat despite weighing 170 pounds or so, from reading personal accounts here and on Reddit. This is also why bariatric surgery patients regain weight and become obese again despite only eating around 1,200-1,500 calories&#x2F;day. These people basically got short-changed when it comes to metabolism genes.   If there is a famine, they will outlive everyone. But in abundance  they become fat very easily.  This does not answer why there are more obese people today compared to in the past, but there is  still probably a genetic component nonetheless.<p>And on the other extreme  are people who can be very slim despite eating a normal amount of calories or only slightly less than 2,000. These people are much rarer, as it&#x27;s disadvantageous from an evolutionary perspective to have an inefficient metabolism, but they exist in the same way very tall or short people exist by virtue of phenotypic variance.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38948032" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38948032" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">screye</span><span>|</span><a href="#38942521">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38943445">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38943729">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38945290">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38948032">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38948032">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">CICO works quite well at the extremes.

He discusses a &quot;causality test&quot;: &quot;If we inject this hormone into people, they must gain weight&quot;. According to Dr. Fung, leptin and ghrelin don&#x27;t pass this test, but insulin and cortisol do. Still, leptin and insulin appear to have a close relationship. &quot;Insulin promotes fat storage. Leptin reduces fat storage. High levels of insulin should naturally act as an antagonist to leptin. However, the precise mechanisms by which insulin inhibits leptin are yet unknown.&quot; He also says that &quot;too much insulin causes obesity&quot; and that &quot;obesity is a state of leptin resistance.&quot; (Sorry for that mini book review; I needed to understand what he was saying.)<p>On the fasting point, he&#x27;s explicitly supportive not of regular fasting but intermittent fasting: &quot;Diets must be intermittent, not steady...we cannot fast all the time.

One approach which seems to accomplish this is eating close-to-zero carbs five days&#x2F;week (say, during the week) and then eating lots of carbs two days&#x2F;week (say, on the weekend). The burst of carbs will cause leptin levels to spike since the body now has tons of available energy.

And it’s not permitted when a land is unoccupied since one of the central tenets of adverse possession is open and notorious occupation. And, as you know based on your prior replies, adverse possession has a time component. The GP’s post is about merely leaving a property unoccupied. They don’t list a timeframe but we can pretty easily assume that if one exists in their mind it is less than the &gt;5 years required for adverse possession based on the context.<p>I am not a commonwealth lawyer, but my understanding is that they have a similar modern rule in the UK and other commonwealth countries. I am not a continental lawyer, but my understanding is that civil law is similar with respect to government takings.<p>I will give you credit here because you may have interpreted the GP’s statement of “or forfeit the property” to mean generally lose possession of the property (including to a third party) rather than in the context of the prior sentence that references “the state allowing.” So, some backwards ancient legal principles that have been rejected or severely limited in modern times MIGHT support the contention that a third party can take someone’s land due to it being unoccupied and no modern legal principles support the contention that the government can make someone forfeit their land to the state merely for it being unoccupied.<p>The answer to my question (Does&#x2F;should the government have the right to make you surrender that building without compensation (because that’s what forfeit means) simply due to it being unoccupied?

Squatting has, historically, predominantly targeted empty buildings like luxury rentals, offices, factories, churches, etc. Please show me a single example of somebodies primary home being squatted and they becoming homeless as a result.<p>Sticking to Spain, there were about 17,000 squatting incidents (reported to the police) in 2021 [1]. I don&#x27;t know about big cities in Spain, but e.g. in Berlin there are tens of thousands of squaremeters in unhoused space in form of offices  and high-rent appartments. Do you really think people go to the homes people live in first?<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maldita.es&#x2F;malditateexplica&#x2F;20221026&#x2F;datos-okupaciones-espana-denuncias-condenas&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maldita.es&#x2F;malditateexplica&#x2F;20221026&#x2F;datos-okupacion...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40594216" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40594216" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lottin</span><span>|</span><a href="#40589561">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594342">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40587154">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40594216">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40594216">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If investing in housing is made less profitable, there will be less investing and consequently less supply in the long run, thus making the housing problem worse.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40587154" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40587154" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anthk</span><span>|</span><a href="#40589561">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40586818">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40587154">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40587154">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Idealista arguing on the ethics of squatting it&#x27;s like Exxon fighting against pollution or Trump talking against bribery.<p>I&#x27;ve seen war trenches which seemed more liveable than the average racoon hole rented at Idealista.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40586818" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40586818" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">golergka</span><span>|</span><a href="#40587154">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40586908">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40586818">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40586818">[20 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why would anyone invest in development in a country with such laws?</div><br/><div id="40586849" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40586849" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">diggan</span><span>|</span><a href="#40586818">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40587095">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40586849">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40586849">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Because we have doors and windows closed, so in reality this isn&#x27;t a huge issue.

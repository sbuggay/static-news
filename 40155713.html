I think this point is a bit obscured by the article&#x27;s use of this &quot;fragmented thinking&quot; terminology, which it does not do a good job of defining before building an argument on top of it. (I found myself searching for those words to see if I had missed the definition.)<p>However, I do think this is an insightful point! I think these &quot;internal interruptions&quot; are indeed a big problem for me, and one I don&#x27;t think about nearly as much, but will try to more now that I&#x27;ve read this article.<p>The frustrating thing about external interruptions is the inability to control them. Things like turning off notifications and putting on headphones are mechanisms to reduce that frustration by imposing control over those interruptions.<p>The good news for these <i>internal</i> interruptions is that it should be much easier to control them. But it requires being aware of the problem!

And that I think this concept would be helpful to others here. That’s all, no more, no less.<p>It isn’t that I’m perfect, or infallible, or even immune to frustration and the occasional bout of snark. It doesn’t mean that I’m a “better” person. It also doesn’t mean that I have to accept every viewpoint as true or equally likely. Nor does it mean that I can’t criticize. Nor that I can’t take a side on a considered opinion. It doesn’t mean that this always leads to perfect results or that I’m always successful. It doesn’t mean that it’s a perfect heuristic. It’s only one more tool in a toolbox.<p>I think it is undervalued - and sometimes angrily pushed back against - in this community, maybe because it gets dismissed as “feelings” (and not “reason”). The reason I think this is that I&#x27;ve encountered here the “experienced expert with healthy self doubt versus passionate amateur with little self awareness” dynamic in action over and over again.<p>There’s an ongoing, half century current in the field trying to examine whether reasoning may often involve a heuristic-based, adaptive process based on incomplete and imperfect information, and less so something resembling a pure application of formal logic.<p>In this universe, cognitive biases extend more clearly to things like which facts you consider as possible at all in the first place and by which methods you weight them as more or less likely or influential, as opposed to merely fallacies of formal logic that we’re most often exposed to. So, the thinking goes, it can help to try to fill some gaps in this area by trying to increase the breadth of what you’re exposing yourself to and allowing yourself to take into account.<p>In my experience this can be a frustrating and exhausting concept to contend with as a person. You certainly can tu quoque yourself - or me, like you and others in this thread have - into oblivion. After all, what business do I have talking about cognitive biases if I&#x27;ve been shown to be subject the very same, and am not an expert in it? I don&#x27;t know where the line is but I&#x27;m not certain it makes the concept less helpful outright. At the very least I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m claiming something that&#x27;d be considered very controversial as far as I&#x27;m aware.</div><br/><div id="40193365" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40193365" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pseudalopex</span><span>|</span><a href="#40189391">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40191532">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40190913">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40193365">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40193365">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Please continue preaching empathy and self awareness.

For me, sans definition, could very quickly imagine what they were talking about because it started resonating for me almost immediately.<p>&gt; The frustrating thing about external interruptions is the inability to control them. Things like turning off notifications and putting on headphones are mechanisms to reduce that frustration by imposing control over those interruptions.<p>This is partly <i>why</i> it started resonating for me right away. I currently share a semi-private office with another senior engineer. Lately he&#x27;s been spending a good chunk of his time working on higher-level systems planning work and I&#x27;ve been spending most of my time working on very specific complex low-level work. The questions are sometimes frustrating because they&#x27;ll interrupt my flow state, but... only sometimes. I&#x27;ve been chewing on that for a couple of weeks now, actually, because I hadn&#x27;t yet figured out <i>why</i> he could sometimes ask me questions and it would have almost zero effect on me while other times it would have a massive negative effect.<p>The article nailed it, on reflection: the effect size of being interrupted with a question, for me, is proportional to how far away from the problem I&#x27;m working on is. If I&#x27;m digging into some of the autopilot code and get asked a question about GPS or IMUs, it is absolutely no problem to think about the question and answer it. If, though, it&#x27;s a question about, say, a battery or the charging system, I&#x27;ll get the &quot;black cloud evaporating&quot; phenomenon from the comic in the article. And it happens so quickly that by time I can even just answer &quot;sorry, I don&#x27;t have brain capacity to think about that right now&quot; it&#x27;s too late.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40192341" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40192341" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aantix</span><span>|</span><a href="#40189391">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40192320">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40190573">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40192341">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40192341">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I use Cold Turkey to block my habbit of scrolling time-wasting sites when I should be reflecting harder on what it is needed to solve the issue at hand.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getcoldturkey.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getcoldturkey.com&#x2F;</a><p>It&#x27;s almost like I need some mental space, to meditate on the solution, but that feels exhausting, so I choose sometimes to mindlessly scroll.<p>Any other tools that I may be missing?</div><br/><div id="40192522" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40192522" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hackerlight</span><span>|</span><a href="#40189391">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40192341">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40190573">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40192522">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40192522">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">An alternative is to add URLs to &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts like this to block them:<p>127.0.0.1 tiktok.com<p>127.0.0.1 www.tiktok.com<p>Then use ublock origin extension to pare down features on sites you still visit, and an RSS reader app to slow down media consumption.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40190573" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40190573" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hinkley</span><span>|</span><a href="#40189391">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40192341">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40191150">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40190573">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40190573">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I spent a long time thinking about why I always end up being the guy that people feel comfortable interrupting.

Now the problem with this is that sensitivity of human hearing is not flat across frequencies. There&#x27;s a sharp uptick from 1kHz to 3kHz (peak) and you gotta get to 9kHz before you&#x27;re back down to the level of 1kHz (which 100Hz - 1kHz is fairly flat). Here&#x27;s a random graph[0], take it with a bit of a grain of salt but as far as I know it is reasonable. But remember that dB is logarithmic so this is significantly louder.<p>Because of this, Pink Noise is created to be &quot;flat&quot; with respect to the human ear[1]. I mean there&#x27;s approximations going on for this but think of it as a lazy version of that if we didn&#x27;t know the more complex response curve from [0]. While white noise is flat across frequencies, the perception is that higher frequencies are louder.<p>In short, pink noise will sound like it is raining on a metal surface or by rapids in a river. You can hear the low frequencies but you got lots of high ones too. Brown noise will be like sitting in the forest when it is raining, it hitting the soft dirt. Or a lot like being near the ocean.<p>So if you want that comfort slow pace feeling, turn up the low frequencies, so 10Hz to 500Hz, and I like to cut-off anything above 600Hz.<p>It can be good to play with single tones too[2]. I like about 65Hz (I can hear about 21Hz to 17kHz on this site with some good headphones but who knows. All that isn&#x27;t flat and I&#x27;m a tad over 30). But the site I sent you previously has a lot to play around with. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a high quality refined tone specification site but if you find one let me know.<p>I hope this helps.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.compadre.org&#x2F;nexusph&#x2F;course&#x2F;images&#x2F;OscillationsAndWaves&#x2F;FrequencyResponseOfHumanEar1-min.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.compadre.org&#x2F;nexusph&#x2F;course&#x2F;images&#x2F;OscillationsA...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Colors_of_noise#Pink_noise" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Colors_of_noise#Pink_noise</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.szynalski.com&#x2F;tone-generator&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.szynalski.com&#x2F;tone-generator&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40191576" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40191576" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">iamleppert</span><span>|</span><a href="#40190920">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40192206">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40191576">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40191576">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This article itself was written by someone with fragmented thinking.

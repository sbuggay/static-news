It&#x27;s happening in almost every sector of the economy you can imagine. I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say that PE firms are buying up nursing homes, transfering ownership of the land and building off into a separate entity, and have that entity charge the nursing home rent which keeps going up and up. This forces management of the nursing home to find ways to cut expenses until there&#x27;s nothing left to cut except stuff directly related to resident care, safety, etc. Families see the writing on the wall and move their relatives out which accelerates the demise of the nursing home and it has to shut down (or is shut down, by the county&#x2F;state.) Then the PE firm bulldozes the building and sells the property (which is what they really wanted.)<p>The US suffered a massive toxic fire in Ohio that destroyed a big chunk of the town and left a huge area heavily poisoned because a private equity firm bought the railroad and was squeezing it for every penny, and despite plenty of warnings by union officials and experts, the FRA did nothing and then...boom. Wheel bearing seized, train derailed, town polluted by hundreds of thousands of pounds of incredibly toxic chemicals like vinyl chloride.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tiktok.com&#x2F;@moreperfectunion&#x2F;video&#x2F;7198354503823887658" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tiktok.com&#x2F;@moreperfectunion&#x2F;video&#x2F;7198354503823...</a><p>Precision railroad scheduling means:<p>- insanely strict rules about when engineers can request time off even for family medical emergencies, and sick days (so you have train engineers and other staff working while sick as dogs. Totally safe! Really stressed out employees, too - and stress means mistakes.) RR unions tried to strike twice. First congress and then and Biden bitch-slapped them back to work with a &quot;compromise&quot; that was still oppressive as hell because the economic disruption from the trains not running was more important. All because the railroads want to cut the number of employees down as low as possible so there aren&#x27;t available engineers to replace sick ones, and they don&#x27;t want delays while replacement engineers head out to trains that had to be left somewhere because the engineer was sick.<p>- dramatically reducing the time rolling stock maintenance crews have to inspect a car for problems - from three minutes to a minute and a half. Not only does this save labor, it means those maintenance crews don&#x27;t find as much stuff wrong which takes a car out of service and costs money for the repair...woo, saving more money!<p>- reducing the number of employees per train; I believe it&#x27;s currently two, and they&#x27;re trying to push the FRA into allowing them to run one employee per train.<p>- increasing train lengths to reduce labor costs by moving more cars per people they have to pay. This increases the chances of derailments, and also causes other problems, like slower brake response time (the longer the train, the longer it takes for a pressure reduction in the brake line to make it to the end of the train, though I believe some end-of-train devices can be set up to remotely release brake pressure.)<p>- reducing track crews <i>and</i> time allocated to track maintenance so the tracks are more available and maintenance costs are lowered.<p>Keep in mind locomotive engineers are paid a median wage of $35&#x2F;hour with a 10&#x2F;90th percentile spread of $28&#x2F;$44. These aren&#x27;t enormous sums of money they&#x27;re saving by going to one person on the train, particularly since it will be a lower-paid employee who is removed.<p>The crash was caused by overheating bearings which caused a wheelset to seize and derail the train.<p>It gets worse. The railroad pushed to have tanker cars intentionally burned, lied to the public, and turns out it was likely just because burning off the chemicals was cheaper and faster than a proper cleanup.

And then he started scheduling his own overnight&#x2F;weekend DMs to send at 9am Monday.<p>It was an awesome response, and those firm self-imposed boundaries helped allow the work to be rewarding, rather than an absolute nightmare.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41353227" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41353227" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">frosting1337</span><span>|</span><a href="#41353173">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41354221">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41353271">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41353227">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41353227">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A lot of companies here are pretty good.

Personally, I maintain a very strict separation between work devices and personal. Work email, slack, and whatever else I need for work lives on my work devices only. Personal email, whatsapp, etc live on my personal devices only. Most of the companies I&#x27;ve worked at add a remote wipe functionality to the phone, and even though I understand the business case for this and I&#x27;ve never heard of it being misused, that&#x27;s not something I want on <i>my</i> <i>personal</i> devices.<p>I usually only have a couple of exceptions to this policy - I usually have my personal gmail logged in at work, and occasionally for very specific reasons, I might temporarily install &quot;work&quot; apps on my personal phone, for instance when I want to leave work early to catch a train, but need to be in a work meeting later in the day, or to stay in contact with colleagues when out at a conference, etc. These apps get removed again when I no longer need them.<p>When I leave work, the work devices get switched off. In most cases, I leave the work devices at work, including laptops and phones, assuming I have somewhere secure to leave them at work. Almost every company I&#x27;ve worked at, I&#x27;ve had a lockable chest of drawers, so I just put things in there. In the ones without, the laptop stays on the desk plugged in, and I might take the phone home even though it&#x27;s switched off.<p>I&#x27;ve almost never been asked why I haven&#x27;t seen or replied to an out-of-hours communication. On those few occasions, I&#x27;ve just said &quot;All my work devices were switched off for the weekend&quot; and there&#x27;s been nothing further said. In the very few cases where I was expected to be on call, it was previously agreed and so I took the necessary devices home.<p>Obviously, things changed a lot with the shift to remote working during and after COVID, but I still maintained the same boundaries. Even now I have my own company, I have separate computer, desks and even chairs for work and personal use. Slack and work related e-mail is only on the work devices. If I want to do some work over the weekend (which feels acceptable now it&#x27;s for my benefit), I physically sit in a different half of the office to do that.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41353385" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41353385" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ludston</span><span>|</span><a href="#41355143">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41352933">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41353385">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41353385">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My personal experience is that Australia doesn&#x27;t have a huge problem with this generally.

All with zero compensation, because I was a salaried employee.<p>One company had a problem with continuing to promise the world to clients, but not setting realistic timelines. 
When, inevitably, the goal posts were shifted, timelines were not updated to recognise the issue. There was never an explicit &quot;You must work longer hours to finish this&quot;, it was &quot;The client expects this to be done by this date.&quot;. There was also pressure that if I didn&#x27;t work more to finish things, that it would fall upon some other member of the team who was also known to be burnt out.<p>Another company refused to require teams to conduct any form of peer reviews, testing or take on responsibility for monitoring or resolving issues.<p>Regularly people would commit code and push changes to production, and then walk out the door to go home.  When that caught on fire, I&#x27;d be required to remote in and resolve whatever issue they had caused. Typically this happened right as I was getting home and trying to eat dinner.<p>I&#x27;m not certain if this law would&#x27;ve helped me in these cases.

Politicians and govt departments like them though; they get to put a dot-point on their list of achievements.<p>Unfortunately Australia has become a business-backwater (the upper bound of our capabilities is to dig stuff out of the ground and ship it overseas).<p>Sorry if this sounds negative, but every rule - however well-intentioned - steals attention and creativity away from entrepreneurs, slows the economy, drives up prices, reduces customer service, and benefits large incumbents who can withstand the burden.</div><br/><div id="41354086" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41354086" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">moorow</span><span>|</span><a href="#41353152">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41353204">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41354086">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41354086">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I own a tech consulting company in Australia.

Yes, those rules can (usually do) have negative economic impacts. More wealth is good, but lets not pretend that there are no tradeoffs.<p>The last 10 years (and especially the last 3) have seen a massive shift in work culture and the once-precious work&#x2F;life balance has essentially disappeared. Many people in white collar jobs are hooked into work every waking hour. That sucks, and a lot people don&#x27;t want to live like that. Many people (myself included) are in a position to set clear boundaries, but many others aren&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of government as a guardian of culture, but sometimes it is.

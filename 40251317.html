Board breaking is really, really easy. The key is the boards designed for breaking are cut in their weakest orientation.  Wood is incredibly strong going with the fibers, even a pine board is very hard to break long ways using a sledge hammer.  However, if it&#x27;s cut on its short axis, it&#x27;s incredibly easy to break.  Most people, even children don&#x27;t need any guidance beyond, &quot;punch through the board&quot; to be successful.  Breaking boards is more mental than physical.  If a student is struggling or a novice, the person holding the board can hold their hands a little wider to make it easier to break.<p>Concrete is more difficult, but there&#x27;s still a trick to it.  The blocks you use for breaking have a bit of flex to them, but are also extremely brittle.  So just getting it to flex just a small amount will cause them to break in half.  That&#x27;s also why you place spacers between stacks of bricks or wood.  You&#x27;re leveraging the flex of the material to break it, and stacking them without spacers makes too rigid to break.<p>In short, this stuff is 90% magic trick.</div><br/><div id="40253244" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40253244" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">licebmi__at__</span><span>|</span><a href="#40252171">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40252276">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40253244">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40253244">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;In short, this stuff is 90% magic trick.<p>I would say, kinda but not entirely.

You&#x27;d be surprised at how easily you can break one with the simple tap of a claw hammer.<p>It&#x27;s just physics. The longer the brick, the easier it will break. Some demo  rocks are much longer.  The trick is to hit it fast, use the smallest impact point you can, and follow through. If you don&#x27;t follow through you won&#x27;t even be able to break a pine board.

The most important 3 are the following.<p>To achieve maximum acceleration, you need maximum force. For maximum force, you need as many muscles as possible to participate in striking. The most powerful muscles are those of the legs, so they must also participate when hitting with the hand, by rotating the hips, whose movement must be transmitted through the abdomen and thorax until the hitting hand.<p>To achieve maximum final velocity of the hand, the hitting arm must not move like a rigid stick, but like a flexible whip (more accurately like an articulated flail), with a wave propagating along it so that the extremity will achieve a maximum speed, much higher than the speed of the extremity of an arm-length stick that would rotate around the shoulder. For this, all the muscles that do not contribute to the acceleration of the hand must be as relaxed as possible.<p>To achieve a maximum transfer of energy into the hitting target, it is necessary for the body part used for hitting to have a maximum equivalent mass. For maximum equivalent mass, the ideal is for the entire body to behave as a rigid body. This can be achieved by a contraction of most muscles. So in contrast with the time before the hand reaches the target, when most muscles should be relaxed, during the very short time of the impact most muscles must be contracted. In many Japanese martial arts this is somewhat confusingly explained by some mumbo-jumbo about &quot;kime&quot;.</div><br/><div id="40255744" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40255744" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">amatecha</span><span>|</span><a href="#40254150">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40255301">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40252071">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40255744">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40255744">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah!  thank you!  this comment is better than the whole original post!

The whole idea of fighting was to stop the other bloke hitting you as soon as possible. It wasn&#x27;t to earn marks.

Bare knuckle boxing seems more brutal but it&#x27;s said to have been safer in that regard.<p>Using padded gloves allows for hitting the opponent much harder without injury to the hand, so they make it possible to hit with a lot more force. Serious brain injury is caused by accelerational forces, and those are only slightly reduced by the padding, but the padding gives significant protection to the thin bones of the hand. Without the protection the bones in the hand could break when struck against the relatively hardy bones of the skull.<p>Of course if you did happen to nicely hit the jaw, that&#x27;s one of the common target spots for a knockout.

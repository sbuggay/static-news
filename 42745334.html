And an OCR reading envelopes can be directed to prefer numbers or letters depending on what it expects.<p>Even if LLMs can push a 99.9% accuracy to 99.99, at least an OCR-based system can be audited.  Ask an OCR vendor why the machine confused &quot;Vancouver WA&quot; and &quot;Vancouver CA&quot; and one can get a solid answer based in repeated testing.  Ask an LLM vendor why and, at best, you&#x27;ll get a shrug and some line citing how much better they were in all the other situations.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42749162" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42749162" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dambi0</span><span>|</span><a href="#42745532">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42749076">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42749117">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42749164">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42749162">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42749162">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For the addresses it might be a bit easier because they are a lot more structured and in theory and the vocabulary is a lot more limited.

Handwriting styles changed a lot over the centuries and individuals can definitely be identified by their personal cursive style of writing and you can see their handwriting change as they aged.<p>Then you have the problem that some of these ancestors not only had terrible penmanship but also spelled multi-syllabic words phonetically since they likely were barely educated kids who spent more time when they were young working on the farm or ranch instead of attending school where they would&#x27;ve learned how to spell correctly.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether your LLM can handle English words spelled phonetically written in cursive by an individual who had no consistency in forming letters in the words. It is clear after reading a lot of correspondence from this person that they ignored things that didn&#x27;t seem important in the moment like dotting i&#x27;s or crossing t&#x27;s or forming tails on g&#x27;s, p&#x27;s, j&#x27;s, or even beginning letters consistently since they switched between cursive and block letters within a sentence, maybe while they paused to clarify their thoughts. I don&#x27;t know but it is fascinating to take a walk through life with someone you&#x27;ll never meet and to discover that many of the things that seemed awesome to you as a kid were also awesome to them and that their life had so many challenges that our generations will never need to endure.<p>Some of my people have the most beautiful flowing cursive handwriting that looks like the cursive that I was taught in grade school. Others have the most beautiful flowing cursive with custom flourishes and adornments that make their handwriting instantly recognizable and easy to read once you understand their style.<p>I think there are plenty of edge cases where LLMs will take a drunkard&#x27;s walk through the scribble and spit out gibberish.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of an old joke though.<p>Ronald Reagan woke up one snowy Washington, DC morning and took a look out of the window to admire the new-fallen snow. He enjoys the beautiful scene laid out before him until he sees tracks in the snow below his window and a message obviously written in piss that said - &quot;Reagan sucks&quot;.<p>He dispatched the Secret Service to the site where samples were taken of the affected snow and photos of the tracks of two people were made.<p>After an investigation he receives a call from the Secret Service agent in charge who tells him he has some good news and some bad news for him.<p>The good news is that they know who pissed the message.

What typed text? That image is a single handwritten page, and the writing is quite clean, not &quot;barely legible&quot;.† The file related to John Hopper appears to be 59 pages, and some of them are typed, but they&#x27;re all separate images.<p>Are you trying to process all 59 pages at once? Why?<p>I should note that transcription is an excellent use of an LLM in the sense of a language model, as opposed to an &quot;LLM&quot; in the sense of several different pieces of software hooked together in cryptic ways. It would be a lot more useful, for this task, to have direct access to the language model backing 4o than to have access to a chatbot prompt that intermediates between you and the model.<p>† My biggest problems in reading the page: Cursive <i>n</i> and <i>u</i> are often identical glyphs (both written и), leading me to read &quot;Ind.&quot; as &quot;Jud.&quot;; and I had trouble with the &quot;roster&quot; at the bottom of the page. What felt weirdest about that was that the crossbar of the &quot;t&quot; is positioned well above the top of the stem, but that can&#x27;t actually be what tripped me up, because on further review it&#x27;s a common feature of the author&#x27;s handwriting that I didn&#x27;t even notice until I got to the very end of the letter. It&#x27;s even true in the earlier instance of &quot;Roster&quot; higher up on the page.

Each era and each correspondent presented different challenges. Some hands were sprawling, some spindly, some cramped; <i>t</i>’s went uncrossed at the ends of words, and <i>f</i>’s and <i>s</i>’s were interchanged; spelling, capitalization, and punctuation could be erratic or idiosyncratic. Often, to save paper and postage, the sisters turned a single sheet ninety degrees and wrote back across a page already covered with handwriting. I learned to be especially attentive to these cross-written lines, in which the sisters invariably confided their deepest feelings in the last hurried moments of closing a letter. Here I would find the urgent personal message that had been put off for the sake of dispensing news or settling business. In one such postscript, I discovered Elizabeth’s account of a conversation with Horace Mann in which the two spoke frankly of their love for each other and finally settled on what it meant.”<p>A photograph of a letter with cross-writing is here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.masshist.org&#x2F;database&#x2F;1774" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.masshist.org&#x2F;database&#x2F;1774</a><p>Marshall wrote more in an article for <i>Slate</i>:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;news-and-politics&#x2F;2005&#x2F;05&#x2F;reading-the-peabody-sisters-letters.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;news-and-politics&#x2F;2005&#x2F;05&#x2F;reading-the-peab...</a></div><br/><div id="42748013" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42748013" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">teddyh</span><span>|</span><a href="#42745678">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42745488">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42748013">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42748013">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>and f’s and s’s were interchanged</i><p>Could these be instances of the long s, “ſ”, easily confused with an f?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42745488" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42745488" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jez</span><span>|</span><a href="#42745678">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42748240">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42745488">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42745488">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The handwriting in some of these snippets, while sometimes difficult to read for one reason or another, is nonetheless beautiful: did everyone who wrote have such great handwriting back then?<p>I&#x27;m looking at the piece in the Instagram post linked by the page, which begins, &quot;honor of holding in their service&quot;.

I learned cursive as a child, used it for years, and it was never faster than printing, it was much slower. When I say ‘print’, I use an in-between style of half-cursive fast print that isn’t cursive but a lot of people use in practice, and it’s much faster for me that trying to write legible cursive.<p>However cursive is neither faster nor more legible to read, as evidenced by this article and the pages that need translating. If we’re going to compare cursive and print, the metric should be overall speed and accuracy of communication, not how many milliseconds the pen-holder can save while writing something nobody can read.<p>Today, it no longer matters. People type &amp; text mostly, and typing is <i>way</i> faster than either cursive or print. The number of situations that require handwriting continues to decline.

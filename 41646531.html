I don&#x27;t blog as much any more but do create content elsewhere - a lot of it is for my own enjoyment and creative outlet, to blow off steam, whatever - the fact that other people may want to watch it is secondary. I do try to do things people want, but only if I want to do it.<p>The only reason I highlight this is that the up and coming generations absolutely do not see content creation in the same way. I got in an absurd argument with an early 20 something on a social media platform about how annoying ads were that were disguised as content. The response was overwhelmingly &quot;Well, how else do you expect content creators to make a living?&quot;<p>I do not disagree that creators should be able to monetize their content however they please, but the fact that people see that <i>as the end and only goal</i> of content creation is baffling to me and almost certainly making it worse. This same person tried to tell me it&#x27;s been the same way since the earliest days of youtube - which they would have been in diapers around that time - is absolutely not true. The idea of content creation as a full time career is relatively new, and I hate it. The worst part is if you don&#x27;t participate in the type of obnoxious engagement hacking or buried ads that these &quot;professional&quot; creators do, the algorithms punish you for it.</div><br/><div id="41648791" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41648791" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ReleaseCandidat</span><span>|</span><a href="#41648513">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41649106">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41648791">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41648791">[57 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; content creation<p>I seriously hate the term &quot;content&quot; used for &quot;creative output&quot;.

Think wisely, let the Meme Bank be the custodian of all your funny pictures and videos.<p>Just by looking at a period of 10 years back compared to now, we can see a stark difference between the meme collections that families kept at home vs the meme collections of families that kept their memes in Meme Bank.<p>There are two factors that contribute by an outsized amount to the lowering of value of the meme collections of average Joe over the years:<p>Firstly, resolution and compression artifacts. Where ten years ago a 640 by 480 pixels jpeg would have garnered applause from the people you showed it to, the people of today expect more. And all you’d be getting today for that once glorious meme, would be responses asking you “y’all got any more of them pixels?”<p>Secondly, stale pop-cultural reference. That meme you’ve got referencing a scene from a movie from last year. Yeah, it might still be funny today.

Nothing of value to others is truly created in a vacuum. It must have some system of re-uptake, of value being conferred back to the creator or else it will never repeat.
Ads are one potential way that can be accomplished, but as much as we hate ads we can&#x27;t just expect them to go away and leave the &quot;content&quot; alone. We have to <i>replace</i> them with some other superior way of remunerating the creators.

There&#x27;s a couple of main reasons for me to write a blog instead of just an obsidian note.<p>Firstly, the process of writing a blog post makes me think through my assumptions as I&#x27;m explaining the concepts it covers to other people. On more than one occasion I&#x27;ve realised while writing, that my understanding of the topic wasn&#x27;t entirely correct, so it&#x27;s useful here.<p>Also I blog so the information is available to others. If I spent a decent amount of time working things out, it&#x27;s possible that a blog could save other people in similar situations effort, so that&#x27;s handy.<p>Lastly I blog so I can point people to a post instead of explaining a topic in detail, it&#x27;s a handy time saver for things that come up a lot.<p>As to benefits, well it wasn&#x27;t deliberate but blogging contributed to me getting my last two jobs, so in that sense I guess it&#x27;s paid off pretty well!</div><br/></div></div><div id="41650957" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41650957" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jaw</span><span>|</span><a href="#41648513">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41649106">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41649357">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41650129">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41650957">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41650957">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For me personally, the effort of &#x27;polishing&#x27; a post makes it drastically more valuable to myself in the end: I think harder about the material; I notice problems with my thinking that I would have glossed over otherwise; I explain things in ways that will be more useful&#x2F;legible to me-five-years-from-now.<p>Committing myself to publish posts is, in part, sort of a motivational hack to get me to do the polishing. The possibility that someone else _might_ read it and judge me for it pushes me to put much more effort in than I would if I kept it private. (I wrote a short blog post on this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brokensandals.net&#x2F;personal&#x2F;reviews-as-notes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brokensandals.net&#x2F;personal&#x2F;reviews-as-notes&#x2F;</a>)<p>I probably wouldn&#x27;t see this as a sufficient reason for blogging if I believed that _literally_ nobody would _ever_ read the stuff I post.

For all of the reasons that the author listed, but also because it&#x27;s a mechanism to give back to the community that all of us rely on whether we&#x27;re writing code, making a recipe, doing a craft, learning a new hobby, etc.<p>A lot of younger devs tell me &quot;why would anyone want to read <i>my</i> writing&quot; and I show them YouTube and how many different videos there are on how to make a pancake (and more are added every day!).  There&#x27;s a different audience for every voice and someone out there is looking for your voice.  Everyone should make a habit to write in long form.</div><br/><div id="41648546" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41648546" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kstrauser</span><span>|</span><a href="#41647489">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41647302">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41648546">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41648546">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I never can tell what will resonate, either.

I had a recent stint of not writing due to very intense discouragement and feeling like a bit of a fraud. Like Jonas, I was writing for myself and kind of lived in a bubble where my posts had no comment system and I saw around 5 visitors per day on average with the odd boom to hundreds to thousands for a day or two. This was rare. I didn&#x27;t worry much about what I wrote so much as how much I enjoyed writing it.<p>Eventually I was struggling in the job market and someone suggested that my writing was hurting my prospects. They found the odd typo and grammar mistake, thought the content wasn&#x27;t particularly good, that it was hard to follow&#x2F;disjointed, etc.<p>I immediately took it all down and felt like a bit of a fool to have thought anyone would actually find it useful. Maybe I should have written it but kept it offline like a personal journal, I thought.<p>After a year or so it occurred to me how incredibly wrong all of that was. I never should have taken anything offline. I&#x27;ve hired people before, many times, and not once did I stumble across a candidate&#x27;s personal blog and think &quot;ugh, typos. grammar mistakes. no thanks&quot;. These things are a signal of a person&#x27;s character, curiosity, ability, and all kinds of other factors that matter a lot. Almost always these things helped people I was hiring more than it hurt. There&#x27;s the odd case where I could tell the site wasn&#x27;t followed through on and that&#x27;s not great, but it&#x27;s very relatable too.<p>I took a while but started writing again, started sharing it in an attempt to shake the self-doubt out of myself, and it has been an incredibly refreshing and rejuvenating experience. Writing reminds me of what I love about programming, because I primarily write about the things I find fascinating or engaging. It gives me a greater sense of knowledge and ability as I&#x27;ve covered a topic so thoroughly. It&#x27;s a mental exercise not only in writing itself, but understanding.<p>Jonas says this and I couldn&#x27;t agree more: something about it is just fun. I can&#x27;t put my finger on it. When I&#x27;m writing, I&#x27;m in a focused and engaged state almost instantly. It&#x27;s where I want to be.<p>If you doubt yourself and feel like writing isn&#x27;t for you—even though you enjoy it—I hope you can take something from my experience and realize that it&#x27;s still worth it. No one cares if you don&#x27;t write like an acclaimed author. No one cares if there&#x27;s the odd typo or bad grammar. The point is to enjoy it, and share that with people who are curious. The more you do it, the better you&#x27;ll get. It can become a real source of joy in your life.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41649237" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41649237" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aprdm</span><span>|</span><a href="#41648799">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41649242">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41649237">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41649237">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">With all the AI generated content, we will be having AI models using AI generated text on the internet.

I have a few theories.<p>One is that the developer doesn&#x27;t really <i>want</i> to ultimately write a game.<p>Creating the assets needed for a game, as an example, can be daunting. Implementing high scores, audio, saving game state.... There is a lot of work to create a game beyond the rendering part.<p>Or the developer is intimidated by the more qualitative nature of the &quot;game part&quot; of the game. The engine can be measured in FPS, etc. How do you measure how fun the game is?<p>A recent approach I took was to write the game &quot;firstmost&quot; — the game engine was a necessity to realizing that goal. FWIW, I used SDL to create a kind of sprite engine. The &quot;engine&quot; was bare-bones but allowed me to recreate a shareware game of mine for Steam.<p>After the project was done I began a second (sprite-based) game by first moving over the same game engine code. But this new project required I extend the engine (there were new &quot;feature requirements&quot; unique to this new game).<p>In this way the engine can evolve from project to project, but never becomes a <i>means to no end</i>.<p>(And if you do it right, you ought to be able to pull the engine back into the original project with a minimal of refactoring.)<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just suggesting something that everyone already knows.</div><br/><div id="41648135" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41648135" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">probably_wrong</span><span>|</span><a href="#41647903">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41648059">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41648135">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41648135">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have a different theory.

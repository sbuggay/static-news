If they&#x27;re getting chicken it&#x27;s not going to be whole and uncooked. It&#x27;ll be sold in a plastic bag leaching PFAS into the food and be coated in high fructose corn syrup (most packaged lunch meats have sugar or HFCS added). Those kinds of places tend to have very little fresh fruit and veg as well.<p>If you&#x27;re looking at cost per calorie unhealthy food will often win out as less costly, not just in terms of money but also time and effort. Someone who works two jobs and spends hours sitting on or walking to&#x2F;from the bus isn&#x27;t always going to have the energy or time to roast a chicken.

America, saviours of the world. It entirely discounts the contributions that other countries globally make. Countries in the European Union, Australasia, etc.<p>The US cost of healthcare is about 17% of GDP. In other first world nations it&#x27;s about 11%. This isn&#x27;t service delivery or value, it&#x27;s underlying cost. Per capita healthcare costs over twice of what it does in the UK. Similar for Australia. Both those are socialised and have very active R&amp;D communities.<p>The average life expectancy in the US is about 78. In other first world nations it&#x27;s almost unilaterally closer to 84.<p>The US is ranked 69th globally in terms.of health system performance. The US is also ranked worse than the OECD38 average for death by preventable causes.<p>The biggest difference between those places I mention and the above is that the US views healthcare as a capitalist endeavour and tries to claim that competition will lower prices. Quite the opposite has occurred, and the system has become perverted. Intellectual property laws applied in this fashion ensure that you cannot have competition for health care since drugs are limited to a single supplier. You also don&#x27;t get a choice in hospital care or doctors in most cases when you really look at how medical competition works.<p>In other places, the costs are socialised through taxation. Drugs are purchased through nationalised efforts where suppliers must either come to the table and negotiate prices properly or lose access to entire markets.

My biology class had a poster of all the things AIDS could present as (kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma, etc).  At the time HIV was effectively a death sentence and it really affected places like SF heavily.<p>One of my main motivations in college and grad school was to work in drug discovery, specifically for HIV.  At the time (~1995-2000) we were just starting to see positive results from protease inhibitors and reverse transcriptase inhibtors came somewhat later leading to the current &quot;managment of HIV through HART&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Management_of_HIV&#x2F;AIDS" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Management_of_HIV&#x2F;AIDS</a><p>All of this came slowly - decades between significant new technologies&#x2F;improvements in treatment.  many sources of infection such as blood transfusions are now much less risky (people in the 70s and 80s were getting hep C and HIV from blood taken from HIV-positive donors).  And the disease presents very differently in the US vs. other areas such as Sub-Saharan africa.  But with extensive effort, prevention has gotten better and treatments have gotten much better.  If there are truly usable preventatives for at-risk populations, and those medications are affordable, it will be a huge boon to the recipients.<p>Some interesting things to note:<p>- there was a lot of controversy about the source of infection and a lot of people used this to criticize gay people and injected drug users.<p>- one of the world&#x27;s most famous virologists, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Peter_Duesberg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Peter_Duesberg</a> actively denied that HIV caused AIDS and instead thought it was transmitted by drug use.  Note &quot;Duesberg entered a long dispute with John Maddox, then-editor of the scientific journal Nature, demanding the right to rebut articles that HIV caused AIDS.&quot; which I think presages the current arguments about what scientists can say regarding the origins of COVID.  The impact of his statements in South Africa was significant.  From what I can tell he was completely off base and never made any truly convincing arguments for his position.<p>- Fauci, of COVID fame, played a big role in getting NIH and the various AIDS community organzations working together and making large improvements to HIV&#x2F;AIDS treatment.  Before that, Fauci was heavily criticized by various LBGTQ orgs (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;12&#x2F;31&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;anthony-fauci-hiv-aids-act-up.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;12&#x2F;31&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;anthony-fauci-hiv...</a>) &quot;Larry Kramer, one of the group’s founders, wrote an open letter to Dr. Fauci in The Village Voice calling him a murderer and comparing him to the Holocaust organizer Adolf Eichmann.&quot;  Again, all this presages the later treatment of Fauci by various political groups during COVID.  I often think back to Fauci during HIV&#x2F;AIDS while reflecting on the current situation around COVID and I think we got lucky to find somebody like him, even if he said a few dumb things, and we&#x27;ll be lucky if any public servants are willing to take up his role in the future.<p>- modern gene therapy often uses variants on HIV as the vector. That&#x27;s right: it&#x27;s so good at getting into cells and modifying the genome, that we use it as the preferred method.  it took quite some time before the vectors were made safe enough (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5152689&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5152689&#x2F;</a>)</div><br/><div id="40743842" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40743842" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mrmetanoia</span><span>|</span><a href="#40743198">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40743541">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40744211">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40743842">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40743842">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One of my in-laws is a full on Fox news nut, but has a rare condition that he received treatments for as part of an NIH study that did him a world of good and Fauci was one of the doctors that worked on it, as a result the bits of nuttery he didn&#x27;t buy into were attempts to discredit Fauci or anti-vax stuff.

In the period you quoted, the variants based on the massive BA.2.86 saltation took over, including JN.1 which was fully dominant by January. XBB.1.5 and BA.2.86 are antigenically very different. I would not be surprised if the case ratio between the two branches during the period was in fact 55:45, i.e. matching the CDC&#x27;s 54%.<p>Regrettably, this is one&#x27;s on the FDA, as XBB.1.5 was already on the way out when the FDA chose it. Part of the problem was their desire to include Novavax in the lineup. It has a much longer update turnaround time than Moderna and Pfizer, and Novavax had already committed to XBB.1.5 by the time the 2023 VRBPAC meeting took place.<p>As for the original vaccine, the waning measurements were in terms of antibody titers, not in terms of actual effectiveness against the target variant. Delta emerged in the spring of 2021, and it had significant immune escape from WT (Wuhan.) By the time the population was immunized against WT, Delta had already driven WT out.<p>There have not been many reported cases of non-immunocompromised people getting infected with the <i>exact same variant</i> they had been vaccinated against or previously infected with, particularly with WT. There has been too much evolution in the timeline to even dig out the signal.<p>The original WT mRNA effectiveness measurements were 92-95% IIRC. For all we know, the missing 5-8% might be attributable to immune deficits, early infections, and&#x2F;or incomplete B-cell maturation. I haven&#x27;t noticed any research that measured the likelihood of single-variant breakthrough infection, but if you find some I&#x27;d like to look at it.<p>As for other diseases, they are not in the pandemic phase, so their vaccines can be optimized accordingly.<p>I would dispute that &quot;easily evolve&quot; notion, though. There have been billions of Covid cases since 2019, including countless immunocompromised patients who are basically walking virus incubators. Yet there have only been a handful of major saltations.

PURPOSE 1, a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized study, is evaluating the safety and efficacy of twice-yearly, subcutaneous lenacapavir for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and once-daily oral Descovy® (emtricitabine 200mg and tenofovir alafenamide 25mg; F&#x2F;TAF) in more than 5,300 cisgender women and adolescent girls aged 16-25 across 25 sites in South Africa and three sites in Uganda. The drugs are being tested in parallel, with one group receiving twice-yearly lenacapavir and one group taking once-daily oral Descovy. Additionally, a third group was assigned once-daily oral Truvada. Study participants were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to lenacapavir, Descovy and Truvada, respectively. Because effective PrEP options already exist, there is broad consensus in the PrEP field that a placebo group would be unethical; thus, the trial used bHIV as the primary comparator and Truvada as a secondary comparator.<p>There were 0 incident cases of HIV infection among 2,134 women in the lenacapavir group (incidence 0.00 per 100 person-years). There were 16 incident cases among 1,068 women in the Truvada group (incidence 1.69 per 100 person-years). The results demonstrated superiority of twice-yearly lenacapavir over bHIV (primary endpoint, incidence 2.41 per 100 person-years) and superiority of twice-yearly lenacapavir over once-daily Truvada (secondary endpoint), with p&lt;0.0001 for both endpoints. In the trial, lenacapavir was generally well-tolerated and no significant or new safety concerns were identified.<p>[...]<p>Gilead expects results in late 2024&#x2F;early 2025 from the program’s other pivotal trial, PURPOSE 2, which is assessing twice-yearly lenacapavir for PrEP among cisgender men who have sex with men, transgender men, transgender women and gender non-binary individuals who have sex with partners assigned male at birth in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, Thailand and the United States.

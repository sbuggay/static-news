The apple version only loaded the current tile into memory - every time you stepped off screen, it would load the new tile from a floppy and reset your character position to the opposite edge (e.g. walk off the right edge, load the tile to the right and reset your character to the left side at the same height).<p>I found out (largely by accident, initially) that if you removed the floppy, it would try to read a couple times, and then give up. It would still reset your character position to the other side of the screen but not update the actual tile graphics &amp; platform locations. You could use this to cheat past otherwise impassible barriers - find a tile you could walk all the way from one edge of to the other at the same height as the barrier, take out the floppy, walk across the tile the right number of times so you are in the tile &#x27;past&#x27; the barrier, then put the floppy back in and walk back so you&#x27;re now on the other side. :)<p>The version I played also had a charming bug(?) where if you underflowed a stat counter (e.g. by doing a 5 manna action when you only had 4 manna left) the game would print the message &quot;I have nothing more to give&quot; and then lock up, leaving it ambiguous whether it was your character that had nothing more to give, or the actual game.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41166365" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41166365" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">StrictDabbler</span><span>|</span><a href="#41166607">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41166663">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41166365">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41166365">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have also been obsessed with &quot;Below the Root&quot; since it came out.<p>Dale Disharoon&#x2F;DeSharone had an odd insight into textures. Look at the ladders. Look at the vines, both those that can be climbed and those that can be cut with a &quot;trencher beak&quot;. Look at the way the trees evoke growing wood. The visuals are much more evocative than should be possible at this resolution.<p>Dale also did a Disney-licensed Apple II game based on &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; which is similar in character to &quot;Below the Root&quot; and a game based on &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. Both are strange and mystical and full of odd vines that remind me of the patterns left by the cellular automaton &quot;Langton&#x27;s Ant&quot;.<p>All Dale&#x27;s games were unfair and opaque but that was the state of the art.</div><br/><div id="41167235" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41167235" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwanem</span><span>|</span><a href="#41166365">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41166663">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41167235">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41167235">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I never said I didn&#x27;t care for the presentation.

You&#x27;d be surprised at how often a simple request like this can lead to you being able to breathe new life into an old game.<p>Story time. A favorite game of mine as a young child was an old DOS game called Redhooks&#x27; Revenge. It was essentially a graphical naval adventure where each player would take turns rolling dice and moving their ship. Landing on ports would allow you to conquer them Risk-style, and at various times you would be asked a maritime-themed trivia question depending on the square you landed on. Answering correctly would give you bonuses like rum, water, extra cannons, etc.<p>My sister and I used to play it for hours on end to the point where we&#x27;d basically both memorized all the quiz questions. Decades later, I was messing around with the files, attempting to figure out a way to add additional trivia questions. I ended up reverse-engineering the weird binary format of the asset file to randomly inject customized trivia into the game every time it was started. You had to be really careful when injecting the questions not to accidentally alter any additional addresses in the file; otherwise, the game would just crash.<p>Out of random curiosity, I looked up the original company, ImagiSOFT, and got in touch with the author, who happily gave me permission to develop an official sequel, Redhook&#x27;s Revenge II: Call of Booty.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;specularrealms.com&#x2F;redhook" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;specularrealms.com&#x2F;redhook</a></div><br/><div id="41167250" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41167250" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JKCalhoun</span><span>|</span><a href="#41166663">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41166834">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41167250">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41167250">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Someone reached out to me because they wanted to implement my old game Glider on a Nintendo cartridge (1).

Generally one that was otherwise meaningless, like &quot;what is the fourth word on page 6?&quot;.<p>It was also standard to provide a little gameplay to people who failed the copy protection, as a demo of the game.<p>Civilization&#x27;s implementation of these ideas was that, after a certain number of turns, the game would bring up a screen displaying the artwork for a technology, and ask you which technologies were the prerequisites for that one. This information was present in the manual.<p>However, it was also a core part of the game itself, which meant two things.<p>First, if you were familiar with the game, the odds were good that you&#x27;d recognize the technology in question from the artwork (displayed every game in a mandatory cutscene whenever you learned the technology), and know the prerequisites.<p>Second, because this information was critical to gameplay, it was included in the in-game Civilopedia, and you were free to look it up during play, including early-game play before the copy protection question popped up.<p>(Third, the answer format was multiple-choice selection from four possibilities, making guessing quite viable. Guessing wrong got you an instant game over.)<p>It&#x27;s the only software I know of where the copy protection had absolutely no effect on your ability to use the software.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41166801" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41166801" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">immibis</span><span>|</span><a href="#41166663">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41168058">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41165715">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41166801">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41166801">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For me, it would be &quot;Theatre: An interactive night of horror&quot;[1], the first interactive fiction work I ever saw.

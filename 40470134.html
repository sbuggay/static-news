Instead, it&#x27;s a stamp (like what you see on [0]).  It&#x27;s a big stamp, but it&#x27;s just a stamp.<p>That&#x27;s OK, though, because the person making the stamp is keeping a lot of records, so they&#x27;ll know what they stamped.<p>When I first got my Treasury Direct[1] account, I couldn&#x27;t verify my identity using their online process, and so I had to mail in FS Form 5444[1].  My local credit union had &quot;Medallion Service&quot; as one of the reasons for booking an appointment (separate from &quot;Notary&quot;), and they were able to take care of it.  As mentioned in the article, the person at the credit union asked me for a monetary value.  As it was a new Treasury Direct account, I said &quot;$10,000&quot; (the maximum amount of Series I bonds you can get per calendar year).<p>And as implied in the article, my credit union had no problems issuing this, even though they were not involved in Treasury Direct in any way.<p>It&#x27;s interesting, all the &#x27;little&#x27; &#x27;home-grown&#x27; ways of identity guarantee that pop up when needed.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bankofamerica.com&#x2F;signature-services&#x2F;medallion-signature-guarantee&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bankofamerica.com&#x2F;signature-services&#x2F;medallion-s...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.treasurydirect.gov&#x2F;forms&#x2F;acctauth.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.treasurydirect.gov&#x2F;forms&#x2F;acctauth.pdf</a></div><br/><div id="40473145" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40473145" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bostik</span><span>|</span><a href="#40472246">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40472489">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40473145">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40473145">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not in the US, but can fully appreciate the practice.<p>If I were to request to move funds in 6-to-7 figures range across institutions, I <i>absolutely</i> would want the receiving outfit require that I visit my current outfit in person first to authorise such a transfer. Making sure that such visits are smooth and efficient is good service.<p>On a related note, when I got my mortgage in the UK, the issuing bank&#x2F;lender-arm required me and my wife each to get a Proof Of Being Alive. (I&#x27;m not a UK native.) Turns out embassies issue these quite routinely, for a modest fee, and a visit that lasts at most 15 minutes. At the time I found that requirement both confusing and irritating, but in the context of the article, it makes sense. The lender was about to issue a sufficiently large loan to a person with very limited[ß] UK transaction history.<p>On the upside, more recently that same bank&#x2F;lender prodded and arranged me to get an early, admittedly pretty good fixed deal on my remortgage - two months before the central banks started to hike their rates. Without that early intervention my current rate would be at least three percentage points higher.<p>ß: from the viewpoint of a financial institution, who likely measures customer relationship ages in decades.</div><br/><div id="40473640" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40473640" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CaliforniaKarl</span><span>|</span><a href="#40472246">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40473145">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40472489">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40473640">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40473640">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I absolutely would want the receiving outfit require that I visit my current outfit in person first to authorise such a transfer.<p>So, about that…  The Medallion Signature Guarantee is often obtained from an entity not involved in the transfer.  From [0] on my post:<p>&gt; We do not provide medallion signature guarantees for assets you&#x27;re transferring out of a Bank of America or Merrill account (guarantees are typically provided by a third party not involved in the transfer or by the firm receiving the assets).<p>In a way, that&#x27;s a good thing: By the time you&#x27;ve initiated this transfer, the receiving entity should have done their KYC.  And the losing entity probably would not want to take the cost of the liability.  Having a third party—one who has had you as a customer for some time—is a good layer of security.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40472489" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40472489" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">daft_pink</span><span>|</span><a href="#40472246">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40471398">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40472489">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40472489">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The other side of this is that I’ve absolutely had a SEC advisor tell me that I couldn’t access my money unless I kept my account with him and the bank had to verify my access to the money if I wanted to transfer it, but if I stayed I could keep it.  ACATS ultimately protects the consumer from keeping their money with unscrupulous advisors.<p>I agree with the author that it is totally terrifying, but I feel the assets should be kept with a third party or third party verification service so that the broker isn’t incentivices to “verity” details.<p>I think medallions are a good solution to this problem and like the author of the piece says they are shockingly easy to get.  I think that the advisors themselves receiving the money generally have huge relationships with the companies they work with that issue medallions and even the third party companies with relationships with the receiving advisor will generally provide one for free even if the person doesn’t have one.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40471398" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40471398" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">e63f67dd-065b</span><span>|</span><a href="#40472489">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40472211">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40471398">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40471398">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I never knew about the 3-day limit before, it makes sense that this is the reason behind unverified ACATS transfers (a problem that I&#x27;ve spent no small amount of time arguing about on various online forums long ago).<p>Interestingly, Fidelity lets you put your account into &quot;lockdown&quot; mode there they&#x27;ll reject all ACATS (and ACH too I believe) transfers automatically without your intervention.

For the &quot;financial system&quot;, $1000 is nothing. For many people, $1000 means the difference between having something to eat or not. Even if you get your money back in the end, not having any money for several days can be a disaster; and the 1% chance that you might not get that back can be too much risk to bear.<p>&gt; I have family members that are so scared of card skimming they only pay in cash<p>That&#x27;s understandable. With cash, all you can lose is the cash you have in hand at that moment; if your card is skimmed and used without your permission, you can lose up to the card&#x27;s limit (and perhaps even more, if the limit isn&#x27;t strictly enforced). You might say that fraudulent transactions will be reversed, but there&#x27;s always that 1% chance that the other side will somehow manage to convince your bank that the transactions were in fact legitimate.<p>&gt; and friends who are still too scared of the internet to buy things online.<p>When you buy at a store, the goods you bought are in your physical possession at the moment of the payment. When you buy things online, the goods you bought show up days or even weeks later, if they do, and until they arrive, you have no idea whether they&#x27;re actually what you bought (and that&#x27;s on top of the &quot;card skimming&quot; risk).<p>Sure, if you have enough resources, you can tolerate losing $1000 of the limit of one of your credit cards for a few days until the charge is reversed (and even, in the worst case, absorb the loss in case that charge isn&#x27;t reversed), but not everyone can do that. And the perceived risk can be higher than the unknowable real risk; someone who has heard about (or experienced) enough incidents in which money was lost (temporarily or not) will understandably be more reluctant to expose themselves to these risks.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40472525" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40472525" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">acheong08</span><span>|</span><a href="#40471398">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40471453">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40471595">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40472211">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40472525">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40472525">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I once had to starve for 2 days because my bank froze my card over the weekend and being in a new country, had no cash with me (the nearest exchange was too far away by foot)<p>Nowadays I pretty much have the bare minimum in the bank and just spend cash.</div><br/><div id="40472813" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40472813" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">skybrian</span><span>|</span><a href="#40471398">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40472525">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40472211">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40472813">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40472813">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Having multiple, independent payment methods, of any sort, seems like the way to go.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40472211" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40472211" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">icedchai</span><span>|</span><a href="#40471398">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40471616">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40472211">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40472211">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had to get a medallion stamp to do an ACATS transfer from broker A to B.

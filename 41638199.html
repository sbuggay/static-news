Similarly, for the buy agent half, they will get multiple extra % of home price above that 2.5%.<p>The structure of the MLS &#x2F; commission system incentivizes sellers to take out these large fees because they will be rewarded for doing so.

Why? Because I have a strong analytical approach to the market and I actually do my job. The typical agent waits for offers to come in and makes no effort to negotiate a better outcome for their seller. Likewise, many agents are lazy and have no idea how to advise their buyers on what to offer or how to create an overall compelling offer, IE: what are the possible levers we can use to create a competitive offer apart from cash on the barrel? It makes me cry when I see agents who don&#x27;t even know what acting in their client&#x27;s best interest means - but I don&#x27;t blame them, I blame the public that makes no effort to interview or get to know their agent. Way easier to pick the person from your church or who you went to high school with than to actually interview and ask questions.

Sellers are not setting the price for their house, buyers bidding for it do.<p>Anyone selling a house using an agent isn’t someone who manufactures houses. They are mostly people selling their own home because they are moving to a different home.<p>They are going to put their house up for sale, buyers will make offers, and the seller will choose the best offer. The buyers are making offers based on what they are willing and able to pay; they don’t care whether 100% of that sale price goes to the seller or if only 94% does. They are making the same offer no matter what.<p>And sellers aren’t going to take 6% less if they don’t have an agent. They are going to take the same offer whether they get 94% of it or 100%; they are taking the best offer made.<p>Even your app example isn’t how it works. There is no “break even” price for a digital good that doesn’t have a COG (cost of good). App manufacturing has a fixed price, and then every unit sold costs them zero dollars.<p>They are going to set the price to be what maximizes the value of “cost per unit * units sold”. That equation is going to be the same no matter what the App Store percentage is. The only thing the percentage does will be to change the amount of money the company makes and change the equation on whether it is worth making the app at all; once the app is created, the only thing that will determine the price is the equation above, not the cost per sale.<p>So many people seem to have this idea that prices for things are based on some “cost per good + profit margin = price”, but that isn’t how any good is priced. Many goods end up being priced in a way that is close to that, but that is only because of robust competition. Prices are set by the seller trying to figure out which price will generate them the most profit; the cost to make the good only sets a price floor, where if they can’t get more than that amount, it simply isn’t even worth it to make and sell the good. It has nothing to do with the price ceiling.</div><br/><div id="41641730" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41641730" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pzo</span><span>|</span><a href="#41638907">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41641518">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41639789">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41641730">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41641730">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; They are making the same offer no matter what<p>Obviously seller can decide if agree on minimum price.

The vast majority of software engineers do not make a percentage of the earnings of the product they&#x27;re developing. If I work for a company making 150k&#x2F;year, I don&#x27;t suddenly start making 300k&#x2F;year if the company sells my software for twice as much. Likewise, I can&#x27;t charge twice as much for consulting just because the company I&#x27;m consulting for makes twice as much money.<p>An agent makes a commission based only on the value of the house, which incentivizes them to sell more expensive houses. When I purchased my house, I did most of the work (found the house, hired a home inspector, found my own mortgage, used my own lawyer) - the agent existed because it was basically required, and made 11k for roughly 15 hours of work. If I was wealthier, and could have afforded a more expensive house, they could have made 20k for 15 hours of work. In both cases, they did the exact same amount of work (minimal); why did they make more in the second scenario?<p>Now that I know how the system works, I will be avoiding agents if at all possible when I sell my current house and buy my next. They&#x27;re about as useful as used car salesmen, but somehow have convinced the entire continent that the housing market will fall apart without them.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41640992" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41640992" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">WillPostForFood</span><span>|</span><a href="#41638907">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41640636">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41641014">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41641011">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41640992">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41640992">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They don&#x27;t deserve $6,000, or $60,000 which is 6%!</div><br/></div></div><div id="41641011" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41641011" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bookofjoe</span><span>|</span><a href="#41638907">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41640636">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41640992">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41639960">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41641011">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41641011">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">6% of $1M = $60,000</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41639960" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41639960" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rco8786</span><span>|</span><a href="#41638907">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41639109">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41639817">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41641582">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41639960">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41639960">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">IF they can deliver a product that actually works, yes.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41641582" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41641582" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">IAmGraydon</span><span>|</span><a href="#41638907">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41639109">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41642586">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41641582">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41641582">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;I don’t know any other real estate people who know anything about code<p>CRE professional here (about a decade in the industry) who was a coder first.

Well guess what? The sewer line was fucked, and could back up at any moment and destroy the finished basement.<p>Thus ensued many many more emails and small changes to contracts that many people needed to sign. It seemed like such a random thing, but all of a sudden $10,000 was on the line that nobody knew existed. All because my agent had worked in that neighborhood before, and knew that those sewer lines were all old!!<p>After that experience, I’m convinced you cannot automate out the human element of real estate. There is so much nuance, and the stakes are so high.<p>But like you said, I think there’s room for a LOT of automation in tools that realtors <i>use</i>. And if you can make realtors more productive, maybe you can get fees down.<p>I think that’s compass’s main draw. They make a bunch of fancy internal tools for their realtors to use, so that they can do more business at a lower rate.

You can see what I was working on here (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;findur.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;findur.io</a>). The app is active but the business is shut down. I just leave it up to have as a portfolio project at this point. I&#x27;ve learned many hard lessons from doing this journey.<p>Lessons learned that might help you guys out:
- Consumers want everything Zillow has. Until you actually build Zillow AND THEN start to innovate on top of that, people won&#x27;t come.
- Zillow is developing the &quot;everything app&quot; for home buyers. Read their quarterly reports you&#x27;ll get insight to what they are doing
- Consumers in this market won&#x27;t pay for a service give Zillow and others are free. Market is tough
- Brokers are paying other fees and don&#x27;t want to buy additional software. 
- Realtors are not doing well in this market so this must be a huge value add or they won&#x27;t come. They also require a mobile version because they are on the road a lot.
- Validate that your company is not just a &quot;feature&quot; but truly something different. A lot of times, Zillow can just build out the feature itself. It already has a first pass at using LLMs for search</div><br/></div></div><div id="41640159" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41640159" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">simplyluke</span><span>|</span><a href="#41640617">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41639824">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41640159">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41640159">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t see anyone asking the question that to me is the elephant in the room:<p>How are you preventing hallucinations and plainly false information being sent to buyers engaging in what&#x27;s likely to be one of the largest financial decisions of their life?

A good RE agent will be honest with you if the asking price is ridiculous in either direction. They know all the little local details and laws that are easy for a layperson to miss. They&#x27;ll help you deal with a difficult buyer&#x2F;seller. They know where the flood plains are. They know about zoning. They know who to call when the weirdest shit pops up. There are few other areas in life where ignoring (or not seeing) non-obvious red flags can ruin a person or family so completely.<p>I have had bad RE agents that were uncooperative paper-pushers who kept dropping the ball, and I have had good RE agents that were worth every single penny they earned.<p>If you want to be mad at something, I suggest looking into the National Association of Realtors.

If it costs $0.50 more to make a compostable container, you can bet most companies will buy the cheap plastic.<p>I’m shocked at the single use waste that can be found in the restaurant industry. One of my favorite places used plastic for everything: cutlery, plates, cups. Their trash bins would be filled every day, and for what? To save a few cents? I feel customer facing plastics should all be compostable as a first step, if also for its social awareness impact.<p>What’s the best way to develop good policy? Pin point a few industries with maximum benefit&#x2F;minimum cost to legislate for and expand from there? Or write a more holistic law that the entire population could then collectively weasel around, but it would be “fair” and “make sense”?</div><br/><div id="40333035" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40333035" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AstralStorm</span><span>|</span><a href="#40332412">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40332825">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40333035">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40333035">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They almost all are compostable these days, even sometimes wooden or paper.

Now we get random gifts, usually food or fruits or some flower or plant.<p>Now we have little get togethers inviting each other, text to ask if need anything from the store, etc.  And all it took was being willing to sit outside for a couple hours each night and say hi.</div><br/><div id="36132960" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36132960" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AndrewKemendo</span><span>|</span><a href="#36129908">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36134352">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36132960">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36132960">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes this exactly.

Just takes a little practice, right&#x2F;good equipment, and good ingredients. My main tip is get them live. Get them purged and cleaned if possible. Otherwise just another simple skill to learn but definitely don’t want poopy crawfish. I find people devour the potatoes and corn. Then about 4 lbs of crawfish per person (some people will eat none and some will eat 10 lbs so hard to estimate).<p>You can probably get the decent starter recipe online as it’s pretty basic and you’ll just start with a premix of spices. I wouldn’t recommend DIY approach for a bit on spices. Do a couple practice runs to build muscle memory and adjust how spicy(hot) you like it.<p>I grew up around it but even still I had to watch some YouTube videos to spark my memory of what the adults were actually doing. So just invest some time there as well.<p>Good luck with the boils!<p>Edit: to add, I also have to drive a bit. It was partially the genesis for this as I realized I somehow crossed this border where I was no longer near the gulf coast but inland and although I’m in same state it’s actually quite a different culture where I am versus closer to the coast.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36133074" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36133074" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thepasswordis</span><span>|</span><a href="#36129908">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36134352">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36131054">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36133074">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36133074">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Based and grill-pilled.<p>We&#x27;ve been doing the same.

She&#x27;d go riding her bike around the neighborhood, and a few people stopped by because &quot;the little girl on the bike said I should come meet you guys.&quot;<p>I will say it was easier, to me, to do so when first moving in.

It&#x27;s definitely true that homes with lawns make this easier than say apartments. Part of this is that you&#x27;re more likely to spend time outside owning a home as you need to simply work on the yard. But the main causal factor is likely just seeing people frequently. Like one reason it was easier to make friends in school was simply because you sat next to people and see them every day. That builds relationships. The same thing happens with work, you spend 8+ hrs a day there with the same people. Some businesses try to curb this, which is curbing natural human interactions and others encourage it too much which feels forced. Weirdly the most significant factor to building relationships is spending time with people. More so than things like religion (correlates because time in church), politics, or other things that we think are major barriers and encourages us to turn to bubbles.</div><br/><div id="36133368" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36133368" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lannisterstark</span><span>|</span><a href="#36129908">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36133264">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36130082">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36133368">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36133368">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Right, I currently live in a townhouse and as the other posters posted, the only time we see our neighbors is when they get out of the car and go inside.<p>On the other hand, when I used to live in a single-floor-only apartment complex (more &#x27;two apartments in a single building&#x27; built together), I used to interact with my neighbors quite a lot.<p>I do eventually want to move to a State where there is less brown and more green (arizona rn - so the prospect of sitting outside isn&#x27;t that great during summer evenings), and where places are a bit more spaced apart.

You&#x27;ve got a lot of &quot;fake&quot; black belts in TKD in part because it&#x27;s mostly forms work and not really tested. Some sparing matches go hard, but that&#x27;s rarely the case as you don&#x27;t really want to be kicking with full force with your sparing partner. So the skill vs skill tests are much more limited.<p>In BJJ, you&#x27;re typically going to be rolling with full effort. You&#x27;re going to be put in a real choke hold and you&#x27;re really going to go to sleep if you don&#x27;t tap. We don&#x27;t slam the joint locks the way you might see in a tournament setting with money on the line, but a slow and safe arm bar will work as well if you&#x27;ve actually got control of the limb. So for me the ranking in BJJ feels more aligned to actual ability to me than my experience with TKD did because you&#x27;re getting a real test of your skills every class. The sorting feels more natural and everyone can clearly see the differences in skill play out daily.<p>You respect your classmates and seniors more because of your experiences rolling with them and less because it&#x27;s demanded by the belt system and and built in by tradition.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36131021" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36131021" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nostromo</span><span>|</span><a href="#36130729">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36132544">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36130883">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36131021">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36131021">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Or a team.<p>I joined a rugby team that is open to everyone but highlights lgbt inclusivity in sport.

Obviously if you&#x27;re a staunch atheist or otherwise just can&#x27;t stomach the idea of &quot;God,&quot; then visiting a church not recommended. But if you grew up Christian and drifted away, or you can entertain the possibility of a higher power, then I recommend checking out a church as a place to find community.<p>Denominations are different flavors of Christianity, and which denomination you visit is important. I&#x27;m personally a member of &quot;The Episcopal Church,&quot; which I find to have a very small amount of dogma and is tolerant of a wide range of beliefs. The theological dogma can be summarized in the &quot;Nicene Creed,&quot; which is a pretty short list of what the church holds to be true (and even if you as individual differ, TEC is chill about that). After that, members of The Episcopal Church are more united in what they <i>do</i> together rather than what they <i>believe</i> togther - songs, taking communion, common readings, etc. The Episcopl Church is generally one of the more liberal&#x2F;progressive churches around (we ordain women and LGBTQ individuals into the clergy and perform same-sex marriages, for example).<p>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a nice group of people that I see every week. A lot of churches have a &quot;coffee hour&quot; or a meal after the service, and it&#x27;s a time to chit chat with others. They care about me and I care about them, and people check in on each other to see how everyone is doing. When we had a baby, people brought us food, and we always get cards in the mail for birthdays and such. It&#x27;s nice.<p>Since we&#x27;re a <i>community</i> of people, we can sometimes work together to accomplish things I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do on my own. We run a food pantry and we&#x27;ve supported families fleeing from bad situations (and not in abstract sense, but doing the legwork of finding an apartment in town and providing furniture and stuff). One family attends our services, and their kid is about my kid&#x27;s age, so we&#x27;ve become friends over that.<p>Again, I know religion can invoke strong feelings, so if the very idea is offputting, leave it alone, it&#x27;s fine. But for me, it&#x27;s been a community I&#x27;ve appreciated having.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36129119" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36129119" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">etskinner</span><span>|</span><a href="#36128668">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36131682">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36130852">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36129119">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36129119">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For those who aren&#x27;t religious, there&#x27;s also Sunday Assembly: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sundayassembly.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sundayassembly.org&#x2F;</a><p>For those who are spiritual but not Christian, there&#x27;s also the Unitarian Universalist Association: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uua.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uua.org&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36130852" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36130852" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">slothtrop</span><span>|</span><a href="#36128668">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36129119">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36132573">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36130852">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36130852">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I expect sect&#x2F;denomination has an influence here because my experiences in the past were strictly familial, no one made friends there though there are familiar faces.

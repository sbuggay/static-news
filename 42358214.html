It&#x27;s extremely difficult to read this other than as conveying: (1) You do think this is what &quot;Russia&quot; (meaning its people) thinks, (2) That it&#x27;s a reasonable position we should have empathy with and extend credibility to, (3) including, implicitly but unavoidably the &quot;NATO was built to destroy Russia&quot; part.<p>Instead of treating it as the obvious hogwash that it is, that no reasonably sane and informed person would ever believe.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42396120" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42396120" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mopsi</span><span>|</span><a href="#42358345">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42394084">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42396744">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42395712">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42396120">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42396120">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Everything thing you say ignores what the Russians have been saying about NATO expansionism, and I think that is more key to understanding both sides of the issue.<p>The trouble with this narrative is that it has no connection with reality whatsoever. It is a cover story produced to lull distant foreigners into sleep; it is not connected to the actual developments in Russia or Russian relations with its neighbors. Nobody takes this story seriously in Russia; it is not discussed in military or policy circles. It is a pretext very much in the same tradition as German excuses for invading Poland.<p>Few people can offer better insight into &quot;understanding both sides&quot; than Andrei Kozyrev, the first foreign minister of Russian Federation, in office 1990-1996 and in charge of rebuilding foreign relations of the entire country after USSR&#x27;s demise. And he openly calls this narrative bullshit and people who fall for it idiots. Most key figures from pre-Putin Russia hold the same view.<p>NATO is a pain in the butt for Russia for the very simple reason that Russia still carries imperialist desire to roll over its neighbors, and a country being in NATO makes it much more difficult for them to invade. Without support from allies, Ukraine would&#x27;ve lost years ago, but with international support, they persist and have caused incredible losses to Russians. It&#x27;s simple calculus. Without NATO, Russian invasion of Poland would face only the fairly limited Polish conventional forces. With NATO, they would be potentially facing anything up to US carrier groups and British nuclear missiles. Risks associated with invading their neighbors go way up if they are in NATO, enough to deter from invading.<p>Understanding this, joining NATO and other international organizations has been a top foreign policy priority for most countries in Eastern Europe. &quot;Expansionism&quot; is a completely wrong word to use when the initiative for joining NATO has always been very intense in Eastern Europe, out of fear of Russian invasion, against lukewarm and skeptical acceptance by the existing members, who believed such fears to be overblown.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42395712" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42395712" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rat87</span><span>|</span><a href="#42358345">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42393316">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42393623">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42395691">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42395712">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42395712">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">the USSR is not russia and they dont want to destroy russia.

Instead of considering their points or even trying to ignore them he tried to suppress the protests with extreme violence and ridiculous anti protest laws people thought might lead to dictatorship like in neighboring Russia or Belarus. The Ukranian people didn&#x27;t like this and the protests grew and grew and grew. The EU and US encouraged the political opposition to make a compromise with the President even if it was unsatisfactory. But then the police who has been fighting the protesters got cold feet that the president would throw them under the bus in the deal, so they disappeared and the President decided to do the same. Since he abandoned his country and his post the legislature had no choice but to remove him from office including many from his own party.

information in this case will or should necessarily be made public. Indeed, there
are other ways to protect specific information in litigation. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ.
P. 26(c) (allowing for protective orders for “protect[ing] a party or person from
annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense” upon a
showing of “good cause”). The fact that these other means exist and are—in the
Court’s view—better suited to address Plaintiff’s instant concerns also indicates
that Plaintiff proceeding anonymously is not required to achieve the protection
he seeks. Thus, the Court makes clear that while it will not allow Plaintiff to

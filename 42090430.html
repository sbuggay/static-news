The person&#x2F;people who control your raise, bonus, and promotion are your real customers.<p>Think about it like this. A customer is the entity that exchanges money for something they value; like a good or service. That&#x27;s usually your manager. Or in the case of OP the promotion committee. (Many times it&#x27;s both your manager and the promotion committee). They are the ones who directly control your money (raise, bonus, promotion, etc).<p>With that perspective in mind it makes sense to manage your career as a business where you&#x27;re doing things to increase the rate at which you deliver value to the entity which can trade money for that value.<p>Many of the setbacks you faced are very common when trying to run your own business. The customer changes their mind, the market shifts the goal posts, you realize you&#x27;re focusing on the wrong things. Like a business you have to constantly change your strategy and adapt to the customer; not the other way around. Why? Because the customer can very easily get their goods or services from someone else if you can&#x27;t deliver what they want.</div><br/><div id="42092624" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42092624" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hinkley</span><span>|</span><a href="#42092156">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42092602">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42092624">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42092624">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And the user may also not be the customer.

You&#x27;ve done things in your career that I can only dream of doing. What I can say is that I&#x27;ve somehow managed to survive a quarter-century in a string of Big Tech companies without dropping out (yet).<p>It sounds like you may have been looking at the currents and picking the one that seemed best one to swim in. I found there&#x27;s often -- but not always -- another option: build a dam. In other words, change it up. Alter the landscape. Seek to change the business in a way that nobody&#x27;s been willing&#x2F;able to do before. Looking back at my career I found I was happiest and most successful when I was able to tell my boss what I was doing vs. waiting for my boss to tell me to do something interesting&#x2F;impactful&#x2F;etc.<p>When that option doesn&#x27;t seem to be presenting itself, it&#x27;s probably time to move on. But I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s often worth giving it a try first.<p>A couple of times I needed to earn the right to create my own destiny by pushing through some grunge work, but once I established a degree of trust with my management chain, that was capital I could &quot;cash in on&quot; by proposing something big, new, and interesting. It never ceases to amaze me to see how boldness often gets rewarded. I just saw a co-worker of mine draw blood from a stone (funding-wise) by proposing something ambitious and controversial last week. Suddenly they&#x27;re a TL of a new team this week. They&#x27;ve built a reputation for &quot;just getting it done,&quot; so management has confidence in their ability to execute and drive results.<p>Whenever I&#x27;m starting to feel stuck in a rut, that&#x27;s when I open a blank document and start hammering out a design for something new. I&#x27;m not even thinking about promotion when I do that.

The ones it did have made it look like things had gotten worse. My bug discoveries caused the overall bug count to increase. The pipeline’s failures increased because I made it fail fast on anomalies instead of silently passing along bad data.<p>I understand why the author might think this is better, but all software have bugs and a lot of data is tainted by those bugs. Was fixing the pipeline an actual priority? Was it critical? If so, how were the downstream internal customers dealing with the new exceptions? Why were they not raising a ruckus about it? Why was the author allowed to move on to a different project if there were so many bugs in that pipeline deserving of a promotion?<p>I have met more people in life that made a big deal out of ultimately unimportant details than the opposite. Internal pipelines usually have a lower bar and the downstream consumer may not even care about 75% of features that are just there and unused. Being a senior engineering is also knowing when to leave good enough alone.<p>&gt; My other work didn’t look so good on paper either. On several occasions, I put my projects on hold for weeks or even months at a time to help a teammate whose launch was at risk. It was the right decision for the team, but it looked unimpressive in a promo packet. To the promotion committee, my teammate’s project was the big, important work that demanded coordination from multiple developers. If they hornswoggled me into helping them, it’s evidence of their strong leadership qualities. I was just the mindless peon whose work was so irrelevant that it could be pre-empted at a moment’s notice.<p>Is that conclusion really wrong? It&#x27;s a bit uncharitable for sure but that is indeed what happened not just how it appeared to have happened. If your project was such a low priority that dropping it for several months does not flash a red light in someone&#x27;s dashboard, then I am sorry but that does not seem promotion worthy.<p>The little comic also has good examples that things that imo are not &quot;senior&quot; work. Writing E2E tests for a product that is already shipped is worthwhile, but unless it&#x27;s something very special it&#x27;s not complex enough, does not require enough design to be considered &quot;senior work&quot;.<p>Again I don&#x27;t know the guy, maybe he did get an unfair read on his body of work, but reading the entire blog I mostly get the vibes of &quot;I worked 2 years at Google and then wanted to be a senior so I rushed my promo packet without a cornerstone project&quot; and the committee refusing that is just the system working as intended.</div><br/><div id="42091443" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42091443" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mtlynch</span><span>|</span><a href="#42091280">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42093258">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42091443">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42091443">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hi, I&#x27;m &quot;the guy.&quot; Thanks for reading!<p>I largely agree with you.<p>I didn&#x27;t mean to argue that the work I was doing for the first two years merited a promotion.<p>My point was more that I felt frustrated that I was doing what my manager and team asked of me, told consistently that I did the work well, and then later found out that it was all worthless for career advancement.<p>I think there are competing interests at a large organization that make this difficult.

However, this so called &#x27;smart insulin&#x27; sounds to me much more like the shit produced by non-diabetics pancreases.  like theres just no way the non-diabetic body is making a hormone that doesnt fully kick in for 90 minutes.  that just wouldnt be as resilient and effective as what i witness in the people around me.  its insane how they can, for example, eat a tub of ice cream on a whim and not be blasted into the 400s.  or just go wild exercising at length on an empty stomach and not have an emergency low sugar.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42092118" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42092118" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">caseyy</span><span>|</span><a href="#42091950">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42092203">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42092118">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42092118">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is currently in a category of cures that are always a decade away. I am happy that the researchers are putting it out there to attract interest and investment, but the GRI-type insulins remained in lab settings for about 30 years now and it is somewhat troubling to not see progression into and through the stages of pharma clinical trials on T1D patients.<p>Clearly, there is tremendous potential to make money here – diabetes is a very serious epidemic worldwide. So why hasn&#x27;t this progressed out of the lab?</div><br/><div id="42092258" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42092258" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tsol</span><span>|</span><a href="#42092118">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42092207">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42092258">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42092258">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was curious about this myself so I looked up a bit more about this. Here&#x27;s what I found;<p>&gt;Even though there have been many publications and patents on the subject, no mechanism has yet been shown to be compelling enough to treat diabetes.[1]<p>&gt;An apparent more effective strategy is to give insulin glucose-responsive properties that let it respond to glucose reversibly. Merck created a system ... because of its incredibly low efficacy, this system did not merit advancement past phase I clinical trials.[1]<p>It sounds like they&#x27;re saying basically that they exist, but aren&#x27;t yet effective enough to replace the old standard. This particular design is newer.<p>From the study linked in the article as citation 1:
&gt;Here we report the design and properties of NNC2215, an insulin conjugate with bioactivity that is reversibly responsive to a glucose range relevant for diabetes, as demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. NNC2215 was engineered by conjugating a glucose-binding macrocycle and a glucoside to insulin, thereby introducing a switch that can open and close in response to glucose and thereby equilibrate insulin between active and less-active conformations.<p>Essentially it&#x27;s a new attempt at making a GRI that&#x27;s more promising. It&#x27;s insulin attached to a molecule that binds to insulin to block it from working unless glucose is present, in which case it binds to glucose instead and allows the insulin to be active. Of course that also means it will need to go through full FDA approval process which would keep it about ten years away if it does really end up being effective enough.<p>But this time could be different! It&#x27;s very cool conceptually too. The fact that it&#x27;s possible to make a drug that works like that. It&#x27;s amazing to see these novel drug delivery concepts develop in real time.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insideprecisionmedicine.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;translational-research&#x2F;novo-nordisk-researchers-engineer-glucose-sensitive-insulin-switch&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insideprecisionmedicine.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;translational...</a></div><br/><div id="42092290" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42092290" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">caseyy</span><span>|</span><a href="#42092118">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42092258">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42092207">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42092290">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42092290">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It is of course a great effort that these scientists are undertaking, not to be diminished by any healthy scepticism.<p>Thank you for looking into this.

Closed loop is a good example, and stem cell-based islet transplants are in real clinical trials now.

GLP1 inhibitors are more commonly available for T1Ds, especially now that they are in weight loss drugs that doctors are starting to more easily prescribe off-label to T1s. Metformin has basically become on-label for T1Ds due to its benefits to insulin sensitivity. But the smart insulin hasn&#x27;t made much progress for the last several decades.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s all doom and gloom.

You are a fraction of yourself, mentally and physically, for easily a week, more if you had to go through say 4-5 in a row.<p>These are the conditions that we put repeatedly people who have full control over life and death and health of their patients, often without further supervision, hoping they somehow magically never ever make a mistake, and when they do, folks immediately cry a murder and families sue to hell with massive dollar signs in their eyes.<p>You complain about that, or that you spend whole weekend being on call 48h unable to do anything really for literally 20 USD altogether (price of a canteen lunch here), including when you have to come and work 10-hour shift? You are put under pressure, shushed for being a pussy if you complain, told to toughen up since previous generations had it even tougher, and they somehow got through. Nobody mentions how horrible parents those absent folks were, how burned out they often were, quietly weeping or drinking themselves into oblivion. Well yes, those that didn&#x27;t just quit, didn&#x27;t go insane, didn&#x27;t commit suicide, sure they got through. And now enjoy seeing young going through a bit milder version of the same. Of course there are insane amounts of money involved, but its always between insurance and hospital, doctors get less than capable IT folks for much less work. I am IT guy and consider this utterly fucked up wrong.<p>A good friend of ours sued the hospital (biggest public in Switzerland) for breaking basic Swiss law consistently like that, he was first but quickly gathered tons of other doctors. IIRC hospital finally caved in, a bit, but he is gone from it for good to private sector. Twice the pay, half the crap.<p>I could go on and on like this, a lot of doctor friends in our circles.

Given the IT money in the US, I&#x27;m not sure they have the same situation if we look at the hourly rate.<p>Regarding doctors strikes, I asked the question to multiple ones and the few explanations I got are : 
- they are deeply regulated and organized, they rely more on acting behind the scenes (lobbying) than going public in the streets

Add decades of stagnant&#x2F;falling pay plus death by a thousand administrative cuts and the profession no longer justifies the difficult working conditions as convincingly.  Some practices are still good, others terrible.  Look at the rate of physician turnover to see which is which.<p>Oh and the “provider” discussion is worth paying attention to. Your doctor has this calculus worked out - years &amp; energy invested, work environment &amp; income expected, then the only viable option in your city is to be employed by a large hospital system (because hospitals get paid at least double for the same work, outcome is as expected.) But wait there’s more: you are now called “provider” by your large hospital employer who hires 2x NP employees to do the “same” work as you and pay half.

Junior doctors already have to compete to get training slots even vaguely where they live and if they miss that they simply have to physically move to a different city. Medical training isn&#x27;t as simple as just adding a lecture theatre and a few classrooms, or even a whole university building faculty of lecturers and admin. You also need a hospital (and GP surgeries etc) to be attached as well as enough senior staff to train them when they are there. That training is very intensive on trainer:trainee ratios and the senior staff are also in critically short supply as the ones who were trained up when there was training capacity (which, to be fair, was a time when it was far cheaper to train a medical student), are retiring by the thousands and many newer junior doctors quit or emigrate as a result of their experiences up to that point.<p>Hospitals cost absurdly large amounts of money, especially in the UK where there are consultancies and layers of subcontracting for everything. So the infrastructure costs of adding even a few hundred student places is astronomical.<p>Due to strategic underinvestment (or ideological sabotage, or governance incompetence, depending on outlook) there is now a self-reinforcing problem: not enough hospitals and staff to train doctors to beef up existing hospital staffing or work in hypothetical new hospitals even if a money firehose was turned on.<p>Rather than having a tall glass of concrete and doing the hard thing, which will still take decades to manifest, what the government is currently doing is a rerun of Healthcare Assistants where more care is delegated to much cheaper-to-train staff. Plus quite a bit of noise about &quot;AI&quot; bring used to allow them to sweat the asset of the staff they do have by, for example having one radiologist verifying AI findings rather than a pair-based system.<p>Which will all work &quot;kinda ok&quot; and let them punt the problems at least into the next government&#x27;s domain when they lose the next election and can spend 5 years screaming from the Opposition benches about the mess. But you cannot do it forever (or the hail-Mary works, there&#x27;s an AI revolution and you can actually run a hospital with an app, 2 agency nurses, a few smart plugs and an AWS instance).<p>Of course &quot;doing the hard thing&quot; would be easy to say if it was just the NHS, but there&#x27;s the same structural degradation in everything. So you also need to spend billions on education. That&#x27;s the same general problem - shortage of facilities and not enough existing staff to train new staff and the ones you do train quit. Schools are currently one something like a near-500-year replacement rate (50 per year, 24000 total) and that&#x27;s without considering population growth or even the hundreds of schools that need rebuilding because they&#x27;re made of RAAC. Then roads need billions to repair the accumulating damage. The railways need huge investment and staffing. Energy is the same - virtually no supply of domestic nuclear design engineers mean they get absolutely rinsed on even squinting in the direction of a drawing of reactor (though Hinkley Point C cost spiral is currently EDF&#x27;s problem, not the taxpayer and green energy is actually a rare success story). Defence is similar (e.g. ships being retired because they need the staff elsewhere). At least some water networks are collapsing into a multi-billion hole after private dividend extraction. So that money firehose has a lot of work to do, even if they would turn it on. Which is ideological poison apparently.</div><br/><div id="40029317" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40029317" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lelanthran</span><span>|</span><a href="#40025499">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40026554">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40025677">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40029317">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40029317">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Medical training isn&#x27;t as simple as just adding a lecture theatre and a few classrooms, or even a whole university building faculty of lecturers and admin.

The surgeon mentioned was in Australia, I have seen these issues first hand in the Netherlands and am aware of very similar of the first 2 out of 3 issues (caused by overwork&#x2F;understaffing&#x2F;over-fatigue etc) in Belgium, Germany, the UK, India and god knows how many other places.<p>However, fields like aviation have strict workload limits. You cannot be on call&#x2F;duty for too long because fatigue kills. Issues like alarm fatigue are studied by agencies, and folks at Boeing&#x2F;Airbus then implement the findings.<p>The question is, why is it okay for medical professionals to wear themselves down to the bone (sometimes literally, like in this article), while some other professions take care to avoid it?<p>(Edit&#x2F;PS: I added a fairly detailed self-reply below on what I think are some of the common arguments (like on the number&#x2F;availability of doctors) and why they don&#x27;t really fly, pun not intended.)</div><br/><div id="40025656" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40025656" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">derbOac</span><span>|</span><a href="#40025361">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40025389">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40025656">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40025656">[15 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The answer is implied, right there in the first paragraph: &quot;... I’ve never been diagnosed with a mental illness.&quot;<p>At least in the US, there&#x27;s a kind of masochistic pride in the physician community, that everything he described in his essay is laudable, noble, to be emulated. Nowhere does he acknowledge the risks to his patients or whether the costs are worth it in the end, or if a different system might be better. And he&#x27;s holding up the lack of mental illness diagnosis as if it&#x27;s something to be proud of, as opposed to never being diagnosed with say, cardiovascular disease or cancer. He&#x27;s proud he&#x27;s never sought help or tried to change anything. Sure he mentions problems with patient care in passing, but what he&#x27;s really upset about is &quot;just being another employee&quot;.<p>In the end in his mindset whatever he&#x27;s complaining about is better than the alternatives, which is ceding over some of the care responsibilities to others or opening up healthcare to a more competitive market so he&#x27;s not the only provider who could provide those services (note the comment about denying other physicians income). The AMA and physicians union (yes it&#x27;s a union) basically guarantees this in lieu of having real competition, decreased income, and so forth.<p>Why is it different in something like aviation? My guess is because the failures are more visible, they&#x27;re on the nightly news, people are there posting pictures on social media? For whatever reason, I don&#x27;t think pilot organizations ever managed to remove themselves from scrutiny in the same way as physicians did. We see pilots as highly skilled professionals, but part of a system, with alternatives, and the subject of fair scrutiny from outsiders who are not pilots: engineers, safety experts, investigators and so forth. In my experience when these kinds of issues come up in healthcare though, everyone defers to physician groups themselves, as if no one else has expertise enough to scrutinize them.<p>I imagine too at some level, part of the issue is that the pilots themselves are subject to their own mistakes: if a pilot crashes a plane, they take themselves out at the same time. If a surgeon makes a mistake and kills a patient, they still walk home and can rationalize whatever they want, all they want.<p>I&#x27;m growing unsympathetic to these types of essays (the one linked). If physicians want me to empathize with them more, maybe they should stop stigmatizing mental unwellness and recognize it in themselves. Maybe they as a professional group should admit that others could take on some of the load, maybe even better in some situations. It feels a bit like they create a mess out of selfish greed or ego and then expect me to feel bad for them.</div><br/><div id="40025719" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40025719" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mlyle</span><span>|</span><a href="#40025361">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40025656">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40025733">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40025719">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40025719">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Nowhere does he acknowledge the risks to his patients or whether the costs are worth it in the end, or if a different system might be better<p>c.f.<p>&quot;...everything is rushed, and mistakes are bound to occur.&quot;<p>&quot;I am realising more and more that what brings me greatest distress is the relentless administrative pressure which take away the meaningful clinical engagement I have with my patients.&quot;<p>&quot;I was burned out and I couldn’t control my emotions at work and at home.

Here in Sweden a physician has a MSc in medicine and is ready to meet patients and be trained when he&#x27;s 23, and I think this has the benefit that there&#x27;s no need to overwork them.<p>By the time they&#x27;re 30 they&#x27;ll have all the experience the need without having been overworked, and not sleeping enough kills intelligence, memory, drive, all mental qualities one may have.<p>I think these two policies, ensuring that people graduate earlier-- removing the pre-med and having people start right away with a medicine program, and graduating in 5.5 years, that&#x27;s the right approach.<p>Physicians would earn less, but they&#x27;d have substantially better lives. Being able to start younger also means success younger, and happier families.</div><br/><div id="40025784" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40025784" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Turing_Machine</span><span>|</span><a href="#40025361">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40025705">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40025534">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40025784">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40025784">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This was in Australia (4.1).</div><br/><div id="40025990" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40025990" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">impossiblefork</span><span>|</span><a href="#40025361">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40025784">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40025534">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40025990">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40025990">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ah, thank you.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40025534" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40025534" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Rinzler89</span><span>|</span><a href="#40025361">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40025472">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40025705">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40025498">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40025534">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40025534">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt;They have to &quot;do more with less&quot; (Not limited to public sector, see Boeing), and that works for a while, until it doesn&#x27;t.</i><p>Yes, which brings us back to the point I made about it being a numbers game.

Most of them are non-profits, or operate as part of state or local government agencies. They have no ability to negotiate higher rates with Medicare&#x2F;Medicaid and only limited ability to negotiate higher rates with private payers (typically set as a multiplier to the Medicare rate). Voters generally haven&#x27;t been willing to raise taxes. There is probably some waste that could be trimmed but it&#x27;s tough to figure out where to cut without impacting patient care quality. Much of the administrative overhead is forced upon them by unfunded government mandates around reporting, quality, security, credentialing, and interoperability.<p>Private donors are always welcome. If you have a few million to spare then you can personally fund a residency program expansion at your favorite teaching hospital.<p>I won&#x27;t attempt to defend ridiculous charges for certain basic medical services. Hospital accounting is a funny business, and almost entirely artificial. The teaching hospitals tend to deliver a lot of charity care (including writing off a lot of bad medical debt) and some Medicare&#x2F;Medicaid reimbursements don&#x27;t even cover their costs. So, they attempt to close the gaps by jacking up other prices as high as they can.<p>You should accept a lower standard of care because as a society we have limited resources and can&#x27;t afford to waste them.

She&#x27;s planning on leaving the profession at the end of the year. We talk a lot about what is wrong with the medical profession.<p>One issue is the type of person attracted to the profession. They&#x27;re incredibly academically talented, not driven by money, and desire status and recognition. Surgeons are the most extreme cases of this personality type, as they&#x27;re harder jobs to get and have a lot of pressure. These people are the types who get their head done, roll up their sleeves, and get on with things. They&#x27;re not used to asking for help or additional resources. They&#x27;re the sort of people who care for others! Medicine self-selects for martyrs.<p>In addition, you have so many hoops to jump through (training, specialisations, etc) with significant time investment that can be lost in moments by pissing off training directors or other senior doctors. My partner ends up working more than her contracted hours because her bosses expect her to, although they would never explicitly enforce stricter rules. If she works her contracted hours she can kiss a consultant job (UK equivalent of attending) goodbye as her bosses won&#x27;t provide a reference for the role.<p>Because the stakes in medicine are literally life and death, meaning that it is heavily regulated. There are horror stories around the GMC, the UK regulator, and doctors are terrified of being investigated. They adopt a legalistic mentality where they only treat if they&#x27;re sure that they won&#x27;t get prosecuted. It&#x27;s very different from aviation with its no blame culture.<p>Finally, another factor that is making medicine so tough is that it is a success story! People live longer, and pathologies that were once fatal can be managed with ever more complex treatments. As demographics lean to older populations, then the demand keeps increasing.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40025386" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40025386" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">uniqueuid</span><span>|</span><a href="#40025361">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40025980">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40025478">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40025386">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40025386">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for the perspective.

But fewer people makes it <i>harder</i> to let someone off if they haven&#x27;t slept well so I don&#x27;t really buy that.<p>Another is that the medical profession is much more &quot;flexible&quot;&#x2F;fluid in its needs, unlike flights scheduled in a regular manner. However, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not possible to give doctors an 8 hour workday, and substitute&#x2F;bring more doctors for other shifts. In fact, this is exactly what happens in many 24-hour manufacturing plants&#x2F;operations. Foxconn doesn&#x27;t let a sleep deprived employee make an iPhone, but it&#x27;s okay to let a sleep deprived doctor perform life-saving&#x2F;potentially deadly operations?<p>Another possibility is that &quot;it would cost more&quot; to have 3 docs instead of 1. Which might be supported by anecdotal evidence on how expensive things (including salaries) are in the medical field. However (especially if you&#x27;re only familiar with the US healthcare system), this doesn&#x27;t explain how doctors in say India are overworked.<p>The &quot;real&quot; reason, I think behind all this? The first part is it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s &quot;easy&quot; to compress and push an 8 hour shift to a 24 hour shift, fatigue be damned. The costs are &quot;hidden&quot;, it&#x27;s likely even with fatigue a 99% successful operation is still 95 or 90% successful. Everyone can rationalize it and go about with their day. &quot;Oh, unfortunately people don&#x27;t always make it&quot;.<p><i>Not</i>, &quot;there was a 20% chance they wouldn&#x27;t have made it but an 80% chance it was because the doctor was fatigued.&quot;<p>When an aircraft crashes, 300 people may die instantly. This gets front page coverage on a newspaper. However, a few deaths &quot;here&quot; and &quot;there&quot; don&#x27;t really show up, even if they tally up to thousands. This is the second factor, that &quot;hides&quot; and normalizes occasional slip-ups.<p>&lt;&#x2F;End of this wall of text&gt;
I unfortunately don&#x27;t really have a solution. I&#x27;m sure there are brilliant UX designers here on HN who could help ease and streamline the admin workload.<p>I suppose a dedicated politician&#x2F;presidential candidate somewhere could take this upon themselves to campaign for. (Seriously, the NHS was part of the discussion behind Brexit. Supporting doctors is a brilliant political strategy, the NWA didn&#x27;t have a song called &quot;Fuck the paramedics&quot;.)<p>There have been many instances of things catching on once found successful somewhere, be it procedures like the Heimlich or concepts like Lean Manufacturing. Therefore I don&#x27;t doubt that one good Harvard Review paper showing a 20% decrease in all-cause patient mortality, with trials underway in a few hospitals, is all it will take.

The current way is that upon admission to med school, you must be willing to accept just about any practice specialty. This is another thing that could be flipped on its head by allowing you to be any kind of doctor, provided that you attain the required MD and complete training.<p>Yes, I know, certain medical specialties are very competitive, but (IMO) they should be forced to admit you if you pay for the training. For instance, if I could be a radiologist, I would. But I dont want to be any other kind of doctor. They could say &quot;ok, you will be eligible for radiology residency upon earning an MD and completing some standardized program proving you learned the book-side of radiology. Upon completion of that, (and , say 1 year of generalist MD work), then some radiology residency essentially has to admit you. Not interview for it, and jump up and down like a puppy, and based on how likeable you are, maybe, they let you in.<p>This could open the door for non-traditional doctors in general: Word could get around, &quot;hey, this podiatry program is cool, 2 years training, 1 year public service, and you could earn $200k&quot;, knowing what kind of dr you will be might have an interesting effect in attracting people who otherwise would have never considered it (to fill the unpopular specialist roles like podiatry or psychiatry).</div><br/></div></div><div id="40025772" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40025772" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Gunax</span><span>|</span><a href="#40025424">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40026611">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40026266">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40025772">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40025772">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">While it&#x27;s true that there is a limit (really there is a limit to every university study), there is also a limit to the number of people who are qualified and interested.<p>For instance, there are only about 20k people who score &gt; 510 on the MCAT per year (the average matriculant has about a 512).

Whether or not that will take the pressure off front-line medical personnel who are currently tasked with generating it remains to be seen, but you&#x27;d be hard pressed to convince me.</div><br/><div id="40026633" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40026633" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lukko</span><span>|</span><a href="#40026266">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40026556">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40028291">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40026633">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40026633">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There are a few other reasons - doctors document every interaction partly for medico-legal reasons – just in case something happens.

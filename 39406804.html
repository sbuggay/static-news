I just want to build things, I don&#x27;t want to manage them. I see what it is like to be manager as I work closely with them, and I just don&#x27;t find it appealing at all.<p>As a senior engineer, my words also often matter, but I don&#x27;t have the huge amount of responsibility that comes with being a manager, which is nice.

In fact, every good senior engineer should be aware of what the leadership is trying to accomplish anyway, as we&#x27;re not just code monkeys, but rather problem solvers. If this isn&#x27;t actively communicated to you by managers themselves (it often isn&#x27;t), then you should proactively ask questions yourself, as like you said, it would give more insight into solutions.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39407623" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39407623" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mytailorisrich</span><span>|</span><a href="#39407569">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39407646">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39407644">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39407623">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39407623">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Senior engineer is fairly low.

For real. Sit quietly long enough for your brain to switch off before making essential and impactful decisions that could harm your people.<p>In the beginning, you become a kind of parent-to-child genius. You have to accept them and also understand their ways. The more controls you put in place, the less control you will have, as they will attempt to jump around and oppose the unnecessary bureaucracy (I&#x27;ll do the same, honestly).<p>My second advice is to always behave as if you are going to leave tomorrow. This will prepare your team and your peers and even improve your lifestyle.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39407664" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39407664" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shubhamjain</span><span>|</span><a href="#39407644">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39407565">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39407664">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39407664">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Suffering from front-end fatigue? Can&#x27;t keep up with the newest shiniest frameworks and tools? Management&#x27;s got you covered! The &quot;hot new&quot; agile &#x2F; kanban &#x2F; scrum methodologies are 20–30 years old. The basic meeting types (demos, dailies, 1-on-1s) have been developing for centuries.<p>&gt; Frankly, after 4–5 years of working in a particular tech area, you can solve the vast majority of practical problems well enough. If you want some work challenge, you can:<p>I hate takes like these. &quot;Good technical skills are dime a dozen, but management? that&#x27;s the hard shit.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s absolutely no lack of meaningful skills you can expand into if you&#x27;re plateauing as an engineer. If you&#x27;re a front-end engineer, go learn some design and product thinking, that&#x27;ll help you give better input to other teams. Learn some scripting, and automate a bunch of shit. Learn some SQL and learn to query data on your own, instead of relying on others.<p>The best manager I had had a wide range of technical skills, so was able to make smart decisions since he had a very holistic picture of the codebase. Technical management shouldn&#x27;t be about following methodologies, doing 1:1s, and being a middleman, it should be about making good practical decisions.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39407565" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39407565" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Prcmaker</span><span>|</span><a href="#39407664">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39407568">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39407565">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39407565">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve watched a colleague go from a good engineer, to a great engineering manager, to an awful project manager.

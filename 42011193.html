I&#x27;ve never had social media accounts. When I was 18 or so, I had a Palm Pilot with a cellular modem cradle that let you actually go to (mostly text-based) websites. It was the first smart phone, really. Amazing for finding information, for someone who didn&#x27;t even have dial-up internet until 5 years earlier. But eventually I put the Palm Pilot away. It wasn&#x27;t really addicting (and it was <i>insanely</i> nerdy to walk around with a computer connected to the internet, in your pocket like that).<p>I militantly avoided owning anything beyond a flip phone again until I was 36 (2016), when I finally caved in and grudgingly bought a cheap Android phone to work on a mobile game. (For the first 6 months of development, I&#x27;d just written and tested it under emulation, but bug reports were getting too hard to reproduce). Six months after that, I found myself doom-scrolling on the damn thing every time I had a free moment.<p>What I noticed during my smartphone-free years of watching people play with theirs were a few things: They weren&#x27;t considered nerdy. They weren&#x27;t considered computers. The social awkwardness of looking at a device in public had changed into a shield for people against the social awkwardness of looking at their surroundings or acknowledging other people. People forgot how to interact and how to sit and wait without doing something with their phone. Doing something with the phone was more than passively sipping a drink or smoking a cigarette; it was a way to show other people that they didn&#x27;t want to interact. Or a way to hide from interaction.<p>I think this has to do with the way apps are structured. The vast majority of people never <i>needed</i> a computer in their pocket. Computers were for information and for work. I think of smartphones and the current app ecosystem as more like a swiss-army-knife of spyware and ad tech shoved into a package with as many sensors as possible, to monitor the population. And so, it had better be addictive. Because the underlying act of looking at one and spending so much time with one is, and always has been, antisocial and therefore somewhat repulsive. It took a great amount of marketing to normalize it, and people still rebel against it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42012098" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42012098" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aeolun</span><span>|</span><a href="#42011560">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42011773">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42014315">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42012015">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42012098">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42012098">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I only have to look at my own phone habits to know that expecting any better from my children is probably unreasonable.</div><br/><div id="42012782" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42012782" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ryandrake</span><span>|</span><a href="#42011560">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42012098">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42012015">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42012782">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42012782">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a great point.

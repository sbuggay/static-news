I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I clicked on the link titled &quot;Lightweight Productivity Tool&quot;, but expected something closer to, I guess Notion, or a few other similar tools I&#x27;ve seen around here recently – i.e. an integrated, straightforward tool, that covers much of what &quot;productivity&quot; could mean.<p>As for the product, I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;ve not actually installed or tried it, but based on the page... I&#x27;ve tried many &quot;organise X into folders&quot; sorts of products in the past to try to get my life in order, and none of them ever stick. Even when I take the time to organise a whole aspect of my life, I either come back and realise I organised it in the wrong way for how I need to access it, or I just search and skip the organised hierarchy.<p>How does Zlinky change this? From looking at the page, I&#x27;m not sure it does. A folder-based bookmarking service is handy, but all the major browsers can sync this sort of stuff I think. Can Zlinky cause a step-change in how much value I get out of my bookmarks? If so, how? I&#x27;m not bookmarking a whole lot because I find search more effective than bookmarks, do I need to be bookmarking more?<p>Screenshots as an addition is an interesting take on this. The two are not something I&#x27;d inherently put together, and I&#x27;m interested in the motivation for this. I do use a screenshot sharing tool, taking multiple screenshots a day, and I do use the history on this (a few times a year), but again, organising them isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ve needed except in the rare cases of, say, creating marketing images for a product, in which case I&#x27;ve been using a shared workflow with other team members involved.<p>I&#x27;m interested to hear more about the problems this is solving. It sounds like you&#x27;re quite evangelical about it which suggests I&#x27;m either missing some sort of realisation, or that I&#x27;m not the target user – either way I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s something I could learn here.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39052139" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39052139" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jsf01</span><span>|</span><a href="#39052124">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39052900">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39052139">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39052139">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One of my biggest concerns when saving lots of things to an app like this and spending time curating bookmarks and other content is what happens if the app one day disappears.

We plan to always offer data portability for free. Currently you can easily export your links to a CSV file.  The CSV file contains details of your links, the folder it is saved in, and any notes attached to that link.<p>Over time we will update this export to include any images that you saved into your Zlinky account.<p>Currently you can download a CSV of your saved links once a day.<p>We also hope to offer import link, image etc options over time.<p>Thanks.

We get great user feedback from a critical mass of free users, and it pushes us to always work on a high quality upgrade path, not to mention having to solve some nice technical scaling challenges! Overall it pushes us to build a better product.<p>We have a proposed full pricing structure up on our website. We hope to leave our pricing structure as the website reflects (including the free plan), and we will continue to build out the feature set of the Premium Accounts as to make Premium accounts increasingly useful over time.<p>For example in future, we would like to offer some extra note taking features, home district widget configuration, collaboration features etc to Premium Accounts.  Importantly we will always offer free and easy data portability, so users can export their data at any stage if our product no longer is fit for use.<p>Feel free to let me know any other product feedback.<p>Thanks.

I also obsessively studied Mandarin Chinese in my late teens for the sheer fun of it, before doing a math undergrad. I even wrote comments on Hacker News about it a decade ago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=7622940">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=7622940</a>.<p>At the time I had seemingly limitless motivation for grinding away on flashcards and other learning materials. My progress was strong and I passed the HSK6 after a year and a half or so of studying, which at the time was the highest level of certification offered. I think they changed the system since and added more levels beyond 6. You can do amazing things if you&#x27;re dedicated!<p>Today my Chinese is absolutely unusable, and my views on China have soured to the extent that I don&#x27;t really want to revive my old skills. My takeaway is that learning one of these languages, the CJK languages, Arabic, or similarly weird languages, is just too much effort and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it. I clearly had a lot of excess energy at the time that I could&#x27;ve directed towards something better. Knowing Chinese is about as useful as juggling and you might as well get really good at juggling if you&#x27;re bored.

In the first 4-5 months of being truly consistent with ~1hr a day of Anki and Peppa pig I got to around 2,000 words and was able to have a great experience when I traveled to Taiwan, so I can vouch for the core methodology in this post. It’s not “easy”, but it’s definitely the most effective way to learn a foreign language that I know of.<p>The CI community has come a long way in the last ~5 or so years - the general consensus looks a lot like OP’s methods, which I would summarize as:<p>1.

The idea is that there aren’t many great CI options between 500 words and ~3k-5k words - OP himself mentions that when he started watching Scissor Seven 刺客伍六七 he barely understood anything, which is pretty hard to “push through” without some hardcore willpower. My project <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plusonechinese.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plusonechinese.com</a> makes Mandarin audio stories that are 85% comprehensible at any level from 400 words all the way to 8k or more words and then auto-imports the audio snippets into SRS flashcards, which makes a CI workflow like this a lot easier to engage with at a lower level and without advanced willpower.

If you use an SRS, make sure that the item your test goes through the brain structures you want to get good at, eventually reading can help with listening, but because you’re not processing the language through the typical brain structures that handle it, you’re delaying getting good until you’ve exercised these “muscles”.<p>Also, don’t learn words in isolation. Better is to learn the words in context. Better yet is to vary the practice, maybe hookup an LLM to vary the cloze word, if that’s your cup of tea.<p>Use audio if possible.

Anki’s extreme flexibility coupled with an engineer’s mind had me spending whole stretches of days or even weeks just tweaking my card templates, hoping to achieve some sort of optimal card format that will maximize my acquisition of the language (Mandarin like in the post). At some point I had enough scripts in there that I had turned it into my own Duolingo-like app.<p>These days I reign that impulse in and force myself to stick to simple card formats. Creating cards should take as little time as possible. The Chinese Support add-on is super useful for that by the way.<p>Another thing about Anki is that it can feel oppressive sometimes, because if you don’t do your reps they just pile up and it becomes a drag to clear the “debt.” Staying on top of my reps before I had a baby and life was chill was easy; now with the baby I sometimes feel like Anki takes away from the already limited time I have to expose myself to the language by reading books, watching videos, etc.<p>I stick to it though, since for a language that distant from the two other languages I speak, memorization work is a must.</div><br/><div id="41744932" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41744932" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pessimizer</span><span>|</span><a href="#41743267">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41743911">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41744051">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41744932">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41744932">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Another thing about Anki is that it can feel oppressive sometimes, because if you don’t do your reps they just pile up and it becomes a drag to clear the “debt.” Staying on top of my reps before I had a baby and life was chill was easy; now with the baby I sometimes feel like Anki takes away from the already limited time I have to expose myself to the language by reading books, watching videos, etc.<p>For me the new habit has been to not guilt myself too badly for skipping my cards if I know I spent an hour or two on native materials. Key to this has been to make sure that while all of my subdecks under my combined deck offer me a set number of new cards every day, the combined deck is set to zero new cards per day. If I&#x27;m missing days, I need to stop adding cards for a while until my daily load is tolerable enough that I&#x27;m not tempted to skip out.<p>Also, I like to get new cards of the same type at the same time. After I&#x27;ve cleared them once, let them be mixed in with the other cards, but when they&#x27;re introduced, I should be focused.<p>I hope that FSRS* eventually solves this: they&#x27;ve pretty much done away with manually-chosen &quot;ease&quot; as a concept (although not everyone has accepted that yet.) I hope they&#x27;ll ditch the idea of people regulating the number of new cards they get per day and move to allowing users to select an amount of time they want to spend, or a date by which they want to have a particular proficiency (defined by card recall), and instead have the algo choose how many new cards you should have. e.g. <i>I&#x27;m looking for 45 minutes a day of review, optimize for that</i>; or, <i>I want to be able on the 15th of October to be able to get 95% of this set of cards correct, drill me on them repetitiously for as long as it takes.</i><p>There&#x27;s been a lot of thoughtful discussion about pushing the app forward in ways like this.** Simpler is better, and the scheduler should be scheduling, not the user; the scheduler&#x27;s job is to adapt to the user.<p>The next frontier for SRS after polishing the schedulers is to gain an understanding of what makes a good card or a good deck, rather than leaving it as an exercise to the reader along with a bit of handwaving about how it&#x27;s better to learn from one&#x27;s own cards than ones that others have made. I&#x27;m about 3 years into daily SRS and this is not my experience. I&#x27;m eternally grateful to people who come up with innovative decks or just well written and focused cards.<p>-----<p>[*] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;open-spaced-repetition&#x2F;fsrs4anki&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;open-spaced-repetition&#x2F;fsrs4anki&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;</a><p>[**] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.ankiweb.net&#x2F;t&#x2F;pass-fail-grading-as-default&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.ankiweb.net&#x2F;t&#x2F;pass-fail-grading-as-default&#x2F;</a>

No doubt that SRS will allow us to remember words, yet few can really acquire those words intuitively. When starting to learn English in school, we used some kind of SRS system to memorize words and phrases and sentences, and man, the result was abysmal. We spent 10 years learning English (3 years of middle school, 3 years of high school, and 4 years of college), trying to memorize new words every day, passing TOEFL and later GRE through intense SRS, yet few students could understand TV shows, read fictions, or communicate with English speakers. And the learning was arduous, to say the least.<p>In contrast, I was lucky enough that my mom gave me a set of graded readers compiled by National Geographic, and simply asked me to read them through. And then Sidney Sheldon&#x27;s books, Friends, etc and etc. So basically I immersed myself into the language, never having to do SRS, and I could easily pass TOEFL and the GRE Verbal years before graduating college. As a bonus, I started to enjoy TV shows and movies early on, and was able to socialize with my classmates and professors without even trying. I also used the method to learn Spanish and Japanese, and the results are similar. No SRS needed but consistent exposure to the languages. In less than two years, I can read books like The Alchemist, If Tomorrow Comes, and Project Hail Mary. Another interesting contrast is that I couldn&#x27;t understand much conversation in those languages, precisely because I spent most of my spare time in reading.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41747044" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41747044" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">latentsea</span><span>|</span><a href="#41743267">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41744145">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41743473">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41747044">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41747044">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I actually think the 6 days a week of tutoring is the thing that needs to be emphasised more.

I quickly picked it back up, breezing through HSK 2 and 3, and now just about to be at HSK 5 soon. At times it feels daunting just going off the recommended number of hours needed to get to HSK 6 (5,760 hours), but it&#x27;s actually been flying way faster than I expected.<p>It&#x27;s actually pretty great language for self-study once you get to a good enough foundation. It&#x27;s really endless and there&#x27;s so many rabbit holes to get stuck in - ancient literary language especially. I&#x27;m excited to try and get deeper in to that. My ultimate goal is to be able to read the Big 4 novels confidently.<p>It&#x27;s also one of the weird things where motivation has a real snowball effect. The more you know, the more it feels like you can do, the more doors it opens for exploring entirely new areas. It helps that with Chinese there&#x27;s so much that feels locked up or hidden from normal western view. Want to learn about tea production, culture, and history? Need to learn Chinese. Want to better understand Japanese kanji and history? Need to learn Chinese. Trying to grasp all the distinct geographic dialects and idiosyncrasies is tricky. Also the fact that a quarter of the planet kind of lives and operates on a separate internet, and the FOMO I felt by not being able to understand that.<p>Anyways, 10&#x2F;10 definitely recommend. My plan is to keep chugging through and get to HSK 6 studying after my newborn infant arrives in 2 months, though I don&#x27;t know if I can keep up the 10 hours a week I&#x27;m currently managing. I&#x27;m also doing elementary Japanese at a way more casual pace with local classes, and my Spanish has disintegrated to barely being usable.<p>There are so many more helpful tools and communities that exist now than 10-20 years ago, like chrome extensions and better repetition tools, though I still enjoy just handwriting in a notebook a bunch.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41744627" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41744627" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ilamont</span><span>|</span><a href="#41746466">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41742838">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41744627">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41744627">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I really like the focus on watching or listening to source materials every day.

Also, a lot of takedowns on SRS tend to actually be takedowns on memorizing 1:1 translations of words <i>at all</i> which is all they assume people do with SRS. I&#x27;ve never done those, because I think <i>word lists</i> are bad and 1:1 translations from L1-&gt;L2 are bad because they are always wrong (languages are different, not substitution ciphers.) I almost only deal in complete sentences in SRS, and clozes.<p>There&#x27;s also a piece of advice given by David Parlett in an old book about learning languages straight from possibly incomplete printed grammars and native or anthropological recordings: &quot;learn the hard stuff first.&quot; There are some things about languages that are central, complex, and should just be learned by rote. Romance conjugations are some of those things. Using SRS to learn how to conjugate reflexively and automatically in Spanish (after probably 50K card reviews) was the best thing I could have done to open up a world of comprehensible input.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41745338" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41745338" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rahimnathwani</span><span>|</span><a href="#41742838">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41743274">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41745338">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41745338">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you&#x27;re doing all these things already, but want something for learning to write characters, Skritter is the best thing I know of.<p>I used it many years ago (on a Windows PC using a Wacom tablet).

2. Try watching something that you understand. Search &quot;[target language] comprehensible input&quot;. This content has been simplified for people like you.
3. Focus on what you DO understand, not what you don&#x27;t understand. Not only does this not weigh you down, it also give you something to focus on.
4. Pop bubble wrap (or something). Watching a TV show is effectively &quot;doing nothing&quot; and this makes some people uncomfortable (sorta like struggling to meditate).

The &quot;Europeanization&quot;, or 欧化，came in many different flavors (even though most of the influence came from English), for better or for worse. There was a &quot;new culture movement&quot; more than 100 years, and the Chinese elites tried to translate western works into Chinese that ordinary people could understand, and that movement fundamentally changed modern Chinese.<p>- polysyllabic words (复音词）。Modern Chinese has many such coined words that either came from Japanese or from European languages. For instance, 台灯 == table lamp. Traditional Chinese wouldn&#x27;t create words like that.<p>- Introduction of linking verb. Traditional Chinese, even 白话文，don&#x27;t use linking verbs like &quot;be&quot;, &quot;get&quot;, and etc. For instance, in English one may say &quot;his dream is to be a scientist&quot;, but in Chinese one would only say &quot;他梦想成为科学家“， while it is now perfectly find to say &quot;他的梦想是成为一名科学家“，due to the influence of English.<p>- Introduction of long sentences. Traditional Chinese does not use long sentences, let alone clauses. For instance, in the modern Chinese, people are used to &quot;if .. then&quot; type of sentences, yet it was not used in traditional Chinese.<p>- Punctuations. Traditional Chinese uses only period, if it uses punctuation at all. Yet now modern Chinese uses all kinds of English punctuations.<p>- New syntactical structures, even though they are eye sores to me. For instance, in English one can say &quot;they made great contribution to the society&quot;, and in modern Chinese one can say &quot;他们对社会做出的贡献很大“, even though a more traditional way is &quot;他们对社会贡献很大“。BTW，even the latter is westernized, as in traditional Chinese we don&#x27;t use propositions like &quot;对“。<p>- New grammar. For instance, traditional Chinese does not have passive speech, but modern Chinese does.<p>- The modernization of Chinese syntax and semantics.

Even once you know the 6,000 characters that people often cite as being needed to read a novel, you&#x27;ll still run into characters that you don&#x27;t know (especially in proper names, but also in less common, especially literary or <i>chengyu</i>, vocabulary).<p>I also disagree about the &quot;grammatical similarity&quot;, but at the point of fluency we&#x27;re talking about here (day-to-day fluency in <i>idiomatic</i> Chinese), that doesn&#x27;t matter anyway, not even a bit.</div><br/><div id="41745435" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41745435" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">g9yuayon</span><span>|</span><a href="#41744363">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41744585">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41744614">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41745435">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41745435">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">An elementary student in China probably won&#x27;t learn more than 3000 characters, yet they can read advanced novels.

As you mentioned, there is a steep learning curve before you get to that point. Characters instead of letters, sounds you&#x27;re unaccustomed to hearing and making, and multiple tones make learning basic phrases much more work than many languages. However, once you get some time with those difficult pieces, the grammar is actually much easier than one would expect. I would much rather learn another language like Chinese than a conjugation-heavy one such as Finnish.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41745348" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41745348" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">biesnecker</span><span>|</span><a href="#41744363">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41744614">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41745975">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41745348">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41745348">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Chinese grammar only really seems like English in the beginning.

Otherwise, the basic structure of the two languages is subject + verb + object. A lot of semantics are constructed with the help of adverbs and particles without verb conjugations.

In contrast, in Spanish we&#x27;d say Lo he hecho - different sentence order, and tons of verb conjugation.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41746186" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41746186" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Always42</span><span>|</span><a href="#41744363">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41743766">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41746186">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41746186">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Any equivalent resources for spanish?</div><br/></div></div><div id="41743766" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41743766" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wwarner</span><span>|</span><a href="#41746186">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41743766">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41743766">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Best anki testimonial that I&#x27;ve read.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

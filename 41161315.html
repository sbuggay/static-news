I worked on such a team once and it was really excellent. The advantage of this strategy is if the experiment doesn&#x27;t work out, terminating freelancers is much easier than permanent (I noted you&#x27;re based in Europe).<p>Contrary to what other people said, I wouldn&#x27;t try find a CTO straightaway. It&#x27;s a hard role to hire for, <i>especially at the start</i>. I think you&#x27;re better off unleashing a small, excellent team of builders then hire management later to help build out the team if the initial effort succeeds.<p>Happy to chat more about my experiences with this strategy, davedx@gmail.com (I&#x27;m in Europe too)</div><br/><div id="41197001" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41197001" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alemanek</span><span>|</span><a href="#41194744">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41195702">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41197001">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41197001">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is excellent advice but I would back up a few steps and do a few things before bringing in a freelancer team.<p>Identify a part of this system that can work somewhat in isolation and is non-critical if at all possible.

Small freelance &#x2F; contract team of very very senior very experienced people. 3 to 4 max.<p>I was fortunate in that I, for the first part of my career, joined teams that were structured like this.<p>Some additional thoughts:<p>- keep things small at the start - task your team with at least two goals for the first 90 to 180 days<p><pre><code>       i ) to define a small but critical piece of work (actually designing and coding something related to what you need to do). Cannot be part of your core platform but will need to eventually be in the platform. Picking the right piece of work here is critical.

      ii ) to define a design, roadmap and project plan for completing everything you want done with cost, staffing, tech and effort estimates

</code></pre>
Then use the 90 to 120 days and the two tasks above to evaluate:<p><pre><code>    i) if the folks and team you have put together works:

        a) as a team and 

        b) with your existing business ( can they do the work, can they work effectively with the rest of your business, is the design the come up with solid and does it give you confidence that they can tackle the real core work you need done)


   ii) if you can get a sense of what it will cost (what did the 90 day project cost and was it delivered on time and budget per the team&#x27;s estimate )

   iii) if the team can put together a road map with support of the business for the broader objective in parallel to executing the piece of work chosen

   iv ) if the solution if palatable from a cost perspective ( money, people, tech, disruption ) 

   v) if the staffing model , architecture and integration proposed for the project by your new team could work (get feedback from the rest of the business about what is proposed by your new team ) 

    vi) if your business can work with this new tech team ( feedback from your existing staff about the folks doing the work and their product for the small piece of work they tackled )


</code></pre>
- It is really critical that they be &#x27;senior&#x27; people - &#x27;senior&#x27; here meaning they have done and seen a lot. The title will not tell you if they are. You have to actually look at what they have done. Look for senior free-lancers with a variety of (longish 4 to 5 years) experience using a variety of technologies (C &#x2F; Java &#x2F; PL-SQL &#x2F; Perl &#x2F;  Rust &#x2F; C++ whatever etc etc - but boring old tech is better, you will eliminate another variable from your project complexity ) in variety of industries &#x2F; verticals ( 3 to 5 industries. This is a signal of effectiveness at learning new things and delivering effectively in new fields with new people in new environments.<p>- it is critical that your freelancers not just be developers: they have to be &quot;business-goal oriented&quot;. Consider asking for references who are not developers and consider filtering your freelancer hires through their networks in LinkedIn - do they have a good mix of senior and non-senior people in their network who are NOT developers? That is a good indicator they worked effectively enough with other non-software parts of the business that the people on that side of the fence (marketing, ops, finance etc etc ) are comfortable being associated with them. Pick the areas that matter to you.<p>- Consider filtering for delivered results when you talk to candidates and in resumes: look for achievements &#x2F; projects &#x2F; work delivered rather than work done as this &#x27;could&#x27; be a signal that the person is focused on actually &#x27;owning&#x27; projects (not work ) and closing out on projects &#x2F; goals (could also be a signal that the person did not not consider put delivered work in their resume so there is that - so, if you don&#x27;t see it, just ask something like &quot;what projects have you owned start to finish and how did you architect, design and execute on them&quot; and interpret the response ).<p>- Key skills to look for in free lancers:<p><pre><code>               - systems integration (making systems &#x27;talk&#x27; to each other - you will have to make your existing system talk to your new system + you will eventually have to get your data off wherever it is now to your new environment and you will have to make the new system work with all the other tech systems you have now)

               - system architecture: designing software solutions

               - database architecture &amp; design

               - project &amp; program management 

               - lean six sigma &#x2F; green belt ( means they have may have worked with ops people to optimize operations )

</code></pre>
All the difficult stuff is going to happen in the background (batch processing, integration etc etc)  so don&#x27;t bother with front end development skills at the start - that is actually relatively easy to hire for.<p>You will definitely find folks who have the right profile who will work with you - the key is decent (not crazy) pay, benefits and elements of stability attached (contracted duration with pay guarantees for performance, performance bonuses if possible etc etc).<p>- Plan on developing a bench from the freelancers so hire some mid-level junior folks to work alongside them for when the freelancers inevitably move on. You will have to hire from outside (try and get mid-level people in the industry, not senior folks, so that it is clear that your senior freelancers are the leaders &#x2F; owners of work ) but try really hard to source at least a few of these folks from existing staff if possible ( people in other job functions - and are good at those jobs - who are programming inclined ) as they are a good source of how things work to integrate into the team or as new hires. They do not have to be as as senior but they have to be able to keep up. These people start as grunts for your freelancers and learn the system as it is built - they are your future tech staffing.<p>- Plan ahead for what WILL go wrong. 
I strongly strongly strongly recommend reading two books<p><pre><code>                - The Phoenix Project - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.ca&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0988262592
                - The Unicorn Project - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.ca&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1942788762
</code></pre>
They deals with how executives and staff tackled a situation very similar to what you are dealing with and explains how to tackle some of the key structural problems you WILL run into. It is also a great resource for understanding how to run a project like this and understand how things could go right and more important, how things can go wrong and what to do WHEN they do go wrong (because they WILL ). The books will give you a very strong set of foundational thoughts about how to think about running this project if you decide to commit to doing it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41195702" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41195702" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">poeticsilence</span><span>|</span><a href="#41194744">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41197001">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41197601">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41195702">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41195702">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Strongly agree here.

Hiring freelancers and seeing who gets it is probably the only way your organization can reliably detect talent (whereas a software company would have an interview funnel as a core competency).  Once you have a freelancer who gets it, you can ask them if they want to join, or if they want to get paid to interview for you.  Talent likes to work with talent, and the freelancer will be better at interviewing than you.  Repeat this process until you have a team.<p>Eventually you may want management, but by the time you need management, you should have a pool of engineers large enough that one of them would be willing and able to manage the rest.

Smart freelancers are all about keeping their clients happy in the long term. It&#x27;s just good business.<p>Not a freelancer, but this is a classic &quot;market for lemons&quot; situation: designing things for the long term takes a significant amount of extra thought and expertise.  If two freelancers give two different quotes, one of which has a higher hourly rate <i>and</i> will take a longer time, there are one of two possibilities:<p>1. The more expensive quote is way overpriced, trying to extract money out of the buyer and possibly double-dip<p>2. The cheaper one is a low-quality &quot;cowboy&quot; job that&#x27;s going to cost way more to maintain in the long run<p>If buyers in general can&#x27;t tell the difference, then the market will end up pressuring even the high quality people to cut corners and produce &quot;cowboy&quot; jobs. 
 In other words, it may not be 100% the freelancer&#x27;s fault they&#x27;re &quot;not interested in the long term unless forced&quot;.<p>So part of the job of a &quot;wrangler&quot; is to understand what&#x27;s worth investing in and what&#x27;s not -- to know that it&#x27;s worth spending double in this particular area because it&#x27;s a long-term win -- and to be able to evaluate the output of the work, to make sure that what was delivered actually is higher value.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41199756" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41199756" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">The_Colonel</span><span>|</span><a href="#41194744">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41198839">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41199378">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41195597">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41199756">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41199756">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My experience as an in-house dev working together with freelancers and body shops (in Europe) is less positive.<p>A pattern I commonly see is that they are heavily technology focused and don&#x27;t really care about the domain, because domain-specific skills are not transferable.

Itâs a different way to make an impact and help make healthier spaces for technical teams to do what they want.<p>Iâll share one example. Clever architecture and leverage can beat most coding especially in the B2B space.

I like to have a credible story for 5-10x ROI on software development because the costs end up being so variable and uncertain.<p>Then the trick is figuring out how to hire, train, and establish a productive environment for the team. My customers approach was to hire a vendor [Pivotal Labs] to ship a first release and help hire in-house staff to replace vendor roles until the team was fully in-house. The customer got rapid feedback that the team and concept worked; we shipped working software.

It seems that there is a high risk of your vendor ceasing operations or their solution not being able to support your growth. The sooner you start the transition, the less painful it will be.<p>When deciding whether to build a replacement yourself, consider whether this solution could become a competitive advantage in the market. This is unlikely to be the case for a logistics company unless you plan to sell the software you build. From a business perspective, it&#x27;s usually better to invest in your core strengths and outsource everything else as much as possible. Otherwise, securing the budget to hire the right talent in the right amounts will always be more challenging.<p>Assuming software is not your core strength, it may be wiser to search for one or several solutions that you can combine to support your strategy for decades while providing a certain level of flexibility. This might also mean building some parts of your system with low-code or even custom code, but I would try to keep that to a minimum.<p>If you still decide to build something custom, my recommendation would be to avoid replacing everything at once. Instead, replace your existing solution gradually. Start by rebuilding the most problematic functions first, and then add other features as you go. You might find along the way that some parts of the older solution&#x27;s functionality are no longer needed.<p>As the founder of a low-code SaaS product (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uibakery.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uibakery.io</a>) and a service provider company (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.akveo.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.akveo.com</a>), I can definitely relate to your challenges, which are quite similar to those of my clients.

This is likely doable, especially since you are already having to rely on outside tools.<p>Then to start building, hire a small team (employees or freelancers) and have them create a single piece of functionality that can be swapped out from the current workflow. This type of approach will limit the upfront costs and give you a much better idea of how feasible the replacement will be as a whole. It will almost certainly go smoother as well. Every rewrite&#x2F;replacement of a large software project runs into a lot of unexpected challenges and complexity that will have to be ironed out, and this limits the disruption at any one time.<p>There are a lot of factors in whether or not to go this route, but it&#x27;s certainly plausible that it&#x27;s a good decision. I worked for a smaller company that did something similar and gradually built out their own internal workflow software tailored to the business. Overall it worked out quite well and they ended up with much better software at a lower price than they would have paid for outside tools.

Or for the same project how do you go from Java to Rust? Of course you can also do that by splitting things out into REST services, but now you have to handle reliability issues of your transport layer and have to figure out how to pass large data through it and&#x2F;or how to handle a barage of calls that were previously swift in-memory function calls.

You don&#x27;t give a lot of info on the exact niche you are in, but the username tells me that you&#x27;re doing containers in European context, most likely shortsea or domestic, not deepsea.

If you are running a small-ish container terminal for example, you really should know how the depot department of the major carriers are managing their empty stock so you can decide your stacking strategies in the yard. You should probably also have an understanding of benefits vs drawbacks of tower cranes vs gantry cranes found at bigger quays. That then influences what your TOS should be capable of. Same thing goes for intermodal transport planning, you really should know not only how detention&#x2F;demurrage works, but also what tricks you can pull to optimize for it, and how shipping lines monitor this internally. If you are building stuff in-house, you&#x27;re inevitably going to be limited in your understanding of the wider market.

It may not be completely necessary, but when that&#x27;s not off the table, it&#x27;s a whole new ball game anyway.

Put a number on the value that solid software would bring to your business, and if that number can support compensating a software team at market rates or higher, you have the potential to retain a team. However, it also needs to be a good team -- solid leadership, with a culture that matches what is expected by software devs: respect, autonomy, flexibility, and trust.<p>If all of that sounds reasonable, go forth and build.

I would start by documenting and&#x2F;or asking for documentation on how the whole system works. This is key. I would start with a high level diagram. Even if you&#x27;re not technical, this would allow you to evaluate the existing stack and see what could be worked on in parallel to the existing tech if any. I feel like you are technical enough to understand this since you understand CRUD and other terminologies. You can even set a time for the provider to explain the services to you if needed. I say parallel because I&#x27;m assuming you can&#x27;t just quit using the system entirely, it will need to function until you do the switchover.<p>2. Once you have a good understanding of the system, this will allow you to be more specific on your needs.

If it is indeed a re-write, I would approach it so that it&#x27;s 1-1 parity with the existing system first, and if not, maybe with some ample planning and product grooming make the features even better. Furthermore, this will allow you to make a basic PRD for the requirements of what you are building. Doesn&#x27;t have to be really specific but it will make it clear to yourself and others on what the task would be.<p>3. Hiring. At this point, I would start hiring a CTO&#x2F;VP&#x2F;senior engineer. Describe the problem from 2., maybe deep dive even if needed and start to get technical leadership going. I&#x27;m assuming cash is not a problem so if you start at $175k&#x2F;year salary (maybe some stock&#x2F;benefits) you can find many technical leaders that would go for this. Once you make that first hire, if they have a good network and or social clout it should be easy for them to hire people and&#x2F;or consultants to do the job.<p>4. Iterate. Once you have that amazing team and if they have a good process in place they should keep iterating on the product and continue doing this on a steady pace.<p>5. Once the product is ready or any point that is it deployable make the switchover. At this point, you should have full in-house control of the product and have competent tech team in hand to do whatever is needed.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41199979" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41199979" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bh213</span><span>|</span><a href="#41200007">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41199809">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41199979">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41199979">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My team worked remotely from the EU for a similarly sized ($100-$200M) US-based company in the print-on-demand space for over 8 years as an external provider, building much of the core infrastructure and services.

It seems you&#x27;ve (OP) almost already decided, but you&#x27;re unsure about details such as how to retain software developers. Before you go into such details you need to be sure you want to make this move. This must be a strategic move, meaning a long term move where you&#x27;re sure you&#x27;re gaining a strategic competitive advantage through this being a core competence (in the academic&#x2F;theoretical strategic sense). There are very few quick fixes in IT. Most projects are grossly underestimated - in particularly if you lack the competence in-house today (easily 10-100x).<p>At it&#x27;s core, it should be a decision that is not only about control over the software, it&#x27;s about bringing the knowledge about the processes and technical complexities of doing your business in-house. You might think you know all about it, but most likely you don&#x27;t (otherwise most IT projects wouldn&#x27;t fail). The big cost in IT is specifying exactly how things should work (that&#x27;s basically what coding is all about). If you&#x27;re not a developer (and even most developers underestimate&#x2F;don&#x27;t fully understand this) it&#x27;s highly likely you underestimate this part of it (otherwise it would be easy for you to code it yourself - again, how to code is not a big deal, it&#x27;s specifying exactly how it should work).<p>Software development is a lot about managing and documenting processes, aka knowledge, about your business.<p>Otherwise I agree with lots of other comments. Make sure you and the rest of the business is sure and have enough budget&#x2F;resources allocated for a long time forward. Bring in a CTO&#x2F;leader with the experience&#x2F;skills of doing something like this. Make sure that person has the mandate to do what&#x27;s needed (hiring, culture, etc). Could be a good idea to do it step by step to test out (again, a good mindset is to see this as an investment in learning about how to do your business, using IT&#x2F;automation). A hybrid approach could work (take over existing code, use another platform&#x2F;ERP&#x2F;system as a base) - all depends on the specifics of your business, how custom your business and processes really are, how core to your business they are, etc.<p>Good luck!</div><br/></div></div><div id="41198143" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41198143" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alex_c</span><span>|</span><a href="#41186266">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41196148">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41199639">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41198143">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41198143">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This comment lists most of the questions I would ask.

Your fear that the devil is in the details is very much justified (I have stories, boy, do I have stories ...). However, in your position I would definitively start building a dedicated tech team. That allows you to start developing real solutions to solve pain points in a way that feels less like &quot;filling the gaps&quot; and more like &quot;the first steps towards a better future&quot;. It also may make you a better, more informed customer which may perhaps help with your current vendor as well. It also gives you something to fall back on if the proviable shit really hits the fan with your current vendor.<p>Do not underestimate the importance of product management. Product management drives your development team. If you now use a basically off-the-shelf product, this is likely taken care of for you. Or not, given you describe the vendor as stagnant. In either case, you need to have that covered well.<p>One-is-zero: do not rely on single individuals, build a team. At the leadership level you&#x27;d want at least a product lead, business analyst, cto and a senior software architect. Make sure they work together as a team and that there is healthy cross-over in expertise&#x2F;experience so that people can cover for eachother. In-house, not contracted.<p>I&#x27;d advice against fully outsourcing to an agency. You can contract a development team, and depending on where you are located that may be the most realistic option, especially in the beginning. But make sure you are at the steering wheel and have the people and experience in-house to use that wheel well (see previous point).<p>Invest in boring things like documentation and testing right from the beginning. It will pay for itself many times over. If you let it slide, you&#x27;ll never catch up and you&#x27;ll pay for &#x2F;that&#x2F; many times over.<p>Other than that there&#x27;s probably a lot I&#x27;ve learned from my adventure so far, but I find it typically difficult to assess what the lessons learned are unless someone pokes me with the right questions.

If this sounds like you, or you use a lot of third party carriers, keep this in mind:  tracking freight movements alone isnât that hard, but you need really strong accounting fundamentals in the system from the get-go to be able to really understand costs in this business.  Some off the shelf software doesnât do this particularly well.<p>Based on this - my strongest advice would be to choose boring tech (Java or .NET) and recruit specifically for some core developers who have a solid grounding in accounting fundamentals, or do some serious training on this before embarking on the design.

A few key questions that you need to answer:
- Can you get support from the top (board&#x2F;CEO) to modernize HR to create competitive comp structure?
- Can you identify real engineering leaders that can commit to the job? -- You can&#x27;t just hire non-hands-on random middle managers. Good engineers don&#x27;t want to work for politicians.
- Do you have political stability to invest in the transformation long-term (3yr+ or more if you are more massive)?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

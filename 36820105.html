Retail and institutional is the difference between playing in a casino and being the casino.<p>It&#x27;s important to understand - on the whole - he average probability of guessing the direction of a trade is 50&#x2F;50. Any obvious (and virtually all non-obvious) edges, arbitrage for instance, are removed by the market participants. That&#x27;s what a market IS.<p>In that respect, &#x27;random walk&#x27; is correct. However, that does not mean all participants cannot expect profitability over the short or long term. Which are also themselves, very different things.<p>For retail traders, transaction cost (commissions + bid&#x2F;ask spread) make it a negative expectancy.<p>In fact, bid&#x2F;ask spreads and commissions ARE PRICED right at a level to remove any positive expectancy, but leave the APPEARANCE of a possible positive one.<p>Getting that up just a couple percentage points to a positive expectancy is difficult in the short term, and VERY difficult over the long term. Not impossible.  That&#x27;s why about 70-80% of active retail traders are losing overall at any given time.<p>For firms, order flow and much lower transaction costs make for a positive expectancy. The value of order flow alone is responsible for the zero-commission trading industry.<p>Skill isn&#x27;t the issue. The trader with skill level at lose a little or break even trading - from his bedroom - would very possibly be winning on the big banks trading desk. Even if executing the SAME trades they were at retail. More so, the more frequent the trading activity.<p>So if big institutions have a built in edge why do they sometimes fail? Easy, they still sometimes make stupid bets (ie.. Silicon Valley Bank&#x27;s bond bet which killed it).</div><br/><div id="36823572" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36823572" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tnecniv</span><span>|</span><a href="#36823527">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36822727">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36823572">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36823572">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have a family member who was a speculator for about a decade and worked in a secondary role for investment banks for the rest of their career.

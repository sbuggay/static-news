You write the migrations manually and define the schema manually (although there are generators to handle a lot of the boilerplate). Then you write the functions to CRUD your new model, etc.<p>Whereas with Ash, I believe the ideas is that you define the resource using Ash&#x27;s DSL (Elixir can get pretty liberal with the metaprogramming), and then it makes it easy to add functionality from there: 
auto-generating migrations,  handling object-level permissions, generating OpenAPI schemas, and making it easy to do a lot of other stuff that is tedious to do by hand.<p>It seems to be very magic-heavy but claims to allow escape hatches. I&#x27;ve heard some good things about it, but also that it has a lot of magic involved.<p>It&#x27;s written mostly by one guy and it&#x27;s definitely a high-level abstraction, but I&#x27;m quite certain it&#x27;s not just buzzword salad. It certainly has a huge scope though and I wonder if it tries to do too much, but I am quite intrigued by the siren song of this project.<p>There was recently an Elixir conference (ElixirConf) and Zach&#x27;s (the main developer) talk was posted on YouTube just the other day, so that&#x27;s probably why this is getting posted here now.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37630808" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37630808" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ygouzerh</span><span>|</span><a href="#37630892">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37630882">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37630808">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37630808">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If I understand well, is it a Model-Driven Development (MDD) framework?

A resource can model anything, like a database table, an external API, or even custom code. Ash provides a rich, and extensive set of tools for interacting with and building on top of these resources. By modeling your application as a set of resources, other tools know exactly how to use them, allowing extensions like AshGraphql and AshJsonApi to provide top tier APIs with minimal configuration. With filtering&#x2F;sorting&#x2F;pagination&#x2F;calculations&#x2F;aggregations, pub&#x2F;sub, policy authorization, rich introspection, and much more built-in, and a comprehensive suite of tools to allow you to build your own extensions, the possibilities are endless.<p>For those familiar with Phoenix, you can think of Ash as a declarative application modeling layer designed to replace your Phoenix contexts.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ash-project&#x2F;ash">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ash-project&#x2F;ash</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37630833" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37630833" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rmrfchik</span><span>|</span><a href="#37630869">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37630833">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37630833">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Looks like chat-gpt generated.

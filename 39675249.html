My experience with self-help and organization titles has been that the activity of breaking down tasks is a sort of known primitive human operation that many authors assume their readers to have. However, my own personal experience and the accounts of others I have heard while participating in group sessions is that breaking down tasks can be very difficult and provoke emotions of avoidance and despair.<p>The most broadly relevant advice that I have come across when it comes to breaking down tasks is to keep breaking things down until I am 90% certain that I can successfully complete the task. The certainty here would vary on how much self-confidence an individual has and their risk tolerance, so some people may break down tasks to 70% certainty of success.</div><br/><div id="39676555" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39676555" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hyperthesis</span><span>|</span><a href="#39675992">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39676734">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39676555">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39676555">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Similar: the more uncertainty, the further I break it down.<p>This has been <i>amazingly</i> accurate for time estimates - in aggregate...

The client wants the moon, on a low budget, and wants it completed yesterday.<p>A strong manager understands their role, and the constraints (time, money) of the system and is able to find compromise where necessary. They&#x27;re there to guide the owner, and at the same time monitor the workers.<p>Of course the vast majority of middle management are not strong. They see their role as passing on orders from on high. The boss is the customer, and the customer is always right. So their only part is to demand more from the workers.<p>Strong tech workers understand what the manager needs. Good time estimates. Limited budget. The manager needs to be passing accurate data upstream. Bad workers ignore reality, tell a manager what he wants to hear, and just do their thing. Not realising that they (the programmers) will be the ones thrown under the bus ehen it goes tits up. (Another sign of bad managers is to blame the underlings.)<p>Good managers, working with good techies, is a match made in heaven. Together they deliver accurate estimates, with plenty of contingency time. Together they decide what features are necessary, and what can be canned. If you are in this dynamic, count yourself lucky.<p>If you are a good manager working with crap staff, well, that&#x27;s unlucky. But at least you can turn them over. If you are a good tech working with a crap manager (which I suspect is most of us) then, well, I guess the only options are to stay, or quit.<p>Bad managers can be made better with explanations though.

Trying to define the solution before the problem has been properly examined would only limit the final output. Most of the exploration only happens when people actually start coding.<p>Not having a well defined final output and time is not very relevant for software, mostly because there is no per unit cost. Most managers do not realize this is they are not from a software engineering background. A versatile product can be sold to many different customers without additional development costs.<p>But since most companies are managed as factories, all the processors will ultimately create a very limited product targeted at a specific customer.

Anyone can come up with a bad breakdown. The real point of mastery, which he didn&#x27;t talk about here, is identifying when the evidence suggests a task breakdown is incorrect enough to cause problems and communicating that &#x2F; doing a re-estimate [0]. And being comfortable that it will happen so not getting stressed up front putting out a schedule that is likely to change. Managers generally want an accurate roadmap up front. This is them asking for the impossible. IMO Good management is about flexibility and understanding that the expected nature of the work changes as time passes and developers learn.<p>He has a little example at the end. Ponder that if someone had come to him with an accurate estimate (&quot;you can do this in a few evenings as a plane trip&quot;) he&#x27;d have rejected that as too risky. That illustrates that estimating isn&#x27;t even about accuracy, there are many unspoken factors here around risk management, expectation management, task familiarity, etc, etc.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jacobian.org&#x2F;2021&#x2F;jun&#x2F;8&#x2F;incorrect-estimates&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jacobian.org&#x2F;2021&#x2F;jun&#x2F;8&#x2F;incorrect-estimates&#x2F;</a> - he has  a post on the topic</div><br/><div id="39675895" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39675895" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">WaxProlix</span><span>|</span><a href="#39675787">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39675712">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39675895">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39675895">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Really great, honest and refreshing link - my thanks for posting it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39675712" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39675712" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hartator</span><span>|</span><a href="#39675787">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39675926">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39675712">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39675712">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don’t know.<p>I think that’s the main truth about software engineering.

The estimates will change, they&#x27;ll probably give you a broader range instead of being able to estimate almost down to the minute (and being off by no more than an hour or two) like someone just painting walls (with a known environment, surface type, and paint material).<p>Does the mural need to be designed? Are the desired qualities of the mural well-specified or will there be a series of back and forths? Maybe a set of prototypes (sketches) so that you can refine your requirements. At that point, the estimate for the <i>total</i> task (design <i>and</i> paint a mural, or design <i>and</i> develop a software application) becomes far less clear.<p>There are certainly programming tasks which are closer to the paint-a-wall task which are much easier to estimate reliably, but they&#x27;re far from the only thing people in this field work on.</div><br/><div id="39676653" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39676653" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kvmet</span><span>|</span><a href="#39675712">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39676333">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39676652">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39676653">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39676653">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This kind of thing destroys freelance devs who don&#x27;t have context.<p>Customer: &quot;Hi we need this small change.&quot;

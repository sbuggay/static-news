Economically speaking, what essential functions do registrars perform (specifically <i>in their capacity as</i> registrars [1]) that justify their existence? Why can&#x27;t people register say a .org domain name directly with the Public Interest Registry? Why is an intermediary like GoDaddy required?<p>There&#x27;s even a ICANN rule I think that says a registrar and a registry can&#x27;t be the same legal entity, which is why Google had to create a separate company called Charleston Road Registry for .dev, .app, .google etc (likewise Donuts created Dog Beach LLC and so on).<p>[1] I know most registrars offer additional services like hosting which smaller (and often non-profit) registries may not be equipped to provide. But that doesn&#x27;t really answer the question. Why can&#x27;t registries handle basic domain registration themselves &amp; leave hosting to specialized providers?</div><br/><div id="41031287" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41031287" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">toast0</span><span>|</span><a href="#41031114">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41031175">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41031287">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41031287">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Because people were tired of dealing with NetworkSolutions customer support, even if the registry service was good.

In the old days, if you didn&#x27;t like the service, you needed to find another TLD; post 1999, you can keep your domain and change your registrar when you want. The TLD can redelegate the registry business too, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the end customers very much.<p>There&#x27;s only 2800 registrars, and popular registries likely deal with each of them, but that&#x27;s not a large number.

You only pay what is charged by registries and ICANN<p>The problem is, running a registrar is complicated. It costs money. People get angry with you when things break - especially if they&#x27;ve paid you money.<p>You also have to deal with abuse reports, copyright complaints, and a legal demands.

And I setup two low volume OpenSRS reseller accounts for two companies in 2000, IIRC.<p>Registrar markup is not really that much. As I understand it, PIR, the operator of the .org registry charges registrars $9.05 &#x2F; domain year [1], and low cost registrars typically charge end users $10 &#x2F; domain year. I know there was a dust up over PIRs management recently, but I don&#x27;t remember the details and couldn&#x27;t find them in a quick look; if these aren&#x27;t the actual numbers, they&#x27;re pretty close. After payment processing, costs of included registrar provided services, customer service and operations, there&#x27;s not really huge profits being made by registrars; providing service as a pass through at direct cost wouldn&#x27;t be that compelling.<p>You&#x27;d need some other reason to encourage people to use your services, but I&#x27;m not sure what that would be. I&#x27;ve used specialty registrars at work, and they&#x27;ve got features like presence services where they have real people in the jurisdiction that satisfy the requirements of TLDs that require someone in the country to register a domain and corporate registrars that will work with the registry to enable registry locking that makes it incredibly difficult to change domain settings [2]. These are compelling features for the right kind of customer, but I don&#x27;t think it makes sense for a non-profit to provide them.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itp.cdn.icann.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;files&#x2F;registry-agreements&#x2F;org&#x2F;org-appx-08-pdf-17jul18-en.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itp.cdn.icann.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;files&#x2F;registry-agreements&#x2F;org&#x2F;o...</a><p>[2] We moved to one of those after the current flavor of Network Solutions was phished and an unauthorized person used a customer service account to change our domain&#x27;s glue records as well as some others; with registry lock, no changes can be made by the registrar unless the registry unlocks the domain after doing a song and dance routine with the end customer --- not very convenient, especially when the authorized person ignores the call to dance, but better than when a registry employee can get phished and change our domain without our consent</div><br/><div id="41031658" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41031658" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jdrmar</span><span>|</span><a href="#41031228">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41031399">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41031474">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41031658">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41031658">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Exactly.

I don&#x27;t know what the current rate is, but before they renegotiated, they were paying about $3&#x2F;domain to Affilias [1] based on a reported payment of $33M on just under 11 million domains.<p>I don&#x27;t really know where the rest of the money goes. There were a lot of questions when PIR tried to sell .ORG to private equity in 2020, but I don&#x27;t know if there was much follow up after the deal got quashed.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;domainnamewire.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;14&#x2F;org-sticks-afilias-backend&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;domainnamewire.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;14&#x2F;org-sticks-afilias-bac...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41031726" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41031726" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jiveturkey</span><span>|</span><a href="#41031228">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41031275">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41031726">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41031726">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">(2012)</div><br/><div id="41031941" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41031941" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nicexe</span><span>|</span><a href="#41031726">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41031275">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41031941">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41031941">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Although old, this is the currently valid version.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41031201" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41031201" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">para_parolu</span><span>|</span><a href="#41031789">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41031201">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41031201">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In a world of blockchain is there anything popular for truly distributed DNS?</div><br/><div id="41031579" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41031579" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">withinboredom</span><span>|</span><a href="#41031201">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41031579">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41031579">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Handshake is one unaffiliated with any existing chain.

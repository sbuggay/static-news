Pricing things is super hard. In a very liquid market it is difficult but doable, in an illiquid market (of one non-fungible asset) it is practically impossible. At what cadence do you update the estimate? How long is it binding for? If the value suddenly changes, how long a grace period do you have before you have to update the price?<p>You can try to patch this by saying that you have a right of first refusal -- that if someone offers to buy the asset at the price then you can accept their valuation as the new estimate of the price, and pay taxes going forward on the new value.<p>But then this defeats the point of the process because effectively the valuation is non-binding. So you have to put in all sorts of structures to prevent abuse -- maybe levy fines for past underpayment when the pricing is adjusted, or limit the number of re-pricings per time period.<p>And it incentivizes nuisance bidders, because owners will defend their property. So you have to put in restrictions like forcing escrow before the sale, or limiting bidding by a single entity.<p>Not to mention the difficulty in maintaining this registry of ownership of these assets, along with how to deal with more complicated deals about the rights involved -- film rights vs. tv rights vs. print rights, rights to individual characters, temporary licenses, etc., and all of that needs to be mechanized to allow a certain fixed list of the types of rights that can be granted, which right now is as extensive as a contract can contain -- if Sherlock Holmes were still in copyright, what if I just wanted to license Watson or make a film about Moriarty?<p>This is all just hopeless technocratic pie-in-the-sky dreaming.</div><br/><div id="42321366" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42321366" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nightski</span><span>|</span><a href="#42321341">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42321391">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42321366">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42321366">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Another problem in my mind is most creators could not afford the taxes for a high enough valuation (early on at least), but investment groups like blackrock could buy up all the copyrights&#x2F;patents on the cheap.

Same idea on, say a cap table -- both parties agree that in event of a dispute, they will make sealed binding offers for the whole company; higher offer must pay. I often recommend this to young startup CEOs when they have a team they haven&#x27;t worked with before, and I&#x27;ve occasionally suggested it to business partners.<p>Although I like the intuitive simplicity and game theoretic aspects of the arrangement, I&#x27;ve never seen it get through a partnership agreement or shareholder agreement round of redlines. Often lawyers feel nervous about it, and they&#x27;d prefer to litigate anyway; a space they are comfortable assessing and handicapping (and billing for). Often one party feels less sophisticated than the other, and thinks there might be a trap somewhere in there. Most sense, I think, that this sort of arrangement benefits the wealthier party.  I think Harberger taxes suffer from the same sort of problem: the most money wins the asset.<p>You mention, rightly, the absolute trash heap that Brian Herbert has made of Dune. You speculate, wrongly, I think, that this arrangement would have cut him out and protected the IP. Au contraire -- I think Brian has done very well financially from this IP ownership -- sadly, enshittification pays -- and I don&#x27;t see any reason to think that better stewardship would have resulted in more money to go buy out the IP than Brian&#x27;s made.<p>Particularly in a world of art and human creative output, I&#x27;m negative on forcing IP rights to the wealthiest owners -- I&#x27;d prefer a system that leaves it in the hands of people who might have a variety of interests that could dominate, even if that gives us some tragedies in exchange.<p>Anyway, a system of transparent IP with buyout values (or reference values) attached is not, to my mind, uniformly better than what we have -- the reference values will be wrong, they will not capture non-monetary value, and they don&#x27;t guarantee a ready buyer. It&#x27;s hard to see what we&#x27;d gain; I agree that we wouldn&#x27;t lose a lot, but there&#x27;s a lot of social and legal work to implement between here and there.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42322735" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42322735" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">adamc</span><span>|</span><a href="#42322043">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42322463">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42322735">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42322735">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The fundamental idea here is that you have no intrinsic right to the things you already possess.

I think that âauthors life + 95 yearsâ arguably stretches âlimited timeâ beyond reasonableness, but I digress.<p>There is a real cost, both to the society the law serves, and in the operation of law enforcement and judicial infrastructure needed to support copyright and patent enforcement.<p>Even if you 100% believe in copyright and patent, it seems like a reasonable thing for the direct benefactors of copyrights and patents to substantially bear the cost of enforcement.  A one-time filing fee (for patents) and nothing (for copyright) seems low.<p>There is also a societal cost in suppression of innovation by allowing these to last long periods of time, so it seems reasonable that the cost structure should be (1) related to the value of the work to the creator&#x2F;inventor, and (2) incentivize shorter times, especially if the values involved are low.<p>I donât fully grok Harberger taxes but it seems to me that they try to satisfy both my proposed criteria, but are flawed in that the value is stated by the inventor&#x2F;author but isnât flexible enough to handle how current pricing works in the market, and also seems to confuse the value of the work with the value of an instance&#x2F;copy of the work.  Maybe Iâm misinterpreting but I see other comments to that effect.<p>My proposal is to make the fee structure impute the value, by increasing over time.  For example, we could require a fee of $1000 for issuance of a copyright or patent (separate from the application fee).  The term would be for one year.  The patent&#x2F;copyright holder can extend for as many years as they want, but the cost goes up 10x each year.  If itâs a valuable asset, youâll keep paying until the cost of extension exceeds your perceived value.  Now the value is established by the most informed party in the market.<p>This is my proposal.  You can of course tinker with lengths and amounts and increase factors.<p>In sum the idea is that for valuable works (a Marvel Avengers movie or the patent on the RSA algorithm or a cancer drug) the copyright&#x2F;patent holder will keep paying for many years until itâs not profitable anymore.  For works that have little market value, they would fall into the public domain quickly and be able to help improve other works or inventions, and inhibit rent seeking.  It practically eliminates the incentive for patent trolling, or for suing an artist decades later for having a beat similar to a song 40 years ago, or for establishing huge defensive patent portfolios.  The economics arenât there anymore.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42322473" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42322473" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">observationist</span><span>|</span><a href="#42322508">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42321011">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42322473">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42322473">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t see malice sufficiently addressed.

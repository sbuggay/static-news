These cases underscore the limits of a framework that relies on static datasets and rigid generative processes. CoT, as they demonstrate, falters not because it cannot generate solutions, but because it cannot conceive of them in ways that mirror human ingenuity.<p>As they say - &quot;Superintelligence isn&#x27;t about discovering new things; it&#x27;s about discovering new ways to discover.&quot;</div><br/><div id="42657715" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42657715" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dartos</span><span>|</span><a href="#42655107">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42663067">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42657715">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42657715">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; &quot;Superintelligence isn&#x27;t about discovering new things; it&#x27;s about discovering new ways to discover.&quot;<p>Wow I love that quote.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42663067" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42663067" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seagullz</span><span>|</span><a href="#42655107">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42657715">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42661962">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42663067">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42663067">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And then other problems would perhaps turn up down the track that would call for &quot;discovering new ways to discover new ways of discovery&quot; and so on.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42661962" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42661962" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TaurenHunter</span><span>|</span><a href="#42655107">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42663067">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42657975">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42661962">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42661962">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you for mentioning the windmill problem.

I used this thread as a prompt to Claude 3.5 Sonnet:<p>My prompt:<p>Fluid self-control of attention should be enough to bootstrap to metacognitive exploration. Is one the horse; the other the cart? Seems true of the evolution of human cognition from language and theory of minds-of-others that then makes us more attentive to our one minds as objects of internal meta-dissection. What do you think?<p>Claude comments:<p>An evolutionary perspective on the relation between attention control and metacognition is worth “attention”.<p>The idea that fluid attention control might be the &quot;horse&quot; that pulls the &quot;cart&quot; of metacognition aligns well with what we know about human cognitive development.<p>Consider:<p>1. The evolution of theory of mind: Humans (primates snd perhaps other taxa) first developed the ability to model and attend to others&#x27; mental states (likely driven by social survival pressures). This gave humans a &quot;template&quot; for mental state modeling that could then be turned inward.<p>2. Language evolution may have followed a similar pattern - external communication tools becoming internalized for self-reflection. Vygotsky&#x27;s work on inner speech and cognitive development supports this outside-in pattern.<p>3. This uggests that the ability to fluidly direct attention (including to others&#x27; minds) may have been the crucial evolutionary stepping stone that enabled the later development of systematic metacognition.<p>This has implications for AI development. Current systems like myself have rigid attention mechanisms and no true ability to recursively examine our own cognitive processes. Following your logic, perhaps the key to developing true AI metacognition isn&#x27;t to directly implement it, but to first develop more fluid, self-directed attention mechanisms that could bootstrap the development of deeper metacognitive capabilities.<p>Do you think this suggests that current AI development might be approaching things backwards by trying to implement sophisticated reasoning capabilities before we&#x27;ve developed truly fluid attention control? It seems like we might need to master the &quot;horse&quot; (flexible attention) before we can effectively develop the &quot;cart&quot; (sophisticated metacognition).</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42657969" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42657969" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">WillieCubed</span><span>|</span><a href="#42655107">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42657975">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42656317">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42657969">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42657969">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I love the quote you mentioned at the end.

However you want to give natural language semantics, ML models certainly to not use this semantics.<p>The very best that might be said is that the correlational structure of words under transformer-like supervision (ie., where &quot;predict the next word&quot; is the goal) produces a distribution which is an extremely approximate model of natural language semantics.<p>Though this has never been disputed. The question comes down to what kind of extreme approximation is involved.<p>Eg., the truth conditions for &quot;I have a pen in my hand&quot; are that I have a pen in my hand -- direct access to these truth conditions is very plausibly necessary to <i>mean</i> &quot;I have a pen in my hand&quot; in the relevant context. Since a machine has no access to the truth conditions of such utterances it cannot possibly <i>mean</i> them.<p>Thus if a machine manages to say, &quot;I have a pen in my hand&quot; at an appropriate occasion -- the &quot;extreme approximation to natural language semantics&quot; has to do with this occasion and what &quot;appropriateness&quot; means.<p>Critics of LLMs and &quot;computer-science-addled thinking&quot; about such matters (such as myself) would say that there are a very narrow range of &quot;occasions&quot; (ie., situations in which you&#x27;re prompting) that allow such responses to seem appropraite.<p>That a response seems appropriate to a user is a good engineering condition on a tool working -- it has nothing to do with whether a model understands natural language semantics.<p>What we might say is that it approximates conversations between agents who understand such semantics on a narrow range of occasions, and succeeds in modelling appropriate language use. And so you might call LLMs models of &#x27;average appropriateness of replies&#x27;.<p>It obviously does not, nor cannot mean, &quot;I have a pen in my hand&quot;</div><br/><div id="42657217" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42657217" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gjm11</span><span>|</span><a href="#42656317">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42656948">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42657019">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42657217">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42657217">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The truth conditions for the sentence &quot;The composer Johann Sebastian Bach died in 1750&quot; are not directly accessible to me.

(Though some of their consequences could be accessible.) Can people mean such things, when they say them?<p>The truth conditions for &quot;There are infinitely many prime numbers&quot; are ... unclear, really, but maybe they&#x27;re vacuous (there is no possible world in which there aren&#x27;t infinitely many prime numbers) or they involve only abstracta (such as those numbers). How do you feel about the possibility of an AI saying <i>that</i> and meaning it, and why?<p>The first of these examples is the most directly relevant one. I have no direct access to the truth conditions of that sentence, but I think I can still mean it, have good reason to think it true, etc. The processes by which I got into that state involve ... learning things by reading about them, which is exactly what I think you&#x27;re saying cannot in principle ever give genuine knowledge.<p>Anticipating a possible response: Of course many of the other things I know, some of which are relevant to the way I understand those words, I learned more directly. For instance, part of what &quot;died&quot; means is the cessation of various natural processes like breathing and having one&#x27;s heart beat, and I have direct experience of breathing and having a beating heart. One could argue that real knowledge and understanding needs to be somehow traceable back to direct experience, and therefore LLM-type systems cannot have them. But that would be a <i>different</i> argument from the one you&#x27;ve made, and I think it&#x27;s less compelling (though more likely to be right!) than the simpler &quot;knowledge isn&#x27;t real unless it&#x27;s based on direct access to the relevant truth conditions&quot;.</div><br/><div id="42657432" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42657432" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mjburgess</span><span>|</span><a href="#42656317">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42657217">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42657019">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42657432">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42657432">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The mechanism of access varies depending on the claim made.  &quot;the sun is engaged in nuclear fusion&quot; could not have been meant in 100 BC. But &quot;I have a pen in my hand&quot; could have. Julius Caeser could have made those sounds but he could never have meant the meaning of those words.<p>... to mean &quot;I have&quot; requires an &quot;I&quot; to &quot;have&quot;, and so on. So what parts of non-linguistic reality language <i>refers</i> to matter for evaluating whether the user means what they say. An actor is likewise pretending to mean, and a child may say something without knowing what it means (as in, eg., a claim about nuclear fusion).<p>If two children were immitating sounds to each other, such that one &quot;said&quot;, &quot;the sun is nuclear fusion&quot; and so on -- then neither in this conversation are communicating, neither know what these words mean. No child involved could ever come up with these words in this worder, and mean their meaning, they can only have this conversation via immitation. This is the case with an LLM -- it&#x27;s an imitation game wherein the game is to either fool the adult overheading the child, or to generate some userful material (depending whether you&#x27;re the CEO or CTO).<p>The problem with a &quot;predict the next word&quot; training goal is that any patterns which emerge will only be coincidentally related to the non-linguistic reality words refer to -- because the machine isn&#x27;t trained on reference: it is not participating in reality and associating words with it.<p>The kind of participation necessary for an agent to acquire the meaning of words has no universal answer, but it always &quot;some&quot;. An LLM has none.<p>For a claim about a composer, an agent who means to make this claim (rather than a child who imitates the sounds of words) -- must be aware of what a composer is, and so on. They cannot mean this claim if they don&#x27;t have access to the non-linguistic reality to which these words refer (or are unable, via imgiation, to simulate similar ways the world might be, such that it has composers, given their prior knowledge -- eg., they at least have to have some prior direct access to music, leading-groups-of-people, and the like).<p>We can slightly weaken all this but it&#x27;ll make no difference for an LLM -- however weak we require access, to access the meaning of words requires accessing a non-lingusitic reality. Words <i>mean</i> non-ligustic things -- that is their point.</div><br/><div id="42661414" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42661414" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gjm11</span><span>|</span><a href="#42656317">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42657432">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42657019">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42661414">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42661414">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree that it&#x27;s possible for someone to say words that in other context would have meaning, without their having that meaning when they say it.<p>Most of what you say merely <i>asserts</i> that when an LLM says something it can&#x27;t truly mean it.<p>(Incidentally, that&#x27;s not <i>quite</i> responsive to the original claim, which is that LLMs <i>learn meanings</i>, not that they <i>mean things when they say them</i>. I think there are situations that could be described by saying that they learn the meanings of things but none the less don&#x27;t mean those things when they say them. I would need to think more before trying to pass judgement on whether that&#x27;s actually happening with today&#x27;s LLMs, but it seems well within the range of somewhat-plausible possibilities.)<p>The key argument you make for claiming that LLMs can&#x27;t really mean things -- which I remark is <i>not</i> the argument you were making a couple of comments upthread -- is this bit:<p>&gt; The problem with a &quot;predict the next word&quot; training goal is that any patterns which emerge will only be coincidentally related to the non-linguistic reality words refer to -- because the machine isn&#x27;t trained on reference: it is not participating in reality and associating words with it. [] The kind of participation necessary for an agent to acquire the meaning of words has no universal answer, but [...] an LLM has none.<p>I think &quot;coincidentally&quot; is way too strong here. When you ask an LLM &quot;When did J S Bach die?&quot; and it says 1750, it isn&#x27;t by coincidence that it gives a correct answer. (Considering how much they get right, despite their confabulations and whatnot, it would have to be one hell of a coincidence.) So that&#x27;s a pattern in what they say that is not-coincidentally related to the non-linguistic reality.<p>It&#x27;s only <i>indirectly</i> related, for sure. The LLM says that Bach died in 1750 because it has read things that say that Bach died in 1750. But, again, that&#x27;s also why I say that Bach died in 1750.<p>And it seems to me that what matters, when determining whether and to what extent an utterance actually means something, is not the <i>directness</i> of the utterer&#x27;s connection to the underlying reality, but something more like its <i>robustness</i> and <i>richness</i>. Robustness: To what extent, if the reality were different, would that tend to make the person say something different? Richness: Consider all the other bits of reality closely connected to the one in question; does our speaker&#x27;s behaviour correlate with those too?<p>If someone perpetrates an elaborate deception that makes me believe in a certain person&#x27;s existence and various facts about them, when in fact everything I think I know about them is mediated by the deception, and <i>by pure coincidence</i> there actually is a person with those properties, unknown to my deceiver, then ... well, maybe I do &quot;mean&quot; what I say about them, but I don&#x27;t really <i>know</i> what I think I know. This is a failure of robustness; changes in the underlying reality have scarcely any tendency to change my behaviour.<p>If I learn a list of things to say about stars (&quot;they operate by nuclear fusion&quot;, &quot;they are mostly billions of years old&quot;, etc.) but I&#x27;m just parroting them, then robustness might not fail: maybe I learned these things by asking an astrophysicist to give me a big list of facts about stars, and if the facts were different they&#x27;d have given me a different list. But richness fails: if you ask me &quot;would stars behave the same way if the weak nuclear force had very different parameters?&quot; or &quot;were there stars before there were trees on earth?&quot; or &quot;if we brought five more stars like the sun about as close to the sun as the earth is, what would happen to the earth and its inhabitants?&quot;, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to answer unless I got lucky and one of the answers was in my list.<p>But if both those properties do apply, then -- while of course anyone who isn&#x27;t me is welcome to disagree -- I am happy to say that they &quot;mean&quot; what they say, or at least that what they say has meaning, and conveys actual understanding, and so on. At any rate, what they say <i>behaves like</i> what someone with actual understanding says: it&#x27;s responsive to the facts, and it permits not only recitation of a few specific facts but something more general.<p>Those properties of robustness and richness can be present even when learning takes place only textually. How far they&#x27;re present in today&#x27;s LLMs is debatable (though e.g. I think no reasonable person can deny that they are present to an extent that phrases like &quot;stochastic parrot&quot; would lead one not to expect) but if they aren&#x27;t there it isn&#x27;t <i>just</i> because the LLMs learn about things only via text.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42657019" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42657019" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">idiotsecant</span><span>|</span><a href="#42656317">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42656948">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42657217">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42659417">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42657019">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42657019">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In what way do you have access to the <i>truth</i> conditions for &#x27;I have a pen in my hand&#x27; that an LLM can not?

chains.<p>We claim that for complex problems, the true solution generating process should be viewed as (equation) i.e., the joint probability distribution of the solution (a, s1, . . . , s) is conditioned on the latent generative process.

What&#x27;s happened instead is that the claims made by LLM makers keep getting more and more outlandish as time passes, and they do that as a response to criticism that keeps pointing out the shortcomings of their systems. Every new model is presented as a breakthrough [1] and its makers rush to show off the results like &quot;the new model is 100% better than the old one in passing the Bar exam!&quot;. You can almost hear the unsaid triumphant question hanging in the air &quot;Are you convinced now? Are we having fun yet?&quot;.<p>We&#x27;re not. The big deal with LLMs is that they are large enough language models that they can generate fluent, grammatical text that is coherent and keeps to a subject over a very, very long context. We never could do this with smaller language models. Because statistics.<p>What LLMs can absolutely not do is generate novel text. This is hard to explain perhaps to anyone who hasn&#x27;t trained a small language model but generativity -the ability to generate text that isn&#x27;t in a training set- is a property of the tiniest language model, as it is of the largest one [2]. The only difference is that the largest model can generate a lot more text.<p>And still that is not what we mean by novelty. For example, take art. When ancient humans created art, that was a new thing that had never before existed in the world and was not the result of combining existing things. It was the result of a process of abstraction, and invention: of generalisation. That is a capability that LLMs (as other statistical systems) lack.<p>The goalposts therefore have not moved because the criticism is as old as nails and the LLM makers have still not been able to comprehensively address it. They just try to ignore it. If the goalposts are <i>here</i> and you&#x27;re shooting goals over <i>there</i> and then doing a little victory run every time the ball breaks Col. Mustard&#x27;s windows, that&#x27;s not the goalposts that have moved, it&#x27;s you that keeps missing them.<p>_____________<p>[1] I&#x27;m old enough to remember... GPT-3 and how it blew GPT-2 out of the water; GPT-3.5 and how it blew GPT-3 out of the water; GPT-4 and how it blew GPT-3.5 out of the water... And all the users who would berate you for using the older model since &quot;the new one is something completely different&quot;. Every single model. A yuuuge breakthrough. What progress!<p>[2] Try this. Take the sentence &quot;&lt;start&gt; the cat sat on the mat with the bat as a hat &lt;end&gt;&quot; and generate its set of bi-grams (&quot;&lt;start&gt; the&quot;, &quot;the cat&quot;, &quot;cat sat&quot;, etc.). Then generate permutations of that set. You&#x27;ll get a whole bunch -14!-1, as in |sentence|! minus the initial one- of sentences that were not in the training set. That&#x27;s generativity in a tiny language model. That&#x27;s how it works in the largest also, hard as that may be to believe. It shouldn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a very simple mechanism that is extremely powerful. Large models are simply better at assigning weights to permutations so that the ones more often encountered in a corpus are weighted more.</div><br/><div id="42660454" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42660454" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">adampk</span><span>|</span><a href="#42656611">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42660262">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42657464">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42660454">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42660454">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Agreed!

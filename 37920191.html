H. Conway&#x27;s proof of Morley&#x27;s theorem.<p>Background: Morley&#x27;s theorem is a non-trivial theorem in planar euclidean geometry stated in 1899 (first proof appeared 15 years later). The proofs are not easy. One can use complicated trignometry identities to prove it. Even the &quot;simple&quot; proofs are sometimes quite involved.<p>Conway introduced some notation and almost trivialized it. The notation he introduced was just a* := a + 60 where a is the degree of an angle. No one would believe this notation can do anything good, but with them (and some other insight) Conway can explain the proof in just a few sentences! (One might think anyone who understand that the interior angles of a triangle will always have a sum of 180° can come up with this simple proof, but that just didn&#x27;t happen for 100 years until Conway revealed it.)<p>See page 3-6 here: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thewe.net&#x2F;math&#x2F;conway.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thewe.net&#x2F;math&#x2F;conway.pdf</a></div><br/><div id="37922773" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37922773" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AlexErrant</span><span>|</span><a href="#37922405">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37925425">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37922773">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37922773">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Michael Nielsen (with Andy Matuschak) also wrote about how Hindu-Arabic numerals enabled more powerful kinds of thinking (compared with Roman numerals.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;numinous.productions&#x2F;ttft&#x2F;#how-to-invent-hindu-arabic-numerals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;numinous.productions&#x2F;ttft&#x2F;#how-to-invent-hindu-arabi...</a><p>&gt; ...the Hindu-Arabic numerals aren’t just an extraordinary piece of design. They’re also an extraordinary mathematical insight. They involve many non-obvious ideas, if all you know is Roman numerals. Perhaps most remarkably, the meaning of a numeral actually changes, depending on its position within a number. Also remarkable, consider that when we add the numbers 72 and 83 we at some point will likely use 2+3=5; similarly, when we add 27 and 38 we will also use 2+3=5, despite the fact that the meaning of 2 and 3 in the second sum is completely different than in the first sum. In modern user interface terms, the numerals have the same affordances, despite their meaning being very different in the two cases. We take this for granted, but this similarity in behavior is a consequence of deep facts about the number system: commutativity, associativity, and distributivity</div><br/><div id="37922998" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37922998" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hyh1048576</span><span>|</span><a href="#37922405">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37922773">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37925425">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37922998">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37922998">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yep.

Even now, over a decade since solving problems, I can still recall most of it and use it if needed.<p>Once I got to upper and grad level math, the approach of simply understanding and solving problems failed me, because you are usually not provided enough problems compared to earlier courses. It may have been good enough for the course to get an A, but not good enough to retain the material beyond the course. I&#x27;ve studied complex variables (Cauchy Goursat, residues, etc) at least 3 times. It&#x27;s always a breeze, and it&#x27;s always forgotten soon after. The same with statistics. With the latter, what <i>did</i> finally help me was spaced repetition. Even though it&#x27;s been a few years since I last reviewed&#x2F;relearned statistics, I can still read some material involving it and understand it. This is <i>entirely</i> because of those flashcards.<p>Understanding definitely has to precede memorizing. Insisting that memorizing is a sign of poor understanding, however, is parochial thinking.

In so-called &quot;softer&quot; disciplines, the concepts are less precisely delineated, and their relationships are fuzzier. If you don&#x27;t quite understand some prerequisite concept, you can sort of muddle your way through even the later notions that depend on it. Not so for mathematics.

Math certainly <i>can</i> transfer to new domains, but I would never call that &quot;the point&quot; of math, and that&#x27;s also a totally different endeavor to be performed in addition to learning the math itself.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.johndcook.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;12&#x2F;homework-problems-are-rigged&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.johndcook.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;12&#x2F;homework-problems-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.econlib.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2012&#x2F;08&#x2F;low_transfer_of.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.econlib.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2012&#x2F;08&#x2F;low_transfer_of.htm...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37922118" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37922118" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Almondsetat</span><span>|</span><a href="#37921368">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37921936">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37923460">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37922117">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37922118">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37922118">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Understanding is remembering, remembering is understanding.<p>I seriously don&#x27;t get why people keep separating the two</div><br/><div id="37922853" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37922853" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ChainOfFools</span><span>|</span><a href="#37921368">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37922118">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37922618">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37922853">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37922853">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Because machines can remember without understanding and do just fine solving just about any problem you might find in undergrad math?

My current primary focus is building a spaced repetition platform for learning poker solver solutions with the aim of winning money at live poker games ( www.livepokertheory.com ) . The motivation for the project is just to work on an indie hacker project that self-funds itself since I use my own tool to make money. My app is not based on Anki since , besides wanting to independently monetize my work , I also wanted to build a poker-centric UX for it.<p>Now, within the poker community there is an idea that “GTO robots” (players who memorize game-theory equilibrium solutions produced by solver software) are inferior to intuitive players who exploit their opponents mistakes rather than play an equilibrium strategy which is suboptimal vs a non optimal opponent. For example, a GTO strategy will bluff very aggressively which is not good against opponents that never or rarely fold. Especially GTO play is criticized in live games where there is other info such as opponent “tells” such as shaking hands when making bets.<p>But it’s a false dichotomy as I believe studying equilibrium gives you a strong baseline understanding of the mechanics and in live play you can still listen to your gut and make adjustments.<p>The OP talks about math and I’m talking about poker but I’ve seen this concept discussed in a few other places. Basically, some education systems way overindex on rote memorization. And just rote memorization is a really bad way to learn and understand since you miss high level reasoning, problem solving, and abstraction. But some rote memorization can be good as a foundation for abstraction. I’ve seen some studies suggest people who can do arithmetic and basic algebra more quickly can do higher level proofs more effectively. They are less “bogged down” with low level mechanics when doing higher level thinking. Musicians who want to creatively and improvisationally “jam out” might still drill scales to build that low level technique to unlock the high level creativity on top of it.<p>And within learning and memorization, spaces repetition works really well. It matches something with our brain chemistry to review mostly new stuff but occasionally review old stuff that might be fading, it’s the right mix of novelty and preventing forgetting. Anki is heavily associated with flash cards for language learning Vocab and MCAT test prep so nice to see some others exploring it’s possibilities outside of that.</div><br/><div id="37924428" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37924428" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BenFranklin100</span><span>|</span><a href="#37921403">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37921481">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37924428">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37924428">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">“But some rote memorization can be good as a foundation for abstraction.

The relatively &quot;simple&quot; notions on which we build all other mathematical concepts, such as equality, relation, function, symmetry, associativity etc. actually have incredible depth to them. Too often, I think teachers and texts gloss over these notions instead of plumbing their philosophical depth and implications (statements like &quot;the proof falls out automatically&quot; or &quot;the proof is obvious&quot; or &quot;the proof is a natural consequence&quot; are a real disservice to learners). Both set theory and category theory are illustrations of just how far you can go with a few of these ideas (category theory, for instance, is basically entirely built up around the notion of a function and only two other ideas, identity and associativity—yet these three &quot;simple&quot; ideas alone are enough to construct a theory rich enough to model all the other branches of mathematics!)<p>Understanding mathematics is really understanding how to start approaching metamathematics. What does it mean to distinguish one class of things from another? What does it mean to say something has a property? That a property is reflected or preserved? These are the sorts of questions that are fruitful. It makes sense that the spaced repetition approach can help because it might necessarily force you to continue thinking about (and thus questioning) a concept you&#x27;d otherwise have taken for granted or not plumbed to sufficient depth. Too often, we fail to recognize how complicated &quot;simple&quot; things really are.</div><br/><div id="37922445" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37922445" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Affric</span><span>|</span><a href="#37921786">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37922512">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37922445">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37922445">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Too often, I think teachers and texts gloss over these notions instead of plumbing their philosophical depth and implications<p>I have a few questions:<p>What level of teacher?<p>Are you a maths teacher&#x2F;teaching academic?<p>My understanding of Maths education in the west is that they essentially spend the whole time attempting to get children to the point where they can do precalc and that any attempt at reform is eventually defeated by conservative engineers running a concerted political campaign to convince the voting public that set theory and category theory are a leftist conspiracy.<p>My experience of university mathematics was that set theory was assumed knowledge (fair, it has managed to stay in the curriculum), same with category theory (lol).<p>I would say that if it weren’t for the rise of the computer and the prevalence of relational databases in the late 20th C they would have managed to cut all non-precalc out entirely.</div><br/><div id="37924566" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37924566" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">galaxyLogic</span><span>|</span><a href="#37921786">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37922445">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37922525">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37924566">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37924566">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Many people lack basic &quot;numerical literacy&quot;.

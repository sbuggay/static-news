Money wasn&#x27;t invented to track scarce resources, money was invented to track who had paid taxes to the correct military invaders. The traditional &#x2F; pre-money form of economic system (in the sense of it being a system to track the usage of scarce goods) is the gift economy. This is the system humans are built to work in. But gift economies are backed by strong promises of identity in close-knit groups. A bunch of rapacious murderers extracting food out of the fifth town they&#x27;ve sacked this week aren&#x27;t going to be able to tell the difference between John, son of John, John, son of the brother of John, and John, son of the cousin of John.<p>What money does is separate a person&#x27;s identity from their ability to access scarce resources. This &#x27;paraidentity&#x27; of money is rendered in the most extreme in crypto. Your identity means nothing, just the size of your wallet, to the point where even voting in cryptocurrency is proudly for sale. The thing is, separating access to resources from personal identity also centralizes control of those resources. Printing money to fund war is not a bug, it is a feature.<p>In fact, it&#x27;s not even something Bitcoin fixes. The primary source of liquidity in the Bitcoin ecosystem is businesses buying it to pay data ransoms. Bitcoin, in the name of opposing statism, invented a new kind of state whose military consists of hackers penetrating and encrypting systems to force you to buy Bitcoin to decrypt them.<p>The way you debase Bitcoin is by inventing new kinds of Bitcoin. Because, remember, the scarcity isn&#x27;t the thing bringing liquidity into the system.

An ideal, 0% inflation currency (assuming that is ideal) would expand and contract automatically with economic conditions. Satoshi considered this problem but decided it was too complicated to implement, which is why he went with the fixed supply route.<p>Still, it&#x27;s worth remembering that a fixed supply currency will inevitably fail just as the metallic standards (which were semi fixed supply) did, and for the same reasons: politics. Metal backed currencies fell because the political will required to coordinate the system fell apart. Newly-enfranchised workers didn&#x27;t find the message &quot;suck it up, the gold standard requires it&quot; very appealing politically, so they voted for other things that entailed fiscal and monetary policy. Central Banks, seeing the writing on the wall, abandoned gold en masse, with the US retaining it only for other central banks.<p>Bitcoin would have the same problem. It would be inevitably deflationary - halvenings, for example, are tied to computational power. Presumably, more demand for Bitcoin means more computational power, so its supply decreases just as demand increases.<p>Deflation is even worse than inflation for working people. Investment dries up, because why would somebody take a gamble on a business if they can keep their cash in their closet and make money, risk free? Employment therefore drops, while people decrease spending - why spend $100 on something today, if you can buy it for $85 in a year? Additionally, loans get more expensive in real terms, wages decline, and a whole host of other bad things happen.<p>That&#x27;s why central banks target +2% inflation, in part. Inflation is preferable because it encourages investment, discourages nominal (and only nominal) wage decreases, decreases the real value of loans to the benefit of the debtor class, and other benefits. Central Banks also have a pretty successful record dealing with runaway inflation - hike rates, cause a recession, wait - whereas they lack tools to deal with deflation. At its simplest, the solution to deflation is for everyone to get a check from the government, but this whole field is considered weirdo experimental land and has only barely been tested.<p>All that is to say: Bitcoin is fundamentally ignorant of history and is incapable of becoming anything other than digital gold. It has a floor value which it cannot sink beneath: online gambling, illegal things, and privacy advocates (in that order) guarantee it will never truly hit $0.00. But it would be an absolute catastrophe for any country to adopt as its actual currency.<p>Now that I think of it, Bitcoin is perhaps one of the earliest examples of technophiles assuming society should work according to computer code, thereby &quot;cleaning&quot; these imperfect human systems by replacing them with the inevitable future: A philosophically-driven (rather than pragmatically or empirically, for example) system, with clear and inviolable rules, limited to no exceptions, and a happy ignorance of why existing systems came to be.

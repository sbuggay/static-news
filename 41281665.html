Clean Code will work well for somethings. If youâre iterating through a list of a thousand objects itâs one and a half time slower than a flat structure. If you were changing 4 properties in every element it might be 20 times less performant though.

On the flip side something like the single responsibility principle is completely solid for the most part.<p>Maybe if people like Uncle Bob didnât respond with âthey misunderstood the principleâ when faced with criticism we might have some useful ways to work with code in large teams. Iâd like to see someone do research which actually proves that the âmodernâ ways work as intended.

This spurred a rewrite of BSD fragments tied to the legacy unix codebase which fully portablized C and the GCC downstream projects which ended up benefiting the weird hobby OS linux disproportionately, and had it not had to be written from scratch we may have ended up with a wonderful 286-BSD rather than a 486-BSD, which at the time was still not fully clean room foss and unburdened. This was a time when large customers of OS products were trying to squeeze all the performance juice out of the existing systems instead of looking at new paradigms. We have things like the full SAST and warn-free release of sunOS around this time, where Sun was focused on getting a rock stable platform to then optimize around rather than efforts to produce products for the emerging Micro market. We can see that the concept of a portable unix system and c library as early as Xenix on the Apple Lisa in 1984.

if i wanted efficiency on a compiler that didn&#x27;t do the strength-reduction for me, i would write it as<p><pre><code>  int elems[5][300];

If you want to see the remnants of just a boatload of work, dig deep into the F83 system.<p>F83 is a top drawer Forth system. It implements the Forth 83 standard, and itâs in the public domain.<p>It runs on CP&#x2F;M and MS-DOS.<p>It has the editor, a single step debugger, virtual memory, multi tasking, an assembler, full source code, and it is self hosting (on top of its host OS) via its meta-compiler. But you could readily port it to a system with no real OS, needing little more than console I&#x2F;O and some kind of block device.<p>Itâs a hybrid block file based system. Historically you would just hand entire block volumes that would then be managed by Forth directly. Here, you create pre-allocated files that are then used in a customary Forth block style. It did not use text files for source code. It also has shadow screens for documentation. Shadow screens are where you divide the block volume in two, and the first half is source code, and the second is documentation. So if you have a 200 block volume, then screen 4 is code and screen 104 is documentation.<p>If you want to see the source code of a word, just type VIEW &lt;word&gt; and it will show you the screen that defines the word. The compiler embeds the source screen in each definition. A simple command will bring up the shadow screen to show the documentation.<p>It also has a word decompiler, and a threaded dictionary for better search performance. It has hundreds of words.<p>The real trick is imagining the work that went into this system. The bootstrapping process that converted this from a likely hand keyed, assembly based FIG Forth to what became F83. Starting with a pure, block screen based system to one that works with a file system, shifting code around on disk with little more than offsets and a copy routine thatâs little more than a block move.<p>On a slow, 2 floppy 8080, where resetting the system was the routine way to get back to a known state. Using a powerful, yet very dangerous language, rife with traps. Itâs like doing self surgery with a mirror.<p>The holes they must have blasted in the floor trying to avoid shooting themselves in the foot. Repeatedly.

In its own strange way C was portable to machines with unusual word sizes like the DEC PDP-10 with 36 bit words.  I used C on Z-80 on CP&#x2F;M and on the 6809 with Microwareâs OS-9.<p>In the 1980s there were books on FORTRAN, COBOL and PASCAL.  I know compilers for the first two existed for micros but I never saw them,  these were mainly on minicomputers and mainframes and I didnât touch them until I was using 32-bit machines in college<p>There were academics who saw the popularity of BASIC as a crisis and unsuccessfully tried to push alternatives like PASCAL and LOGO, the first of which was an unmitigated disaster because ISO Pascal gave you only what you need to work leetcode problems,  even BASIC was better for âsystems programmingâ because at least you had PEEK and POKE though neither language would let you hook interrupts.<p>Early PASCALs for micros were also based on the atrociously slow UCSD Pascal.  Towards the end of the 1980s there was the excellent Turbo Pascal for the 8086 that did what NiklausWirthDont and I thought was better than C but I switched to C because it portable to 32-but machines.<p>Iâd also contrast chips like the Z-80 and 6809 which had enough registers and address modes to compile code for and others like the 6502 where you are likely to resort to virtual machine techniques right away,  see<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SWEET16" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SWEET16</a><p>I saw plenty of spammy books on microcomputers in the late 1970s and early 1980s that seemed to copy press releases from vendors and many of these said a lot about PL&#x2F;M being a big deal although I never saw a compiler, source code, or knew anybody who coded it.</div><br/><div id="41282452" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41282452" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pvg</span><span>|</span><a href="#41281753">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41282348">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41282846">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41282452">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41282452">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>Towards the end of the 1980s there was the excellent Turbo Pascal for the 8086</i><p>TurboPascal was released at the tail end of 1983 targeting CP&#x2F;M and the Z80.

I have used them on both Intel 8080 and Zilog Z80.<p>The MS FORTRAN compiler was decent enough. It could be used to make programs that were much faster than those using the Microsoft BASIC interpreter.<p>Even if you preferred to write some program in assembly, if that program needed to do some numeric computations it was convenient to use the MS Fortran run-time library, which contained most of the Fortran implementation work, because the Fortran compiler generated machine code which consisted mostly of invocations of the functions from the run-time library.<p>However, for that you had to reverse-engineer the library first, because it was not documented by Microsoft. Nevertheless, reverse-engineering CP&#x2F;M applications was very easy, because an experienced programmer could read a hexadecimal dump almost as easy as the assembly language source code.

Why <i>these</i> blocks in particular? What <i>else</i> is out there?<p>The ChatGPT explainer that he mentioned[1] is <i>still</i> my go-to article for learning about it; I think I&#x27;ll add another one of his to the list.<p>Finally, the bit one why <i>history</i> is important - and finding out his archive of writing on history of math and science[4] is great. I believe that history is the most underappreciate science itself, and learning science without its history leaves you without either context or deep understanding of it.<p>(Personally, I add <i>etymology</i> to history: I find resources like &quot;Earliest Known Uses of Some Mathmatical Terms&quot;[5] invaluable).<p>And, of course, it&#x27;s great to see that he&#x27;s diving into linking mathematics, computation, physics, biology. Great discoveries often lie on the interfaces of various fields.<p>As Vladimir Arnold wrote in his famous essay[6], divorcing mathematics from physics has been a phenomenal crime. I&#x27;m guilty of it too. I recently made a post on reddit[7] with a GIF showing the osculating circles and the evolute of an ellipse. It&#x27;s pretty, but what is <i>really</i> hiding behind it is the shape of the gear tooth which nearly <i>all</i> gears have.<p>I learned (and taught!) the mathematics behind it without having any understanding how gears are designed and why they work. And people who make gears make them without understanding the math behind the equations. This came up at work (I&#x27;m working on implicit CAD modeling), and from a discussion a better understanding (...and a better product) emerged. There is no reason for narrow specialization that creates barriers in fields that aren&#x27;t just related, but are <i>necessary</i> for each other - so I believe that the mere fact of Wolfram doing this work is important.<p>Maybe he&#x27;ll find out something groundbreaking in those directions. Maybe not. But I can <i>guarantee</i> that he and people around him will stumble into fascinating things along the way that they wouldn&#x27;t encounter otherwise.<p>Lord Kelvin thought that what makes atoms different is how they&#x27;re tied into different knots. That turned out to not describe the reality of atoms at all - but gave rise to knot theory[8], which has since gained a fundamental ground in mathematics, particularly - topology (you can construct any 4-manifold by removing a tubular neighborhood of a knot in 3-sphere and gluing it back with some twists - see Dehn Surgery[9]). So, while Kelvin did not find what he was looking for there, the direction his effort has jump-started <i>may</i>, in fact, fundamentally describe our reality - as we have yet to learn what kind of manifold structure our <i>universe</i> has. And knot<p>Anyway. All in all, good, thought-provoking article (this comment, which contains some thought at least, is a testament to that); I&#x27;d recommend looking beyond the title and looking into the things Wolfram mentions. There&#x27;s a ton of interesting tangents there.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;romankogan.net&#x2F;adhd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;romankogan.net&#x2F;adhd</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writings.stephenwolfram.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;what-is-a-computational-essay&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writings.stephenwolfram.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;what-is-a-comput...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writings.stephenwolfram.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;08&#x2F;whats-really-going-on-in-machine-learning-some-minimal-models&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writings.stephenwolfram.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;08&#x2F;whats-really-goi...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writings.stephenwolfram.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;02&#x2F;what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writings.stephenwolfram.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;02&#x2F;what-is-chatgpt-...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writings.stephenwolfram.com&#x2F;category&#x2F;historical-perspectives&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writings.stephenwolfram.com&#x2F;category&#x2F;historical-pers...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk&#x2F;Miller&#x2F;mathword&#x2F;m&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk&#x2F;Miller&#x2F;mathword&#x2F;m&#x2F;</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.fsu.edu&#x2F;~wxm&#x2F;Arnold.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.fsu.edu&#x2F;~wxm&#x2F;Arnold.htm</a><p>[7] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;math&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1f1yblk&#x2F;evolute_of_an_ellipse_and_its_osculating_circles&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;math&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1f1yblk&#x2F;evolute_of_an...</a><p>[8] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_knot_theory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_knot_theory</a><p>[9] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncatlab.org&#x2F;nlab&#x2F;show&#x2F;Dehn+surgery" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncatlab.org&#x2F;nlab&#x2F;show&#x2F;Dehn+surgery</a></div><br/><div id="41407097" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41407097" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AlbertoGP</span><span>|</span><a href="#41406683">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41406552">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41407097">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41407097">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>The ChatGPT explainer that he mentioned[1]</i><p><pre><code>  This should be [3].

There is a quite probably apocryphal quote that Jimmy Carter asked Volcker &quot;can you end inflation&quot; to which Volcker replied &quot;Yes, but it&#x27;ll probably cost you re-election&quot; and Carter said do it. Reagan then swept in under these conditions.<p>Most of the &quot;market reforms&quot; under Reagan were more pro-business than pro-market and resulted in big problems like the savings and loan crisis, among other things.<p>Carter was also a very uninspiring person who mused too much in interviews and press conferences, which didn&#x27;t <i>look</i> decisive to the general public, even though it showed how he was thinking.<p>Either way, he was an underrated president that was more a victim of timing and did what was best for the country.</div><br/><div id="42543555" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42543555" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">linguae</span><span>|</span><a href="#42543452">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42544042">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42543555">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42543555">[27 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For these reasons, Jimmy Carter is my third-favorite president of the 20th century, behind my favorite, Calvin Coolidge, and my second-favorite, Dwight Eisenhower.

It’s more like paying for discount healthcare but has the major medical built in.</div><br/><div id="42546497" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42546497" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gigatree</span><span>|</span><a href="#42543338">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42546405">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42546515">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42546497">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42546497">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Stupid question but does that mean the “discount” comes from tax dollars? i.e. medical costs are spread out more but we’re also collectively spending more of our income on it?</div><br/><div id="42546658" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42546658" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lotsofpulp</span><span>|</span><a href="#42543338">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42546497">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42546515">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42546658">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42546658">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The discount is from a knowledgeable entity who buys lots of healthcare knowing what they are buying (theoretically preventing fraud) and what competing healthcare providers are selling at, and also negotiating with the collecting purchasing decision of thousands or millions of insureds.<p>Edit:  since I can’t respond to comment below due to hitting too fast posting limit:<p>Post ACA and pre ACA plans are completely different products due to out of pocket maximum, age rating factor caps, and inability to screen for pre existing conditions.<p>Hence comparing pre and post ACA health insurance prices is not meaningful.</div><br/><div id="42546760" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42546760" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gigatree</span><span>|</span><a href="#42543338">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42546658">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42546515">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42546760">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42546760">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Was thinking of the tax credit, but yeah that makes sense (assuming that the post-ACA unsubsidized price of a plan is lower than its pre-ACA price).</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42546515" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42546515" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pkulak</span><span>|</span><a href="#42543338">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42546405">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42546497">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42546647">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42546515">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42546515">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You can buy it as long as you also have an HSA account, which you should have anyway because it’s pre tax.</div><br/><div id="42546657" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42546657" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lotsofpulp</span><span>|</span><a href="#42543338">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42546515">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42546647">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42546657">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42546657">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That is a High Deductible Health Plan, which have out of pocket maximums capped in the $10k per calendar year range.

Carter&#x27;s Response<p>&gt;From the beginning, President Jimmy Carter gave the hostage crisis a high profile. It was the focus his and his country&#x27;s attention, day after day. But that was exactly wrong approach to take if he wanted to get the hostages out, without making it seem like he conceded to terrorism. Not only did the Iranians benefit from the publicity, but the constant crisis took time away and attention from other important problems, like the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the 1980 presidential election.<p>&gt;What Carter should have recognized was that there were different factions in the Iranian government competing with each other for power, and the hostage situation would go on as long as the Iranians could use the situation to their political advantage. If there was not as much attention on the hostage crisis, it would have not been as useful a propaganda tool.<p>&gt;The President threatened a military response if the hostages were harmed or put on trial. The threat was deterrent, not coercive. Such threats are most effective at keeping somebody from doing something they haven&#x27;t already done. The threat worked. Iran stopped saying they were going to put the hostages on trial and execute them.<p>&gt;Carter considered several courses of military action. He decided not to mine Iranian ports, as that would interfere with other countries, and might provoke the Iranians to harm the hostages. He did however order that a rescue plan be drawn up, but he hoped it wouldn&#x27;t have to be used.<p>&gt;The other effective measures he took were to freeze Iranian monetary assets, and to impose an arms embargo and economic sanctions. His goal was to get other countries to go along with the embargo and sanctions.<p>&gt;IV. The Hostage Rescue Mission<p>&gt;On April 23, 1980, an abortive Iranian hostage rescue mission took place, conducted under the utmost secrecy. The plan was to storm the American embassy in Tehran, and bring home the hostages.<p>&gt;8 helicopters, 6 C-130 transport planes, and 93 Delta force commandoes secretly invaded Iran. They were to rendezvous at a place in Iran they called Desert One, move out to another point called Desert Two, and then go on to Tehran to rescue the hostages. But Delta force never made it to Desert Two or Tehran. The mission was aborted after three of the eight helicopters failed, on the way to Desert One. The operation was a miserable failure, resulting in an accident that caused the loss of 8 American lives. Later investigation revealed a surprising level of negligence. [4] [7] [13]<p>&gt;Just before the rescue mission took place, several other countries had finally agreed to level economic sanctions on Iran. Some of them agreed to the sanctions because they thought that if they did, the U.S. would not take any military action. They were quite irate when they heard about the rescue mission after the fact.<p>&gt;At least three central figures in the Iran-Contra Scandal were involved with the Iranian hostage rescue mission: Secord, Hakim, and North.<p>&gt;General Richard Secord helped to organize the abortive rescue mission. After the first mission failed, he was the head of the planning group that eventually decided against another rescue attempt. Because the whereabouts of the hostages were unknown, the second rescue attempt (the October Surprise that the Reagan-Bush campaign was so worried about) never happened.<p>&gt;Secord was later suspended from his Pentagon post because of the EATSCO probe. EATSCO is a company that belongs to Edwin Wilson, the CIA operative who is currently serving time in a federal maximum-security prison for, among other things, secretly supplying 43,000 pounds of plastic explosives to Kadaffi. [21]<p>&gt;In 1981, he became Chief Middle East arms-sales adviser to Secretary of Defense Casper W. Weinberger. [21]<p>&gt;Albert Hakim is a wealthy arms merchant, an Iranian exile, and CIA informant, who had a &quot;sensitive intelligence&quot; role in 1980 hostage rescue. He worked for the CIA near the Turkish boarder, handling the logistics of the rescue mission in Tehran. Hakim purchased trucks and vans, and rented a warehouse on the edge of Tehran to hide them in until they were needed for the operation. Unexpectedly however, he skipped town the day before the rescue mission. [2] [13] [25] Later on, in July, 1981, Hakim approached the CIA, with a plan to gain favor with the Iranian government by selling it arms. [22]<p>&gt;Oliver North led a secret detachment to eastern Turkey. He was in the mother ship on the Turkish border awaiting the cue from Secord to fly into Teheran and rescue the hostages. [2] [25] After the first aborted rescue mission, he worked with Secord on a second rescue plan.<p>&gt;According to the October Surprise theory, Secord, North and Hakim did not intend Desert One to carry through. The miserable failure of Carter&#x27;s Desert One rescue attempt may have been deliberate.<p>[More intriguing details about the sabotage, election, Iran Contra Scandal, and citations in the full paper: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.donhopkins.com&#x2F;home&#x2F;documents&#x2F;OctoberSurprise.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.donhopkins.com&#x2F;home&#x2F;documents&#x2F;OctoberSurprise.ht...</a> ]</div><br/><div id="42544040" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42544040" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">UncleOxidant</span><span>|</span><a href="#42543338">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42543516">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42543993">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42544040">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42544040">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;From the beginning, President Jimmy Carter gave the hostage crisis a high profile.<p>As someone who remembers that era, I&#x27;m not entirely sure I agree with that.

Reagan was certainly charming, but I beleive he didn&#x27;t have the integrity of Carter. While Reagan let dictators like Pinochet commit heinous human rights abuses so long as they were anti-communist, Carter put actual pressure on the regime and sought answers.

Jimmy Carter, then-governor, pops up at the end to be taken in a canoe down a river that the couple of workers want protected. Having basically nobody around to impress, Carter is nonetheless affable, open, curious, and generally good-hearted. The piece ends at the governor&#x27;s mansion, like this:<p><i>A ball sat on the pavement. Before going in, we shot baskets for a while. &quot;The river is just great,&quot; the Governor said, laying one in. &quot;And it ought to be kept the way it is. It&#x27;s almost heartbreaking to feel that the river is in danger of destruction. I guess I&#x27;ll write a letter to all the landowners and say, &#x27;If you&#x27;ll use some self-restraint, it&#x27;ll decrease the amount of legal restraint put on you in the future.&#x27; I don&#x27;t think people want to incur the permanent wrath of the governor or the legislature.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;I&#x27;ve tried to talk to property owners,&quot; Carol said. &quot;To get them to register their land with the Natural Areas Council. But they wouldn&#x27;t even talk to me.&quot;</i><p><i>The Governor said, &quot;To be blunt about it, Carol, why would they?&quot;</i><p><i>The Governor had the ball and was dribbling in place, as if contemplating a property owner in front of him, one-on-one. He went to the basket, shot, and missed. Carol got the rebound and fed the ball to Sam. He shot. He missed, too.</i><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;1973&#x2F;04&#x2F;28&#x2F;travels-in-georgia" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;1973&#x2F;04&#x2F;28&#x2F;travels-in-geo...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42545080" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42545080" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ChuckMcM</span><span>|</span><a href="#42545332">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42547287">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42545080">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42545080">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I found this opinion piece or carter (also from the post) compelling:

He established the Senior Executive Service and insulated civil service workers against political pressure. He slowed the revolving door for departing officials and placed independent inspectors general in every department. The Office of Special Counsel originated with his legislation to investigate possible wrongdoing by high-level officials. And he extended ethical standards to the private sector through the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, barring corporations from bribing foreign officials to obtain contracts. With Walter Mondale, he created the modern vice presidency as a fully engaged partnership.</i><p>That and his campaign slogan to not lie to people really highlighted his integrity.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42547287" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42547287" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ddingus</span><span>|</span><a href="#42545080">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42544252">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42547287">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42547287">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you Mr. Carter for a life of public service well lived.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42544252" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42544252" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gslin</span><span>|</span><a href="#42547287">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42544096">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42544252">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42544252">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;677UB" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;677UB</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42544096" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42544096" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jmward01</span><span>|</span><a href="#42544252">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42544066">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42544096">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42544096">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">He was a great human being.

At Dynamicland, each version of a program is a sheet of paper (with a unique set of fiducials along the edges).  If you want to edit a program, you grab a keyboard and point it at the program.  A text editor comes up; you make your changes, and hit commit.  When you do, it spits out a new piece of paper with your changes.  Put it in the view of the camera to use the new version.  Take it away and use the old paper to roll the change back.</div><br/><div id="41452731" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41452731" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">d--b</span><span>|</span><a href="#41448957">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41449063">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41452731">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41452731">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Can you “pipe” the results of one paper onto one of the inputs of the next?<p>That’d be pretty funky.</div><br/><div id="41452779" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41452779" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jf</span><span>|</span><a href="#41448957">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41452731">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41449063">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41452779">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41452779">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes.

It&#x27;s great fun and the people are just wonderful. I think of Realtalk as adding another layer to programs, the Physical Layer. Program behavior can be determined and controlled by physical layout as well as code. It&#x27;s not completely unlike a frontend&#x2F;backend distinction, and in fact you could make a Realtalk simulator using a javascript canvas much more easily than building the camera&#x2F;projector setup.<p>Just like building full stack software, there&#x27;s a large amount of nonobvious skill in dictating your separations of concerns between the physical layer and software layer. Good programs are flexible, remixable, modular, intuitive, and let non-programmers make nontrivial interactions and enhancements via the physical layer. Bad programs require you to have the physical objects in a particular configuration, or break completely if one piece of paper is lost. I found these programming design questions a really interesting part of playing at Dynamicland.<p>A solid limitation of the system is that the pieces of programs aren&#x27;t actually modular. You can&#x27;t take a Cat from one program and a Dog from another program and have the dog interact with the cat. This is obvious in software - that&#x27;s why we design APIs - but it&#x27;s frustrating when all your programs exist in the same space (that&#x27;s the whole selling point) and when bringing part of Program A into Program B is so intuitive and, when you have dozens of these programs lying around the room, inevitable.<p>I&#x27;d love to see them explore (wait for it...) using AI. Incorporating object recognition could remove the need for pasting dots onto every object by defining rules like &quot;when you see a car, color it Red&quot;. It could allow for inter-program interoperability via the shared language of object recognition. And it could even determining logical interactions in a fun and surprising way: what _should_ happen when I take the cactus from this program and put it on top of the balloon from that program?</div><br/><div id="41452752" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41452752" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jf</span><span>|</span><a href="#41451072">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41451973">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41452752">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41452752">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  You can&#x27;t take a Cat from one program and a Dog from another program and have the dog interact with the cat. This is obvious in software - that&#x27;s why we design APIs - but it&#x27;s frustrating when all your programs exist in the same space<p>I also thought this, but learned that what I needed was an Alan Kay style &quot;change of perspective&quot;.<p>The key for me was understanding the &quot;wish&quot; and &quot;claim&quot; concepts in Realtalk. In your example above, you would need to separate your &quot;Dog&quot; program into two programs: One that was simply a program claiming &quot;I am a dog&quot; and another that would encode dog behavior, something like &quot;I wish that a bark sound would play when a dog is near a house&quot; - then you&#x27;d leave it up to Realtalk to make that happen. Adding &quot;Cat&quot; behavior would mean adding two new programs: one to claim &quot;I am a cat&quot; and another &quot;I wish that a meow sound would play when a cat is near a house&quot;. To make the &quot;Dog&quot; and &quot;Cat&quot; interact, you&#x27;d add a program that said &quot;I wish that a growl sound would play when a dog is near a cat&quot; and so on.<p>Another example that might help is how I learned this myself: I made a set of playing cards. What I ended up with was 52 pieces of card stock, each one had a program that was simply &quot;Claim that I am card X&quot; - and then I made separate programs the give those cards meaning. For example a program to give the cards a style would be something like &quot;I wish that card 1 will have the Ace of Spaces printed on it, etc&quot; and another program would be something like &quot;I wish that the sum of all face values of the cards on this line is printed next to the line&quot;<p>It took me several days to internalize this, but once I did things started getting fun pretty quickly. For example, I was able to make a program to &quot;clone&quot; a real world image onto a playing card by having Realtalk take a picture of a rectangle and then always project that image onto a particular card when it was face up. Because the cards just made claims about their identities, this let me separate the designs on the cards from the rules as well as add &quot;training mode&quot; programs to help teach basics. And they were all decoupled!</div><br/></div></div><div id="41451973" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41451973" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jes5199</span><span>|</span><a href="#41451072">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41452752">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41452485">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41451973">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41451973">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">it should be possible to make objects that are general-purpose, you end up with a bunch of low-code reusable things like &quot;dog&quot; or &quot;car&quot;, and they have stable representations than can be used as data in multiple other programs</div><br/></div></div><div id="41452485" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41452485" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">miffing</span><span>|</span><a href="#41451072">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41451973">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41454640">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41452485">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41452485">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">related: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dynamicland.org&#x2F;2024&#x2F;FAQ&#x2F;#What_is_Realtalks_relationship_to_AI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dynamicland.org&#x2F;2024&#x2F;FAQ&#x2F;#What_is_Realtalks_relation...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41454640" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41454640" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aardwolf</span><span>|</span><a href="#41451072">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41448485">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41454640">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41454640">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I didn&#x27;t want to watch videos while at work so had to do it with the text, and trying to figure out what it was was hard.

It was a specific video that I saw that I think every maker and every creator should see called “Inventing on Principal” by Bret Victor.

The &quot;arrangement of components&quot; and the &quot;hand-drawn diagram&quot; shots show stuff drawn on a whiteboard, which seems like it can be edited by redrawing. Are you saying that a hand-drawn diagram program can be freely edited by changing the diagram, but a language-based program cannot be edited by changing the representation of its code? That seems ... worse.<p>I would think that you&#x27;d want a fiducial marker on code-printouts to identify that a piece of code has a language and a namespace perhaps (i.e. &quot;this page contains a kotlin definition that lives in com.acme.foo&quot;), but that the contents should be modifiable.

Yes, there are definitely some people with, say, an &quot;executive mindset&quot; who love social interaction so much that they want that to be all they do all day every day.<p>But for many people, the activities they enjoy most are ones that involve solitary direct manipulation. If I&#x27;m going fishing, I want to cast the lure myself and feel the snap of it thrum through the rod. I want to feel the tension on the line when a fish bites. Waving at a robot and asking it to catch me a fish would be a strictly, catastrophically inferior experience.<p>What is gardening if your hands don&#x27;t get dirty or woodworking if you don&#x27;t come home smelling like wood shavings?<p>Here&#x27;s a way to look at it: When people retire and no longer need to choose their activities based on financial need, how much time to they often end up spending giving instructions to people? I hear a lot of retirees puttering in their garden, playing board games, tinkering on an old motorcycle, or getting better at guitar. Some definitely do join community organizations too, but humans are as much a tool-using species as a social one.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41448668" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41448668" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shortrounddev2</span><span>|</span><a href="#41448639">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41452204">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41449081">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41448668">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41448668">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I feel that mobile screens and AR are going to be the future</div><br/><div id="41448691" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41448691" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">modeless</span><span>|</span><a href="#41448639">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41448668">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41449081">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41448691">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41448691">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Mobile screens are the present, in the form of phones.

They often fall into one of the following categories:<p>-  “People won’t get the core ideas and will use it to make things that go against the core ideas” — People who care about Bret Victor’s work will take the time to learn the ideas. People who don’t might try and make something Bret doesn’t like, but currently the world is full of things Bret doesn’t like, so I don’t get how that would be different than the status quo.<p>- “It’s actually ‘anti-internet’, reimagining computers as objects in physical space, without the intangible connections provided by the internet” — Cool! I’d like to use it to make an airgapped little lab thing for people in my city to play and experiment in, but I can’t do that unless it’s released to the community.<p>- “Yeah but remember it’s ‘anti-internet’, releasing it open source on the internet would violate the core principles.” — This feels too cute by half. I don’t consider this a legitimate objection.<p>- “Just come to Oakland, you’ll understand when you get here and use it.” — That’s way out of many people’s budgets. I also get the feeling that I wouldn’t come around just by seeing it, I think I’d want one in my city even more.<p>- “You’re not entitled to other people’s work.” — True, but most stuff done in this sort of research space is done with the intent of spreading an idea or increasing the public good. It seems kind of odd that the Dynamicland folks keep talking about what a revolutionary concept it is while preventing 99.9% of people from actually experiencing it.<p>Overall it just seems like such a weird attitude. I get that they’re worried about the world misunderstanding their ideas, but at this point there are tons of people who have been eating up Bret Victor’s work and have immense respect for his ideas, and would gladly watch, listen to or read whatever instructions would be necessary to help someone who’s already bought in “play by the rules” and get the best possible experience.</div><br/><div id="41451737" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41451737" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sorrythanks</span><span>|</span><a href="#41449627">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41451004">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41451737">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41451737">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think you can look at some of the other replies in this thread to see how deeply this can be misunderstood.

(Indicator collision, portability of indicators between Dynamicland instances, and debugging are just a few off the top of my head.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="41449926" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41449926" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">koolala</span><span>|</span><a href="#41454422">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41448826">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41449926">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41449926">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m hopeful VR programming with standardized programming languages and AI will create a Dynamicland-like software environment one day.

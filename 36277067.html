They feel they stepped inside Marie Antoinette&#x27;s mind as it existed during a turbulent episode when MA was in danger.<p>I am not an authority on this subject but while reading this article I was reminded of another strange encounter documented by a well-known author.<p>I believe that it was John Steinbeck who described in his book of collected WWII experiences &quot;Once There Was A War&quot; an event which happened to him one evening during the Blitz.<p>From memory he recalled walking along a lane one night and passing a warmly lit cottage home with an old woman visible through a window. It was a peaceful scene. I think the story went that he didn&#x27;t remember the cottage being there when he went by earlier and asked someone local about it. They told him that there had indeed been a cottage at that place but that it had been hit by a German bomb and destroyed, killing the old lady who lived there a long time before he walked by the spot.<p>Anyway, nice story. The world is full of things that are hard to explain.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36289157" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36289157" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Simon_O_Rourke</span><span>|</span><a href="#36288993">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36289157">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36289157">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In terms of Fortean experiences, these are sometimes called timeslips, and there&#x27;s plenty of them documented, however that encounter in Versailles is the one that usually gets rolled out. There&#x27;s been a few cases of forward-slips, definitely looking forward to getting my hands on a hover-car is things like this are to be believed.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.forteana.org&#x2F;index.php?threads&#x2F;time-or-dimensional-slips.13755&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.forteana.org&#x2F;index.php?threads&#x2F;time-or-dimens...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

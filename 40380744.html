It was my dream job. At the time deviantArt made money a few ways.<p>In no particular order, because I don&#x27;t know which were profitable or which represented a larger portion of revenue:<p>- Subscriptions (users could pay for a few extra features and to disable ads on the site)
- DeviantArt branded merch.
- Prints and products with users&#x27; art printed on them
- Sponsored Contests. These promoted movies or other media properties, or software of interest to artists. Often the prizes included Wacom tablets and Adobe Photoshop licenses.<p>During my time there a significant problem we were dealing with was due to deviantArt&#x27;s stance on adult content. Anything was allowed as long as it wasn&#x27;t outright pornography.  In practice that meant that nudes were allowed but sexual acts were not. This had consequences for deviantArt&#x27;s revenue. It meant that we could not run ads from the &quot;reputable&quot; ad networks and were forced to deal with seedier outfits that often (e.g. constantly) included malware in the display ads, exposing users to all sorts of nasty stuff. One of my projects was to detect and&#x2F;or prevent the malware ads which proved challenging and at least given the amount of resources devoted to it, it was not very fruitful.<p>It really is sad for me to see what deviantArt has devolved into. Once the original founders sold out a few years ago I really didn&#x27;t hold out much hope for the site&#x27;s future.</div><br/><div id="40387452" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40387452" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sph</span><span>|</span><a href="#40385401">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40386039">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40387452">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40387452">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; This had consequences for deviantArt&#x27;s revenue.

Two platforms appealing to amateur and small artists grow to great relevance among a patchwork of subcultures. Then, they start trying to turn a profit and end up alienating the entire userbase that carried them to that point. DeviantArt is much further down that road than Tumblr is, though.

Their business model relies on art remaining scarce enough to not exhaust the demand for art. A machine that lets you create unlimited art for the cost of some GPU time completely destroys the economic underpinnings of most artistic endeavor.

Which created a situation where an outgoing management pretty much ordered to not bother fixing it and just banning it all, hoping that Verizon&#x27;s &quot;family friendly&quot; policies meant that it wouldn&#x27;t jeopardize the sale (which it turns out, the sale wasn&#x27;t jeopardized).<p>You can still kinda see it in how broken the actual removal was; they just excised the NSFW from the frontend by marking the posts as sensitive on the API and then preventing the frontend from viewing anything sensitive. For years (and maybe even today) you could just scrape the API to find NSFW posts, although that&#x27;s on the decline since most NSFW Tumblr accounts have been deleted entirely by the actual people behind them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40387784" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40387784" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zimpenfish</span><span>|</span><a href="#40382759">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40386520">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40387503">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40384868">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40387784">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40387784">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Apple mandated the changes to Tumblr that pissed everyone off.<p>That&#x27;s not true - Tumblr already had their &quot;no adult content&quot; plans in place well before the CSAM problem caused Apple to temporarily suspend them from the app store.

Anyone can tell you that a very large portion of the money changing hands online for art (adult and not) is actually changing <i>paws</i>, so dA missed out of having a slice of that, whether through advertising or facilitating transactions. Worse, its reputation was tarnished among adjacent subcultures.<p>There have also been regular ToS panics every 2 or 3 years, where someone&#x27;s (mis)interpretation of the licensing rights dA claimed for being able to modify and distribute artwork (i.e., make thumbnails and send images in daily update emails) caused users to swear off the site for fear of having their work &quot;stolen&quot;.

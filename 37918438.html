The thing is the benefits have disproportionately accrued to modernising economies in the developing world. China, and much of East Asia has seen an incredible transformation. Catching up is always much easier than forging ahead.<p>Genetic computing is obviously not a thing, genes are long terms storage, not processing. On the other hand while we don&#x27;t compute biologically, all the latest advances in AI are based on neural networks, inspired by biological neurons.<p>We’re not on Mars, and thinking back to 1998 I don’t see where that optimism came from. There was no indication of the technology or appetite for a project like that. It’s only with the advent of reusable rockets that it’s becoming viable.<p>Nanotechnology was the big buzz back then, but it isn’t pushed that much in the article. Other futurists were making absurd claims of what would be possible in 5 years. Impressive restraint.<p>China on the road to democracy, and a Russia modernising? Oh well. Both are on the list of major risks though.<p>As a Brit it’s conflicting to see the optimism for us leading the way in Europe in the main article, and the fact that we basically opted for 10 on the risks list instead.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37924093" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37924093" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fullarr</span><span>|</span><a href="#37925859">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37924242">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37924093">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37924093">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I like how there&#x27;s a list of 10 things that could ruin his prediction and basically all of them happened<p>It&#x27;s amazing that he got so much right including how he&#x27;s wrong</div><br/><div id="37925008" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37925008" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">somenameforme</span><span>|</span><a href="#37924093">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37924304">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37925008">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37925008">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Agreed. This is one of the most well informed, across a vast spectrum of info, articles I&#x27;ve ever read. And.. in Wired? Unsurprisingly it seems this was a segment&#x2F;paraphrasing from a book he wrote. Here [1] is his Wiki page, which includes published works and the like.<p>All that said, I think there&#x27;s one big miss he made, and did not consider. While so much of what he said came true, I think many people would love to reset society back to 1997. And I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just because of the misses. It simply seems that economic prosperity is not increasing personal contentedness, which seems a much more meaningful metric than &#x27;happiness&#x27;.<p>If anything contentedness and prosperity seem to run into conflict, beyond a certain point. Obviously an area in Africa with a genuinely high food insecurity rate needs more prosperity. But going from relatively rich, in terms of economy, as we were in 1997, to absurdly rich as we are today, does not seem to have brought the corresponding changes one would have expected. If anything, it seems that more prosperity just drives people to want even more, with all notions of contentedness collapsing.<p>---<p>Yeah, in searching on this topic I bumped into this. [2] Apparently $75k (2011) is peak &#x27;happiness&#x27;, though again what a myopic metric contrasted against contentedness. The odd thing is that it was $75k period. Whether in Bodunk where $75k means you&#x27;re rich, or NYC where $75k means you&#x27;re living far from comfortably. It was just $75k. There were no meaningful gains in measures of happiness beyond that magic number.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Peter_Schwartz_(futurist)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Peter_Schwartz_(futurist)</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;businessjournal&#x2F;150671&#x2F;Happiness-Is-Love-and-75K.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;businessjournal&#x2F;150671&#x2F;Happiness-Is-...</a></div><br/><div id="37925531" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37925531" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">opo</span><span>|</span><a href="#37924093">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37925008">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37924304">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37925531">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37925531">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;...It was just $75k.

There are quite frequently some pretty glaring differences, and that&#x27;s certainly the case here [1].<p>The original study was carried out by directly surveying people, and measuring their subjective perspectives. Their answers were then contrasted against their income. The later study was carried out with a smartphone app, which participants opted into at their discretion, asked at a frequency completely up to the participants, and then asked them about their experiences just prior to the notification. I&#x27;m not really sure what that&#x27;s measuring, but it seems fairly safe to say that it&#x27;s something quite different.<p>For instance ask a grossly obese man how he feels at any given point in time and it&#x27;s probably pretty good. He&#x27;s likely relaxing, eating, and otherwise engaging in various forms of self indulgent behavior. But gauge him on his overall life satisfaction and it&#x27;s likely to be abysmal. Vice versa, query a mother who&#x27;s raising 4 young children and, at any given point in time, and they&#x27;re often not going to be having the best of times. Yet, nonetheless their overall life satisfaction is likely to be quite high.<p>Basically look at any poll on various forms of contentedness, Gallup carries out an annual one here. [2] And you&#x27;ll find the results are nothing like what you&#x27;d expect, even more so if one thinks money can provide anything beyond what one can buy. The &#x27;most positive&#x27; places are in Latin America - Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, Columbia, Mexico, etc. The &#x27;least negative&#x27; places are in Eastern Europe and Asia: China, Kyrgyzstan, Vietnam, Estonia, Poland, Kazakhstan, etc. These results don&#x27;t leave much room for money doing anything beyond ensuring ones base needs can be comfortably met.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1073&#x2F;pnas.2208661120#sec-3" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1073&#x2F;pnas.2208661120#sec-3</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gallup.com&#x2F;analytics&#x2F;349280&#x2F;gallup-global-emotions-report.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gallup.com&#x2F;analytics&#x2F;349280&#x2F;gallup-global-emotio...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37926256" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37926256" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rbanffy</span><span>|</span><a href="#37924093">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37925531">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37926290">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37924304">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37926256">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37926256">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It should also vary a lot with age. $75K would make me a very happy late teen, but wouldn’t pay my bills now, and that’s not because of inflation - it’s because now I have a family, a mortgage, and a lot of sizeable expenses.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37924304" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37924304" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">russdill</span><span>|</span><a href="#37924093">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37925008">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37924803">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37924304">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37924304">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;This is only a scenario of the future, by no means an outright prediction of what is to come.

Will Europe summon the political will to make the transition to the new economy? Will Russia avoid a nationalist retrenchment and establish a healthy market economy - let alone democracy? Will China fully embrace capitalism and avoid causing a new cold - or hot - war? Will a rise in terrorism cause the world to pull back in constant fear?

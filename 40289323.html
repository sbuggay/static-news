The solution is elegant: each vocal microphone is doubled, meaning there are two at each position. The phase is inverted on one of them, the singer sings into only one, and both are sent to the speakers via their channel&#x27;s amp.<p>The effect of that setup is that only the difference between the two microphones is amplified; common signal in both (i.e. the sound coming out of the speakers) is nulled out, but the difference signal (the voice) makes it through. It apparently wasn&#x27;t quite perfect but was absolutely a lot better than wailing feedback.<p>The thing that made it sound so good was that any given speaker only reproduces a single source, but the article touches on that. The mic arrangement I described is simply what makes it possible.</div><br/><div id="40290751" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40290751" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TylerE</span><span>|</span><a href="#40289817">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40291930">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40290751">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40290751">[15 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">While it&#x27;s true that they did that and why, I&#x27;d ultimately chalk it up as more of a flaw than a feature. Vocals never sounded great on wall of sound shows because they could never sing perfectly into one mic. This can be confirmed by listentng to soundboard tapes of the shows, and comparing them with ones a year or two either side - the full on Wall was only used for about a year.<p>While the WoS laid much of the groundwork for how modern PAs are designed and operated, it was more of a white elephant than anything, and many of it&#x27;s actual ideas were discarded. It was totally impractical to tour with and they lost money doing so.  The only real technical legacy it has is of using coherent phased line arrays.<p>Really it&#x27;s whole reason for existence (getting a coherent, in phase, non-canceled signal at an extended distance from the stage) isn&#x27;t even relevant, as these days secondary speaker arrays with delay lines (to sync them perfectly with the mains) is almost childs play. Literally plug and play. Modern PAs can self-tune the whole system just from playing a short burst of white noise through the system, and listening for the response.</div><br/><div id="40293326" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40293326" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mannyv</span><span>|</span><a href="#40289817">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40290751">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40290855">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40293326">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40293326">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Modern PAs can self-tune the whole system just from playing a short burst of white noise through the system, and listening for the response&quot;<p>A technology which was developed by&#x2F;with the Grateful Dead, by the way.<p>From what I understand they essentially financed the modern PA industry by spending a ridiculous amount of money on sound equipment.

Computers and all the things that became possible at the advent of computers. It’s removed the limitations to creativity. Nowadays, in terms of concert sound, you can not only correct the sound for any room, you can ongoingly correct it in real time as the room changes and as the temperature changes and as the humidity changes. We used to do that in the ’80s and ’90s – I had a complete weather station at my mix board and we tracked temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, because they change sound dispersion, sound quality. We corrected the systems accordingly. We did long, long studies and mapped it out, and we had curves so we could predict where the sound was going. We had to do that by hand. Nowadays, it happens all by itself.&quot;&quot;&quot;</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40290855" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40290855" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dekhn</span><span>|</span><a href="#40289817">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40290751">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40293326">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40292751">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40290855">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40290855">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">(I assume you&#x27;re aware, but for the larger audience)... the grateful released an album &quot;Two From the Vault&quot; which was a soundboard recording... but the original soundboard had huge phase cancellation errors due to microphone placement.

I&#x27;m involved in maintaining the audio system for an auditorium used by a non-profit. After a flood and remodel, including replacing some audio components (like microphones), it was observed that the microphone on the main podium always had a 60 Hz hum. The hum depended on where the microphone was facing. Sometimes it was there, sometimes it was not.<p>Being a non-profit facility, there are no fancy DSPs to notch out the hum or anything like that, so more creative solutions were investigated. It was determined through dumb experimentation that orienting an identical microphone 180 degrees to the one with the hum and setting the gain similarly would nearly eliminate the hum.<p>Eventually, the working theory became that a relatively new large pad transformer installed across the street was being picked up by the microphones.
Orienting one microphone 180 degrees from the other caused the hum to be picked up out of phase from the main, and thus could be mixed in to cancel out the main mic hum.<p>Ultimately the real solution was simply buying better microphones, but there was a period of some months while a microphone sat off stage, pointed backwards.</div><br/><div id="40290981" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40290981" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ChainOfFools</span><span>|</span><a href="#40289817">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40290856">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40292336">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40290981">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40290981">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s been quite a few years since I last worked in live show production, but on any show at a venue where we couldn&#x27;t be sure of access to clean power, humbuckers (not the guitar pickups, a nickname for what I believe was just a dumb 60hz notch filter or ground loop isolator inlined on house power taps)  were a standard pack out in the road kit.<p>I would have expected that this decades-old and well established component of power infrastructure would have been commoditized by now and integrated into any dedicated AV performance&#x2F;production space such as an auditorium.</div><br/><div id="40292887" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40292887" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">munificent</span><span>|</span><a href="#40289817">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40290981">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40291632">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40292887">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40292887">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; what I believe was just a dumb 60hz notch filter</i><p>A simple notch filter won&#x27;t fix 60 Hz hum.

You can look at intermodulation measurements for some popular and affordable home speakers here.

If we&#x27;re talking about his remarks here I&#x27;d characterize his take as &quot;more vertical arrays&quot; and not just &quot;more speakers.&quot; I realize it&#x27;s a bit pedantic of me, but some people think that simply adding more speakers equals more betterer sound and it&#x27;s quite far from the case. In general, multiple loudspeakers arrayed horizontally (this includes MTM center channels in home theater setups) lead to comb filtering.<p>I&#x27;m sure you know that, just clarifying for others.<p>If he has written about this elsewhere I&#x27;d love to read more!</div><br/><div id="40292300" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40292300" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jtriangle</span><span>|</span><a href="#40290369">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40291730">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40295620">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40292300">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40292300">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m simplifying things significantly because I don&#x27;t expect most HN&#x27;ers to know the ins and outs of pro sound.<p>Dave Rat has a good youtube channel, he also has some sort of insider subscription thing that I&#x27;ve never bothered with. I wouldn&#x27;t say his ideas necessarily translate to every situation, but, he really presents these ideas as tools to use in a toolbox, not as gospel.<p>One interesting thing is that, we generally view comb filtering as universally &#x27;bad&#x27;, when, in reality, our ears do an excellent job of sorting out comb filtering when it comes to natural sounds. In fact, comb filtering is how we can locate a sound in 3d space with only two reference points (and, if you try, only one reference point moved around a little). That&#x27;s remarkable, and points back to <i>how</i> speakers comb filter instead of mere comb filtering itself.<p>In practice, say you have a rock band, and your sound system has two arrays with subs spaced 40ft apart. Now, you&#x27;re going to get a less than ideal pattern from that in the ranges where the bass guitar and kick drum live. How do you fix it? The answer is fairly simple, you simply run bass&#x2F;kick in stereo, then, you delay the bass on one side by a little, kick on the opposite side just a little, then add some kind of EQ difference to the delayed side of each, then play with the delays until it sounds right.<p>Why does that work? Or does it really work? It&#x27;s odd, because the math says &quot;no no, it&#x27;ll sound bad&quot;, the reality is, it can tighten up that comb to the point you don&#x27;t really hear it and you can get good bass coverage out of a fairly poor system design.</div><br/><div id="40293169" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40293169" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hunter2_</span><span>|</span><a href="#40290369">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40292300">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40294416">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40293169">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40293169">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The opposite delays is an interesting touch.

It&#x27;d be better if it were a mono stack right in the middle of the stage, but we can&#x27;t do that because <i>that&#x27;s where the performers are</i> and two objects can&#x27;t occupy the same space at the same time.<p>So we do the obvious thing:  We put speakers at each side of the stage, instead.  This at least solves the obvious Newtonian physics issue.<p>But there&#x27;s a problem with that.  Now we have two sources of audio in one room, and the sounds that many in the audience hear are a sum these two sources, mixed together acoustically -- even though those two sources arrive at the listeners&#x27; ears with different amounts of delay (due to relative distance).<p>And when those two sources are playing exactly the same thing (an instrument or vocalist panned to the middle, say, as is quite common), that always results in predictable comb filtering for many people in the room.  And it&#x27;s the same comb filter across the whole spectrum, for <i>all</i> of the sounds (every instrument, every vocalist, every everything) that come from both sets speakers.<p>One approach that Dave uses is to try to make sure that each side of the PA is always playing something different from the other one.  This might mean using two kick drum mics (placed differently), and two microphones in front of a guitar cabinet (also placed differently), and so on.  One microphone is for the left speakers, and one microphone for the right speakers.<p>They still mix acoustically, but because they&#x27;re different signals to begin with, they don&#x27;t comb filter as efficiently as they would if they were identical signals.<p>And because each of these things are all mic&#x27;d <i>differently</i> (with one mic per speaker-stack), one instrument&#x27;s inevitable comb filtering will be <i>different</i> from another instrument&#x27;s inevitable comb filtering.  This randomizes (ish -- it can be predicted and measured) the comb filtering that is involved in the sum of the entire PA, and that can make for a better listening experience for most people.<p>(And where two microphones can&#x27;t be used, like for a vocalist, then the idea is to do <i>something, anything</i> different between the left and the right output channels for that singular source.  It could be different EQ (what a wonderful phase-scrambler conventional EQ is), or delay, or different reverb settings -- but it should be <i>different</i> somehow coming from left and right speakers.)<p>The math works fine.  If comb filtering is inevitable, and it is, then it is better to have a random-ish mix of comb filters of diminished depth and that each affect individual musical elements differently than to have one singular and very brazen comb filter that affects everything uniformly for any given listener.<p>The problems with Dave&#x27;s ideas here are this:  It doubles the channel count at the board (which can be worked around just by throwing more money at it), it more-or-less doubles the expenditure on microphones and snakes, and it more than doubles the complexity of getting an initial mix working well.<p>But most importantly:  It defies the conventional workflow of trying to mix sounds on a stereo PA system in a huge room like it is the same as listening to a high-end stereo system at home and sitting in the sweet spot.  Dave Rat&#x27;s ideas generally don&#x27;t&#x2F;can&#x27;t combine to make a central sweet spot, or to produce a perfect stereo image:  There&#x27;s a left mix and a right mix, and they&#x27;re both very deliberately different mixes that are each made from sources that are split up to be as different as is reasonably possible.<p>So the biggest problem with Dave&#x27;s ideas aren&#x27;t that they don&#x27;t make sense somehow (they do make sense), but that it goes against the conventional target.<p>(But the conventional workflow that aims for the idea of precise stereo image as a target is kind of inherently bullshit anyway, because only a small percentage of attendees can stand in that sweet spot to hear that perfect stereo image at one time, while the other 90+% of concert-goers simply can&#x27;t physically be there (because Newton, again).  Most listeners aren&#x27;t anywhere near centered on the stereo PA, and will hear what psychoacoustically <i>seems</i> to come chiefly from either the right or the left stack (because Haas effect), and will have no ability to be in a place where a good stereo image is possible to begin with.  The conventional target sacrifices the auditory experience of many for the benefit of few.)</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40295620" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40295620" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">soulofmischief</span><span>|</span><a href="#40290369">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40290816">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40295620">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40295620">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Informative article and a good read, although the author clearly has no idea how commas are supposed to work.

It&#x27;s nice to be able to see what devices he&#x27;s fiddling with to get his effects (most of the concert videos don&#x27;t show the effects pedals and stomp boxes in detail).  He&#x27;s making heavy use of a looper- he can play some notes, capture them, and loop them continuously in the background (he uses to create a whole group of backing music that runs even when he&#x27;s not playing actively).<p>I mean if you look at this effects it&#x27;s not surprising he can get all those tones.  He&#x27;s got multiple signal paths that get split and recombined with various effects applied to one or the other (being played thru speakers that are miked), a Leslie (rotating speaker in a cabinet that adds some interesting warbles), a bunch of different gains with distortion, along with a bunch of &quot;digitech&quot; that does real-time complicated distortion.  All of those run in chains so effects compound.<p>Some day I really want to have the time to build my own guitar similar to his as well as my own pedals.  I&#x27;ve spent various bits of time in the background working on related things, but haven&#x27;t allowed myself to really focus on it, because I tend to get a bit obsessive until I&#x27;ve fully explored my interests.<p>Here&#x27;s a nice example of looping to make one instrument sound like many:

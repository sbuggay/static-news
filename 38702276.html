There is no shortage of people who feel unrewarded and unappreciated for their qualifications and credentials.<p>But if you try to make your own way - getting a skill by practicing yourself and searching out people who need that skill it might work surprisingly well and take you far.<p>Btw if you enjoy the linked writing you should check out Time Shelter, it won the Booker prize recently.</div><br/><div id="38706415" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38706415" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">svilen_dobrev</span><span>|</span><a href="#38706264">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38706543">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38706415">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38706415">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">as someone who has done similar thing (~10y older than OP) - go to oz to see how it is, then one day, return back, to see how it is .. and stay since .. yeah, Time Shelter is quite a thing.

Having lived here for roughly the last ~8 years, it seems to me that the ones succeeding the most are those which have a nearly universal negative appraisal of the communist era. Poland, for example, is on a pretty great trajectory and will probably be in the top 2-3 EU economies in a decade. The Soviet system was forced upon Poland and very few people look upon that era favorably. The break between eras was also fairly clean and without too much internal conflict.<p>Compare that to some other states like Bulgaria or Ex-Yugoslavia, which have a more complicated memory of the communist era, and which also had a lot of conflict during the transition period. There is less of a pre-packaged “social imaginary” of what the country could be&#x2F;used to be prior to the communist era - unlike Poland, which was occupied and spent a couple centuries building an oppositional identity during the Partitions&#x2F;occupations.</div><br/><div id="38706618" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38706618" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rightbyte</span><span>|</span><a href="#38706543">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38706575">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38703010">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38706618">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38706618">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well, if people start missing the Soviet union, you probably got concerning problems.

Yugoslavia wasn&#x27;t in the Soviet sphere at all and was more &quot;indigenous&quot; and not as repressive as the Soviet states. So in Bulgaria and Ex-Yugoslavia, the memory of the communist era is not as clearly negative as it is in Poland. (Even if it&#x27;s not positive, either – it&#x27;s just more murky.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="38706654" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38706654" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">danieldk</span><span>|</span><a href="#38706543">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38706618">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38706672">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38703010">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38706654">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38706654">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think it happens naturally in many places because older people tend to look at their history with rose tinted glasses.

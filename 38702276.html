To ‘be modern’ means to modernize – compulsively, obsessively; not so much just ‘to be’, let alone to keep its identity intact, but forever ‘becoming’, avoiding completion, staying underdefined. Each new structure which replaces the previous one as soon as it is declared old-fashioned and past its use-by date is only another momentary settlement – acknowledged as temporary and ‘until further notice’. Being always, at any stage and at all times, ‘post-something’ is also an undetachable feature of modernity. As time flows on, ‘modernity’ changes its forms in the manner of the legendary Proteus . . . What was some time ago dubbed (erroneously) &#x27;post-modernity&#x27; and what I&#x27;ve chosen to call, more to the point, &#x27;liquid modernity&#x27;, is the growing conviction that change is the only permanence, and uncertainty the only certainty. A hundred years ago &#x27;to be modern&#x27; meant to chase &#x27;the final state of perfection&#x27; -- now it means an infinity of improvement, with no &#x27;final state&#x27; in sight and none desired.</i></div><br/></div></div><div id="38718009" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38718009" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dottjt</span><span>|</span><a href="#38718263">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38706264">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38718009">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38718009">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t know if this comment will be found in the sea of great comments in this thread, but I think this article is the answer to Adam Curtis&#x27; film Hypernormalisation.<p>The premise is that humans are currently trapped in an endless cycle and we have no concept of how to break out of it, but I think this might at least provide some context as to why.<p>I highly recommend watching it (along with his other documentaries) if you found this article fascinating.

But it pains and scares me that an exiled Bulgarian now wants to take on the Bulgarian collective with postmodern, cosmopolitan and American ideas.
The cycles he describes exist mostly in the minds of postmodern cosmopolitans. And these arise because cosmopolitans in reality cannot produce anything other than ideology and services. Yet the terrible and boring every day bread still comes from the bakery! And since you can&#x27;t invent a new ideology or service or produce a new work of art every day (except for journalists of course, who mastered the producing of &quot;nothingness&quot; every single day), at some point you get lost in pondering and start looking for the culprit. Of course, the first scapegoat is politics, society, people - always the others. Just because you can&#x27;t free yourself from your nihilistic mental wheel, you have to conjure up and condemn the entire collective. Herein lies the birth of all &#x27;structural arguments&#x27;, I claim, ad hoc. &#x27;My dissatisfaction must have structural reasons, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t be dissatisfied.&#x27; The eternal lamentation of the upper-urban-class cosmopolitans.<p>No, I know and admire people for whom such complaints are distant, even annoying. People who don&#x27;t have time for it. And you can just as freely and willingly decide to lead a calm and regulated life. This life is not a danger to humanity, as the postmodernists and cosmopolitans have always wanted to tell us, and I do not want Bulgaria to be &#x27;Americanized&#x27; that way. I would rather listen to a Kaba Gaida in the mountains than have to read through a capitalist-cosmopolitan lament. The former gives me power and strength, a connection to the world, the latter just makes me sick and weak.<p>I know Bulgaria has its issues, but losing its uniqueness to solve them, is for me the bigger issue.</div><br/><div id="38718378" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38718378" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">afandian</span><span>|</span><a href="#38707301">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38718237">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38718378">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38718378">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don’t want to trivialise your post, but I encourage everyone to look up videos of the Kaba Gaida.

Gay people!) lest we start thinking for ourselves.<p>So yes, social media is all about dissatisfaction, but it all seems terribly shallow, self-serving, and, dare I say it, manufactured.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38716657" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38716657" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TaurenHunter</span><span>|</span><a href="#38707301">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38708070">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38714511">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38711392">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38716657">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38716657">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your post resonated with me and you have a well-structured description of this sentiment.

In most cases, these attempts are ridiculous, ersatz, misguided imitations of ideologies borrowed from the past, exposing their own imaginative shortages—they aspire to move the hands of the clock, even if backwards—but it’s hard to deny they represent dissatisfaction and resentment with the way things are. There is, it seems to me, a subconscious craving to be taken out of the boredom of timelessness and be thrown back into the flux of time, even if that means violence or war—anything but the broth! </i><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;58999261-time-shelter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;58999261-time-shelter</a></div><br/><div id="38717384" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38717384" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lynx23</span><span>|</span><a href="#38717194">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38703010">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38717384">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38717384">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To me, this excerpt reads more like a person standing politically left not willing to accept that the deal with democracy is that they can not have their way every election.  Trumpism, Brexit and the rise of nationalism are simply an expression of the democratic pendulum swinging from side to side.

The Soviet system was forced upon Poland and very few people look upon that era favorably.

  HART: Well, they had certain advantages to begin with, too, but better relations. Again, I don’t think it has any particular... To be honest, Polish Catholicism is basically culturally very much like Slavic Orthodoxy. There, you’re going to find that culturally, Catholicism and Orthodoxy are closer to one another in many ways than Catholicism in the East is with Catholicism in the West.

  Trying to draw causal ties between what are very complex social histories, I just think is a mistake. There’s no way of saying one way or the other. Greek democracy flourished in the modern age for a while after Greek independence in the early 19th century, and Greece remains Orthodox, too. Even more than Poland, it is committed to a set of real democratic norms. In Poland, there are stronger reactionary forces at present than there are in Greece.

and also from Ep. 192, with Jacob Mikanowski:<p><pre><code>  MIKANOWSKI: [...] I think that idea of an Orthodox disease is maybe a figment of geography more than a deeply cultural matrix that we think. I’m not — I think we could be optimistic about Croatia and Romania simultaneously. Bulgaria maybe too. I’m not sure that I believe in a kind of Orthodox curse. I think it has more to do with how things shook up internally in former Yugoslavia and where those countries are in relationship to that industrial core of Germany, Austria, Switzerland.</code></pre></div><br/><div id="38708493" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38708493" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">keiferski</span><span>|</span><a href="#38706543">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38708437">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38707029">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38708493">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38708493">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah, I also don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d really call Czechia a place with a &quot;lot of Catholicism in its background.&quot; It was a hostile top-down imposition from the Austrians, with the consequence that Czechs are largely agnostic&#x2F;areligious today.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Religion_in_the_Czech_Republic" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Religion_in_the_Czech_Republic</a></div><br/><div id="38717942" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38717942" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thriftwy</span><span>|</span><a href="#38706543">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38708493">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38707029">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38717942">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38717942">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What would Czech have if not for Austria?

I took a tour of the Presidential palace when I was in Bucharest. The guide was extremely negative about the communist era(when the palace itself was built), as many Romanians are.

The magic that happens on a greenfield project is not so much about your beliefs or your open mind, it&#x27;s more about <i>all the other people</i> mentally unblocking you and not putting spokes in your wheel.<p>So, yeah, if the whole hierarchy crumbles and entire lifetimes of curated opinions, thoughts, social norms become garbage, people let others be.

Not so much because of their beleaguered economies, although that was an important factor, but because no one believed anymore.<p>Hah, that alone?

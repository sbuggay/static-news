All cultures have terms for black&#x2F;dark and white&#x2F;bright. If a culture has three color terms, the third is red.

This pattern is as follows:
    &gt; 
    &gt; All languages contain terms for black and white.
    &gt; If a language contains three terms, then it contains a term for red.
    &gt; If a language contains four terms, then it contains a term for either green or yellow (but not both).
    &gt; If a language contains five terms, then it contains terms for both green and yellow.
    &gt; If a language contains six terms, then it contains a term for blue.
    &gt; If a language contains seven terms, then it contains a term for brown.
    &gt; If a language contains eight or more terms, then it contains terms for purple, pink, orange or gray.

Some dimension of their inner life will doubtlessly escape us.<p>However even with the ancients, we can in most cases understand why they did what they did. People are puzzled by details like the &quot;wine-dark sea&quot; exactly because they understand many other parts of the Iliad and Odyssey quite well.<p>There are about 90 generations separating us from Homer.

Wrong! There is no word for âmindâ in the Iliad, except maybe in the very newest interpolations. The words are things like kardia, noos, phrenes, and thumos, which Jaynes translates as heart, vision&#x2F;perception, belly, and sympathetic nervous system, respectively. He might translate the sentence about Agamemnon to say something like âQuivering rose in Agamemnonâs bellyâ. It still means the same thing â Agamemnon is afraid â but itâs how you would talk about it if you didnât have an idea of âthe mindâ as the place where mental things happened â you would just notice your belly was quivering more. Later, when the Greeks got theory of mind, they repurposed all these terms. You can still find signs of this today, like how we say âI believe it in my heartâ.<p>Of course it&#x27;s possible that Jaynes is simply wrong, and the Greeks <i>did</i> have a concept of the mind, and a translation that talks about the mind is genuinely more faithful than one that does not.</div><br/><div id="35737935" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35737935" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">malloryerik</span><span>|</span><a href="#35736587">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35737258">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35737440">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35737935">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35737935">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A very quick reply. Yes, I&#x27;ve read Julian Jaynes also, and have thought like you are thinking now. However I&#x27;m not sure how one would translate <i>noos</i> -- head? thoughts? feelings? Consider also that French, for example, has no word for &quot;mind&quot; and yet translators clearly don&#x27;t shy from the word. Now this is different of course, if the point is that the Homeric Greeks didn&#x27;t have the same idea of consciousness, but I think that idea can come through without ridding oneself of words like &quot;mind.&quot; Maybe you&#x27;d prefer a word like &quot;perception,&quot; but that introduces another burst of unhelpful associations, not least of which is its scientific and precise-sounding tone? Finally, when I read Homer, it seems clear that many characters do have, shall we say, internal deliberations, and that Homer is clear about this. So I tend to feel that Jaynes&#x27; interpretations might be best seen as tentative and unfinished.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35737440" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35737440" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alex_young</span><span>|</span><a href="#35736587">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35737111">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35737440">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35737440">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hmm.  All of this reminds me a bit of the rather odd (to our culture) way of describing people as light or dark in Ancient Greece.<p>Colors were gendered; women could be white-armed, but never a man, who would be described as dark if he were masculine.<p>Couldnât the same hold here?  The sea is powerful so it is indeed dark like wine.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aeon.co&#x2F;essays&#x2F;when-homer-envisioned-achilles-did-he-see-a-black-man" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aeon.co&#x2F;essays&#x2F;when-homer-envisioned-achilles-did-he...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="35737111" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35737111" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jrm4</span><span>|</span><a href="#35737440">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35736206">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35737111">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35737111">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Every once in a while this goofy idea comes up and I don&#x27;t know why.

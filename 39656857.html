For example most Amish places of business have electricity, battery powered lights are common as well as gas powered fridges. They generally don’t reject modern medicine. However, they generally don’t have electricity at home because they don’t want to be reliant on the grid at large. If and how much solar and wind power are adopted in Amish communities will be an interesting thing to observe over the next decade or two.<p>Now there are some communities who reject all power that doesn’t come from “gods creatures” and will reject e bikes and stick to push scooters and buggies.

This is a no-go for a religious community that views decentralization as the only path to holiness.<p>Remember: the Amish don&#x27;t hate new technology because it&#x27;s technology and they want to live in a fantasy world. They hate technology because it&#x27;s a centralizing force.<p>What changed? Simple: solar. Solar is (mostly) decentralized electricity: once you buy solar panels you are dependent only on the continued existence of the sun for power.

The Luddites and Amish share a common thread, which is that of ownership and control and ability to set one&#x27;s own course. I don&#x27;t think the Luddites agreed that preserving traditions and culture was what drove them. They wanted mechanization to serve us all, to not be used to control them.

I would suggest that this says more about the culture you live in than the culture the Amish live in. (No offence intended.)<p>My hypothesis is that you live in a primarily material culture (safe bet, since we mostly all do.) Thus most of your life decisions surround money. What can you afford, how to get more of it, how to spend less of it and so on. Again, z safe bet, since that&#x27;s true for most of us in general, and is emphasised especially in the US.<p>Most of this is just baked in, so when we look at alternative lifestyles we can assume that they make decisions as we do. That can be a mistake simply because its hard to conceive the way others live.<p>For example it&#x27;s common for Europeans to get over 30 days paid leave a year. In the US most shift workers get none. In Europe salaried workers work fixed hours, then go home. In the US they stay late, do emails all night, and so on.<p>Neither approach is right or wrong, they&#x27;re just different.

Consider all these &quot;phone-free&quot; movements, limited screen time, and social media detoxes. In this light, the Amish seem very much enlightened that they take many years to deliberate whether a technology is an overall positive or detriment. Going back to the use of electricity. I think probably a huge part of a grid that works at nighttime is that it definitely changes society in the sense that nightlife is all of a sudden possible. You can debate whether or not it&#x27;s a positive impact to society but the impact is inarguable.

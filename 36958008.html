He predicted that were Russia allowed to build a nuclear arsenal, a war against the U.S. would be inevitable. He therefore recommended that the U.S. launch a nuclear strike at Moscow, destroying its enemy and becoming a dominant world power, so as to avoid a more destructive nuclear war later on. &quot;With the Russians it is not a question of whether but of when,&quot; he would say. An oft-quoted remark of his is, &quot;If you say why not bomb them tomorrow, I say why not today? If you say today at 5 o&#x27;clock, I say why not one o&#x27;clock?&quot;

This language reflected the Nazis’ racist ideology, in which they posited a hierarchy of races with Aryans at the top and viewed others, including Anglo-Saxons, as lesser or enemies. This also served to foster animosity and dehumanize the Allies among the German populace. However, such language was not universally used by all within the Nazi regime, and the terminology often varied depending on the context and specific propaganda objectives at the time.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36981378" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36981378" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mseepgood</span><span>|</span><a href="#36975459">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36981290">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36982202">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36981934">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36981378">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36981378">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Russian propaganda as well.</div><br/><div id="36982611" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36982611" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ttflee</span><span>|</span><a href="#36975459">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36981378">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36981934">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36982611">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36982611">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah.

They kept talking about 235 (i.e. Uranium-235), about isotope separation, but not a single hint that you could transmute U-238 into Pu-239 and then make a plutonium bomb.<p>What&#x27;s not appreciated about the Manhattan project is that not only the US made a bomb, it made two, meaning two completely different designs. And they were aware of a third one: Glen Seaborg (the discoverer of plutonium) has investigated the feasibility of making a bomb from Uranium-233 [1]<p><pre><code>  &gt; Seaborg viewed uranium-233 as a potential backup to plutonium-239
</code></pre>
So the US could have made bombs of three different designs, it just got confident enough that 2 will work out in the end. Of course, 10 years later (in 1955) it did build and test a U-233 bomb just to see that it&#x27;s possible.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trace.tennessee.edu&#x2F;utk_gradthes&#x2F;2758&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trace.tennessee.edu&#x2F;utk_gradthes&#x2F;2758&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="36979643" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36979643" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Animats</span><span>|</span><a href="#36979527">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36978407">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36979643">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36979643">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Right.

I think that, combined with the need to demonstrate the power of the new weapons lead to a reluctance to seriously engage with the Japanese diplomatically.  I take as evidence of that the fact that a key sticking point in the surrender decision was the status of the Emperor, who ultimately wasn&#x27;t removed by the US anyway.  The allies could have made their terms much clearer much earlier, and they could have engaged with the Japanese attempts to seek peace much more.

Giving them the opportunity to surrender in response to the bomb helps shift moral blame onto them.<p>Whether the Allies cared much or not is also moot in terms of <i>what they should&#x27;ve done</i>, morally speaking. Clearly my opinion is they didn&#x27;t care enough. Clearly I find the firebombings morally disgraceful as well. Clearly, at least some people involved in the decision cared a little, as several people did lobby for a demonstration. The US also was known to airdrop pamphlets encouraging civilian evacuation of cities; civilians weren&#x27;t a total non-concern.<p>It&#x27;s not anything like North Korea threatening the US with a space laser. For a multitude of reasons: US spy capability means they would know well in advance the details of any North Korean space laser. North Korea isn&#x27;t an alliance of the most powerful nations in the world with leading scientific and military capability. And if North Korea did indeed demonstrate a space laser that could obliterate a city in a fraction of a second, you&#x27;d better believe the US would stand up and take notice, for that matter.<p>Moreover, at the time an atomic bomb wasn&#x27;t science fiction. Everyone at that point had known that an atomic bomb was possible for decades; both the Germans and the Japanese were trying to develop one. Given that, if the Americans said, &quot;we&#x27;ve succeeded in developing one and intend to use it to destroy your cities unless you surrender&quot;, along with a demonstration of in action, it wouldn&#x27;t be unthinkable that the Japanese would take it seriously - nor would it be particularly different from the Potsdam Declaration, which demanded surrender lest they face &quot;utter destruction&quot; without any specifics, which the Allies did indeed think was worth saying.<p>Delivering a reel of film would have been straightforward; even in total war all communication channels aren&#x27;t cut off. If you want to do a real-world demonstration that can be observed, find a place to detonate it where it will be observed but will do minimal damage. The Manhattan Project involved solving many, many problems; this is just another one, and a relatively small one at that.

But, as we know (and they knew), America was already bombing Japanese cities - there wasn&#x27;t any indication anything &quot;special&quot; was coming. The pamphlets actually excluded Hiroshima from the list of cities that might be bombed (with the caveat that the list was incomplete). Civilians were on edge, but often couldn&#x27;t leave for various reasons, trusted things like air raid sirens, believed that their  distance from military targets kept them relatively free from danger, and so on. This is documented in the essential &quot;Hiroshima&quot; article by John Hersey.<p>And these warnings weren&#x27;t entirely ignored - Hiroshima&#x27;s population before the bombing was substantially smaller than it was before the war, in large part because many Japanese civilians who could <i>had</i> fled cities.<p>The &quot;Hiroshima pamphlet&quot; - the one depicted - was <i>not</i> dropped on Hiroshima. This is apparent if you read the text, which describes Hiroshima as already destroyed; or the fact that it shows an image of the explosion over Hiroshima, not the Trinity test.<p>This [0] Reddit link - which I found by googling about the LeMay pamphlets - goes further to claim (and support, in the links) that even those weren&#x27;t dropped over Hiroshima or Nagasaki.

If you look at the correspondence and the commentary of the people making decisions, it is quite clear that prior to the atomic bombing, the only side that was trying to minimize casualties was in fact, the United States. In fact, even on the allied side, neither Russia nor the United Kingdom, were particularly concerned with minimizing casualties.

While much has been made of the theoretical physical effort at Los Alamos, without the Oak Ridge, TN and Hanford, WA chemical-physical production lines for uranium-235 and plutonium, bomb production would not have been possible.<p>2. These efforts required vast inputs of energy, mostly provided by hydroelectric projects such as TVA for the Oak Ridge uranium effort.  It&#x27;s highly implausible that such efforts would have succeeded in wartime Germany no matter how many resources were diverted to them.  One bombing run would have wiped out the whole enterprise - and of course, neither Oak Ridge nor Hanford were subjected to aerial bombardment.<p>3. The Germans apparently were more interested in a nuclear rocket engine or some such than a nuclear bomb, by most accounts I&#x27;ve read.

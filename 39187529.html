Indeed, the fire bombings that preceded dealt far more damage to Japan than both bombs, in real terms. Nuclear intervention wasn&#x27;t a requirement for ending the war, the war was effectively over, and a sustained bombing campaign could have seen the end without the atomic bomb.<p>Now, the argument I find the most interesting in the case for using the bomb is public, and national and international political opinion. It is arguable that Truman saw very little options other than use the bomb at the time. They had spent millions on the project, politicians knew that something was being developed, and the Cold War was already on the horizon. Further if not used, and the existence of the bomb post war would come to light for the public, there might well be questions as to why it wasn&#x27;t dropped, and, exactly the line you used, if it could have ended the war early.<p>Ultimately, I think a combination of international clout spun into national pride in total victory sealed the decision (although this conclusion was probably made by FDR before him as well). I will say, that the post-Hiroshima speech by Truman is also one of the most powerful speeches by a US president ever made.<p>&gt; It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe.

The atom bomb gave Japan&#x27;s leaders a critically necessary (due to their culture) way to both save face <i>and</i> surrender.<p>Their need for a way out was desperate.  Not particularly because of the US (&amp; UK), whose invasion of southern Japan they felt well-prepared to fight.  (Inch-by-inch, and to the death.)  But because of the Soviets, who the Japanese had assumed would say neutral, per the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact (signed 13 April 1941, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_Neutrality_Pact" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_Neutra...</a>).<p>Unfortunately, the Soviets declared war against Japan on 7 August 1945.  Two days later, they invaded Japanese-held Inner Mongolia, Manchuria, northern Korea, etc.  The Red Army, with 1.5 million men, quickly inflicted massive defeats on the Japanese army - and parts of the latter were retreating in panic.  (See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Manchuria_Operation_map-en.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Manchuria_Operation_map-e...</a> for some sense of the speed and scale of this offensive.)<p>Hence Japan&#x27;s decision, on 15 August, to surrender.

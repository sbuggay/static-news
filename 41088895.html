A jazz pianist soloing will likely do their melody line in the right hand and hit 3-7 with the left), so the tritone substitution will be made&#x2F;implied by whatever the bass player does against that.<p>The other fun thing is to just vamp on a II♭7-V7 sequence.

In particular, Scarlatti was a prolific user of the partimento method of composition, which is a slightly of abstracted version of counterpoint, and his sonatas are pretty good examples of pieces written with this in mind.  The method revolves around intervals and movement between voices rather than chords.

There&#x27;s very little that&#x27;s specifically American about it, let alone German. See Nicholas Baragwanath, <i>The Solfeggio Tradition: A Forgotten Art of Melody in the Long Eighteenth Century</i>.  And of course, Schenker&#x27;s &quot;imaginary continuo&quot; is readily understood as a popularization of historical partimento (and closely comparable approaches such as the so-called <i>Partitura</i> known from German sources).<p>It&#x27;s true though that Schenker&#x27;s treatises included plenty of political asides of such an extreme chauvistic character that to call them &quot;quite right wing&quot; is a huge understatement. (It&#x27;s also true that, as scholarly research has pointed out in recent years, he seems to have expressed similarly extreme views in his private correspondence and other private writings.)  Part of this might perhaps be explained as Schenker&#x27;s awkward overcompensation for  what would&#x27;ve been his remarkably humble origins back then (he came from a small village in what was then Austrian Galicia, now in modern Ukraine).  Regardless, I think we nowadays have so many sources proving the relevance of melodic reduction&#x2F;elaboration approaches (some of them quite early indeed, from the 16th-17th centuries) that to tie these analytical approaches polemically to Schenker and his specificities is really quite pointless, perhaps even misleading.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41092957" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41092957" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pclmulqdq</span><span>|</span><a href="#41089566">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41091174">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41091670">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41089884">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41092957">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41092957">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ah yes, the good old &quot;fascist dog whistle&quot; argument.

Bar 2 of the famous Toccata and fugue ends in a chord. Bar 10&#x2F;11 has a big chord. Bar 12 starts with a chord. There are chords everywhere. In case you doubt the authorship, plenty of other toccatas have chords. The whole idea of figured bass is chords.<p>Second, while they did think differently about harmony, you can describe it in modern terms. A description like Cmaj7 doesn&#x27;t mean anything else than a set of pitches.<p>A tritone substitution is somewhat different, since it depends on what the analyzer thinks the chord could&#x2F;should have been. There&#x27;s a recent YouTube video (by David Bennett, IIRC) that shows tritone substitutions in songs, but he mentions that he doubts Paul McCartney knew he was writing one. But does that mean it isn&#x27;t? No, it means <i>you</i> can see it as a tritone substitution.<p>Music theory is a subjective tool to describe and compare, nothing else.</div><br/><div id="41092967" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41092967" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pclmulqdq</span><span>|</span><a href="#41089566">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41092358">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41092495">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41092967">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41092967">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s interesting that you cite the Toccata and Fugue in D minor because some theorists believe that was actually written much later.  The original theory was that Mendelssohn wrote it in the 19th century, but I believe there were some sources from the 1700s.  It clearly has a very non-Bach character, including the octave doublings in the chords you mention.<p>It&#x27;s very clear that the man wrote chords.  It&#x27;s also very clear that harmony (ie vertical music theory) was not the tool used to write those chords.  If you listen to BWV903, for example, there is a long section of arpeggiated chords that defy 18th and 19th century harmony.<p>The OP&#x27;s idea of a tritone substitution from Scarlatti does not have the same harmonic function as a tritone substitution in modern music.  I would agree with you that if the function matches, you can certainly analyze things in the context of a later theory, but the function does not match.<p>Finally, figured bass notates intervals, not chords.  A crude realization can neglect voice leading in the upper voices, but more skilled realizers of figured bass will preserve voice leading between the intervals in the upper voices.  The idea that figured bass is about chords sort of maps backwards the modern abuses of figured bass (which IMO should not be taught as a &quot;basic music theory&quot; subject - but that is for another day) onto the original method.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41092495" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41092495" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zozbot234</span><span>|</span><a href="#41089566">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41092358">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41092967">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41089888">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41092495">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41092495">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The whole idea of figured bass is chords.<p>I think this might be missing the point a little bit - the bassline in figured bass has more primacy than any of the sonorities above it.

But it&#x27;s better with proper context. Like, say, a song is not about the music theory you put in it. A good song starts with a good story--and that&#x27;s another craft altogether--which you make into good lyrics. Good Lyrics combine story, language quirks and phonetics. The lyrics are a heavy ingredient that needs spacing and intonation which are good-sounding and practical to a human singer, and that needs to mesh with melody and rhythm. Then comes harmony and the doses of emotion you can put into it, and that&#x27;s what this article is about.<p>You can certainly code lots of ingredients. For example, you can use embeddings to find better rhymes faster when composing a lyrics, or even LLM help to check if your lyrics make sense (If ChatGPT can guess what your lyrics are about, a human may be able too). You can  use a host of computer utilities to find harmonies, and even use voice synthesizers to sketch the singing. But at the end, what makes a piece of music interesting is how well it meshes with its listener...you can model that with statistics, if you are pedantic enough, but at that point the maws of hell open and suck your soul out.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41090751" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41090751" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cousin_it</span><span>|</span><a href="#41090665">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41098657">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41093353">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41090751">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41090751">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the only &quot;universal&quot; part of music theory is the integer resonance stuff, &quot;a perfect fifth is a 2:3 frequency ratio&quot;, because integer resonances do seem to have biological significance for us.

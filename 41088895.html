A jazz pianist soloing will likely do their melody line in the right hand and hit 3-7 with the left), so the tritone substitution will be made&#x2F;implied by whatever the bass player does against that.<p>The other fun thing is to just vamp on a II♭7-V7 sequence.

In particular, Scarlatti was a prolific user of the partimento method of composition, which is a slightly of abstracted version of counterpoint, and his sonatas are pretty good examples of pieces written with this in mind.  The method revolves around intervals and movement between voices rather than chords.  It&#x27;s normal for someone thinking in counterpoint to produce some very &quot;modern&quot; &quot;chords&quot; because that&#x27;s a common consequence of following nothing but voice leading to produce a piece of music.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Partimento" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Partimento</a><p>See also Rick Beato mis-analyzing Bach&#x27;s counterpoint as containing a very &quot;modern&quot; maj7#5 chord: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=d1f_tzBx6ko&amp;t=1s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=d1f_tzBx6ko&amp;t=1s</a></div><br/><div id="41089723" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41089723" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">briffid</span><span>|</span><a href="#41089566">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41089635">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41089734">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41089723">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41089723">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But JS Bach apparently did love those modern sounds, see BWV 542&#x2F;I But indeed it doesn&#x27;t make much sense to apply jazz theory on classical or early music.</div><br/><div id="41089878" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41089878" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AlbertCory</span><span>|</span><a href="#41089566">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41089723">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41089884">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41089878">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41089878">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve never quite understood that POV, although my piano teacher had it.

Musical analysis is necessarily socially contextual and therefore revealing of the author’s values and priorities, and Schenkerian arguments often imply, or directly come with, some really quite right-wing positions. Schenker was very much into motivated reasoning to defend his deep-rooted racism; many Schenkerian analysts have, deliberately or otherwise, wound up following in those footsteps.</div><br/><div id="41091670" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41091670" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zozbot234</span><span>|</span><a href="#41089566">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41091174">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41089884">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41091670">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41091670">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Schenkerian analysis is, broadly speaking, a rediscovery and popularization of melodic reduction approaches that were well known to composers and performers in the 18th century.  There&#x27;s very little that&#x27;s specifically American about it, let alone German. See Nicholas Baragwanath, <i>The Solfeggio Tradition: A Forgotten Art of Melody in the Long Eighteenth Century</i>.  And of course, Schenker&#x27;s &quot;imaginary continuo&quot; is readily understood as a popularization of historical partimento (and closely comparable approaches such as the so-called <i>Partitura</i> known from German sources).<p>It&#x27;s true though that Schenker&#x27;s treatises included plenty of political asides of such an extreme chauvistic character that to call them &quot;quite right wing&quot; is a huge understatement. (It&#x27;s also true that, as scholarly research has pointed out in recent years, he seems to have expressed similarly extreme views in his private correspondence and other private writings.)  Part of this might perhaps be explained as Schenker&#x27;s awkward overcompensation for  what would&#x27;ve been his remarkably humble origins back then (he came from a small village in what was then Austrian Galicia, now in modern Ukraine).  Regardless, I think we nowadays have so many sources proving the relevance of melodic reduction&#x2F;elaboration approaches (some of them quite early indeed, from the 16th-17th centuries) that to tie these analytical approaches polemically to Schenker and his specificities is really quite pointless, perhaps even misleading.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41089884" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41089884" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pclmulqdq</span><span>|</span><a href="#41089566">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41089723">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41089878">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41089734">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41089884">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41089884">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">See also BWV 903 and BWV 1079.<p>Andras Schiff playing BWV 903 (there are some REALLY bad performances of this piece out there): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SNWOhm5iXxs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SNWOhm5iXxs</a><p>BWV 1079 wasn&#x27;t necessarily written with musical instruments proscribed, but here&#x27;s a good French group&#x27;s performance: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tfMQ-AYiuJw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tfMQ-AYiuJw</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41089734" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41089734" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">beefman</span><span>|</span><a href="#41089566">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41089635">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41089723">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41090190">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41089734">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41089734">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Scarlatti&#x27;s sonatas contain many chords, apart from pure polyphony.

That is sort of a fringe view that is facially false.  Around the world, rules of harmony have a lot to do with the harmonic series, scales, tunings, and other building blocks that are hugely based on math.

Most 21st century composers and producers I know do absolutely no math (defined in any way) when writing music.  I will also say that the producers of computer music absolutely <i>do not</i> throw away &quot;traditional ideas of orchestration and form&quot; unless they are lazy or bad.

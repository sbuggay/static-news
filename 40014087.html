Various sources list activities that are deemed to be &quot;business&quot; and not &quot;work&quot;, such as attending business meetings or attending a trade show, and entering on an ESTA for these purposes is thus acceptable.<p>Question: What I&#x27;m <i>not</i> clear on is whether the business-but-not-work restriction...
1. merely means that the <i>purpose of your visit</i> has to be business-but-not-work, or
2. requires that the visitor <i>refrain from all &quot;work&quot; activities</i> while in the US, even if they weren&#x27;t the reason for visiting and would have happened anyway.<p>Concretely: suppose I am a programmer who works remotely from Europe for a US company. I visit the US to meet my colleagues face to face and attend a trade show with them (business, not work), but these activities don&#x27;t take up 100% of my time. Rather than sit around idly during the downtime between &quot;business&quot; activities, I do some of my ordinary programming work, of the sort I would do back in Europe. Have I broken the law?</div><br/><div id="40019357" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40019357" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">YZF</span><span>|</span><a href="#40016512">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40020673">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40019357">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40019357">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I am not a lawyer but I&#x27;m pretty certain you are supposed to refrain from any &quot;work&quot; activity.

But your entry will be denied if you tell the immigration officer that you&#x27;re going to be doing &quot;work&quot; that is not permissible under the specifics of the visa you&#x27;re entering with.

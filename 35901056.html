YMMV.<p>-- <i>Some</i> realtors care about volume, and some care about their fiduciary responsibilities to your business. If they are actually a <i>Realtor</i> and following the standards set by the NAR, then volume or commission % shouldn&#x27;t be their motivation. Again - just like any profession - some are good, some suck.<p>-- Finally, regarding commission percentages - yeah, in many markets commissions shouldn&#x27;t be as high as they have been. In my market(s) we are seeing commissions decline. That said - I regularly <i>more than pay</i> my own commission in the earnings &#x2F; savings I negotiate for my clients.

I could give you at least five case studies from the past year in which specific things I did created those kinds of gains &#x2F; savings for a client. It&#x27;s basically standard CMA stuff - show comparable properties, where they sold, where we sold (or had our offer accepted) and demonstrate the tactics that got to that point. Do that across a group of agents and you quickly have a comparative model.<p>Now - sometimes there are emotion-driven data outliers. For example, sometimes you will see someone overpay in cash for a property that could not have appraised at that same value. So again, using data you can account for those scenarios as well. Point being - all that sales data is available and you can pretty accurately create a model of which agents overall are having success not only selling properties, but the degree to which their clients are winning negotiations. I&#x27;d argue that even if an agent was being &quot;overruled&quot; by their clients - even that would be interesting, as it would show that their clients were not actually listening to the negotiating advise offered by that agent (IE: the data could actually demonstrate that there are communication &#x2F; trust issues between the agent and their clients).</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35910813" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35910813" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ttyprintk</span><span>|</span><a href="#35910652">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912300">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912490">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35910813">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35910813">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Now and then, someone posts on HN their saga about disrupting real estate.

They seemed to be looking out for themselves 100% of the time, and their client only when interests were aligned.<p>The relationship epitomizes the principle-agent problem.</div><br/><div id="35912182" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35912182" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">poulsbohemian</span><span>|</span><a href="#35912051">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35910784">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35912182">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35912182">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Real estate agent here...While there are many agents that hold themselves to the standard that the National Association of Realtors has documented in their code, one of the root problems is that state agencies are negligent in enforcing rules and investigating fraud. For example, I know a fellow agent who had documented proof of another agent committing a fraud that did approx $400K in damage to a client - and the state didn&#x27;t even bother to investigate. For that matter, local Realtor associations are often complicit as well - mostly out of laziness rather than deliberate ill-intent.<p>My best advise is to treat a real estate agent the same way you might your accountant &#x2F; lawyer &#x2F; financial planner &#x2F; private banker: don&#x27;t just pick one off Zillow or at random, but carefully cultivate a relationship before you need their services and take steps to discern for yourself whether they are acting as a fiduciary. I agree completely - there are a lot of bad actors in this space, but over the next decade I expect market forces to drive a lot of people out of the business and improve the professional standard.</div><br/><div id="35912291" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35912291" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">conductr</span><span>|</span><a href="#35912051">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912182">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912249">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35912291">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35912291">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Also would add, RE just isn’t that complex.

So a real estate agent who stays up-to-date on contract issues can make a difference. As you point out - where an agent will really shine is market information and negotiating. I saved a client a ton of money last night because I out-negotiated the other side. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m worth the money - because what I saved them is more than I will make on the deal.<p>Agreed too that my office lease is about the same number of pages as a typical residential contract, but far more dense. My landlord added some of the most ridiculous clauses I&#x27;ve ever seen in any contract - and prior to real estate, I regularly wrote business contracts from scratch.</div><br/><div id="35912678" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35912678" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">conductr</span><span>|</span><a href="#35912051">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912371">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912249">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35912678">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35912678">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I saved a client a ton of money last night because I out-negotiated the other side<p>You’re in the business so this might seen brash but it’s not meant to be. I’m just a pretty experienced buyer&#x2F;seller.<p>The assumption I have to make is 1) buyer couldn’t have negotiated that themselves (I happen to be a good negotiator) and 2) further negotiated to keep the buyer’s agent portion of the commission (it’s a standard seller’s cost they’ve already agreed to pay so doesn’t matter if it goes to me or to an agent, net to seller is the same). I’ve done both, regularly. It’s not for everyone for sure, negotiating skills are the hardest to screen for when I have used agents but people not knowing how to negotiate should definitely focus on trying to find that skillset. But saving more than you cost someone is good, but not guaranteed and it’s always possible to pocket the fee you do charge; so you still have a cost and I usually have to decide if “you’re” worth it for something I can do over a handful of calls&#x2F;emails.<p>Also I’m a landlord and those contracts like you said are much more dense. Where I am, the standard sales contracts change annually but not significantly in the last 15 years anyway. For example, I’ve noticed they’ve recently done away with the X days after in favor of precise dates. The math involved in X days and then finding later it lands on a Sunday or something was always sloppy IMO so I welcomed this change. But anyway, the fact it’s focused on a sale makes it so much easier to read than a lease which specifies so much more about condition, use, pets, roommates, etc.</div><br/><div id="35912999" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35912999" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">poulsbohemian</span><span>|</span><a href="#35912051">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912678">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912249">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35912999">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35912999">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you&#x27;ve done a number of deals and watch the market closely - you are right, chances are you can get deals done on your own without me. Where I benefit savvy clients though is mostly in a) current market information b) current contract information c) advance &#x2F; non-public information d) project management e) resources &#x2F; referrals &#x2F; connections f) sometimes even with a savvy buyer and seller, it helps to have <i>someone</i> in the middle to bring the deal together, Ie: someone has to do the paperwork and make the trains run on time.<p>Where I work, there&#x27;s added complexity to the market in part by the variety of properties and the shortage of skilled agents. Of the licensed agents in the area, only about 30% are actually &quot;full-time&quot; agents, and of that 30% very few will do much outside standard residential work - and we&#x27;ve got several types of specialty agriculture, bare land, commercial, and we are on a state line. Our forms in both states have been going through a surprising amount of volatility the past few years, as have what I&#x27;ll call &quot;practices&quot;, Ie: what&#x27;s considered normal buyer &#x2F; seller responsibilities and negotiating chips. For example - with one of these practices I saw a way that our area was behind the times, I started doing things differently and it put my clients in a negotiating position such that my sellers were getting a much higher return relative to comparable properties.<p>I agree on negotiating skills - unfortunately, the public seem to pick agents based on who they know socially rather than on professional abilities. Finally, to your point about negotiating - one of the challenges for many buyers (and sellers) is that they really don&#x27;t know the value of a property or where it should sell. So for example many buyers (assuming they aren&#x27;t in a competitive situation - in which case it&#x27;s a different set of strategies) will offer some stupidly low number in hopes to get the seller to come back with a reduced price. It&#x27;s &quot;let&#x27;s split the difference&quot; negotiating, rather than a data-driven approach. So for example when we go into a negotiation, we don&#x27;t just index off of the asking price, but rather we&#x27;ve done a market analysis (as a example) of our own  and thus have arrived at what we believe to be the fair market price. From that, anything below that number is gravy. So when I not only negotiate below the asking price, but below where we believe the property should fairly sell, then we&#x27;ve <i>really</i> won for the client. Or likewise when I&#x27;m on the sellers side, there&#x27;s a whole slew of ways I set us up <i>pre-market</i> to put us in the best possible position. Even knowing how to read the possibly negotiating strategies for a property, or what &quot;levers and dials&quot; are available in a negotiation isn&#x27;t something that the general public understands - if you&#x27;ve done a number of deals on your own, you may have developed this expertise.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35912249" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35912249" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gnicholas</span><span>|</span><a href="#35912051">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912182">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912291">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35910784">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35912249">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35912249">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What is it you anticipate happening that will trigger the change you describe in coming years?

&gt; prices doubled for no other reason than the money that left dotcom poured
&gt; into housing.)<p>Overall home ownership increased from 64.0% to 68.4% from 1990 to 2007. 
During that time the population also increased from 250m to 300m. 
Ostensibly, around 47m new home owners were added to the list during that
time.  Going from 160m owners to 205m owners,  or adding a new 28%.<p>During the same period 27m new housing units were completed,  with 21m being
single family homes.  I would assume this imbalance would impact pricing,
and there were plenty of other ventures for bummed out dotcom money to pour
into right around 2004.<p>Total ownership continued to fall until 2016.  New single family home
construction rate has only recovered to about 1995 levels.  The current
population is now 330m.  I contend this suggests it&#x27;s _still_ going.<p>&gt; Fact is, after people are used to paying more, there&#x27;s a new baseline and
&gt; a new level of profit expected<p>If you take the chart of average home sale prices over the past 45 years,
you see mostly linear growth.  2007 was a bubble in pricing, seeing around
an 18% higher price than this trend line.  The prices stabilize back to the
trend from 2010 until 2013 again, since then, prices have been about 10%
above trend until 2021 where they rocketed back up to 18% above the half
century trend.<p>There&#x27;s been more than one mode impacting price,  and whatever it is,  it&#x27;s
happening again.  Probably worse, because we don&#x27;t have any corresponding
movement in new home construction with this &quot;bubble.&quot;<p>&gt; Multiply that by orders of magnitude for real, wealthy property owners.<p>Then divide it by all the people who didn&#x27;t do that,  which I&#x27;m estimating
to be of at least a similar if not slightly greater order of magnitude.  I
know quite a few of these people.  Some who bought into the irrational 
exuberance as an opportunity to just remodel the home they&#x27;ve lived in for
more than a decade.  They don&#x27;t live there now.  The smart ones managed
to just barely break even.<p>&gt; Then to add insult to injury, when a bunch of leveraged people lost their
&gt; shirts on property derivatives, we bailed them out, paying twice.<p>Bailing the American people out is how it was sold.  This is not a bad idea
if that&#x27;s what they actually did.  It would probably have a little more
sticking power if they bothered to put more than a token banker or two in
jail for minor indiscretions during the first pump and dump of housing
turned commodity.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35912196" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35912196" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bigger_cheese</span><span>|</span><a href="#35910706">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35910810">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35910864">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912934">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35912196">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35912196">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Negative Gearing and AirBnB are the big culprits people get tax incentives to buy properties and then make more off of short term leases through AirBnB then renting to long term tenants.<p>South Coast of NSW is particularly bad.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35912934" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35912934" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">markdown</span><span>|</span><a href="#35910706">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35910810">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912196">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912782">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35912934">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35912934">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I don&#x27;t even know how we got here.<p>The Reserve Bank just put out an honest ad to explain that a few days ago<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DNxXRigHri4">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DNxXRigHri4</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="35912782" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35912782" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">megablast</span><span>|</span><a href="#35910706">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35910810">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912934">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912554">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35912782">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35912782">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Population growth mainly comes from people having kids.

Microsoft introduced Entity Framework, their new way of handling data in .Net applications. Promises made, promises believed, we all used it. I was especially glad of Lazy Loading, where I didn&#x27;t have to load data from the database into my memory structures; the system would do that automatically. I could write my code as if all my memory structures were populated and not worry about it. Except, it didn&#x27;t work consistently. Every now and again a memory structure would not be populated, for no apparent reason. Digging deep into technet, I found a small note saying &quot;if this happens, then you can check whether the data has been loaded by checking the value of this flag and manually loading it if necessary&quot; [0]. So, in other words, I have to manually load all my data because I can&#x27;t trust EF to do it for me. [1]<p>Long analogy short, this is where I think AI for coding is now. It gets things wrong enough that I have to manually check everything it does and correct it, to the point where I might as well just do it myself in the first place. This might not always be the case, but that&#x27;s where I feel it is right now.<p>[0] Entity Framework has moved on a lot since then, and apparently now can be trusted to lazily load data.

And is it ever really well crafted if you can&#x27;t tweak them to improve their their execution plan? I&#x27;ve never had a client or boss who asked to use an ORM framework. I suspect it&#x27;s something people think looks cool - treating SQL as OOP - until they run into a problem it can&#x27;t solve.<p>[edit] for instance, I have a case where I use a few dozen custom queries on timers to trawl through massive live data and reduce it into a separate analytics DB. Using everything from window functions to cron timers to janky PHP code that just slams results from separate DBs together to provide relatively accurate real-time results.

But I have few rules about ORMs:<p>- Proper DB design first. You should be able to remove the ORM and DB should still function as intended. This means application-side cascade operations or application-side inheritance is banned.<p>- No entities with magical collections pointing to each other. In other words, no n to n relations handled by ORM layer. Create in-between table, for gods sake. Otherwise it becomes incredibly confusing and barely maintainable.<p>- Prefer fetching data in a way that does not populate collections. In other words, fetch the most fine-grained entity and join related data. Best if you craft special record entities to fetch data into (easy with EF or Doctrine).<p>- Most ORMs allow you to inspect what kind of queries you create. Use it as query building tool. Inspect queries often, don&#x27;t do insane join chains and other silly stuff.<p>I would use ORM in one kind of app: where I would work with data that shares records that might need to be either inserted or updated, and there is several nesting levels of this kind of fun. You know, you need to either insert or update entity, if it exists, you should update, and then assign related entities to it, if it does not, then you should insert, and assign related entities to the newly created id. The ORM can easily deal with that, and on top of that it can do efficient batched queries, which would be really annoying and error-prone to hand-craft.<p>If the app does not require this kind of database with these kind of relations, I would not use ORM.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40340737" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40340737" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bad_username</span><span>|</span><a href="#40339848">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40340691">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40340890">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40340912">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40340737">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40340737">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For me the biggest reason is automated database initialization and migration.

But that&#x27;s really what this generatoon currently is.<p>And it <i>can</i> feel like magic, because we&#x27;re pattern-seeking and pattern-matching creatures, so something that seems to intuit the pattern we&#x27;re looking for (even if imperfectly) can feel quite a bit like reasoning with another human. To be a bit less generous to humans, it&#x27;s often the <i>same</i> as talking with another human, because we spend much of our lives writing boilerplate or making small talk or otherwise just kind of on autopilot and answering patterns with expected responses without seriously engaging our complex reasoning. (Do you have to really think about how to map-filter-reduce a dataset anymore? Or think seriously about how you really are when someone says &quot;how are you&quot;? We don&#x27;t usually expect other people to, and most of the time we&#x27;re satisfied by exchanging recognizable &#x2F; somewhat coherent language patterns which we can count on each other to fill in the gaps of. But this is not the intelligence in human intelligence).<p>The corporate hype machine works overtime to hype it as a solution, but that&#x27;s just what they do. That&#x27;s all spin.

I use it for my own projects only...&quot;<p>My guess is the people that don&#x27;t use Copilot because they don&#x27;t trust it, or don&#x27;t like the code it produces, are probably trying to use it in a professional scenario where they have strict coding standards. For hobbyist use or side-projects, Copilot is an incredible time saver. I use it with my Python side-projects, and it&#x27;s truly amazing how much time it saves me. Some of the most common use-cases where it saves me time:<p>- Adding docstrings. Just type `&quot;&quot;&quot;` after a method name, pause for a second, and Copilot will generate a pretty decent docstring. And usually it will mimic the style you&#x27;ve used to write other docstrings in the file.
- Writing tests. This one can be a bit hit-and-miss, but I mostly get good a good starting point, and in the best case it will suggest test scenarios that I might not have thought about.
- Creating basic functions&#x2F;methods. I have terrible memory and usually need to refer to the docs for even fundamental Python code, e.g. reading or writing CSV files, looping over and modifying dictionaries, etc... But with Copilot, I get great results, often just by typing `def open_csv_file` and then pausing for a second to get the method code. If that doesn&#x27;t work, adding a comment with what you want the function to do before writing the function name will help a lot.
- Adding type hints to existing code. Just type &quot;:&quot; and pause for a second, and Copilot will almost always provide the correct type hint. And pressing a space after the closing parentheses in a function, will almost always return the correct return type hint.</div><br/><div id="40339243" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40339243" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">leptons</span><span>|</span><a href="#40339041">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40339063">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40339243">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40339243">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I only use Copilot for my day job, because they paid for it.

Mainly because it&#x27;s just a slightly better autocomplete than PHPStorm&#x2F;Jetbrains IDE provides. Although they are now pushing their own AI tools for an extra fee pretty heavily but unlikely to pay for it given copilot pricing is pretty competitive.<p>There are occasions where I&#x27;m just not in the mood to work something complex out so sticking a temporary comment in telling it what to do can sometimes yield a good enough result, all be it with some occasional minor tweaking.<p>Where it&#x27;s really shined is with repetitive tasks. It&#x27;s nothing close to perfect but it&#x27;s certainly a welcomed little helper even if it does get things wrong sometimes.<p>In terms of the original question, I think its the cognative mental load thats being helped here more than anything, not having to waste brain power on the mundane bits is the big selling point for me.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40339306" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40339306" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Sytten</span><span>|</span><a href="#40340398">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40338910">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40339306">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40339306">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I mainly use it as a smart rust auto-complete and I would say it saves me probably 30% of coding time, everything boilerplate&#x2F;tests it gets super well.

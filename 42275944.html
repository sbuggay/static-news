I’ve also been inspired by Xerox PARC’s 1970s and 1980s researchers.  I pursued that goal, and I’ve worked for a few industrial research labs before I switched careers to full-time community college teaching a few months ago.<p>One thing I lament is the decline of long-term, unfettered research across the industry.  I’ve witnessed more companies switching to research management models where management exerts more control over the research directions of their employees, where research directions can abruptly change due to management decisions, and where there is an increased focus on profitability.  I feel this short-term approach will cost society in the long term, since current funding models promote evolutionary work rather than riskier, potentially revolutionary work.<p>As someone who wanted to become a researcher out of curiosity and exploration, I feel alienated in this world where industry researchers are harangued about “delivering value,” and where academic researchers are pressured to raise grant money and to publish.  I quit and switched to a full teaching career at a community college.  I enjoy teaching, and while I miss the day-to-day lifestyle of research, I still plan to do research during my summer and winter breaks out of curiosity and not for career advancement.<p>It would be great if there were more opportunities for researchers to pursue their interests.  Sadly, though, barring a cultural change, the only avenues I see for curiosity-driven researchers are becoming independently wealthy, living like a monk, or finding a job with ample free time.  I’m fortunate to have the latter situation where I have 16 weeks per year that I could devote outside my job.</div><br/><div id="42278885" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42278885" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gwervc</span><span>|</span><a href="#42277630">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42279083">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42278885">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42278885">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; the only avenues I see for curiosity-driven researchers are becoming independently wealthy, living like a monk<p>I came to the same conclusion.

Even Zuck isn&#x27;t free from business pressures if the funding is coming from Meta and not out of Zuck&#x27;s personal funds.<p>Back to Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, my understanding of how they worked is that while management did set the overall direction, researchers were given very wide latitude when pursuing this direction with little to no pressure to deliver immediate results and to show that their research would lead to profits.  Indeed, at one point AT&amp;T was forbidden by the federal government from entering businesses outside of their phone business, and in the case of Xerox PARC, Robert Taylor was able to negotiate a deal with Xerox executives where Xerox&#x27;s executives wouldn&#x27;t meddle in the affairs of PARC for the first five years.

There are certain types of research that benefit from our current research grant system and from VC funding.  The former is good when the research has a clear impact (whether it is social or business), and the latter is good when there is a good chance the research could be part of a successful business venture.  There are also plenty of applied research labs where the research agenda is tightly aligned with business needs.  We have seen the fruits of applied research in all sorts of areas, such as self-driving vehicles, Web-scale software infrastructure (MapReduce, Spark, BigTable, Spanner, etc.), deep learning, large language models, and more.<p>As big of a fan I am of Xerox PARC and Bell Labs, I don&#x27;t want to come across as saying that the Bell Labs and Xerox PARC models of research are the only ways to do research.  Indeed, Bell Labs couldn&#x27;t convert many of its research ideas to products due to the agreement AT&amp;T made with the federal government not to expand into other businesses, and Xerox PARC infamously failed to successfully monetize many of its inventions, and many of these researchers left Xerox for other companies who saw the business potential in their work, such as Apple, Adobe, and Microsoft, to name a few.<p>However, the problem with our current system of grants and VC funding is that they are not a good fit for riskier avenues of research where the impacts cannot be immediately seen, or the impact will take many years to develop.  I am reminded of Alan Kay&#x27;s comments (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;worrydream.com&#x2F;2017-12-30-alan&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;worrydream.com&#x2F;2017-12-30-alan&#x2F;</a>) on how NSF grants require an explanation of how the researchers plan to solve the problem, which precludes exploratory research where one doesn&#x27;t know how to attack the problem.  Now, once again, this question from the NSF is not inappropriate; there are different phases of research, and coming up with an &quot;attack plan&quot; that is reasonable and is backed by a command of the prior art and a track record of solving other problems is part of research; all PhD programs have some sort of thesis proposal that requires answering the same question the NSF asks in its proposals.  With that said, there is still the early phase of research where researchers are formulating the question, and where researchers are trying to figure out how they&#x27;d go about solving the problem.  This early phase of research is part of research, too.<p>I think the funding situation for research depends on the type of research being done.  For more applied research that has more obvious impact, especially business impact, then I believe there are plenty of opportunities out there that are more appropriate than old-school industrial research labs.  However, for more speculative work where impacts are harder to see or where they are not immediate, the funding situation is much more difficult today compared to in the past where industrial research labs were less driven by the bottom line, and when academics had fewer &quot;publish-or-perish&quot; pressures.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42279442" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42279442" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aprdm</span><span>|</span><a href="#42277630">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42278833">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42279149">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42278847">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42279442">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42279442">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What makes you think they don&#x27;t fund it ?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42278847" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42278847" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">uLogMicheal</span><span>|</span><a href="#42277630">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42278691">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42278833">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42279888">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42278847">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42278847">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is not the mindset of monopolies, cutting research for the sake of short term profits is the mindset of Wallstreet&#x27;s modern monopoly.</div><br/><div id="42278992" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42278992" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">linguae</span><span>|</span><a href="#42277630">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42278847">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42279888">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42278992">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42278992">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree with you that the modern corporate world seems to be allergic to anything that doesn&#x27;t promise immediate profits.  It takes more than a monopoly to have something like Bell Labs.  To be more precise, monopolies tend to have the resources to create Bell Labs-style research labs, but it also takes another type of driving factor to create such a research lab, whether it is pleasing government regulators (I believe this is what motivated the founding of Bell Labs), staying ahead of existential threats (a major theme of 1970&#x27;s-era Xerox PARC was the idea of a &quot;paperless office,&quot; as Xerox saw the paperless office as an existential threat to their photocopier monopoly), or for purely giving back to society.<p>In short, Bell Labs-style institutions not only require consistent sources of funding that only monopolies can commit to, but they also require stakeholders to believe that funding such institutions is beneficial.

Decision systems support across many fields would remove subjective, politicised pressures.</div><br/><div id="42279262" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42279262" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">l33t7332273</span><span>|</span><a href="#42278098">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42278496">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42279262">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42279262">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Do you think there is room for a resurgence in linear optimization?<p>Linear programming, and even integer linear programming are pretty well solved practically speaking.</div><br/><div id="42279621" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42279621" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ggm</span><span>|</span><a href="#42278098">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42279262">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42279621">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42279621">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I tried using some online systems to help formulate weighted sum decisions over unrankable choices and it&#x27;s bloody hard work getting people on board.

The reasons the image is discouraged are to promote professionalism, diversity, and respect in research. The journal Nature says “the Lena image clashes with the extensive efforts to promote women undertaking higher education in science and engineering”. [1] The paper “On alternatives to Lenna says “ Whatever its merits, the Lenna image’s origin is incompatible with our community’s sincere attempts to encourage diversity and respect in Science and Technology”. [2] (And references “ A centerfold does not belong in the classroom”. [3])<p>It’s more or less the same as hanging pin-ups at work- most people understand why that’s a bad idea, regardless of whether it was acceptable in the past. Imagine if female teachers put up Chippendale’s posters in the classroom, or nurses put them in the hospital, and argued that anyone who complained was just being PC police and unreasonably sensitive. Just because some people might not care doesn’t mean everyone is okay with it, and even if you don’t care about it, it’s still clearly unprofessional.<p>I’m sure it’s completely unintentional and that you and parent comment don’t mean to sound unsupportive of our social advances of women. I’m sure like most people here you actively support and encourage women to learn and work in STEM fields, and advocate for equality.

I had actually had Autocad (R16) 3D CAD experience at the time, but alpha_1 was a lot of fun. I ended up making a 3D Model of Escher’s Belvedere. One of the guys was going to “print” it down in the lab in the bottom of MEB (they did have some form of 3D printer) but thought it might be hard and unstable. I ended up getting it rendered with ray tracing on one of the brand new UltraSPARCs they had in the lab, and it was printed on a T shirt that everyone got. We also got a copy of VisualStudio 6 from Microsoft (we toured their studio near the airport) which I sold on ebay for $375 at the time.</div><br/><div id="36270156" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36270156" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">McKayDavis</span><span>|</span><a href="#36266226">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36268449">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36268416">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36270156">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36270156">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don’t know the exact year the CDRS group was acquired by PTC, but it be around the same time I attended the same High School Computing Institute in 1996.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36268416" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36268416" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nologic01</span><span>|</span><a href="#36266226">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36265964">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36268416">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36268416">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Computer graphics has always been a world apart in computing.

Most Americans don&#x27;t own cars or support car-friendly policies due to some notion of car=freedom or some other culture wars nonsense.<p>Americans own cars because most of them live in single-family houses on large plots of land, and that doesn&#x27;t make public transit for daily commuting a realistic possibility. In Paris car ownership is very low, maybe 1&#x2F;3 of adults, but in rural France the car ownership rate is easily 95%+. I haven&#x27;t seen a single developed area in the world that has violated the rule that low density = high car ownership and vice versa.<p>The other rule that I have never seen violated is that the large majority of middle and upper income people do not want to live near low income people, due to crime or other reasons. In Europe, poor people live in the suburbs, so the middle income live in the city with high density housing. In the US and some other places (south asia), low income people live near the business center, so the middle income live in low density housing in the suburbs. These are for historical reasons and cannot be easily changed.</div><br/><div id="35997478" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35997478" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Retric</span><span>|</span><a href="#35997397">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35998197">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35997478">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35997478">[17 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">America actually has a huge public transportation system servicing most homes in the US.

For instance, without vehicles, in the village I live in, we’d probably be connected via bus to the nearby town, where you can do some shopping from a dollar store and get something to eat at restaurants, but to be connected to the various cities? They may have daily shuttles, but the population (&lt;300) may not make this worth it. And as established in the thread public transport sucks and would make running errands impossible.<p>This doesn’t even compare to the truly remote individuals who live in the country miles out.<p>Honestly I feel like people who live in cities really lose their sense of scale for how large the US really is and how small a large percentage of communities are. I mean almost 1&#x2F;3rd of the US population is crammed into less than 1% of the total surface of the USA. Using the 333 most populace cities in the USA gives an average population density of ~3,150&#x2F;square mile. Out in the country where I live, we’re maybe 50&#x2F;sqm, and further out that can drop to .25&#x2F;sqm or lower.<p>Not to mention the fact that the reason public school buses work is because for the better part of the year the destinations are ironed out and rarely change. Little Æ is going from home to school and back 90% of the time. That simply doesn’t reflect an adult’s lifestyle, because while every child in a given area goes to a single school, jobs are much less localized.

The reason lies with the &quot;operated by public entities&quot; bit.  Heck, even in NYC, <i>private</i> companies built the lion&#x27;s share of the subway system, then the city &quot;nationalized&quot; them and very little additional development was done.<p>Around the world governments &quot;nationalize&quot; what they allow themselves to, and at each level they nationalize the most salient and notable industry that&#x27;s not too small to be small potatoes.  In the U.S. the federal government doesn&#x27;t allow itself to nationalize anything, the States do allow themselves but they can&#x27;t bring themselves to hurt their industry as they compete with other States, but <i>cities</i> don&#x27;t see themselves as competing with other cities, and <i>cities</i> allow themselves (and the States allow them to) to nationalize public transportation.<p>Take Argentina where a strong national government has at times nationalized steel production, oil production, etc., but they wouldn&#x27;t deign to bother with nationalizing bus service -- it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s beneath them -- and so Buenos Aires has one of the most fantastic <i>privately operated</i> public bus systems in the world.  You never have to wait more than a few minutes for a bus during business hours.  But in the U.S. you&#x27;re lucky if buses run more often than every 30 minutes at rush hour.<p>Do you want Americans to not drive their cars so much?  Fine, it&#x27;s easy: allow private companies to operate <i>all</i> public bus services, and also to operate small buses without set routes (a sort of Uber of buses).  If you insist on the cities running public transportation then you can be sure that the public transportation system will never ever be good enough that Americans will be happy to relinquish their cars.<p>It&#x27;s that simple.<p>And no, <i>trains</i> won&#x27;t cut it.  Laying tracks down is unbelievably expensive, will never pay for itself, and you can&#x27;t ever change them afterwards, and you won&#x27;t be able to place them where people can use them because that would be way too disruptive unless you make it subways, and that&#x27;s even more unbelievably expensive.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35998197" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35998197" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">asmor</span><span>|</span><a href="#35997397">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35997478">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35998606">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35998197">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35998197">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Both can be true.

The thing is that today most people in the US under the age of 60 grew up in cars, usually in a suburban environment, and it&#x27;s actually impossible for them to imagine what life without a car might even look like. It&#x27;s like trying to describe a color. If we can&#x27;t even <i>visualize</i> an alternative, how are we supposed to <i>achieve</i> the alternative?<p>Only by traveling to places that were developed before cars took a chokehold on the world can people realize how <i>nice</i> it is to live without them <i>absolutely everywhere</i>.<p>Many Americans get a taste of that when they vacation to Europe. They often choose to leave their suburb and spend their 2 weeks in urban environments like Barcelona, London, Munich, Paris, Rome, etc., that where built for people and not cars, because it&#x27;s so pleasant to live like that, and because letting cities develop for people first leads to cities that people actually want to be in, with car-free streets, plazas, promenades, etc. (Yes, today those places are also full of cars. But, unlike American cities, their skeletons are people-first and cars are the invasive element.)<p>It could be argued that so many problems of American life - weight gain, loneliness, fracturing of the social fabric - stem from how we&#x27;ve isolated ourselves in unwalkable suburbs, where there&#x27;s no spontaneous social interaction because everyone&#x27;s always in a car, and where our only exercise is the walk from the parking lot to our desk.<p>What&#x27;s depressing is visiting developing countries and seeing them start to ape the worst of American car life. Places like Colombia, which I visit often, are building shopping malls, big-box stores, parking lots, suburbs, and freeways, while after almost 100 years of that type of car-first development in America we&#x27;re only just starting to realize that actually it might not be that great.</div><br/><div id="35995340" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35995340" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cal5k</span><span>|</span><a href="#35989625">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35995323">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35995340">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35995340">[32 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; What&#x27;s depressing is visiting developing countries and seeing them start to ape the worst of American car life.<p>What a patronizing take.

There are many alternatives to car-oriented life, as cities that grew before cars plainly evidence. Those are the cities that people want to spend their vacations in.<p>Instead of building shopping malls with parking lots, Colombia could relax zoning to allow chain restaurants and McDonalds near housing, and build dedicated bike lanes to get to them. Instead of building suburbs and freeways, it could build more public space like open pedestrian plazas to give people a feeling of space, and metros&#x2F;bus rapid transit to make it easy to get around. Colombians who want to live a quiet suburban-style life can still do that in a rural home, which could be connected by rail when traveling to a city is required - but their <i>choice</i> to live a suburban life should not require those of us in cities to give up our space for wide roads to fit their cars and endless free car storage, at the expense of <i>our</i> way of life.<p>These options aren&#x27;t the only alternatives Colombians could have, nor are they a fantasy - they exist today in places like Europe and parts of Asia.<p>Cars are not a requirement for human flourishing.

I often say I feel like a time traveller. I feel like I&#x27;m from the not too distant future. Chile feels like what California felt like growing up in the 70s and 80s, only with smart phones. People here throw trash wherever ... just like we did in California in the 70s and 80s. People here love their cars, and think of them as a status symbol and an extension of their identity ... just like we did in California in the 70s and 80s. Before I came to Chile I lived in Los Angeles and had to commute each day for over an hour each way. I also lived in Amsterdam and had to commute by bike each day for 20 minutes. I never owned a car the entire time I lived there. I was much better off mentally, physically, and economically in Amsterdam for this reason alone. I was freer too. A lot has changed in Chile since I arrived, especially in car ownership, and car-centric growth. I would not say that it&#x27;s natural or the obviously best choice to prefer a car-centric future. The future Chile is creating for itself is not the one I would choose. There are alternatives.<p>&gt; Like, what&#x27;s the alternative?<p>Building the infrastructure for cars is a choice. Prioritizing cars over other modes of transportation is a choice. So make different choices.<p>I live in a small town. It&#x27;s just six square blocks, but is densely populated with multi-story condos, and lots of shops and restaurants. But the streets are filled with cars. Cars are double parked on the sidewalks, and traffic moves at a snail&#x27;s pace. It&#x27;s loud, dirty, and unsafe. We could easily close the streets to cars, encourage people to take mass transit (we have collectivos and busetas) by making it expensive to park outside of the town center, require the numerous gated communities nearby to incorporate more amenities, like markets and pharmacies, to discourage trips by car, make it safer to bike by building ciclovias, and so on.

Car companies illegally bought up streetcar companies and sent the streetcars for scrap. Cars were killing so many pedestrians that car companies came up with the term &quot;Jaywalker&quot; to mean &quot;country bumpkin walker&quot; and propagandised it into blaming pedestrians for car drivers hitting them. Car companies are pushing SUVs in advertising because SUVs have a legal loophole about being &#x27;light trucks&#x27; where they don&#x27;t have to meet as strict safety and efficiency regulations so they are more profitable; it isn&#x27;t that &quot;Americans like SUVs&quot;, it&#x27;s that &quot;Americans are being told to want SUVs&quot; so they do.<p>They stop you dealing with crowded, noisy buses and trams by <i>being</i> crowded, noisy traffic offloading that problem to everyone outside your soundproofed cage.<p><i>Walking</i> is freedom - you can go where you like, when you like, with whom you like, and you can do it without dealing with crowded, noisy, sometimes dangerous buses&#x2F;trams&#x2F;subways, or rush hour or full car parks or car park fees or tailbacks. And without spending money or needing to be rich, without being confined to a car, without having responsibility of the safety of your passengers and all others around you, without having your attention constantly on controlling a car, without having to divert to a car park, look for a car park, or return to the same car park before you can go anywhere else, without being stuck in traffic, without being stuck to roadways. Walking with metros and trams and trains is freedom with a boost - optional, convenient, power assisted walking. (Bikes can be fun, but designing a city around requiring a bike sucks in the same way that designing a city around requiring a car sucks; design the city around <i>not</i> needing My Personal Metal Transport Vehicle(tm) and then add a little bit of that back in as necessary&#x2F;helpful&#x2F;fun).<p>&gt; &quot;<i>How do you propose to stop Colombians from voting with their wallets when they choose to eat at chain restaurants, shop at big box stores and then take the freeway back to their air-conditioned 2000 sq ft houses in the suburbs?</i>&quot;<p>What happened in Amsterdam in the 1960s is the Jokinen Plan[1] proposed to demolish some working class neighbourhoods and run a six-lane highway into the city center, assuming that Dutch people would want to live in the suburbs and drive to the city like Americans do. Instead the people voted against it, and it turns out that making safe and convenient pedestrian and bike routes separate from car roads makes walking and biking safer and more pleasant, and so more people walk and bike for journeys instead of driving, which reduces car traffic and fumes and the need for big wide roads, which makes walking and biking even more pleasant. They didn&#x27;t ban cars by fiat - surprise, lots of people don&#x27;t want to drive for every single journey. (Possibly because driving is inconvenient, effortful, boring, and it&#x27;s uncomfortable to be trapped in a fixed position for an hour looking at concrete and car-butts and road signs).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;hzDCcSg.jpeg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;hzDCcSg.jpeg</a> - this is a &quot;freeway&quot; because you don&#x27;t pay a toll to drive on it.

It&#x27;s the lack of questioning in decisions and groupthink.<p>Tax per acre used to be a metric that was used in urban planning decisions. That was mostly thrown away when people started to want cars. A primary metric then became level of service. LOS was a way to measure traffic volume but didn&#x27;t necessarily mean increased net economic output, although it was nearly used as one. It doesn&#x27;t paint the picture correctly for municipal urban planning in a financial sense.<p>For sustained economic vitality in a very simplistic form, the infrastructure and municipal services costs should be subtracted from the amount of tax revenue gained from the land. Basically, is this land making the city money or is it costing the city money. This info can be used to adjust taxes, plan better built environments, amongst other things.<p>If that was regularly being measured throughout the last 100 years and acted upon, I imagine much of the car dependent areas of the world would look a lot different.

They tend to have so many areas that are severely underdeveloped that it would be economical to upzone them with transit in mind. Many a European city is far less car-centric than they were 30 years ago, just via rebuilding streets that were already dense enough to make sense. A good 50% of my home town is already just for pedestrians and delivery vehicles, and I read streets are changing.<p>The real problem is both cities that are not growing at all, and cities that are still digging into the car hole.<p>You might be able to rezone 50 year old suburbs, if just because the houses themselves keep losing value (as the real price increases are just land). But when the house was just built 10 years ago, it&#x27;s a very tough sell. And if you expect a couple of million people, who are living in very low density suburb, to come downtown for any reason, you either make their transit story hell, or you are stuck wasting a lot of space just to manage their cars: Bad either way.<p>The cities that aren&#x27;t growing just are going to have a lot of trouble becoming denser, and the political problem will be even bigger, as every effort to make the area near the city center denser in a city that doesn&#x27;t grow is just making the outer suburbs less valuable. I am really worried about those cities.

Access to cars gave me, compared to the horse era of my great-grandparents, access to wide swathes of urban culture, not to mention mind-expanding forays to locations in adjacent states beyond any alternative transportation. Without the auto, I would have lived a much more conscripted life, likely never leaving my home state for a life spent roaming around the world.

It turns short, as-the-crow-flies, trips into long ones. Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve lived in places where it&#x27;s literally faster to walk slowly between two locations than take the bus -- the car alternative was less than 1&#x2F;5th of the bus time.<p>However, once an area builds real transit, like lightrail, or a subway or something, there&#x27;s pressure to integrate the systems, and suddenly bus routes will optimize to connect people with those systems.<p>This is completely anecdotal, but I&#x27;ve noticed massive bus route redesigns in a couple places where transit comes on-line. A 45 minute meandering bus &quot;loop&quot; turning into a 15 minute direct route to the local transit station, which also works well for commuting as offices tend to be in high-density commercial zones near transit so the total commute time is within spitting distance of just driving.</div><br/><div id="35998298" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35998298" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eptcyka</span><span>|</span><a href="#35998077">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35991064">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35998298">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35998298">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This might be by design - if you have a small amount of buses and drivers, then to service a given area one has to have a small amount of long routes.

The bus system has become the transportation of last resort.  It&#x27;s not meant for this and isn&#x27;t good at this.  It&#x27;s only good at highly used routes that can maximize bus capacity.  Let rideshare handle these social safety net transportation issues.  Ask a low income rider using the bus system, would they prefer to continue using it or get a free rideshare card with a few hundred dollars in it every month?  Most would probably very enthusiastically go for the rideshare card.<p>And I know rideshare has a bad reputation because of Uber&#x2F;Lyft.  But government can create rules they must follow to accept these funds.  They can either accept those rules or some other company will.  Or maybe a government rideshare service is a better option.  This is a classic free market vs government service question and there&#x27;s many options here.  But the important point is allowing everyone to use rideshare as a transportation option.</div><br/><div id="35997941" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35997941" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bombcar</span><span>|</span><a href="#35995018">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35995636">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35995094">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35997941">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35997941">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is exactly true, and small towns with <i>no</i> transit almost always have a paravan or other setup (usually it&#x27;s just a minivan that can take a wheelchair and is basically a city-funded taxi).<p>Heck, the ridership on some extended bus lines is so bad and so expensive the city would have been much better off buying each person a small car and focusing the rest on more used lines.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35995094" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35995094" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ako</span><span>|</span><a href="#35995018">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35995353">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35996787">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35995094">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35995094">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">By what metrics do you determine public bus system isn’t working, and how would you expect these metrics to change in your proposal?<p>As far as I can tell many people are using public transport, including buses, so it seems to work to some extend.</div><br/><div id="35995306" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35995306" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bit_logic</span><span>|</span><a href="#35995018">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35995094">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35997958">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35995306">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35995306">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This whole thread exists because the public bus system is a failure in the US.  How many threads on car dependence has there been on HN?  The bus system is used only by the lowest income members of society who can&#x27;t afford a car.  They suffer long transit times, lack of point-to-point mobility, and delays.  Sure that &quot;works&quot; to some extent for those who have no other options.  And this leads to other effects like decreased health and social mobility.  Want to go to college after work to improve your life?  Can&#x27;t because the bus routes take 2x or 3x the time it would in a car to get there.  Want to get a checkup for that cough?  Again riding the bus takes too much time.<p>You can&#x27;t force a top-down solution for public transit with the road system in the US.  The great strength of the US road system is point-to-point transportation.  Let everyone benefit from that instead of running buses that only the poorest use.  Publicly funded rideshare is the way to do this.  After a while, the bus routes will naturally appear in the data.  This is the bottom-up way to build a bus system.</div><br/><div id="35998144" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35998144" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ako</span><span>|</span><a href="#35995018">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35995306">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35997958">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35998144">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35998144">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My main problem with ride sharing is that it allows companies to compete with taxi&#x27;s by exploiting car owner needing extra income.<p>In the Netherlands we treat public transport as a basic necessity that should be available to everyone. Not everyone can own or drive a car (too old, too young, too poor, physically or mentally not able, hazard on the road for others), and you don’t want to force everyone to move to large cities where public transport is available: cities are more expensive. In addition, public transport usually has less impact on the environment.<p>Bussed are sized to need though: areas with lower demand are served by smaller, less frequent busses, or busses on demand. You need to call to reserve a ride. Which is almost like ride sharing, but not at the cost of ride sharing car owners.<p>Public transport has a large positive impact on a society, and as such doesn’t really need to make a profit. E.g., we all benefit if teachers that can’t afford to live in cites, can still travels into cities to teach children there. The entire society, including the economy, benefits from having the population educated well.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35997958" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35997958" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bombcar</span><span>|</span><a href="#35995018">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35995094">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35995306">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35996787">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35997958">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35997958">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Take a look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;afdc.energy.gov&#x2F;data&#x2F;10311" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;afdc.energy.gov&#x2F;data&#x2F;10311</a> - busses are not full enough on average to really pull their &quot;weight&quot; - light trucks do better!<p>Rail does much better because it&#x27;s usually only built where it can be filled, and is electrified.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35996787" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35996787" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sjducb</span><span>|</span><a href="#35995018">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35995094">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35995925">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35996787">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35996787">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Solutions that make things worse before they make things better usually just make things worse.<p>Probably what would happen is the busses would get shut down, the Ubers would be underfunded, then no new busses would be started.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35989819" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35989819" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lynx23</span><span>|</span><a href="#35995018">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35994332">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35989819">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35989819">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I moved 20 years ago into an apartment 5 minutes walking distance from work.

Things felt close, and accessible. I went home for Thanksgiving once and realized that, while there were plenty of things that were kind of in range (grocery store ~2.5mi, shopping mall ~3mi, mini-golf ~1.5mi), the fact that it all ran through that highway made everything feel far, and it was never feasible to do anything but drive.<p>And I&#x27;m not even sure the solve needs &quot;make my hometown area dense&quot;!

Even ignoring security checkpoints, jet planes almost always take people from where they do not are to where they do not want to be. Using them to go from where you are to where you want to be means spending additional time to travel to and from the airport.<p>Trains (most of the time) are a bit better in that regard because stations are more plentiful and often closer to where people want to be.<p>Cars, bicycles, and feet (mostly in that order; depending on infrastructure, it may be faster to get into your car than to hop on pot your bicycle) are even better.<p>Speed wise, it’s reversed. If there are no obstructions, speeds are feet &lt; bicycle &lt; car &lt; train &lt; jet plane.<p>That means that, only looking at trip duration, the detour to an airport and from the destination airport only is worth it for fairly long trips. Similarly, walking can be faster than cycling if you don’t have to go far, cycling can be faster than taking the car, etc.<p>Unfortunately, people also take trip costs into account, and those often are cheaper for air planes, compared to trains.<p>So, to ‘quit’ cars, we have to make it easier for people to go to a train station or to hop onto their bicycle and&#x2F;or have to make it more difficult to hop into their car.<p>Banning on-street parking, requiring car drivers to walk a few hundred meters to a parking garage cuts multiple ways there. Using less space for parking allows for higher density, which leads to shorter travel distances, and increases the time to hop into one’s car.</div><br/><div id="35991021" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35991021" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">josephcsible</span><span>|</span><a href="#35989416">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35989906">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35989616">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35991021">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35991021">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; we have to make it easier for people to go to a train station or to hop onto their bicycle and&#x2F;or have to make it more difficult to hop into their car.<p>The former is fine, since it&#x27;s an improvement to society.

However, there are arguably a lot of positive benefits that result from making cars a more inconvenient choice. For example, one design choice that makes cars convenient is that towns and cities in the U.S.A often prioritize parking lots. Parking lots take up a lot of valuable space. If we used that space for something else (housing, a restaurant, a park, a museum, office space, anything really), then it becomes much less convenient for cars to be in the area, but more attractive for people who do not depend on a car. If that happens at scale in area, you also get other nice benefits like less air pollution, less noise pollution, fewer traffic accidents, etc.</div><br/><div id="35994650" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35994650" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bluGill</span><span>|</span><a href="#35989416">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35992943">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35995075">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35994650">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35994650">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The problem is you need to be able to get to that area before you can eliminate cars.

All the movies and ads told you that.  Pick a girl up to take her somewhere? Nope, can’t do that.  Are you even dateable if you can’t drive? Watching all your friends get their license and feeling like you missed out on graduating to adulthood? It’s painful.  Want to use buses and trains? That’s cool but be careful of all those ‘bad people’ that want to rob you and don’t travel too late at night or too early in the morning, it’s unsafe!<p>A car is a symbol of freedom, independence and safety for many people.  Freedom to roam about wherever you want, whenever you want as you please, without having to rely on your parents.  I don’t blame anyone for thinking this way, it’s what we’ve been fed by culture for as long as I can remember.<p>Not that these perceptions are accurate when I look back on it, they’re as much to do with my own insecurity as a disabled person as they are to do with general society.  It’s nice to know that this isn’t a thing everywhere in the world.<p>FWIW I don’t hate cars (I think I’m as much of a fan as anyone that grew up with gear-head mates) and over the years I’ve come to terms with never driving and quite like the financial convenience of not owning a car, but still.

Just as a fan of fast cars and classics, I appreciate being able to talk the ins and outs with people who are also so inclined. Many of whom are not really into driving, and more into the beauty of the machines. Yes, they&#x27;re also a teenage symbol of &quot;freedom&quot; - I grew up in LA in the 80s-90s, where rich kids had expensive cars, but cool kids had hot rods or souped up rice rockets. It wasn&#x27;t just mobility, it was your most expensive and treasured possession. But it&#x27;s actually a pretty false, limited type of freedom, as I realized when I grew up, sold my Camaro and left the States for 12 years. That sense of freedom from your parents turns out to be a few road trips in your life. It&#x27;s not like you can just drive down to Patagonia (unless you want to court imminent death a dozen times along the way). In any event, basically no one does it. So the freedom aspect is kinda bunk, like all the other freedoms Americans think they have but never actually test.<p>In terms of the pure pleasure of driving a difficult-to-drive, classic that I saved and restored from the scrapyard, with a hair trigger clutch, listening to every sound from the engine, I feel like I&#x27;m probably one of the only people I know who enjoys doing it every day. But it&#x27;s driving as an art, just like fixing cars is an art.

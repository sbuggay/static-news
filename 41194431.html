It’s a big, big task to basically dismantle a car, fix body issues, rebuild the engine and transmission, clean up all the parts, and put it back together.

The goal vs quest mindsets are basically waterfall vs (lowercase a) agile mindsets.  In the former you risk building something you don&#x27;t want or under-allocate resources to achieving it, in the latter, you&#x27;ve realized that you&#x27;ve misestimated what the final outcome will be or should be, and know that there will be a discovery process alongside development.<p>&gt; basically, life intervenes and they got to leave with nothing really done at all.<p>And perhaps there is no sense in that journey being &#x27;complete&#x27; as there&#x27;s always some way to improve things.  But I think the caution here on the &#x27;quest&#x27; mindset, is to still have something functional early on – &quot;Release early, and release often&quot; as it were.  But this caution also holds for the &#x27;goal&#x27; mindset, perhaps moreso, as there&#x27;s a higher risk of misunderstanding what &#x27;complete&#x27; looks like, or all the side-&#x27;goals&#x27; you never anticipated, and becoming dismayed when you&#x27;ve found yourself settling in on a <i>loong</i> quest anyway.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41198857" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41198857" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ocodo</span><span>|</span><a href="#41196363">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41197324">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41197847">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41198226">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41198857">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41198857">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I&#x27;ve also seen plenty people too focused on doing every little step up to some imagined standards that they never get to complete anything<p>This is the true definition of the Yak Shave.</div><br/><div id="41199483" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41199483" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Ma8ee</span><span>|</span><a href="#41196363">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41198857">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41199444">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41199483">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41199483">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not at all.

I&#x27;m not fast. I haven&#x27;t done it in a while. But I think I&#x27;d like to do it again. 
You&#x27;re not wrong, I&#x27;m going to quibble a bit because I have a slightly different perspective that might be helpful.
First, a little context. For me a marathon is all about training. That first day it might only be 50 steps. A few weeks or months in, I can go a mile or 3. Then it&#x27;s just awful. Every little weak tendon and muscle is crying out. Walk for a bit then get back to running. After the early bit, I get 3-4 miles into a run, then have to decide, 3-4 miles back home or 6 to just finish the run. 
I think that&#x27;s the critical point. am I just going to walk home? That&#x27;s an option. but I&#x27;ve gone so far. Walk a lot and just finish the damn route.
And that&#x27;s kind of the point. A lot of comments are arguing about semantics, and I get that. But the point is just get through the bullshit however you can. It&#x27;s ok to kind of hobble along. Stop by the bar and have a beer or three and make it home. There&#x27;s no shame in that. Finishing the loop, however you can, is still finishing the loop.<p>Me, personally, getting past that critical point, embracing the suck. That&#x27;s kinda the point. I hit that miserable point. I keep moving forward however I can. Whatever stupid bullshit comes up, you (I) just get through it. Somehow. it doesn&#x27;t matter how. And then there&#x27;s a bit of a release. Maybe just glide through the last few miles. Maybe rub some dirt on it and walk home. It doesn&#x27;t really matter because I complete the loop. I sort of shed the vision of what it might be, and learn what it really is. And that&#x27;s super helpful.<p>Mark Twain wrote life on the Mississippi, and wrote a lot about how cool it would be to be a riverboat pilot. The beautiful pink sky, the ripples on the water. And there&#x27;s sort of a heartbreaking transition when he learns the pink sky means a storm is coming. the ripples mean there&#x27;s a sandbar. In his unknowing dream, everything he loved about it was a disaster waiting to strike. He learned in his own way.<p>For me, there&#x27;s a joy and romance to running a marathon that was completely unlike what I thought it was before I started.<p>So anyway, maybe the subtle shift from goal to quest is enough to help some people embrace the suck. Nothing is what you think it is without doing it. there are parts that are awful. if you can get through it, you&#x27;ll get nothing you hoped for. but maybe the change of perspective is enough.</div><br/><div id="41198998" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41198998" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mcdow</span><span>|</span><a href="#41196363">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41198341">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41197078">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41198998">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41198998">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I honestly don’t disagree with you.

As you say, it focuses on the process instead of the outcome. I&#x27;ve of course known that this is how you&#x27;re supposed to achieve goals (step-by-step I&#x27;d say), but something about the word &quot;quest&quot; makes it more real to me, and maybe even more desirable. I think perhaps that even though there are tons of painful things that happen during a &quot;quest&quot;, they seem more connected with a &quot;righteous outcome&quot;, vs. the laundry list of steps that I think of for most of the &quot;goals&quot; I want to attain.<p>2. I don&#x27;t deal with unexpected curve balls well, and one reason I fail to reach a lot of my goals is I get dejected when things don&#x27;t go according to plan. But I think the framing of &quot;quest&quot;, where basically curve balls are 90% of what happens, makes it easier in my mind. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m actually planning and expecting the unexpected, instead of getting annoyed when the unexpected pops up. I really like it.<p>3. Finally, and though it may seem trivial or silly, the visualization of a &quot;quest&quot; for me is just something that seems, well, more adventurous than drudgery.<p>In any case, this is one of the first HN posts on self-improvement that I really liked and clicked with me (usually I roll my eyes at what feels like &quot;survivorship bias&quot; advice).

But when encountering setbacks in work the default is to get frustrated.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not the <i>type</i> of challenge that differs. In DnD a lot of the challenges are logistical in nature or some kind of interpersonal conflict.<p>My take is that the main difference is perceived risk &#x2F; perceived high stakes. In a game you are in a circle of safety, so you don&#x27;t get as stressed about roadblocks - whereas if you perceive negative consequences for failing to reach a goal in real life, then any obstacle looks like a survival threat and the anxiety about failing distracts from fully engaging with the challenge. As an example outside of work: if you&#x27;re playing DnD and the DM says: &quot;the bartender gives you a rude look&quot; you are intrigued and curious. If a waiter in real life gives you a rude look, most of our brain&#x27;s will at least temporarily go into ego threat mode and fall into a default of freezing, leaving or arguing back. We will be distracted, bothered, and generally the opposite of open-minded and curious. My point is not whether these are ideal responses but to note <i>how differently</i> our brains respond in a situation where there is actually minimal risk, but our brain perceives high risk because of outdated programming. Another example in the other direction: people can easily start taking games <i>too seriously</i> and become ego-attached to the goal, and the same brain response occurs. These extreme examples strongly suggest that it is the <i>perceived threat</i> rather than actual threat that drive our responses, and perception can often be very out of whack with reality and inhibit effective problem solving.<p>For most people in most work challenges, the actual survival threat from obstacles is small. Our brains massively overexaggerate it because we evolved in a context where most problems (especially social ones) actually <i>were</i> life-threatening. I would even say that in cases where survival (or your income) <i>is</i> threatened by an obstacle, downregulating the fear&#x2F;threat response will usually improve your chances of finding a solution. Negative emotions narrow attention, draw us inward and prevent both mental flexibility and engagement with the world, which make solving difficult problems much harder.<p>To summarize: given how much more inherently motivating it is to work on challenges that are <i>similar in nature</i> to the ones we procrastinate on in life, it seems worthwhile to try to downregulate our evolved fear&#x2F;threat response when encountering obstacles.</div><br/><div id="41197645" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41197645" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AndrewKemendo</span><span>|</span><a href="#41197599">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41199707">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41197645">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41197645">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The difference is, in games like DnD the risk is effectively zero because you’re dedicating time and resources to the game for your enrichment<p>In all other cases it’s a challenge that you don’t want, and impedes time and resources for desired enriching activities<p>So the former is growth, the latter is stagnation</div><br/></div></div><div id="41199707" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41199707" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mihaaly</span><span>|</span><a href="#41197599">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41197645">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41197651">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41199707">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41199707">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I am a weird person and for me thinking about the ultimate outcome (death) helps.

It&#x27;ll get done and it&#x27;ll be fine.  It needed done anyway and ultimately now I&#x27;ve been given a side quest by a randomly encounter.  It&#x27;s not exciting but reframing it like this helps reduce my stress and allow me to think about the other stuff while still making sure this gets done.  So good timing on this post!</div><br/><div id="41195269" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41195269" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lainga</span><span>|</span><a href="#41195226">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41195295">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41195269">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41195269">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Do you think it&#x27;s a matter of the task being framed as within vs. without your agency?</div><br/><div id="41195537" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41195537" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chankstein38</span><span>|</span><a href="#41195226">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41195269">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41195295">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41195537">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41195537">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think that makes sense!  Basically something that is forced on me vs something I have chosen to participate in.  It could be argued whether it fits the latter but reframing can be pretty powerful!  I think partially it&#x27;s that I know that it&#x27;s a temporary distraction and that&#x27;s something I&#x27;m used to in quest-based games but ultimately I still manage to get the temporary small distractions done (and typically have more fun with those) while still making progress towards the larger quest&#x2F;goal in this case.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41195295" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41195295" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">readthenotes1</span><span>|</span><a href="#41195226">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41195269">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41195295">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41195295">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had a job once working with bad people and I morphed my day into the dndonline I was using to decompress with at night.<p>Doing the feature work and adding bugs was like breaking barrels to find loot.

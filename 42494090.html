Pete wrote the initial version of a new product, and you joined the team to take over and continue it&#x27;s development. Pete is bona fide genius who can work miracles and he is always in the critical path of each new initiative, you are told.<p>Once you open the lid of this new codebase you discover that this new product is a half baked spaghetti ball of mud that barely works as the demo that it was intended. With no documentation or tests, it takes you a while to even understand what&#x27;s going on. Meanwhile the clock is ticking. It took Pete a mere 2 weeks to write this system, why it is taking you so long to add new features?<p>You try to explain to management the pickle you find yourself in, but to no avail. They fucking love Pete, and won&#x27;t have anyone criticizing him. He has saved their asses in numerous occasions, and why is it always that <i>others</i> are the ones who can&#x27;t keep up with him?<p>So you chug along, paying the price of the mess that Pete made while he keeps moving to even larger initiatives under leadership adoration. He also seems to have a knack to leave ship before his acts catch up with him, and when he decided to leave the job for a promotion and significant raise, management will miss him.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this behavior more than once and it seems too specific to not be intentional. Let me know if you ever met someone like Pete and how you call such people.</div><br/><div id="42499962" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42499962" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RalfWausE</span><span>|</span><a href="#42497002">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42498183">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42499962">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42499962">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh, i know him... it&#x27;s me!<p>I do &quot;computer stuff&quot; as my profession for about 20 years and always for rather small companies.

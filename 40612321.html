They don&#x27;t have a stake in your ego, they won&#x27;t sugarcoat it beyond the veneer of professionalism. You need an editor who is not your friend, too say no to you. No, you shouldn&#x27;t start your book with this clichÃ©. No, you shouldn&#x27;t have your character meandering aimlessly. No, you shouldn&#x27;t use whedonisms. Exceptions apply, of course, but when the editor is your publisher and not your friend, &quot;shouldn&#x27;t&quot; becomes &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;. Usually that involves saying no to 99% of manuscripts coming through the door. And this is how an okay story becomes a great book. Your editor,  having read more books than you in their segment, knows the difference... usually.<p>All manuscripts are at least a little bit bad, some books aren&#x27;t. As you can tell, I&#x27;m no fan of self-publishing, I just don&#x27;t believe anyone can be objective enough with their own baby.<p>Now... I&#x27;ve read my fair share of bad books, especially recently. The publisher&#x2F;editor is to blame 95% of the time. My theory is that being rigorous takes time, which is always in short supply, and skill. I believe people tend not to stay in the same role for too long anymore, lest they lose out financially. Which is totally fair, but skill (and the chutzpah to say &quot;no&quot;) takes a while to develop, years really. And no one has &quot;years&quot; for anything.<p>Except, of course, all the people in the industry who don&#x27;t mind being poor.

The reverse can be true as well. It happens often that the editor tells the author it is a good book, and the publisher allocates resources to marketing it, schedules book tours, etc. while at the same time both the writer&#x27;s agent and the editor&#x2F;publisher expect the book may sell only ~2,000 copies. The target audience are expected to be other writers, a subset of avid literature readers, etc. They don&#x27;t expect it will earn back the advance paid to the author.

It&#x27;s not random, it&#x27;s just the platform working out what profits the company the most.<p>In the case of streaming content for platforms like spotify&#x2F;amazon prime, some content is cheaper for them to offer.  The perfect user is someone who wants low-royalty or completely unencumbered content, because it&#x27;s cheaper for the platform to license, but the end-user sees the same number of ads for the same length of time.  The average user is also someone who can be <i>tricked</i> into being a perfect customer.  Suppose the user is searching for RoboCop, and it is missing from the catalog.  Terminator <i>might</i> be a better recc, but why not just offer the user some shitty CyborgCopIII instead, just to cut your costs and bump your profits, just in case the user is a sucker?  If the user is not a sucker.. great, they&#x27;ll type more searches, engagement is up, and platforms win either way.<p>Think about how much more data FAANG has than say, GoodReads.  GoodReads is small enough that people just rank stuff and it works fine, and people curate lists, and you find what you like that way.

The genre is a LitRPG novel (admittedly a genre I&#x27;d never known existed until reading DCC), heavily doused with comedic elements. Lots of mature themes and references to sex, drugs, politics, and violence, but with some of the allegorical or illustrative critique (to the point of absurdity) you&#x27;d find with Douglas Adams or Terry Pratchett when discussing serious topics with parallels to real life, in an imagined scifi&#x2F;fantasy setting.

Whenever she&#x27;d show up to parties she would bring in a small stack of unpublished manuscripts, we&#x27;d all get into the wine or beer or whatever and start reading particularly terrible passages to each other. Had she sought out especially bad manuscripts? No! She just grabbed whatever was on the &quot;will read, maybe, someday&quot; shelf in the editor&#x27;s work area.<p>I learned about Sturgeon&#x27;s Law (90% of everything is crap) during these events. Most people think what they&#x27;ve written is interesting, or unique, or worth publishing. However, publishers have to make money, so they curate very carefully, edit the hell out of the raw manuscripts, and then only actually commit to publishing what they think there&#x27;s a market for. Nearly zero of the random manuscripts that are sent in by unknown authors ever make it into this funnel, and the honest reason why, at least from what I have personally read, was because most of it was completely terrible -- in as many ways as you can think of terrible to be.<p>Three other thoughts:<p>1. The great videogame crash of &#x27;83 happened because the dominant platforms at the time did not have a lockdown on curation, so anybody and everybody flooded the market with garbage. Consumers decided it was better to not buy anything than to chance spending the equivalent of nearly $200 in 2024 money and get trash.<p>2. A few breakout, self-published, authors are making it through the piles of junk, but they are few and far between. Andy Weir (the Martian) and Hugh Howey (Silo) come to mind. The &quot;secondary&quot; film and TV markets are so starved for good new ideas that their works are getting converted into non-print media almost as fast as they can get sets built and costumes sewed.<p>3. There&#x27;s probably a new market for solid, well known, curators. People who make money sifting the dreck to find the Weirs and Howeys and surfacing the cream to the top. The creators are self-publishing, and the publishing houses aren&#x27;t doing well these days. But the curation function is still wildly important and finding the right way to do it, and the business model around it, is perhaps the future.</div><br/><div id="40614680" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40614680" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">WalterBright</span><span>|</span><a href="#40614592">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40614843">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40614680">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40614680">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The &quot;secondary&quot; film and TV markets are so starved for good new ideas<p>There&#x27;s a long list of very good scifi that has never been made into a movie.<p>Instead, we get the Mandalorean which rehashes every spaghetti western trope.

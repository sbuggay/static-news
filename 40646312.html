The numbers weren&#x27;t making much sense to me, so I looked at the query building tool. I couldn&#x27;t tell for the life of me if a part of the query was doing an inner join or left join. The business analyst who built the dashboard had no idea either.<p>It turned out that it was doing a left join when the intent was an inner join, and the data being shown was an order of magnitude higher than it should have been. This is when I lost all faith in these kinds of  abstraction layers on top of SQL targeting people who don&#x27;t actually know SQL.</div><br/><div id="40648489" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40648489" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">garciasn</span><span>|</span><a href="#40647399">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40655960">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40648489">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40648489">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As someone who leads a Data Engineering and Data Science team and has for 15+ years, this is exactly the problem. Too many folks with access to data who do not understand the data, its relationships, and what the outputs their individual efforts create mean.<p>Decentralized&#x2F;embedded Engineers&#x2F;Scientists; self-service dashboards; low-code BI&#x2F;data tooling; and, now, LLM-driven text to SQL&#x2F;viz lipstick on a pig have been  floated as some of the solves to the problems seen in the analytics space over the 25 years I&#x27;ve worked in the space. Unfortunately, to date, nothing has actually solved the root issue: lack of data understanding and, its end result, trust in the deliverables.<p>But, to your specific point, SQL isn&#x27;t the solve here, either. Too many folks know enough SQL to pull data and use it as they see fit, but too few folks understand the data, its structure&#x2F;schemas, and valid use of those data. THAT requires time, energy, knowledge, and experience in the space. NO TOOLING, other than experience, solves for this--today (note: will LLMs get to a place where they can?

They were cutting the lines out of the green bar report, taping them to another piece of paper, and photocopying it. They were sorting the report by a different criteria.

Although some queries were a bit messy, it made it easier for them to organize their requirements and communicate effectively with the tech team. Unfortunately, it also resulted in a lot of half-baked and unused dashboards, but overall, it brought positive change to the company.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth developing an ETL system just for business people. It requires multiple dedicated devs, whereas writing SQL for dashboards occasionally only takes a few days per month for a single dev.

The challenge is that if everything is locked behind a data analyst then things only move as fast as the data analyst.  If a business person needs some information now, not next quarter, the challenge is managing the queue for the data analyst which devolves into a world of &quot;rush jobs&quot;.  It&#x27;s all the things highlighted by the theory of constraints (The Goal by Goldratt is sooo good).  You can alleviate the DA bottleneck by getting more DAs or you can find ways to help the business users do some of the basic stuff themselves.<p>I wholeheartedly agree that just giving a business user access to the straight database is not ideal for all the issues mentioned - they don&#x27;t know the context and the gotchas in the data combined with probably not understanding how to write SQL.  I think an effective data warehouse strategy with straightforward data marts of materialized views can simplify the interaction and maybe even make it really simple for someone to generate basic visualizations.  A lot of business people can make basic dashboards in Excel which, worst case, could be connected to a data mart.  It&#x27;s not going to handle BIG data but may cover a large number of use cases for most businesses.<p>I&#x27;m in favor of creating some basic dashboards We&#x27;ve also been experimenting with embedding dashboards in internal tools that provide some slice and dice capabilities but with a high level filter.  A user can manipulate and tweak a dashboard for a specific customer but to look at a different customer they need to navigate to it in the internal tools, not via the dashboard.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40649686" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40649686" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">esafak</span><span>|</span><a href="#40647177">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40651059">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40649686">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40649686">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the missing product the author alludes to is the data <i>catalog</i>, to document what the data means, and where it comes from.</div><br/><div id="40649882" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40649882" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zurfer</span><span>|</span><a href="#40649686">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40651059">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40649882">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40649882">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As someone who has build a data catalog tool and is now building one of these looked down on LLM agents(1):
Data catalogs are mostly used by technical people&#x2F;the data team and a handful of power users. Why?

R probably is the quickest with R Studio&#x2F;quarto to produce contents quick, dirty and still nice to see, but it&#x27;s still far from the flexibility of Emacs.

According to this blog, 96% of books (mostly fiction) sell less than 5000 copies per year. For technical books, it may be worse.<p>I&#x27;ve heard that 10k number before. I&#x27;ve also been told by one of my publishers that 2k copies is the break even point for them. While I&#x27;ve had the fortune of three out of four of my prior books selling more than 2k copies (and one selling many, many more), it seems that a significant number of traditionally published programming books do not. And I&#x27;m sure that ratio is even worse for self-published books.<p>In fact, I think the &quot;Reality Check&quot; section of the article is not harsh enough. The author cherry-picked some data on very well selling technical books, which doesn&#x27;t make the point well. The reality is simple: the vast, vast majority of programming books do not sell &quot;well&quot; (let&#x27;s consider &quot;well&quot; 10,000 copies) and many don&#x27;t even break the 2,000 copy barrier, even from traditional publishers.<p>So, what are the economics of technical book writing? Not good. And it&#x27;s only going to get worse as the market gets flooded with LLM-generated garbage.<p>So, do it because you really want to do it for another reason (career, teaching, etc.). Not to make money.</div><br/><div id="40835481" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40835481" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">elric</span><span>|</span><a href="#40831891">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40833547">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40835481">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40835481">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; as the market gets flooded with LLM-generated garbage<p>That&#x27;s already happening, and getting published. Recently read an awful tech book that was obviously generated by an LLM, it was so bad that I reached out to the publisher, who assured me that this was just the author&#x27;s style, and that they promised no LLMs were involved. All lies, of course.<p>Apparently publishing awful books can somehow generate revenue.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40833547" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40833547" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">doe_eyes</span><span>|</span><a href="#40831891">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40835481">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40832288">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40833547">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40833547">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Right. That was my takeaway too. Some of the examples of success stories he gives aren&#x27;t technical at all - they&#x27;re business books. It would be absolutely exceptional for a software engineering book to sell 100k copies. If you&#x27;re writing about a specific technology, selling a thousand would be a pretty typical result. And this happens over the course of years.<p>There&#x27;s just no money in this. There is a small market for authors who can crank out passable technical content serially for series such as &quot;...for Dummies&quot;: if you have ten books generating royalties in parallel, it might be worth your time. But one or two books? Absolutely not, you&#x27;ll make more working a minimum-wage job.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t try, but it&#x27;s basically a hobby for folks who have something to share, and have a daytime job to pay the bills. Plus, yep, the sucky part is that books piracy is widespread, and that even people who benefit from your writing and have the means to pay are just accustomed to sharing bootleg copies for free.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40832288" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40832288" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gumby</span><span>|</span><a href="#40831891">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40833547">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40833112">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40832288">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40832288">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree that a bookshould be written for its intrinsic value, but it&#x27;s possible to have an extrinsic value as well: even if you don&#x27;t sell many it could be a credibility tool for a consulting or (<i>shudder</i>) &#x27;influencer&#x27; campaign.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40833112" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40833112" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">IMSAI8080</span><span>|</span><a href="#40831891">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40832288">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40833428">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40833112">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40833112">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My guess is the average technical book is probably in the hundreds of copies over a reasonable lifetime.

One of these books (Beginning PHP and MySQL) has incredibly reached its 20th year in print[1], and has been translated into a bunch of languages. Many years ago I also wound up editing ~70 or so books for Apress plus a few for Wiley. In summary I know this business pretty well, and still follow it closely despite not having participated in it for several years.<p>My advice is this: if you want to write a book, then write it. But if you do have this sick, twisted desire to spend countless hours writing and editing your work, telling yourself you are an idiot, not good enough, and a horrible writer, then at least do so with the thinking people are going to read it and as a result you will make money. Set yourself up for the possibility of success. How can you do this?<p>* Package the book in different ways (print, print + videos, print + videos + consultation). This has been extraordinarily successful for me personally.<p>* Use the amazing Leanpub.com to do the book production (turn your Markdown into PDF, epub, etc). Not an affiliate or whatever, just mentioning it because you will save untold hours of pain.<p>* If you want to work with a publisher (and in 2024 I don&#x27;t suggest you do), then choose very, very wisely. There are two who I would even consider working with today, and even in those cases I would absolutely not cede the usual rights.<p>Hope this helps,

It&#x27;s been in print for about a year, and was in beta for around 6 months before that. I&#x27;d estimate I spent around 4,500 hours over 5 years writing my book and the royalties so far mean that the value of that time was around $5&#x2F;hour pre-tax. That hourly rate will go up slowly over time until the book stops selling, but it&#x27;s pretty hard to argue that it&#x27;s objectively worth it just for the royalties.<p>My motivation for writing the book was never the money, and I&#x27;ve generally treated the royalties as a nice bonus. I started writing because I cared a lot about the technology, and I wanted to share it with other people. Writing the book was my way of contributing something to a community that I&#x27;d benefited from a lot in my career.<p>In addition to the satisfaction, there have been other benefits I&#x27;ve seen to writing a book. It&#x27;s opened up opportunities for other side income. I&#x27;ve had paid speaking opportunities, and I&#x27;ve been invited as a guest lecturer at a couple of universities and been offered to chance to design and teach a course at a well ranked local university. If I wanted to actively pursue consulting as a side gig I think the reputational gain would help me there as well.<p>Writing a book has also helped me in my career. In a direct way, I think the benefit to my reputation helped me get interviews. The communication and technical writing skills I gained writing a book have also helped me as I&#x27;ve moved into a leadership role. It&#x27;s impossible to know precisely how much writing a book contributed or to put a clear monetary value on that, but I do think it&#x27;s contributed.<p>The other side of this is that, a year after finishing writing on my book I&#x27;m still recovering a bit from the burnout of working so intensely on a side project for so long.

No, they won&#x27;t be rich. Middle class is at most the target, usually under. Live in a third-tier city and have few expenses. You don&#x27;t need to sell very much for a baseline livable state.<p>$10000 a month isn&#x27;t an achievable target for most working artists. $800, on the other hand, is, even without touring. Sell a handful of Bandcamp copies, sell a few physical copies (cassettes are best for this in the current moment, being cheap to produce and having a fairly loyal audience), have your back catalog do well enough on streaming.<p>$800 is enough to live on, if you&#x27;re living with roommates. In many ways, living with $800&#x2F;month and no unfulfilling 40hr job is much better than living with $1800 and an unfulfilling 40hr job. Even if you don&#x27;t want to live with roommates, it cuts the amount of work for an employer you have to do by a great deal. Working low-skill work is soul-crushing.<p>For authors, from what I understand, this baseline is even more achievable. If you have no hopes of getting rich, the current copyright system is fine.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

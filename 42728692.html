I am telling this story second-hand, but I&#x27;ll try to get it correct. While in Albania, my dad shared a taxi with an older Albania gentleman. The man recounted his time working in the Albanian military in the 60s. His platoon had constructed a large number of bunkers, more than any other platoon. The dictator Enver Hoxha was slated to visit, to give them an award for building the most bunkers in the whole country. When Enver arrived, he walked around, and looked at a bunch of the bunkers they had constructed. He pointed at the bunkers. &quot;Look! You have not used enough rebar! Obviously, you are trying to jeopardize the security of our nation, by neglecting to use enough rebar! You are traitors to Albania!&quot; He swiftly sentenced the entire platoon of young men straight to 30 years in prison, which they approximately served. This man, after serving this time, had just gotten freed from jail.

The toponymy is strangely Albanian, like even the name of the Romanian capital &quot;Bucharest&quot; means &quot;beautiful is&quot; in Albanian.</div><br/><div id="42766294" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42766294" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ImageLonging</span><span>|</span><a href="#42765611">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42766172">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42766294">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42766294">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your post is sadly an example of the pop-sci history that circulates in Romania,* and it is out of sync with the considerable advances made in Albanian historical linguistics in recent decades. The evidence is overwhelming that Albanian originates from the Central Balkans. While Albanian does show signs of belonging to a Balkan Indo-European subgroup deep in prehistory, it is not closely related to Thracian – Matzinger’s 2012 paper “Zur herkunft des Albanischen: Argumente gegen die thrakische Hypothese” in the Ismajli Festschrift conveniently sets out why.<p>While Romanian <i>bucur</i> ‘happy’ and Albanian <i>bukur</i> ‘beautiful’ are indeed regarded as shared lexicon of disputed etymology, <i>București</i> (Bucharest) does not mean ‘beautiful is’ in Albanian: <i>-ești</i> is a common toponym-forming suffix in Romanian. It’s certainly not related to the Albanian copula, which is <i>âshtë</i> with a nasal vowel both historically and in many dialects still today (standard Albanian <i>është</i> is based on the Tosk variety that lost nasal vowels a few centuries ago).<p>* (For HN readers unaware of Balkan quarrels, a cornerstone of Romanian nationalism is the idea that the Romanians are descendants of a Romanized population in Dacia who remained behind when the province was lost to the Roman Empire. This would, crucially, allow the Romanians to have been in Transylvania before the Hungarians, longtime rivals for that land, arrived in 896 CE. That Romanian and Albanian share lexical material from the early first millennium is awkward for that view – many linguists internationally have concluded that the Romanian language was brought to modern day Romania from somewhere across the Danube. Romanian pop-sci, in order to save the Dacian continuity theory, therefore often makes the claim that the Albanians came from the territory of Romania.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="42766172" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42766172" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mathieuh</span><span>|</span><a href="#42765611">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42766294">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42765293">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42766172">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42766172">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Unique how?

Albanians are some of the nicest people you will meet and are very friendly. Pretty much every stereotype you may have heard about them is wrong (except that they love Mercedes, that is 100% real). The country is beautiful with mountains in the North to beaches in the south that are pretty much the same as Greece and Italy (though rocky), with 3 Star Hotels for tens of Euros per night (they use a currency called Lek which is ~100:1 euro).<p>Everyone in the country seemingly knows each other and they are all like one big family. You&#x27;ll notice things differ from other European countries in that they don&#x27;t like lock up chairs from cafes, or have big like metal gates at bars and open air restuarnts. After hours everything is just like wide open its kind of wild to see. No one locks car doors, there is almost no petty crime, women will get up from the table to go smoke a cigarette outside and leave their purse at the table, etc...<p>The Albanian language is unique as well, look up a language tree and you&#x27;ll see its the only one on its branch, they call it Shqip (and never Albanian, which was very confusing to me at first). Though nearly all of the young people speak English, and a good amount up to middle age, but not the much older people... One thing you would never know either is how much Albanians love America especially relative to how much Americans know about Albania.<p>Albanians have a deep gratitude to Americans because for 2000+ years they were stuck between the Roman and Ottoman Empires and had been fighting to protect their territory and keep their culture alive. But after the Ottoman Empire fell and WW1 was over they were occupied by Italy and others, and the &quot;Great Powers&quot; were about to carve up their territory. But at the League of Nations in 1919, Woodrow Wilson intervened and made sure they had a sovereign state.<p>So back to the bunkers finally, after WWII Albania was allied with the Stalinist communists and Enver Hoxha (who they call the &quot;Dictator&quot;), became increasingly paranoid about invasion from all sides including the Russians and NATO, so he started building these 700,000 bunkers. Some of them are small enough for only a couple of people, and whats crazy is where we are up in the mountains, you see just very small ones up a hill and in random spots. Later on, Hoxa allied with Chinese communists to keep Russia out, and then it stayed a closed country until the early 1990s, which explains a lot about why everyone feels treats each other like family and most outsiders don&#x27;t know really know about Albania...Some people compare them to being a North Korea of Europe, though I don&#x27;t like this description, but they were isolated and had to become self-dependent including growing nearly all of their own food etc.<p>But again, it is an amzing place that welcomes foreign tourists, especially Americans. I first traveled there at the end of 2020, during peak pandemic winter, and on the travel map of places you could go, it was one of the only countries that was Green and accepting Americans...<p>Okay that&#x27;s a lot of fun facts about Albania.

Then there was a 100m no man&#x27;s land, then a Welcome to Albania sign that was full of bullet holes, and a table of Albanian border guards drinking and playing cards. Super friendly guys.<p>We walked about 5km into the local town, passing tons of these bunkers. Nearly every single car and truck that passed us was a Mercedes, except for the police cars which were tiny battered Fiats.<p>Can confirm the people we met were incredibly friendly, and the place felt very welcoming and nothing happened to make me feel unsafe.<p>However, I have heard some crazy stories from another friend who travelled there more extensively that make me think, while it&#x27;s a relatively safe country as a tourist, it won&#x27;t be uneventful if you stay there a while, especially if you get off the normal tourist track.<p>Given that most of the stereotypes I&#x27;d heard about Albania up to that point were &quot;bunkers, lawlessness, and Mercedes but lovely people&quot;, I&#x27;d say that it absolutely did live up to these.

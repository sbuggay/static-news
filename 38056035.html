The answer hasn&#x27;t really changed, fundamentally there is nothing you can buy that will give you rapid access other than a working computer and todays storage technology and it will need replacing and redundency. You need to budget to constantly move to new machines and storage technology and often you only have a 5 years to move off some technologies after they go obsolete.<p>The file formats are a bit stickier. The further you stray from basic text the less time the format tends to last and then you have the potential additional cost of developing a format conversion tool as well.<p>I see the appeal of this if its got sufficient access speed there are a bunch of organisations that will see value in keeping data archived permanently safe. But the problem of binary formats over the long term will persist and I am not sure there is much we can do about that. &quot;Project Silica&quot; will also become an obsolete storage medium as well, I don&#x27;t think this changes the fundamentals.<p>I would be happier if they were talking about a zip drive like thing so we could all have this rather than a cloud service.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38056441" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38056441" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PeterStuer</span><span>|</span><a href="#38056853">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38056253">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38056441">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38056441">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m a bit turned off by the &quot;humanity&#x27;s needs&quot; for storage in this article, where humanity would probably be more respected in an environment where longer term storage would be scarcer and curated.

Yes, MS is of course a for-profit company, but the long-term storage situation in academia alone is dire. I know from experience that most research data at my university exist as a single copy on a single external hard drive in a drawer (with a partial disorganised copy currently in processing on a laptop drive somewhere). This may be anything from the only records of a now dead language, or medical research data. Add to this that many seem to &quot;forget&quot; their data when it has been published on. Archiving is a contract with future generations and we are horribly prepared. The storage medium of the rosetta stone, handily beats the flimsy, digital solutions the vast majority use. Or did I completely misunderstand your point?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38056253" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38056253" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mitthrowaway2</span><span>|</span><a href="#38056441">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38056253">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38056253">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is this different than the quartz long-term data storage developed by Hitachi?</div><br/><div id="38056418" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38056418" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tmikaeld</span><span>|</span><a href="#38056253">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38056418">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38056418">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s not much known on the Hitachi project and there&#x27;s not been any news since it was first mentioned in 2012.<p>However, project silica is also using Quartz glass.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

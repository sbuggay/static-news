It&#x27;s the nash equilibrium strategy <i>assuming</i> the other players are also playing a nash equilibrium strategy. As soon as one player deviates from the nash equilibrium it&#x27;s not optimal anymore :).<p>It&#x27;s interesting how this affects play. If a player is bluffing slightly less than they should be, the adjustment is drastic, you should actually never call with hands that do not beat their value hands. If they are bluffing optimally, you are supposed to call using what is known as &quot;minimum defense frequency&quot;. What&#x27;s interesting about this is the minimum defense frequency is based on what the strongest hands you can possibly have in that situation are and the opponents possible hands do not even factor into it. It&#x27;s required to prevent your opponent from bluffing with any two cards profitably.<p>To do the math, if you are on the river and the opponent bets 100 into 100, for this to be profitable for them they need to win 50% of the time or more. If your opponent is bluffing optimally, you need to call with 50% of the strongest hands you have in that specific situation (if you don&#x27;t know what hands you have in a specific situation that&#x27;s a problem) and sometimes they can be dogshit like King high.<p>But, very important to note, very few players actually bluff enough and if they bluff less than they should you should only ever call when your hand actually beats their range of possible value hands. (value vs bluff is kind of a difficult thing to communicate, generally it&#x27;s value if you want your opponent to call)<p>Most players don&#x27;t bluff enough as a result of most players calling too much! When they call too much you should obviously not bluff!

MDF is purely a formula based on pot size and the bet size (pot size &#x2F; pot size + bet size). The fact that it doesn&#x27;t consider various ranges is why it&#x27;s not really useful - it was a simplified formula used to try to understand the game before solvers existed.<p>There are situations where your opponent can bet any two cards profitably and you do have to fold - imagine they bet the size of the pot, but have the better hand 99% of the time, you&#x27;re simply forced to let them bluff the 1% of the time they&#x27;re bluffing.

You would typically lock it to play as you suspect your opponent plays. This lets the solver calculate the optimal exploitative solution against your specific oppoents.<p>Piosolver, the first public solver and the one mentioned in the article, has this feature.<p>However, what often happens is if you lock one node, then several other nodes in the game tree over-adjust in drastic ways, forcing you to lock all of the, which may be infeasiable. As a result, Piosolver recently introduced &quot;incentives&quot;, which gives a player in the game an additional incentive to take a certain action . For example, you may suspect your opponent calls too much and doesn&#x27;t raise enough, so you can just set that incentive and it will include that in its math equations and give you something similar to an exploitative solution with a much simpler UX.<p>This feature was literally just introduced a few months ago so it&#x27;s still very much an active area of research, both for game theory nerds, and people trying to use the game theory nerd research to make money !</div><br/></div></div><div id="41002528" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41002528" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bubblyworld</span><span>|</span><a href="#41001981">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41002139">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41002713">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41002528">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41002528">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, this exists!

It&#x27;s very popular as a format but it only really works because there&#x27;s a culture of trying to match power levels between decks (to be fair, there&#x27;s also the fact that 100 card singleton does tend to mean it&#x27;s hard to be completely consistent, so there&#x27;s a lot more &#x27;bleedover&#x27; between power levels in terms of chance to win in a given match, as well as the &gt;2 player aspect levelling things out as a player obviously in the lead will tend to be ganged up on)</div><br/></div></div><div id="41002295" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41002295" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ip26</span><span>|</span><a href="#41002235">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41003078">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41003617">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41002295">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41002295">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you’re going to play MTG as a simple game theory optimal affair, might as well switch to poker… a Nash equilibrium surely exists all the same, but charm of the game is in the variety and checks &amp; balances.</div><br/><div id="41003015" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41003015" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rcxdude</span><span>|</span><a href="#41002235">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41002295">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41003617">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41003015">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41003015">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well, from the perspective of optimal play the more complex and changing nature of MTG means that optimal play is harder to find and doesn&#x27;t stay still, so there&#x27;s a lot more metagame of figuring out what that play is.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41003617" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41003617" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">willcipriano</span><span>|</span><a href="#41002235">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41002295">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41001960">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41003617">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41003617">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">EDH is the variant of the game for people who aren&#x27;t that competitive.

And when people say they &quot;play GTO&quot; they usually mean &quot;equilibrium&quot; rather than &quot;optimal against my specific opponents&quot; which is &quot;exploitative&quot;.<p>If you actually watch what the top players advocate for, everyone suggests you want to play exploitatively. However, there&#x27;s one equilibrium solution and effectively infinite exploitative solutions, so equilibrium is a reasonble starting point to develop a baseline understanding of the mechanics of the game. It&#x27;s tough to know how much &quot;too much&quot; bluffing is unless you know a baseline.<p>Furthermore, if you &quot;exploit&quot; people by definition you are opening yourself up to being exploited so you need to be very careful your assumptions are true.<p>Also, with solvers like piosolver, you can &quot;node lock&quot; (tell a node in the game tree to play like your opponent, rather than an equilibrium way plays),  but there&#x27;s many pitfalls, such as the solver adjusting in very unnatural ways on other nodes to adjust, and it being impractical to &quot;lock&quot; a strategy every node in the tree. There&#x27;s new ideas called &quot;incentives&quot; which gives the solver an &quot;incentive&quot; to play more like a human would (e.g. calling too much) but these are new ideas still being actively explored.<p>Rock paper scissors is frequently used to explain GTO but it&#x27;s not the best example because equilibrium in rock paper scissors will break even against all opponents, but equilibrium poker strategy will actually beat most human poker players, albeit not as much as a maximally exploitative one.<p>There&#x27;s two other huge pieces this article glosses over:<p>1) It&#x27;s as impossible for a human to play like a computer in poker as in chess - in fact far more impossible, because in poker you need to implement mixed strategies. In chess there&#x27;s usually a best move, but in poker the optimal solution often involves doing something 30% of the time and something else 70% of the time. The problem is that, not only are there too many situations to memorize all the solutions, but actually implementing the correct frequencies is impossible for a human. Some players like to use &quot;randomizers&quot; like dice at the table, or looking at a clock, but I find that somewhat silly since it still so unlikely you are anywhere near equilbrium.<p>2) Reading someone&#x27;s &quot;tells&quot; live is still a thing. While solvers have led to online poker to decline due to widespread &quot;real time assistance&quot;, live poker is booming (the 2024 World Series of Poker Main Event just broke the record yet again) , and in person in live poker, people still give off various information about their hand via body language. From the 70s to the early 2000s, people were somewhat obsessed with &quot;tells&quot; as a way to win at poker. Since computers have advanced so much, it&#x27;s fallen out of favor, but the truth is, both are useful. It&#x27;s totally mistaken to think that advancement in poker AI , GTO , and solvers have rendered live reads obsolete. In fact, in 2023, Tom Dwan won the biggest pot in televised poker history (3.1 million) and credited a live read to his decision, in a spot where the solver would randomize between a call and a fold.</div><br/><div id="41002406" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41002406" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">isatty</span><span>|</span><a href="#41002121">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41002406">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41002406">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Very nice!

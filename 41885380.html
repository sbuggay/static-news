It&#x27;s not a literal &quot;copy&quot; of the original material - it&#x27;s my own original text, but obviously a <i>derivative work</i> of the original material.

Not that the AI has a literal copy of the source material in its training data, but that the training data can be used to produce a derivative work.<p>I could write a (crappy) fanfic of the Lord of the Rings without directly referencing the books&#x2F;movies.

We went round and round in circles for a while because of issues similar to what you&#x27;re describing. I ran a small 4-6 person hardware team (softly blurry on the edges) and the new people wanted significant amounts of design and documentation review as well as financial oversight. We needed $40 worth of solder and connectors and had to wait a week for PO approval as well as demonstrate that we had gotten multiple quotes... even though there was just a store down the block that sold exactly what we needed.<p>Anyway, after a month or two of this I started catching significant flak because my team was nowhere near as productive as it used to be. Complaining about slow POs was met with &quot;maybe you should plan better&quot;. Complaining about design reviews for one-off boards that would go from idea-to-problem solved was met with &quot;you&#x27;re engineers, you need to document your work&quot;. It was painful and I came very close to resigning.<p>What ultimately worked, though, was figuring out a catch phrase that spoke the language of the new people: &quot;accountability without authority&quot;. This ruffled some feathers but once I repeated &quot;you are trying to hold me accountable for delivering a $500,000 project on time but are not giving me authority to buy $40 worth of stuff to execute on that&quot; enough times it finally got through and the system started to change.

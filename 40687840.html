I did not know this.<p>Obviously the title and opening sentence aren’t meant to be taken literally or absolutely despite being phrased that way, since the author had sales before discovering FOMO as a strategy, and also since these statements aren’t true for all products. I can buy that FOMO helps sell a newsletter subscription where it’s hard to communicate value in the first place, and people are used to newsletters being free. FOMO isn’t what drives McDonald’s or gasoline or breakfast cereal though. Most things I purchase aren’t based on FOMO, but maybe a few optional things are here and there.<p>I found the “ads eww” comment to be funny when what the author has discovered is an advertising technique, and one of the very techniques that earns and engenders the ‘eww’. Manipulating people works, but people don’t like knowing they’re being manipulated, especially if claims about missing out or about scarcity are inauthentic.</div><br/><div id="40699062" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40699062" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">schneems</span><span>|</span><a href="#40698668">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40703372">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40699062">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40699062">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I sold a book (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;howtoopensource.dev&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;howtoopensource.dev&#x2F;</a>) and did a *very* soft launch which performed so poorly I spent the next 6-9months building out full blown launch strategy.<p>FOMO is used a lot as the term du-jour but it goes deeper than that: a sense of urgency. We relate FOMO to urgency because a lot of FOMO happens around events (missing a concert or conference, for example) but to me the key isn’t the fear, it’s the urgency.<p>For my eventual launch I read a book aptly titled “Launch” which talks at length about building a sense of urgency, turning the sale into an event, and generating excitement. I offered a limited time, exclusive incentive with a hard deadline and it worked very well. That hits the fear and the urgency.<p>From Kent:<p>&gt; How can I communicate what the company is missing out on<p>While framed as FOMO, to me it’s good old value-proposition marketing. The book I linked above recommends focusing on a customer “transformation” story. Try to get potential customers to imagine what life would be like if ONLY they had your product. From this lens the FOMO is fear of missing out on being your best&#x2F;better self.<p>This part of my launch was really difficult. I wanted to talk about what the book teaches, how it stacks up against other books, why my petagogy is useful. It didn’t seem like my book would “turn a coder into a contributor” (by itself). But that’s exactly the outcome I wanted, and it’s the outcome my customers wanted.

Exactly, the value <i>proposition</i> is stating what you think the value is to the consumer, and when it aligns with what they really value then sales occur. The author made a clear distinction saying, “I naively assumed that people transacted when value exceeded price. I blindly pursued adding more value to this newsletter.” He’s talking about value from his own perspective rather than value from the customer’s perspective, like you did with listing the subjects and teaching methods in your book.<p>I’ve made the same mistake trying to add what I think is valuable and talk about what I think is valuable, and have it lead to low sales, so I know from experience that good marketing is necessary and that good marketing can be difficult for engineers to learn, and that building it does not mean that they will come and buy it. Part of what I’m saying is you have to really understand the eww of advertising, why it’s there, where it comes from, and how to use it properly, and you have to be careful and figure out what the difference is between showing someone the value and lying to them, because sometimes the line is very gray and&#x2F;or very thin.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40701746" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40701746" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">HWR_14</span><span>|</span><a href="#40698668">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40699062">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40699820">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40703372">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40701746">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40701746">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; It didn’t seem like my book would “turn a coder into a contributor” (by itself).

You emotionally manipulate the buyer to make the sale, the buyer regrets buying it within a day or two, and it doesn&#x27;t matter because they will never talk to you again anyway.<p>FOMO is a horrible strategy when you expect to develop a long-term relationship with your customers.

This includes self-respecting, loyal, repeat customers of quality brands. Conversely, very few people are spiteful enough to go through the trouble of switching to a competitor purely out of disdain for FOMO being used as a sales tactic.<p>A couple examples:<p>- The New York Times has 10 million paying subscribers for online content. A tremendous number. Many of their sales pages feature countdown timers and phrases like &quot;Time is running out&quot; and &quot;Offer won&#x27;t last.&quot;<p>- Pretty much any clothing brand. For example, rare Nike shoe drops. People are willing to spend hundreds of dollars, wake up at ridiculous hours, and stand in line for hours, for FOMO-driven clothing sales.

Though I don&#x27;t have schizophrenia, I <i>had</i> social anxiety and general anxiety for many years.<p>One example of how this mindset worked for me is probably best demonstrated by my experience with sleep paralysis. My anxiety kept me tossing and turning in bed, and I would eventually fall unconscious due to exhaustion - triggering sleep paralysis. I of course developed fear of sleep paralysis and thus going to bed made me anxious... cue vicious cycle.<p>How did I break the cycle? I had to develop a joy for sleep paralysis. A genuine interest and joy for that experience. Once I started to look forward to it, the vicious cycle was broken and I no longer got sleep paralysis. It was the ultimate reframe. I psyched myself out.<p>I eventually started to apply that same principal to other anxieties and insecurities and things just started to melt away.<p>A vicious cycle of sleep paralysis is pit of hell though. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39023504" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39023504" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ITB</span><span>|</span><a href="#39023582">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39023863">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39023504">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39023504">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It appears this person&#x27;s high intelligence helped them cope with an otherwise very hard to treat condition.</div><br/><div id="39023572" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39023572" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">h0l0cube</span><span>|</span><a href="#39023504">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39023863">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39023572">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39023572">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">More equanimity than intelligence, and probably more epistemic humility than &#x27;intellectual humility&#x27;<p>&gt; It is not important to know where the voices are coming from.

I was left with a newfound respect and sympathy for people who must go through life with that always and not just as a temporary burden.<p>And even in that short period, as the author describes there was quickly a balancing act to the psychosis. I pictured it as a series of multi-axis sliders where as my brain would wander more towards delusions of grandeur so too came delusions of paranoia (if you&#x27;re important, then you are important enough to persecute - if you aren&#x27;t important, then paranoia is more easily dismissed). There&#x27;s a zen quality to managing a brain that varies and wanders far outside the boundaries of the norm. Though it can only be controlled or reasoned with to a moderate degree and ends up largely a practice of staying on the board riding the wave than dictating the ebb and flow of the sea.<p>I was very grateful when it subsided and I was able to identify the culprit, and my heart goes out to the people who don&#x27;t have an off switch to toggle. 0&#x2F;5 stars - would not recommend.</div><br/><div id="39024652" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39024652" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Loic</span><span>|</span><a href="#39023863">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39024112">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39024652">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39024652">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I am happy for you that you were able to go out of the THC induced schizophrenia.

One is THC inducing actual schizophrenia. Less than that is a schizo affective episode. And less than that is something I&#x27;ve been increasingly suspecting is taking place as dispensaries move to THC only strains and breed out the CBD of just broadly disassociative thinking. I&#x27;ve noticed an increase in some wild conspiratorial thinking among people I know that regularly use THC sans CBD which isn&#x27;t a full blown psychotic episode, but is distinctly unsettling.<p>So yes, I agree that I was fortunate. But like with most things, it&#x27;s a nuanced gradient and not an absolute dichotomy.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39024112" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39024112" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kakayako</span><span>|</span><a href="#39023863">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39024112">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39024112">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tugulu.games&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tugulu.games&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

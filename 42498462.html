Honestly creative interpretation of PDF documents is possibly one of the best use cases of AI that I’ve ever heard of.<p>While a lot about PDF has changed over the years the basic standard was created to optimize for printing. It’s as if we started with GIF and added support to build interactive websites from GIFs. At its core, a PDF is just a representation of shapes on a page, and we added metadata that would hopefully identify glyphs, accessible alternative content, and smarter text&#x2F;line selection, but it can fall apart if the PDF author is careless, malicious or didn’t expect certain content.

I think there&#x27;s a big opportunity in proving that multimodal LLM can reliably generate these artifacts from other sources. It&#x27;s not the LLM actually being a decision support tool itself (though that may well be promising), but rather the ability to generate standardized CDS artifacts in a highly scalable, repeatable way.<p>Happy to talk to anyone about any of these ideas - I started exactly where OP was.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42499857" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42499857" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">joshz404</span><span>|</span><a href="#42498885">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42499086">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42499857">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42499857">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You might be interested in checking out the WHO SMART Guidelines.

They&#x27;re only slightly more machine-readable than binary executables.<p>I hate, hate, hate, hate, <i>hate</i> the practice of using PDFs as a system of record. They are intended to be a print format for ensuring consistent typesetting and formatting. For that, I have no quarrel. But so much of the world economy is based on taking text, docx (XML), spreadsheets, or even <i>CSV</i> files, rendering them out as PDFs, and then emailing them around or storing them in databases. They&#x27;ve gone from being simply a view layer to infecting the model layer.<p>PDFs are a step better than passing around screenshots of text as images - when they don&#x27;t literally consist of a single image, that is. But even for reasonably-well-behaved, mostly-text PDFs, finding things like &quot;headers&quot; and &quot;sections&quot; in the average case is dependent on a huge pile of heuristics about spacing and font size conventions. None of that semantic structure exists, it&#x27;s just individual characters with X-Y coordinates. (My favorite thing to do with people starting to work with PDFs is to tell them that the files don&#x27;t usually contain any whitespace characters, and then watch the horror slowly dawn as they contemplate the implications.) (And yes, I know that PDF&#x2F;A theoretically exists, but it&#x27;s not reliably used, and certainly won&#x27;t exist on any file produced more than a couple years ago.)<p>Now, with multi-modal LLMs and OCR reaching near-human levels, we can finally... attempt to infer structured data back out from them. So many megawatt-hours wasted in undoing what was just done. Structure to unstructure to structure again. Why, why, why.<p>As for universality... I mean, sure, they&#x27;re better than some proprietary format that can only be decrypted or parsed by one old rickety piece of software that has to run in Win95 compatibility mode. But they&#x27;re not better than JSON or XML if the source of truth is structured, and they&#x27;re not better than Markdown or - again - XML if the source is mostly text. And there are always warts that aren&#x27;t fully supported depending on your viewer.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42499210" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42499210" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sswatson</span><span>|</span><a href="#42499034">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42499531">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42498888">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42499210">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42499210">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They’re only machine-readable in the very weak sense that all computer files are machine-readable.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42500131" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42500131" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hulitu</span><span>|</span><a href="#42498923">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42500131">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42500131">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; With properly structured data, machines should be able to interpret the guidelines.<p>Yeah, right.

I honestly think it would, especially given that there seems to be a fairly reasonable consensus online that the franchise peaked in the past for a lot of players - some people say the GBA titles, some say the DS ones, etc. I know personally that I play the old DS, GBA and GameCube titles for a lot of Nintendo franchises more than their current Switch releases.<p>And with regard to making it cross-platform &amp; available on mobile, Nintendo has always controlled their platforms aggressively. They&#x27;ve never released games on other console platforms other than their own, and their mobile push has been deliberately very conservative (even moreso than other companies with retro libraries like Square Enix, Sega, etc). Plus especially with their handheld lineup, the DS and the 3DS are tricky to do emulated releases for - with the combination of built in touch screens, dual displays, etc.<p>But I also think that mobile gaming is a poor fit for most of Nintendo&#x27;s library - unless you&#x27;re expecting players to buy physical controls for their phones, I can&#x27;t imagine playing eg Super Mario World is going to be very fun with touch screen button overlays.<p>Selling their own hardware still works for Nintendo, it&#x27;s still profitable and it gives them control they&#x27;d cede if they released elsewhere. They&#x27;d have to pay platform fees, go through someone else&#x27;s certification processes, etc. They have some of the most recognisable IP in gaming (and with Pokemon etc, one of the most recognisable bits of IP in the world), so they have the market power to pull people to buy their hardware too.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41763790" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41763790" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">FMecha</span><span>|</span><a href="#41762896">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41763004">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41763104">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41763500">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41763790">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41763790">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Emulation is legal.<p>For now.<p>This is just baby steps to Nintendo weaseling themselves into Supreme Court to get Sony v.

My recent Wii U video was taken down and I received a second copyright strike, even though this showcase video was no different than all of the tech demos and reviews I have made on this channel previously. I am still considering a counter claim under fair use, as the video was for educational use, transformative in nature, and had no effect on the market -- it was a demonstration of a console no longer for sale (even the Wii U eShop is closed, so the company itself has no means of earning revenue from Wii U sales). However, I am reluctant to open that can of worms with a multi-billion dollar corporation, as their next step would be to file legal action.<p>At the very least this means I am going to change how I approach future videos. I will no longer show any Nintendo games on-screen, which is a shame because I love using those games for my hardware demonstrations. I don&#x27;t know how that will play out when it comes to showing things like ESDE frontend themes that contain Nintendo characters, but for now I am going to focus on actual gameplay. I am also going through the videos I am working on and blurring out any Nintendo game content as a precaution, even innocuous content like NES games. Unfortunately this is going to delay some video releases -- my latest video should be up right now, but instead I have to re-edit and re-upload the video first.<p>I know this is disappointing news, but with now two strikes on my channel, I don&#x27;t really have any other choice except to adjust accordingly.

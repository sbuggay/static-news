It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.<p>When I started my PhD program, a group of us were given a little talk by the department secretary.<p>She told the story of how she went to audition for Jeopardy!, a trivia game show.  She saw a whole bunch of other people at the audition get really nervous and choke up; her take on it was that they were used to being the most knowledgable in the room -- they were used to sitting in front of the TV screen with their friends or family and knowing every fact, and when they were suddenly confronted with a situation where <i>everyone</i> was as knowledgable as they were, they were suddenly very intimidated.<p>She, on the other hand, was completely relaxed -- she spent her days working with Nobel prize winners and loads of other people for whom she had no doubt were smarter than her.  Being confronted with loads of people smarter than her was a daily experience.<p>She told this story to us to say, a lot of you will experience the same thing: You were used to being the smartest person in your High School, you were even used to being the smartest person in your classes at the prestigious university you attended.  Now you&#x27;ll encounter a situation where <i>everyone</i> is like you: the best and most driven people in your classes.<p>You&#x27;ll feel stupid and inferior for a bit, and that&#x27;s normal.  Don&#x27;t let it bother you.  Eventually you&#x27;ll notice while that most of these other people have areas where they&#x27;re better than you, they have areas where you&#x27;re better.  And there will still be the occasional person who seems better than you at everything: that&#x27;s OK too.  You&#x27;re not the best at everything, and you don&#x27;t have to be.</div><br/><div id="41573397" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41573397" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tombert</span><span>|</span><a href="#41567683">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41568518">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41573397">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41573397">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For every job I&#x27;ve ever had, I&#x27;ve been the &quot;math and functional programming nerd&quot;, where I know lots of tricks in Haskell and F# and even concurrency theory within Java.

Calling it stupid is a cheeky glass-half-empty framing. But one of the big problems with math education is that we force students to struggle to a far greater degree than other subjects, under a <i>belief</i> that personal struggle, the âtryingâ, is the only way to truly get it. This is a pervasive cultural belief that extends to work and money too. And we force it from the beginning when kids are very young, without taking the time to develop their curiosity, and without setting up the system to gracefully nudge people who for whatever reason donât see <i>why</i> they should try so hard.<p>Personally I suspect there are lots of things that could help motivate many more students than we do using our current system of demanding kids âtryâ to grok abstract rules using Greek letters. A combination of more visual storytelling, math history, and physical less abstract problems, along with a grading and progression system that ensures kids get it before moving to topics that depend on having got it might help a lot of people; too often kids are pushed to progress without ensuring theyâre ready, and once that happens, âtryingâ is a fairly unreasonable expectation.<p>Think about how you learned your first language. Your mom taught it to you by rote repetition. She didnât expect you to come to any of it on your own, and you werenât expected to struggle with grammar or understand the rules or judged for getting them wrong, you were just gently corrected when wrong and celebrated when right.

I must be stupid!&quot; I&#x27;ve heard this over and over again in a wide variety of contexts. Including from my own children.

And pretty much universally have also developed coping mechanisms for it. But the experience itself is pretty much universal. My son felt it in middle school when he was struggling with long-division.<p>Now does a poor education system make this experience more likely? Does it serve us poorly? Absolutely! I consider it a crime that Singapore has developed a better way of teaching elementary math, and we have not adopted it. Singapore is now moving to #1 across different subjects according to PISA, and Western education systems aren&#x27;t even curious about how.<p>However that is orthogonal to the key point here.

In fact, I found that often the <i>better</i> and more didactically streamlined the exposition is in a book, the less deeply I end up learning the material. It is precisely the personal struggle, having to make my own sketches and derivations, starting out with a misconception because of bad phrasing in the book and having to explore that misconception until I find what I misunderstood etc. makes the knowledge stick much better because it now feels my own, like an intimate friend.<p>Spoonfeeding may get people quicker to the point of solving the standardized quiz at the end of the chapter but that&#x27;s not the same as learning and understanding.

Research is a continuous spectrum. We are expecting kids in elementary, secondary, and early college to have a research mentality and research level motivation in order to succeed in math classes, unlike some other subjects. (Classes which, btw, were all research topics at some point in time and took tens, hundreds, even thousands of years to develop.) The mentality and motivation are important if you want to end up doing any of the actual graduate, post-graduate, or career research where nobody knows the right answer. The kids who are pruned out by our math system never make it there, and many donât even make it to functional math literacy, even though many&#x2F;most are perfectly capable, and thatâs unfortunate and doesnât reflect well on our education system.

How common would you think a complete self-study of martial arts actually is? I&#x27;ve always thought this cannot be done alone -- or, it would be extremely easy to get lost or head to some wrong direction, eventually harming yourself mentally or physically. Akin to how a common suggestion about yoga or meditation (I used to exercise vipassana daily for quite a while) is that the first, basic principles should be taught by a good master. Possibly due to personality type, I&#x27;ve always wanted to challenge this assumption, though.<p>While learning martial arts on your own, what did you do to overcome more serious mental blocks or standstills (provided you had any)? Did you ever feel that &quot;books are not enough&quot;?</div><br/><div id="41574747" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41574747" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rramadass</span><span>|</span><a href="#41566945">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41570402">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41569089">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41574747">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41574747">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Looking back, that self-study of Martial Arts has been the single most defining time period (I did this in the late 80s to early 90s in India) of my Life and has directly led to my Physical Health, Self-Confidence, Self-Reliance, Mental Fortitude and Persistence in the face of hardships today, all of which are fundamental to Life. I did the above along with a study of Yoga and to this day maintain a large collection of books (of Yoga&#x2F;Martial Arts&#x2F;Ayurveda&#x2F;Siddha&#x2F;TCM&#x2F;Qigong&#x2F;Acupuncture) dealing with both Physical Techniques and Mental Aspects&#x2F;Theory behind them.<p>The key aspects in learning were Overwhelming Drive (the motivation was to learn to fight like Bruce Lee :-), daily practice of basic blocks&#x2F;punches&#x2F;kicks, slowly progressing through the movements of the shadow-boxing&#x2F;Kata routines given in the books and no self-questioning&#x2F;self-doubt&#x2F;no-comparing with anybody else. I also had a good friend who was also very interested in Martial Arts (he eventually joined a Shotokan Karate school) and so we would practice&#x2F;encourage each other. One defining lucky moment was coming across E.J.Harrison&#x27;s &quot;The Manual of Karate&quot; (which was a translation of a Japanese text) where the author explicitly states Karate is useless without makiwara style training&#x2F;conditioning. I took that to heart and made a canvas pillow with coconut-matting, tied that to a tree (a small one which could vibrate and absorb your hits) and would train with full power on it. This worked so well that my basic punches&#x2F;kicks became more powerful than my Shotokan-training friend who only did non-contact practice. To this day i can generate very good power relative to my size. Reading Gichin Funakoshi&#x27;s &quot;Karate-Do : My way of Life&quot; was also instrumental where he mentions his two teachers and their instructions; Master Azato would tell him to think of his limbs as swords so that he went through his opponents and Master Itosu would tell him to harden&#x2F;condition his body so that he could absorb any blow. Next it was Miyamoto Musashi&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot; which led me to studying Martial Arts mindset&#x2F;strategy&#x2F;theory and validated my approach since he was also largely self-taught in many disciplines (the concept of &quot;Hyoho&#x2F;Heiho&quot; acquired in the study of one discipline is internalized and then used to study other disciplines effectively&#x2F;effortlessly).<p>Today you have far more resources and avenues open to study Martial Arts but the main points i mentioned above must be kept in mind even though many teachers may not teach you those. As mentioned in the quote above, Mastery is always dependent on &quot;one&#x27;s own incessant self-cultivation&quot;.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41569089" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41569089" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mbivert</span><span>|</span><a href="#41566945">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41567665">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41570402">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41577242">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41569089">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41569089">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>[...] my Rebbe was the geologist of the soul.

I&#x27;d say &quot;Well, this sounds like DNS, it&#x27;s like a phone book...&quot; or &quot;That&#x27;s an APIPA address, it must not be getting DHCP. The computer shouts out to the network asking for an address...&quot; and so forth. However, he kept asking the same questions.<p>After a few months in one of our monthly meetings he kind of broke &quot;I don&#x27;t understand what I&#x27;m doing out there, you need to train me! I need to be trained!&quot; Completely perplexed I asked him what he was talking about. &quot;You just answer my questions, but you&#x27;re not <i>training</i> me!&quot; I realized he was expecting me to <i>learn him</i> the answers to everything. I had to explain to him that the responsibility of learning was actually on him. &quot;This isn&#x27;t school, there&#x27;s no study guide. We have documentation and Google.

He felt like he was failing because he didn&#x27;t know all the answers and said that he looked back at himself a year ago and couldn&#x27;t believe what he was doing now and how far he&#x27;d come. &quot;I had no idea what an IP address <i>was</i> but now I understand how the packets move through the switches, request an address...&quot; etc.<p>We both ended up quitting and going our separate ways as the IT department there was an absolute shitshow.

Say, after decades of teaching, an exceptional teacher is not going to be able to (in general) report their methods in terms of the explicit accounts of methods as established in books. These are highly varied anyway, and full of rival theories.<p>Indeed, a person who could give such a count is most likely to be a poor teacher by comparison: since all their labour has been in the creation of these accounts, not in teaching (or far less).<p>You cannot do both. You cannot both acquire a vast depth of expertise that grounds good judgement (risk&#x2F;reward, problems that arise in practice, context-sensitive question, intuitions for failure&#x2F;sucess, etc.) -- <i>and</i> develop baroque accounts of that knowledge (its origins, remembering which papers you read, remembering all your projects, all the theories developed by academics, their history, and so on).<p>If knowledge is only, as academics say, just their own sort of accounting -- then one would feel stupid all the time.

The first project I worked on professionally felt vast compared to anything I&#x27;d seen in school.  At first I was embarrassed to be new, to have to ask questions, to have to deal with solving problems in areas I didn&#x27;t fully understand.  It took months and months to &quot;come up to speed&quot;, and I felt that I was drowning in complexity and unqualified for the work I was doing.  Ultimately I came to understand that this is the normal state of engineering, especially when innovation is happening.  The bulk of the work in engineering (not all of it, but the vast majority, especially in software) is fully understanding the problem space, the tradeoffs between alternative paths, understanding how your solution holds up and fixing bugs.  In short, once you&#x27;ve gotten all your questions answered and finally feel fully qualified and no longer ignorant, you&#x27;ve also solved the problem you were working on.  Time to move on to the next thing.<p>When I realized that, I realized that feeling dumb was actually <i>normal</i>, and that I should embrace it and expect to spend the majority of my career in that state.  Not only did this dissolve my embarrassment, but it made me seek out ways to thrive in uncertainty and chaos -- which skills have been to my advantage for many years.<p>It is uncomfortable to admit you don&#x27;t know things, or you don&#x27;t know the best way to proceed, or you don&#x27;t understand something.  The temptation is to downplay that, to pretend you understand, to retreat toward the things you understand well.  But poking at the unknown is how you get smarter, and ultimately how you solve problems.

In my view, you should not feel stupid in either situations, and the teacher should try to ward you against this feeling.<p>For the first type, I argue it&#x27;s simply the resistance to a new mental model. The article&#x27;s example of epsilon-delta language is a perfect example. It&#x27;s a new way of thinking that takes time (and it did historically) to sink in. Competing on how fast you grasp this new concept is stupid. When the new mode of thinking becomes natural, it won&#x27;t care how long you took to adapt to it.<p>For the second type, it&#x27;s simply an impossible standard to reliably have eureka moments. Clearly, smarter people will have more of these than the average people, but no one can do this reliably. On the other hand, while it takes more work for us mortals to have these insights than a genius, there are plenty of ways to get there that don&#x27;t require a super high IQ.

Hmm ...!<p>The article for this thread has:<p>&quot;First, I don&#x27;t think students are made to
understand how hard it is to do research.&quot;<p>Well, from my career and Ph.D., I found
something different:<p>(1) In pure math, read some of the best
materials, look for unanswered questions,
and pick and try to answer one of those.<p>Took me 2 weeks.  Paper got accepted in
the best journal in the field.<p>(2) Applied Math.  In practice, outside of
math, see a need, problem, weaknesses in
what is known&#x2F;done, pick, and try to
answer.<p>Another few weeks, then submitted to a
journal and got published right away, no
revisions.<p>(3) Engineering.  In some real situation
with some big, i.e., expensive, activity,
see where a lot of money is being spent,
pick, attack, maybe solve, and write it
up.<p>Most of the work was done an airplane
flight, and the results became
dissertation in an engineering school.<p>One device:  Pick some advanced topic in
math, e.g., &#x27;tightness&#x27; in probability
theory, and use that as a tool to get some
new results on the problem picked.  There
are problems where such a tool could be
used but is poorly known by people
concerned with the problem.<p>More difficult problems:<p>For the work in (1)-(3), still waiting for
a check.<p>Problems:<p>(A) Getting hired for such work.<p>(B) When do get hired, get paid enough to
buy a house and support a family.<p>Lessons:<p>(i) For academics, never saw where the
professor got paid enough to buy a house
and support a family.<p>(ii) For business, if do get hired and
paid and are doing good work, then maybe,
still, are not paid enough to buy a house
and support a family.  But the owners of
the business are making more money from
the good work than they are paying.<p>So, maybe start a business, do some good
work key to the success of the business,
and keep all the earnings for yourself.<p>Looking around, it appears that the people
who make enough to buy a house and support
a family own a successful business,
although maybe just a successful LLC
(limited liability corporation -- a
relatively simple business type) as a
physician, lawyer, tax expert, etc.<p>So, in simple terms, start a business,
e.g., initially as just an LLC, and
continue with hard work, good ideas, good
insight, until have a successful business,
and then sell it.  Uh, if the money was
from successful &#x27;pesonal services&#x27;, e.g.,
law, medicine, then may not have anything
to &quot;sell&quot;.<p>These days the Internet may provide some
good opportunities.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41568911" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41568911" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rhelz</span><span>|</span><a href="#41573722">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41567371">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41568911">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41568911">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We don&#x27;t really have a good name for the emotion that this article describes as &quot;feeling Stupid&quot;.<p>You know what it feels like to be stupid?

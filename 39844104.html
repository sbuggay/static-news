Note that this handful persons I am referring to _also_ accept criticism and correct their understanding when new information ia given to them: they are not dogmatic jerks.

But he lessened the stigma of being relieved by transferring them to other commands, still at flag rank.  Several commanders early in &#x27;42 were removed from commanding infantry divisions, but were given commands of units in combat support or material support or training where they went on to deliver stellar service.  So it was like finding the right guy (and it definitely was a guy back in those days) for the right job.<p>This is in contrast to continental armies with aristocratic baggage who found it difficult to fire flag grade commanders (looking at you, monty.)<p>But the political risk to his own career was enormous and the only way he got away with it was with the full support of FDR and his reputation earned partially as Pershing&#x27;s Chief of Staff in WWI.<p>He is also the only person in the US Army to be considered for the rank of Field Marshall, mostly because FDR thought it would be funny to have Field Marshal Marshall.<p>Which is to say... you might be able to cheat the Peter Principal, but the amount of effort seems great and you would have to work very hard to sooth the egos of those demoted or reframe the demotion as a lateral xfer.</div><br/><div id="39848076" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39848076" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ranger207</span><span>|</span><a href="#39847428">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39847900">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39848076">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39848076">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s interesting reading about WWII generals because they&#x27;re so well-studied it&#x27;s relatively easy to notice patterns about them. One is that there were a few different types based on what they were good at. Patton was a good tactician and (mostly) beloved by his men; Eisenhower was a logistician with little experience actually commanding but he got along with everyone; Nimitz was good at delegating (aka finding the right man for the job); etc. A lot of leadership stuff is universal, but then a lot of it is also dependent on what&#x27;s needed for the job, and a person&#x27;s skills and leadership patterns may not be exactly what&#x27;s needed for the job. The Peter Principle is that if you do a good job you get promoted, as you get promoted it gets harder, eventually you reach a point where your skills aren&#x27;t enough to overcome the next level of difficulty increase.

They found that these companies tended to promote employees to a management position based on their performance in their previous position, rather than based on managerial potential. Consistent with the Peter principle, the researchers found that high performing sales employees were likelier to be promoted, and that they were likelier to perform poorly as managers, leading to considerable costs to the businesses.[15][16][2]&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="39848308" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39848308" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bowsamic</span><span>|</span><a href="#39847938">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39848295">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39847313">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39848308">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39848308">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; This book was meant as satire, and the fact that so many people take it as fact is honestly quite concerning.<p>The article says it was satire but it also says it was based on their real research.

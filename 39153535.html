Everyone is different. We&#x27;re all motivated by different things, and you have to account for that as a manager. Some people <i>are</i> motivated by lofty goals and values statements that companies write. Linking their work to a value statement the company has written definitely  works. Other people just laugh if you try it.<p>The lesson is that universal statements like this are wrong. The mission just doesn&#x27;t motivate everyone.<p>That said, I&#x27;m fairly sure the Asana one is trolling.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39153885" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39153885" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">or_am_i</span><span>|</span><a href="#39153878">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39153803">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39153885">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39153885">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Do you think there might be more functions to a mission other than to motivate employees with some grand narrative? Perhaps it could serve as a basis for alignment, potentially helping to write strategies, set goals and sometimes even take day-to-day decisions on all levels? I have certainly seen mission statements that are useful in this sense, not just on a company level, but on a level of platforms and individual teams. Personally, I find it much easier to work towards explicitly stated common goals.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39153803" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39153803" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Freedom5093</span><span>|</span><a href="#39153885">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39153818">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39153803">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39153803">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The whole concept is pretty stupid, rooted in a silly assumption; that a grand, noble mission is essential to motivate employees.<p>I am motivated by an important mission, in fact, but I am more motivated by having ongoing impact on that mission (making a difference). I work in defence, so you&#x27;d think there&#x27;s a lot of opportunity to keep people safe, help leaders make better decisions, etc. So far from my perspective, these companies are not very motivated or successful at solving the missions they boldly claim. As a result, I am motivated to leave these places, that lie or are incompetent at solving these missions.<p>For example, a defence company says they want to &quot;serve our democracies&quot;, but they hardly have any users. Another defence company has been building product for 4 years, yet has 0 users over that time. Then there are other, defence companies with unicorn valuation with also very cool marketing, but very little impact in ongoing crisis. All the mentioned companies have very good publicity, it&#x27;s not until you work for them you realise they have 0 impact. There is no reason to change their ways, because they can continue to sign more contracts with gov (tens of millions, hundreds of millions).<p>All you see publicly is cool tens&#x2F;hundreds of million investment or contracts, cool movie like drone shots, &quot;AI&quot;, cool drones, explosions, jets and good music. You don&#x27;t get to see the 0 impact. Or worryingly, negative impact when these things don&#x27;t work.<p>I&#x27;ve been working in defence-tech startups for more than 2 years.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39153818" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39153818" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Animats</span><span>|</span><a href="#39153803">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39153783">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39153818">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39153818">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;A computer on every desk, running Microsoft software&quot; - early Microsoft mission statement.

At this point, the proprietary companies then start enshittifying the software (look at Photoshop, now a cloud-based program) to try to extract more money from users, and to keep users on the upgrade treadmill.  Part of this is probably from the way corporate politics work: when you&#x27;re a manager with a team in place, you need something to keep that team busy, to justify your team&#x27;s continued employment to upper management, so when you run out of useful improvements to make, you invent less-than-useful &quot;improvements&quot; (e.g., ugly new UIs).<p>This is where FOSS seems to be able to do well: it doesn&#x27;t need to waste resources on useless improvements (we&#x27;ll ignore GNOME for a moment as an exception), and can just focus on delivering the necessary functionality.  Once that&#x27;s done, it can just go into maintenance mode and people can move on to other projects.

Or look at PCB design: Altium seems to be the standard here still, despite Kicad having made huge advances and by most accounts being as good or even better.  It took <i>decades</i> (Kicad started in 1992) for the FOSS alternatives here to really catch on much, and only really because PCBs became cheap enough for hobbyists to design and construct their own (mainly because of Chinese PCB companies), and because CERN contributed some resources.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the deal is with engineers hating collaboratively-developed and freely-available software, but it&#x27;s a real thing in my experience.

But when you compare it with SolidWorks, OnShape or SolidEdge, there&#x27;s clearly a huge gap in usability and capability which needs closing before a lot of people will be able to consider it seriously.  I&#x27;m sure it will eventually get there, like KiCAD did, but it will take many years and a lot of investment to get the usability, polish and featureset up to parity.  It looks like Ondsel did a really good job to make some progress along that path.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42170588" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42170588" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">15155</span><span>|</span><a href="#42170406">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42170536">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42170658">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42170583">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42170588">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42170588">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Altium seems to be the standard here still<p>Apple and NVIDIA are using Allegro (or customized versions thereof.)<p>&gt; or even better<p>KiCad is faster, absolutely not better.<p>&gt; very expensive<p>Vivado is free for a great number of devices (not just the &quot;lite&quot; version, either, depending on the board - U50, U55, etc.)<p>No open source tooling can even remotely compare in ASIC implementation flow or FPGA implementation.</div><br/><div id="42170683" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42170683" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shiroiushi</span><span>|</span><a href="#42170406">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42170588">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42170668">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42170683">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42170683">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;KiCad is faster, absolutely not better.<p>Not what I&#x27;ve heard, and CERN seems to think it&#x27;s good enough for their particle colliders.<p>&gt;No open source tooling can even remotely compare in ASIC implementation flow or FPGA implementation.<p>Yes, FPGA tools are a very different matter.  I do wonder if this is really lock-in from vendors more than any preference by users, but still, sufficiently motivated users could reverse-engineer things to try to make a single open-source toolset that works with all vendors&#x27; FPGAs.  Of course, the feasibility of this is questionable, but we&#x27;ve seen really impressive reverse-engineering efforts in other places in FOSS.

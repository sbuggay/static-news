Military kids will grow up moving from base to base, but the schools around bases are fundamentally different. Those are schools where teachers are used to student turnover, and the students are as well. OP talked about kids that were in a more nomadic situation, where they could only form brief &lt;1mo friendships. The local culture of these communities is also used to and adapted somewhat to this.<p>That sounds like childhood trauma to me, the closest analog might not be military children but the foster care system. Not a 100% analog, since presumably the OP&#x27;s cousins kids didn&#x27;t have the pre-existing trauma that entry into that system necessitates, but that is the closest conventional analog I can think of.

We&#x27;re talking easily the upper 4% of income as a junior, eventually going up to 2% or 1% as you gain seniority.<p>The reason is, there are some skills which are highly in demand, and few people are strong in those skills. In particular, I am thinking of HPC engineering and cloud computing infrastructure engineering. Companies and institutions own large server fleets, we&#x27;re talking hundreds or thousands of servers. They want whatever is running on those fleets to have high performance, security, and zero downtime.<p>This kind of work requires strong Linux systems administration and programming skills, an understanding of enterprise networking and storage technologies, confidence with at least one orchestration stack such as OpenStack or Kubernetes, and strong CI&#x2F;CD and IaC skills (look up GitOps.)

2) You don&#x27;t need every skill the employer is asking for.  What you need are the major skills the job requires and the ability to pickup the rest on the job.
3) Only apply for jobs where you are a good fit.
4) While job hunting, spend time each day learning a new skill.  It can be a programming language, a technology, or something interesting.
5) Once you get a job, save lots of money.  It helps you make it through lean times and sets you up for a nice retirement.<p>One last thing.  If your depression does not let up after 6 months, I strongly recommend seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist.  I wish you luck.

The amount is highly dependent on your situation and risk comfort level and can be argued back and forth but not having any puts you at the mercy of whatever your employer&#x2F;manager decides. Or even you getting sick and unable to work for a while. And even if the former doesn&#x27;t happen, the latter definitely will at some point.<p>Though I am reading some of these comments and wondering why they&#x27;d call losing a job an end-of-the-world scenario. I&#x27;ve always thought people on this forum are the type of working professionals that could afford to put away a few hundred dollars a month even if they&#x27;re not on SV wages. Mind you, I am not talking about an amount of money to allow you to retire but just enough to get you going for a few months until you can figure something out. Even if married and with children. That just changes the math a little bit but not the approach.

Some small rural communities have been falling in population and are eager for new people -- sooooo, land for the house might not be too much.<p>Be sure to have cell phone and Internet access and be not too far from a Walmart, a hospital, and, maybe, auto repair.  In the US can get nice weather, usually not too hot or cold or too wet or dry, in the East at the latitude of, say, Kentucky.<p>In Maryland, Virginia, and DC, there is lots of Federal Civil Service employment, and the hiring is not based much on &quot;who you know&quot; but what you can do, education, experience.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42345124" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42345124" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">huqedato</span><span>|</span><a href="#42347981">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42344566">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42345124">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42345124">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A very valuable lesson for me.

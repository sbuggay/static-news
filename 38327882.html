Note that the government is there mostly to keep the capitalist system running.  In an anarchistic society, for example, there would probably be no government, and they would therefore not need any software.<p>Capitalism is built around a concept of private ownership, and as such, the author of a work is reasonably free to use their work as they see fit.  That allows for something like open source software to exist and not, for instance, be stolen or destroyed by others.<p>Also, I think we are far away from collectivism, because typically only very, very, few people actually work on software, let alone open source software.<p>Finally, capitalist companies <i>use</i> open source software a lot.  It is just a very efficient way of dealing with software, and a great way to make profit, because production costs are terribly low.<p>Not defending capitalism here, just saying that it is slightly more involved, as always.</div><br/><div id="38330594" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38330594" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jmyeet</span><span>|</span><a href="#38330280">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38330501">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38330445">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38330594">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38330594">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Actually &quot;open source&quot;, as we know it, can only exist in a capitalist framework.<p>That&#x27;s not true at all. For one, there are more alternatives to capitalism than anarchy. Second, there are more users of open soruce than governments. Third, even though open source projects do have licenses and we have a legal system that enforces intellectual property, we&#x27;ve had very few court cases related to open source licenses because it&#x27;s largely unnecessary. There&#x27;s really no one to sue or be sued in an economically viable fashion. There&#x27;s been very few cases.

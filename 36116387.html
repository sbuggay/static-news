Decentraland, Voxels, and Horizon look like video games from 1990. There are people running around saying this can&#x27;t be done. They&#x27;re wrong.<p>I&#x27;ve written a metaverse client that yields GTA V graphics quality and frame rate for a big virtual world. Talks to Open Simulator and Second Life servers. A small number of users are testing it. It&#x27;s a long way from feature complete, but the graphics part is working nicely. Users need a midrange gamer PC (NVidia 1060 or better, at least 6 CPUs). This is a reasonably difficult problem, but it&#x27;s not impossible.<p>Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic, says that the 600 million people using game virtual worlds should hold an online wake for the metaverse. He means Fortnite and Roblox users.
The metaverse is alive and well for gamers. But it&#x27;s not headed for Facebook&#x2F;Twitter scale.<p>So what went wrong? The NFT clown car, and Zuckerberg, went wrong.<p>The NFT guys are all Make Money Fast. Most of them never even shipped a virtual world.
That didn&#x27;t stop them from collecting money from suckers. Slowly, at the rate of about one every few weeks, the SEC is bringing the hammer down on those guys.[1]
The ones who shipped something just slapped something together and called it a metaverse. If you haven&#x27;t visited Decentraland, check it out. It&#x27;s 1990s graphics quality. It&#x27;s also empty; it runs about 260 concurrent users.<p>The whole Meta fiasco, and its motivations, has been covered elsewhere.<p>So what are the real problems?<p>First, the metaverse is boring. If you build a good virtual world, it&#x27;s about as interesting as real life. Most forms of entertainment have an interesting event density about 10x to 100x that of real life. Metaverses don&#x27;t. You have to make your own fun. Second Life has this problem. It&#x27;s fun for people who
are into building, creating, and exploring. It&#x27;s not fun for people who want to be passively entertained. This limits the market.<p>The game-derived metaverses, Fortnite and Roblox, are games with social areas on the side. Fortnite discovered that by accident. Their game has rounds of play, and you have to wait for the next cycle to start. So they have a &quot;lobby&quot;. People hanging out in the lobby to socialize became a thing, and they built on that to allow users to have social spaces.<p>Second, there are technical problems. Metaverses need to look as good and play as well as AAA title games. This is quite possible, but not on a $99 WalMart laptop or a phone. &quot;Cloud rendering&quot;, as with
Google Stadia (closed), Vortex (closed), and NVidia GeForce Now (still around but the price keeps going up) is an option, but the economics don&#x27;t work out. Nobody can do free to play with cloud rendering. 
Metaverses on a current gamer PC can work quite well, but most people don&#x27;t have those.<p>Third, there&#x27;s the VR nausea problem. If you put people in a VR environment where they can move freely but the visual world is not rigidly locked to the real world at all times, about 5% - 15% of the population becomes nauseated. VRchat shows that there&#x27;s a market for this anyway, but it&#x27;s about 22,000 concurrent users. The only real stat in this business is how many people are logged on right now, measured from outside the system. All other numbers can be &quot;adjusted&quot;.<p>Fourth, there&#x27;s really no role for &quot;brands&quot; in the metaverse. Despite all the hype, no real world brand has had any significant success in the metaverse. These are game worlds. A branch of Sotheby&#x27;s or Hermes does not make sense. Also, showing fashion items in worlds with crap graphics just devalues the brand.<p>So, it&#x27;s a niche. Right now, there are seven games on Steam with over 100,000 users logged in. 
That&#x27;s probably the size of the metaverse market.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sec.gov&#x2F;spotlight&#x2F;cybersecurity-enforcement-actions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sec.gov&#x2F;spotlight&#x2F;cybersecurity-enforcement-acti...</a></div><br/><div id="36121161" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36121161" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crazygringo</span><span>|</span><a href="#36117635">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36120434">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36121161">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36121161">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>Decentraland, Voxels, and Horizon look like video games from 1990.

People happily play mobile games all day long that are nowhere near AAA, and they use social media too. There&#x27;s zero indication at all that graphics quality is the problem. People adore Minecraft and that&#x27;s not exactly known for its AAA graphics.</div><br/><div id="36121989" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36121989" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Animats</span><span>|</span><a href="#36117635">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36121161">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36121638">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36121989">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36121989">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Obviously anyone can achieve GTA V quality if you&#x27;re powering it with a gaming PC, just by basing it on Unreal Engine.<p>Unreal and Unity do much preprocessing and optimization of game content. All that takes place long before the game runs. Much of the smarts in Unreal Engine resides in Unreal Engine Editor, not the runtime. A metaverse client which displays dynamic user-created content from many creators doesn&#x27;t have the benefit of that pre-optimization. There&#x27;s not much instancing. Some content is badly optimized, has too much detail, oversized textures, or errors. You can&#x27;t pre-bake lighting or shadows.<p>A metaverse client thus has most of the problems of an MMO client and some of the problems of a web client (browser). 
Games are normally pre-tuned so that the client does not face these problems.
For a fully dynamic metaverse, content overload is the normal case, and frame rate has to be 
maintained independent of content changes. Think of what happens when you doom-scroll a web page. It&#x27;s like that, but in 3D.<p>(There&#x27;s a class of limited metaverse which works like a game level loader. Users build a game level, the level is loaded during a long preload period, and then you can use it. Sinespace, Breakroom, High Fidelity, VRchat, and to some extent Decentraland are in that category. You build your parcel offline, then upload, but you can change some object transforms in world and move things around.
This allows some offline optimization. Clients for these systems are close to standard MMO clients.
Dynamic stuff is tied to the frame cycle.)<p>Unreal could probably make their system into a metaverse-in-a-box product, with some functions that now run in the editor running on servers or as background tasks in the client. So far, they haven&#x27;t done that, although Sweeney has talked about it.</div><br/><div id="36122055" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36122055" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dale_glass</span><span>|</span><a href="#36117635">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36121989">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36121638">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36122055">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36122055">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">High Fidelity isn&#x27;t loading pre-baked levels.

And create the &quot;environment&quot; that one gets when you are actually at such a stadium.<p>One of the challenges is that physics does a lot of work for you, so people across the field from you talking aren&#x27;t just as loud as the people behind you talking. What&#x27;s more, everyone in such an event would want &quot;good seats&quot; but at a real event there are people all over the stadium.<p>You <i>could</i> select people in groups of 50 and put them into the same &quot;box&quot; of good seats, and if you built a spanning tree overlay different people &quot;near&quot; each other, but it is kind of like the 3 color map problem in that you&#x27;re mapping 50,000 people (probably in two groups of 25,000 for &quot;home&quot; and &quot;away&quot; teams) where they can &quot;hear&quot; the people around them cheering&#x2F;talking&#x2F;Etc. Dave felt faces were impossible although these days you could train an AI model using a webcam and taking pictures of your upper body and face from different angles and have the model then generate your faces of the people &quot;around&quot; you.<p>Annunciation and site lines are pretty straight forward renders, but the actual event (assuming it was really being played by real people) would require a combination of rendering and motion capture from the real event.<p>The amount of network traffic going back and for in n^3 to the number of people &quot;near&quot; you as they form a neighbor volume.<p>And that is just an event where you are a passive spectator.<p>World of Warcraft instance servers would do dungeon raids of 40 players (in vanilla I don&#x27;t know if they do that any more) and their challenge was data base updates for damage dealt, damage done, and environmental changes. Of course most of the play field is fixed for that very reason but a more realistic one that was deformable would require more physics again. We got that with the Phys-X engine and others in the early 2000&#x27;s but they have yet to be able to spew what they are modelling to the other players so that everyone has the same view of what is going on around them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36118060" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36118060" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tiedieconderoga</span><span>|</span><a href="#36117635">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36122522">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36121544">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36118060">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36118060">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Fourth, there&#x27;s really no role for &quot;brands&quot; in the metaverse.

Instead of instantly starting up and pausing if you get interrupted, you have to get the headset off and on. You can&#x27;t pay attention, even slightly, to anything else while using a headset. That means no keeping an eye on children or animals. Using VR with a strong eye prescription is still a dilemma between a difficult adjustment or ordering very expensive custom lenses that also make it harder for anybody else to use the headset.

So why are we still using it? Phrases like virtual worlds or immersive worlds convey the same meaning but lack the stigma of the original term. 
&gt; And these are arguably better descriptors. According to one 2022 study of U.S. consumers, only 16% of people understand and can explain the metaverse. By contrast, anyone can understand the meaning of “virtual world.” You don’t really need to explain anything. For most tech-literate people, they get it.<p>I politely disagree. The metaverse is not (just) a virtual world. It&#x27;s not just &quot;the internet in VR&quot; either.<p>A virtual world is just a single &quot;verse&quot;. Only once you have many (connected) virtual worlds, you get a &quot;multiverse&quot;. They key here is, that you can travel between these different virtual worlds, using one single avatar, one single client - and should be able to carry certain attributes and items with you, from one virtual world to the other.<p>To turn a &quot;multiverse&quot; into a &quot;metaverse&quot; you need to add in the real world as well. There has to be some amount of connection between those virtual worlds and the real world, with both sides influencing each other.<p>Just like the internet allows you to use one single browser (of your choice) to visit all kinds of different sites, connected through links. And using social logins, you are able to carry your identity (your user account) with you across multiple different sites.

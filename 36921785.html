Therefore I imagine &#x27;geniuses&#x27; are made when the cultural conditions are ripe for people to sit around listening to each other and trying to improve. That is, the culture of the listeners than the nature of the speaker.<p>It is conspicuous how little time human society puts in to identifying and then learning from its most capable members.

Persian invasion for Athens, Spanish Armada for England, etc.), that were
2) mastered (Battle of Marathon, defeat of the Armada)
3) but left underlying problems unresolved<p>So, there would be incredibly motivation for these societies to try and address these problems, and perhaps some additional measure of confidence that problems could be mastered. And, in periods of existential crisis, normal patterns start to break down and new modes of expression and organization, new perspectives, etc. can start to manifest.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting that the essay calls out that<p>&gt; all three’s florescences were ended by right-wing revolutions (the Rule of the 400, Savonarola, and Cromwell).<p>as these responses are often prompted by some perception of chaos&#x2F;lack of &#x27;order&#x27; in a society - a breaking down of accustomed patterns.<p>So, in the spirit of the goal as stated by the essay:<p>&gt; We want explanations that make sense, and which can be corroborated by specific historical research.<p>I would say: look for genius where there is also social turmoil and crisis - where there was a belief within a society that it may not be able to survive the problems that faced it, or where it experienced such rapid change that within a generation or two the previous assumptions about how the society worked and what was and wasn&#x27;t acceptable&#x2F;normal came into question - and you might find geniuses there.<p>And it would probably be a good idea to have a concrete, sensible definition of genius that we all agree on.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36924501" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36924501" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tycho-newman</span><span>|</span><a href="#36928506">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36928989">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36924501">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36924501">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The most important question we can ask of historians is “Why are some periods and places so astonishingly more productive than the rest?”<p>Why is this an important question?

On the other hand, as you are pointing out - Banks appears to be writing quite explicitly from the perspective that &quot;genius&quot; and &quot;productivity&quot; (in the sense of creative, scientific, technological, etc. advances) are obviously GOOD and IMPORTANT. And, there seems to be a strong current of &quot;if we knew what served as the &#x27;fertile silt&#x27; for these ... &#x27;Cambrian explosions&#x27; of creativity &#x2F; science &#x2F; tech... we could use this knowledge to foster the appropriate conditions and better harness our magnificent human potential.&quot;<p>Now, granted, I&#x27;m obviously purposefully cherry picking (to a degree) from a large enough essay AND &quot;putting words in his mouth&quot; (hyperbolic, comparatively) to a degree that I&#x27;m almost certainly glossing over language that&#x27;s more nuanced and judicious, say. Nevertheless, I&#x27;m somewhat surprised at ... his surprise, the rosy cast of the whole thing, and, I think the quite incomplete nature of his analysis of the data and information that IS available.<p>Further, I outright disagree with any premise that &quot;genius&quot; is straightforwardly or simply &quot;net positive&quot;. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a need to bring the subjective into it, per se. And, much like discoveries and advances in &quot;nuclear chemistry &#x2F; physics&quot; (providing a particularly stark example, IMO - nuclear&#x2F;radiological weapons &#x2F; nuclear energy of various types, medicine, etc.), most of this is &quot;neutral&quot;, at best.

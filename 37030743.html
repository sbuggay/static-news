&gt; This is self-explanatory. Usually I start off a review to someone who I don’t know yet with a simple “Hi ” in the first comment. If you spot something missing, don’t express this with a statement such as, “This is incomplete”, but rather, ask: “Is there a reason why this is missing?”<p>I chalk this up to cultural differences, but to me questions like this appear from avoidant to interrogatory. Questions are good when you genuinely don&#x27;t know something and are asking for help in reviewing.<p>Anyway, I got a lot of mileage out of the phrase &quot;you can...&quot;, e.g.<p>You <i>can</i> use &lt;language feature&gt; here like this: [...]<p>You <i>can</i> get the same result with this: [...] (typically an idiomatic one-liner)<p>etc.<p>I find people are more receptive to suggestions if they&#x27;re given a choice in the matter. They better explain it though - which is also what usually happens.<p>If there&#x27;s an issue I write something among the lines of &quot;To prevent X errors, use Y.&quot; to make it obvious that this isn&#x27;t just my taste.<p>The Suggested Change feature is very useful and usually doesn&#x27;t require additional commentary - especially for one liners.<p>Also: nothing beats a call review, especially if you don&#x27;t know the person.<p>&gt; Attention to detail
&gt; Try to balance between important and not-so-important changes (experience will guide you). We don’t want to block an important feature or production bug because of a spacing issue!<p>Create a ticket if it&#x27;s warranted, assign priority and move on.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37045622" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37045622" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">imrehg</span><span>|</span><a href="#37046232">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37045912">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37045622">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37045622">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I haven&#x27;t been at a place yet where pair programming is so common or frequent that code reviews are not necessary, so it&#x27;s definitely a very useful skill. I also see that many people indeed take it as burden or hoops to jump through, rather than an inherently useful exercise, as the article outlines it.<p>Mentioned in the &quot;What&quot; section is the matching of the stated goal of the PR with the reality: so rare to find anyone who puts any effort into writing good PR messages (not to mention good commit messages, but that&#x27;s for another time). Linking to tickets, explaining the rationale, most other context is just skipped because being assumed (or assumed to be communicated through some other channels). Less than ideal.<p>In general the &quot;what you put in is what you get out&quot; applies very well both for writing good changes and PRs as well as good reviews. Applying similar principles as the author listed, I have a lot of good feedback from people that the comments in reviews helped them improve and occasions for rare actionable feedback on technical know-how.</div><br/><div id="37046201" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37046201" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">glenjamin</span><span>|</span><a href="#37045622">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37046008">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37046201">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37046201">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The purpose of pair programming and the purpose of code review are not quite the same.<p>Pair programming is a high-context activity where two programmers collaborate closely on building something.<p>Code review is a tool to simulate looking at code that you haven&#x27;t just worked on with high-context, and seeks to assess whether it is understandable to someone in that position.

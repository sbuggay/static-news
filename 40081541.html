I picked up a Classical Mechanics book to get back into the swing of things and of course it went through some basic linear algebra. It’s been a while since I’ve thought about the dot product of two vectors.<p>You know what blew me away though? Not one textbook I looked in mentioned “why” the dot product is important; that is it’s useful for determining the similarity of two vectors. They all focused on the mechanical details of computing the dot product, but never spelled out the reason it can be useful. I went through a few other resources before I broke down and had a little chat with ChatGPT to discuss the meaning behind it and it makes perfect sense after that.<p>In comparison to when I was in college, things are much slower paced so I can take the time I need to ensure I have a full grasp of a concept before moving forward. I guess all of this is to say that as I’ve continued forward through more concepts I keep finding that the books I’m reading offer a mechanical view instead of a holistic view of the material. This feels like the biggest issue with most math books I’ve read and it makes me wonder where books that offer more semantic meaning of concepts instead of recipes exist.</div><br/><div id="40084619" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40084619" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Nevermark</span><span>|</span><a href="#40083883">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40083943">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40084619">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40084619">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In high school trigonometry I am sure I was clear that sine and cosine formed the circle. How could I not?<p>But that fact’s significance and too obvious simplicity, with all its ramifications,  only hit me deeply and profoundly when a year later I realized I could use those functions to draw a circle on a screen.<p>Before that they were abstractions related to other abstractions that I had to memorize to pass a course.<p>To this day I am frustrated when reading papers about abstract algebraic relations and other such concepts, without even a sentence or two discussing any intuitive way to think about them. Just their symbolic relations.<p>I appreciate that in the game of math that view becomes natural. But most of us learn math with additional motivations and are interested in any perspective that highlights potential usefulness or connection to the real world. Many of us mentally organize our knowledge teleologically.<p>Yet even when usefulness is known to exist, it is often neither mentioned or referenced.

But it&#x27;s hard to do, especially in dead tree format.<p>To get someone understand something holistically, as in link to their previous knowledge base, requires knowledge of what their knowledge base is. Traditionally this has been done with structuring the teaching with prerequisites etc and hoping it works.<p>I struggle with this quite a bit when I teach students with heterogeneous background. To be effective, one has to first probe what the students already knows to be able to relate the new stuff to that, and this requires interaction. Hypertext is&#x2F;would be helpful for self-learning, but it&#x27;s sadly very underutilized. LLMs may be better. But probably even those can&#x27;t at least in the current form replace interactive human teaching as they don&#x27;t really form&#x2F;retain a model of what the user knows.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40084551" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40084551" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">z3phyr</span><span>|</span><a href="#40083883">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40084441">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40084518">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40084600">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40084551">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40084551">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Ask why do I need to determine similarity of two vectors<p>Simple:<p>Start with<p>a) Suppose you are making a video game..<p>b) Suppose you are determining ballistic trajectory of your missile system based on model rockets<p>c) Suppose you are running a fighter robot group..<p>Or any of the stuff children are supposed to *actually* do and then take these classes with determination to do the actual creative things that they wanna do all life.<p>There is an aspect of jest in the above comment, but it also contains some likely truth.

What do you do?<p>Just keep at it. One key observation for me was that at some point the misery and rabbit hole nature diminishes, quite rapidly. The groundwork of solving all those exercises repeatedly pays off and the next set becomes a little easier.

My math skills stagnated in high school and then I went on studying computer science (avoiding almost all of the math) and came out pretty good in programming but still bad in math. I tried to read books like calculus made easy but it was still too dry and too hard.<p>How I fixed it:<p>1. I learned to become bored and be okay with it. I sometimes lie on the ground for 15 minutes to an hour and do nothing (and that&#x27;s different than meditation!). I feel incredibly bored, bored to tears actually. I have noticed when I&#x27;m in this state, I&#x27;m in a much better position to do math or anything else that I slightly find boring but also really interesting.<p>2. I went to the root of my problem. I&#x27;m Dutch. I failed a course in high school called wiskunde B (math B). It teaches calculus, vectors and trig. I&#x27;m currently doing that [1]. It&#x27;s been a few months, but it&#x27;s going well.<p>Results and observations:<p>I think I&#x27;m almost at the level to do actual college level math. It helps that I studied CS, because I know a ton of math channels on YouTube and they are now immensely helpful. The thing is the course I&#x27;m following isn&#x27;t explaining the theory well. It is amazing in making me practice, so fortunately I just need to go to good YouTube channels such as 3Blue1Brown or Khan Academy for an adequate explanation on theory.<p>Another observation is that it has made me a better programmer. My debugging style has always been &quot;turn on the debugger&quot;. Now my debugging style is: think deeply about code execution first. Math makes me comfortable with &quot;code execution&quot; because with math you have no choice!<p>__Looking for a math tutor (email in profile)__<p>I&#x27;m looking for a math tutor. I&#x27;d love to ask questions during the week that I don&#x27;t need an immediate answer to. I think it&#x27;ll take about 1 hour per week for you. I have noticed I&#x27;ll need one after the wiskunde B course because I have asked about 100 questions to them in total over the duration of 4 months.<p>Edit:<p>To add. I think for me what made calculus so hard was not having a strong understanding of the fundamentals. The gist of calculus of slope and area is easy. Manipulating the equations perfectly 100% of the time. That used to be really hard and it is getting easier the more I practice.<p>I just happen to watch a YouTube video where a math professor mentions the same thing [2].<p>[1] The math course I&#x27;ve followed (400 euro - includes exam): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kdvi.uva.nl&#x2F;nl&#x2F;onderwijs&#x2F;wiskundecursussen&#x2F;e-wintercursus-wiskunde-b&#x2F;e-wintercursus-wiskunde-b-copy.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kdvi.uva.nl&#x2F;nl&#x2F;onderwijs&#x2F;wiskundecursussen&#x2F;e-winterc...</a><p>It&#x27;s in Dutch, but they have an English version in the language settings.<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=M7febmLhS6E&amp;ab_channel=BigThink" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=M7febmLhS6E&amp;ab_channel=BigTh...</a></div><br/><div id="40082722" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40082722" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gmays</span><span>|</span><a href="#40082640">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40083062">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40082722">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40082722">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You might want to take a look at Math Academy.

After an oral exam at a black board, was admitted to the second year.  Majored in math. Took (so called) <i>advanced calculus</i> from Rudin&#x27;s <i>Principles ....</i>  Took applied advanced calculus from a famous MIT book from an MIT Ph.D.  Taught calculus at Indiana University.  Studied Fleming&#x27;s <i>Functions of Several Variables</i>, right, through the inverse and implicit function theorems, Stokes formula, exterior algebra, etc.  Published some advanced math, essentially <i>advanced</i> calculus.  Once, with some calculus, at FedEx pleased the most serious investors on the Board, had them return their airline tickets back to Texas, stay after all, and saved the company.<p>Okay, the 90 seconds:<p>Consider a car, its speedometer and odometer.<p>Calculus has two parts.<p>For the first part, you read the data from the odometer and reconstruct the  speedometer readings.  Doing this, you take changes in (increments of, differences in) the odometer readings, say, every second.  This is called <i>differentiation</i>.<p>For the second part, you read the data from the speedometer and reconstruct the odometer readings. Doing this, you add the speedometer readings, say, every second.   This is called <i>integration</i>.<p>Starting with the odometer readings and differentiating to get the speedometer readings and then integrating the speedometer readings will give back the odometer readings -- this is the &quot;fundamental theorem of calculus&quot;.<p>~90 seconds.<p>For more, instead of the 1 second steps could use 0.1 seconds, .... 0.0001 seconds, etc.  With really small steps, making them smaller will make no or nearly no difference. So, the reconstructions will have <i>converged</i>, reached a <i>limit</i>.<p>Reaching this <i>limit</i> is mostly what was novel when Newton, Leibnitz, etc. invented calculus.<p>It is fair to say that the first
big application was to Newton&#x27;s law F = ma where have some object -- baseball, airplane, rocket -- with mass m and are applying to the object force F.  Then a is the acceleration of the object.  Integrate the acceleration and get the velocity v.  Integrate v and get distance d.  So, can find where the rocket is after, say, 10 seconds.  Other early applications were to planetary motion.<p>There are applications to areas, volumes, classical mechanics. fluid flow, mechanical engineering, electricity and magnetism, quantum mechanics, relativity, electrical and electronic engineering, e.g., Fourier theory.<p>Physics and engineering are big users.  And there are applications in economics, e.g., work of Arrow, Hurwicz, and Uzawa on the Kuhn-Tucker conditions.<p>By the early 20th century,
calculus was refined,
e.g., presented with careful assumptions, definitions, theorems, and proofs, e.g., B. Riemann and, soon, H. Lebesgue.  By then there was the idea of the highly irregular Brownian motion and the observation that differentiation wouldn&#x27;t work there -- Brownian motion was differentiable nowhere!<p>Calculus?  A pillar of science, technology, and, thus, civilization.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40083955" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40083955" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cess11</span><span>|</span><a href="#40083336">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40083250">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40083955">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40083955">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When I was in school calculus was the first time we encountered sleight-of-hand tricks as a technique in mathematical reasoning, along with math basically being a symbolic form of fiction it made it quite hard.<p>While I enjoy Silvanus book, I don&#x27;t think calculus can be made easy without preparing the students to accept the handwaving and trickery involved in the jump from an equation to its &#x27;area&#x27; or &#x27;velocity&#x27;.

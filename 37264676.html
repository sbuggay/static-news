The HiQ vs LinkedIn case, to my knowledge, went through the following stages:<p>- LinkedIn sues HiQ, Ninth Circuit sides with HiQ<p>- LinkedIn pushes to Supreme Court, Supreme Court vacates citing Van Buren<p>- Ninth Circuit re-reviews and <i>affirms their decision</i><p>- LinkedIn moves to get the injunction preventing them from blocking HiQ dissolved, which is granted<p>- A mixed judgement is finally issued in Nov 2022 ultimately resulting in a private settlement<p>Where exactly does this leave things at? I feel like everyone loves to cite this case but never goes into the finer details.<p>Reading a summary of the mixed judgement from Nov 2022, it looks like maybe the issue came from HiQ using people to log in and thus the ToS came into play...?

Spam is often malicious&#x2F;harmful. Accessing a publicly accessible website is usually benign even if the content being accessed gets saved to disk.<p>Some people don&#x27;t publicly publish their email address, they instead selectively give it out only to those they want to get email from, but their address gets leaked&#x2F;sold and abused. Ultimately people who do publicly publish a contact address (email or even a physical mailing address) are basically on the hook for deciding what to do with whatever people send them.<p>The spam situation got out of hand pretty fast though. The only thing that kept email spam from reaching the level of a DoS attack were blacklists and server-side filtering, and even with those things (plus client-side filters) spam is still a huge problem today. Spam is just a much bigger problem than web scraping. Even the junkmail the mailman delivers to my door has an environmental cost that&#x27;s much worse than the &quot;harm&quot; of a web scraper&#x27;s http GET requests.<p>We have many alternative ways to contact each other online that aren&#x27;t as vulnerable to spam, but for all of its shortcomings email continues to be widely used because at the end of the day people think giving strangers the ability to reach out to them uninvited is valuable. Anyone can set up a whitelist and trash everything that comes into their mailbox unless it&#x27;s from an approved sender, but almost nobody does because they want to be more reachable than that.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37269248" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37269248" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nextaccountic</span><span>|</span><a href="#37266080">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37268112">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37268666">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37268335">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37269248">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37269248">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s like comparing web scraping with DDoS</div><br/><div id="37269453" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37269453" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dvhh</span><span>|</span><a href="#37266080">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37269248">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37268335">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37269453">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37269453">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There are some factors that might lead to this lone of though.<p>- it seem a lot of web developer &#x2F; product manager either do not know or do not care about robots.txt<p>- some web application are so badly optimized, that some of them are not able to handle more than 1 hit per second at a sustained rate, which admittedly have worked fine so far.

An example would be a recipe website. The site owner could&#x27;ve painstakingly collected recipes from the literature, and cataloged, labelled it, etc, making searching and such easy. But the recipes themselves are not copyrightable, only the expression of the recipe.<p>So given this info, the AI scrapper now has a large labelled dataset for which to learn from, and to generate new recipes. These new recipes do not violate _any_ existing copyright, as they are entirely original in expression.<p>I say, as an AI advocate, that the old business model of recipe hosting is destroyed by this new AI, and legislating it to remain by legal means is just fighting against the tide.

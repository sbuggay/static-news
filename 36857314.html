Obviously piquing my interest, I told her not to touch the computer until I arrived.<p>Since the hospital was quite big, it took me about 10 minutes to reach her workstation, where she exclaimed that &quot;the window closed on its own a minute ago. I swear it was on there for half an hour&quot;.<p>That, coupled with the layout of the desk, the description of the window led me to a hypothesis. I pressed the button on the monitor (which she had unknowingly pressed with the corner of her keyboard) which called up the system menu of the display. It showed 100% sun (brightness). The mouse would go under it.<p>Then, I hiked back another 10 minutes to await the next phone call.</div><br/><div id="36867746" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36867746" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mulmen</span><span>|</span><a href="#36863174">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36863582">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36867746">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36867746">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I also did tech support in a hospital.  I&#x27;m not sure IT is a value add in that environment, at least not as much as IT thinks it is.  Nurses are busy doing things like saving lives and caring for people experiencing the worst day of their life.  On top of that nurses have to deal with poorly implemented and maintained workstations.  Then when they ask for help the very people who created the problem in the first place come and belittle them.<p>I&#x27;m not accusing you of anything.  Just noting my own perception that IT people tend to be very smug and see the world from an IT-centric perspective.  Nurses aren&#x27;t dumb and they certainly aren&#x27;t lazy.  They just have better things to do with their time than deal with inconsequential IT issues.<p>As I recall everything in the hospital that was actually critical to providing care had some specialist that maintained the system.  The computer running the MRI machine wasn&#x27;t bound to Active Directory and might not even be on the network.  Issues with it were routed to GE, not the guy that fixes printers.</div><br/><div id="36868362" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36868362" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tiffanyg</span><span>|</span><a href="#36863174">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36867746">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36868709">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36868362">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36868362">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ha - I know where you&#x27;re coming from, but, like every opinionated SOB on this site, can&#x27;t help but throw in my own opinion*:<p>1) The parent comment seems completely neutral and non-judgmental. Seems quite just &quot;I had this experience&quot;, essentially a set of facts (compared to frequent enough comments that possibly really ought to generate a response &#x2F; &quot;note of approbation&quot;).<p>2) Stereotypes are the epitome of judgmental thinking, language, attitudes, etc. That may sound judgmental itself, and I apologize for that - that&#x27;s due, in part, to connotation &quot;issues&quot; with words we use (although, I can&#x27;t, obviously, claim that even removing those removes all of that issue - I am literally labeling and characterizing strictly in denotation). To be fair, people, in general, can be very smug.<p>In my experience, there has been an &quot;enrichment&quot; of that in &quot;IT&quot;, but, for example, try talking to some of the especially high-ranking surgeons, say ... or, certain professors. In particular, I&#x27;ve personally come across a somewhat bimodal distribution, I think. Some people who reach &quot;very high levels of expertise&quot; are very humble (&quot;right-sized&quot; - not subservient or etc.) and super nice (surprisingly willing to help and talk to even &quot;the layman&quot; &#x2F; &quot;novice&quot;). Then, there are the outright &quot;arrogant bastards&quot;.<p>So, to add some kind of summation - calling out &quot;IT people&quot; specifically, and especially the parent comment ... well, what&#x27;s the point? Again - not meant to be rhetorical or aggressive ... but, I think many would agree that people in general should cut that $h1t out.<p><i>This opinion brought to you by my &quot;Big Giant Head... remember, when you&#x27;re thinking of giant heads, think [my] Big Giant Head...&quot;</i>**<p>* Which, we all know is likely to be comparable to ... something else everyone&#x27;s got.

It wasn&#x27;t a daily, or even weekly occurrence.  But, in all honesty those pranks were some of the things that helped my early sysadmin experience.<p>When you have nice, well behaved users you&#x27;ll not have problems that need solving.  When things go awry - that&#x27;s when you&#x27;ll need to solve problems... sometimes even without pranks.<p>Before we had yp set up on the machines, we just copied the password file between them with a note &quot;make sure you change your password on foo&quot; since that was the one we regarded as authoritative and would copy that to bar.<p>One time, while adding a person to the &#x2F;etc&#x2F;groups file for write access to the web server, someone did rcp &#x2F;etc&#x2F;groups bar:&#x2F;etc&#x2F;password (I suspect it was muscle memory) and, well, now bar was unhappy and wouldn&#x27;t let anyone log in... or even su to root to fix it.  Found someone who had an open terminal and had them do a while 1 sync... and then powered the machine down and brought it back up.  It wasn&#x27;t happy, so started up in single user mode.  Just needed to get the password file in there... but the terminal was 300h which didn&#x27;t have a proper termcap entry for vi or emacs to work.  I was a mudder and knew how to use ed... so ed &#x2F;etc&#x2F;password and then the contents of the minimal password file were dictated to me.  When done, we got it back up and then copied the password and groups files to the proper spots.<p>Another time (and this was a prank), someone left themselves logged in and someone else created a directory path that was about 3000 characters long.  &#x2F;user&#x2F;jsmith&#x2F;I&#x2F;will&#x2F;not&#x2F;leave&#x2F;myself&#x2F;logged&#x2F;in&#x2F;I&#x2F;will&#x2F;not&#x2F;leave&#x2F;myself&#x2F;logged&#x2F;in&#x2F; ... The problem with this is that `rm -rf` won&#x27;t handle paths longer than 2048 characters long.   So it didn&#x27;t get removed &quot;I&#x27;ll do it later.&quot;  You know what else doesn&#x27;t like paths longer than 2048 characters long?  fsck.  So when the machine was rebooted&#x2F;crashed at some point, the root volume (yea, user directories were on the root volume) failed to fsck... and failed to mount.  Stuck in single user mode with the backup partition and reading the man pages for mount on the other machine we found how to force a mount without fsck and then had the guy who did the extremely long path fix it (and promise not to do it again) and got machines working.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36861152" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36861152" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bstpierre</span><span>|</span><a href="#36857935">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36858263">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36858217">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36861152">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36861152">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In 1993 my freshman CS class was taught in scheme.

The kicker was that attempting a login after the connection was dropped greeted you with a &quot;could not connect to &#x2F;&#x2F;SCHOOL_BOARD&#x2F;&#x2F;SCHOOL_NAME&#x2F;PC_NAME&quot; to which the solution was reboot the PC and it would work again (99% of the time, anyways). The other kicker was the background image and login domain were the same for every single computer at a single school. We exploited this; we created a full-screen&#x2F;un-exitable UI with the same background image behind a form simulating the normal login screen. We would first login to our own account and run the program (there were no login limits either), at which point someone else later through the day would sit down and try to login. The credentials that got typed in were added to a .txt in my own user folder before the user rebooted the &quot;non-functional&quot; system.

Back then, the computers at the lab at my uni were not very powerful, so people would do work at a Linux console, saving themselves the hassle of running a bulky X session.<p>Some time around 2001 I read the console_ioctl(4) manpage and found it replete with prank possibilities. I wrote little programs that would flip the console font so that all the characters were upside down; or swap capital letters with small letters, again by way of manipulating the font; or flash patterns on the keyboard LEDs; or fade to black and back by manipulating the palette.<p>I then added a server component so that I could leave it running at an innocuously-looking terminal, wait for a victim, fire up these effects remotely from another box in the same room, and watch what happens. Fortunately, I soon discovered that the coding part was more fun than the watching-people-slip part, so I gave up on the latter.<p>Another prank I used to do was simulate a successful root login on these terminals by just typing in what would be printed, including the motd, at the getty login prompt, simulating newlines with tabs&#x2F;spaces (and never ever pressing RET), ending in `[root@mailhost root]# `. Then, again, step back and watch what happens. Some people would curiously type in `whoami` and be puzzled why they got a password prompt; some would step back in terror without touching anything, switch terminals and email the sysadmin.</div><br/><div id="36861567" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36861567" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">0x6c6f6c</span><span>|</span><a href="#36858930">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36859529">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36861567">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36861567">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wish I&#x27;d had Linux systems.

The student terminals were on one half of a large divided room, the other half being used by the college IT folks. Often, if there wasn&#x27;t a spare terminal on the IT admin half of the room, one or two of the IT folks would use two of the nearest terminals just over the divider.<p>One day, bored out of my mind waiting for my COBOL project to compile, I wondered if I could capture the sys admin&#x27;s username and password. I wrote a script using the CLI to perfectly simulate the login prompt complete with beeps, messages and all. All it did was clear the screen, sit there waiting for user to enter their username and password, when they did the script would mail me said username and password, display a username&#x2F;password error then logout to the real login process.<p>After trying the script out on a couple of unsuspecting classmates and having a bit of anonymous tomfoolery I decided it was time to try this out for real with the sysadmins. I logged into both terminals the IT folks normally used and left the script running. A few hours later I returned and to my surprise and mild anxiety I found out that I&#x27;d captured the SYSTEM login password :o. For about a month or so I&#x27;d full control of that machine, and would re-run the script occasionally whenever the SYSTEM password changed. I told no-one and on my last day at college logged in and deleted the script, just in case (this was around the time the law in the UK was getting a bit heavy with regards to unauthorised computer access).<p>Combined with access to the huge set of manuals for that machine I spent a heap of time exploring and learning about VMS and no-one had a clue.</div><br/><div id="36861728" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36861728" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">samch</span><span>|</span><a href="#36861404">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36861780">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36861728">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36861728">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Fun fact: Login spoofing like this is why, from Windows NT on, users have had to first enter a security context with Ctrl+Alt+Del.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Control-Alt-Delete" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Control-Alt-Delete</a></div><br/><div id="36864020" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36864020" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gumby</span><span>|</span><a href="#36861404">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36861728">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36861780">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36864020">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36864020">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">an approach that goes back the the rainbow books, at least.

It was well underutilized and the hit game Quake had come out.  Of course we, the IT support staff, ran a Quake server and invited all of our friends to play on it.  Imagine our surprise when one of our professors we support came into our office and said &quot;Hey our Oracle instance is very slow, can you guys take a look at it?&quot;.  Whoops, we shutdown the quake server and he later sent an email &quot;I don&#x27;t know what magic you guys did, but the performance is amazing!&quot;.<p>Another fun one, not targeted at professors, but at our student compute lab.  We had a lab of 25 Sparc Ultra 60s that was pretty well utilized.  Well one day, before I became a sysadmin, I was thinking to myself &quot;all of these servers are rsh enabled, what if I logged into all of them&quot;. So I wrote a script that would cut up an AU file (sun&#x27;s audio format) into tiny parts and then wrote a program that would synchronize with each other and play a different part out of a different workstation.  I vividly remember playing a screaming sound in a ring around the entire room at a low volume before playing the entire sound out of the three middle workstations at full volume a few seconds later.  The lab was full. At least 15 people immediately noped out.  I was sitting in the back cracking up.<p>Another time the sysadmins of the same computer lab left rwalld running.  So I sent an rwall &quot;The system will shutdown in 5 minutes&quot; or whatever the shutdown message was.  The professor at the time got angry &quot;they always do this, they perform maintenance whenever the g.d. please&quot; and he stormed out of the room.  Suddenly the professor and an angry IT administrator was peering in the door and pointing at me.  They threatened to revoke all of my access which would cause me to fail out.  I just shrugged, I knew what they were up against and instead asked to work for them.  The anger turned to surprise and I worked there for almost 6 years before leaving for greener pastures.<p>Ahh the SunOS days were really the days of yore</div><br/></div></div><div id="36861248" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36861248" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bluedino</span><span>|</span><a href="#36870741">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36869307">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36861248">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36861248">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Back in my MSP days I had a client report that their server was slowing down after an hour.

It was running databases and such that other computers in the building accessed.<p>Every time the server slowed down, someone would go back there and restart the software, or reboot the whole computer, and it&#x27;d be fine for another hour.<p>Sure enough, after an hour, some fancy ass 3D screen saver came on and pegged the CPU.

Our computer lab was packed with the Sun SPARCstation IPCs, each running SunOS. We had this rudimentary email system that everyone in the department used to communicate. The tech-savvy folks, of course, had started exploring Usenet, but for the majority of us, the e-mail was our digital universe.<p>One day, my group of friends and I decided to have some fun. We concocted an idea inspired by the famous &#x27;fortune&#x27; command that prints out random adages. We wrote a simple shell script that would take a random line from a text file full of humorous and nonsensical messages we&#x27;d written, then mail it to a random user in the computer science department. The script was set up as a cron job, scheduled to send one of these messages every hour.<p>Initially, it was just a harmless prank. People found the messages funny and would often share them in the lab. The source of these messages became the talk of the department, but nobody knew where they were coming from. We took great pleasure in watching our peers and professors speculating about the mysterious sender.<p>However, things started to get out of hand when the Dean received an especially absurd message that read, &quot;Why do computer scientists confuse Christmas and Halloween? Because Oct 31 == Dec 25!&quot; He found the joke incomprehensible and thought it was some sort of cryptic message or even a potential threat.<p>The campus IT team was called in to investigate, and a week-long frenzy ensued as they tried to trace the source of the emails. My friends and I watched in trepidation, wondering if we&#x27;d be found out and expelled for our seemingly harmless prank.<p>Finally, after several sleepless nights, we decided to turn ourselves in. We went to the Dean and confessed. After an anxious silence, he started laughing. Apparently, he had been let in on the joke by one of the Computer Science professors and was waiting to see how long it would take for us to come forward. He was good-natured about the prank and found our initiative creative, although he warned us about the unintended consequences of such pranks.<p>Looking back, it was a fun, memorable prank that gave us a valuable lesson about the ethics of technology use. It&#x27;s a story I often recount when I&#x27;m teaching my own Computer Science students about the importance of ethical conduct in the digital world.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36859195" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36859195" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">m463</span><span>|</span><a href="#36859789">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36874721">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36859195">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36859195">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I remember lots of things like this, from the sunos days.<p>There was a program that would sort of melt your screen.<p>There was another one that would animate a little character at the bottom who would then push your desktop off the side of the screen.<p>and there was a way to take all the workstations in the group, and play sounds on them.<p>So (nearest I can vaguely recall):<p><pre><code>  for i in machine1 machine2 machine3 ...

Someone with much tech knowledge immediately saw it wasn&#x27;t quite right (that is how the issue was found) but these were terminals used by the general populace not just us CompSci students so the vast majority of the users were not at all technical (what we might assume almost everyone knows these days was still new fangled magic to the average student back then, for many arriving at Uni was their first encounter with having an email account for instance).<p>To my knowledge they never worked out who did it, or how long it had been going on for other than “may have been months”, because the fake login app would exit and logout after sending off the captured credential, and next time it was run it was done from one of the captured accounts, so only the very first capture would have been done by the culprit&#x27;s own account (even that maybe not if they&#x27;d guessed or stolen a password by other means first). Captured credentials were sent to a popular high volume usenet newsgroup so they couldn&#x27;t track who was reading the result that way. Also, no evidence of the attacker actually using the compromised credentials for anything else, so it was possibly someone “playing” to see what they could do rather than a more malicious intent.<p>It became standard practise (“enforced” by notices in large all caps text) to reset terminals before logging in to be more sure that was a real login prompt.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36869917" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36869917" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">heelix</span><span>|</span><a href="#36859222">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36872768">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36869917">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36869917">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Back in the day when a 4x CD-ROM burner was a luxury, we got a phone call from a customer we shipped a CD to.

What is it like to hear, when you have never heard before?  From what I understand, the restoration (storation?) of a sense, to an adult who has never had that sense, is often an extremely unpleasant experience.  Disorienting, frightening, dizzying, painful.  The brain adapted and rewired itself around not having that sense.  Children have remarkable neural plasticity here, but adults don&#x27;t as much.  In deaf people, the auditory cortex is adapted to spatial navigation and vision, not sound.  In the case of hearing restored by other means (surgery, cochlear implants, etc.) in adults who were born deaf, it can take many years to learn how to interpret what is being experienced in a useful way, and many give up long before that.<p>Not to be a downer or anything, on its own this is still an amazing technology.</div><br/><div id="37443095" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37443095" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">manmal</span><span>|</span><a href="#37441673">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37443109">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37443095">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37443095">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To add one anecdote, this seems to be hard even for children. One of the kids in my family had a second adenotomy (first one grew back), and to improve hearing longer term, they also inserted a tympanostomy tube. Hearing did improve a lot, but the kid had regular meltdowns in the months afterwards. He described it as a loud noise that is constantly screaming directly into his head.<p>Eventually, things calmed down, and things are good now. His parents still aren’t sure it was a good idea because his other ear worked fine mostly, and the docs said his speech development was excellent anyway.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37443109" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37443109" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">I_am_uncreative</span><span>|</span><a href="#37441673">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37443095">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37442038">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37443109">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37443109">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Deafness does not mean being entirely deaf.

On the other hand I can tell you from personal experience no hearing aid I&#x27;ve tried so far can replace natural hearing. It can augment the frequencies you&#x27;re less able to hear, but for some reason being able to hear them naturally vs via amplification works far better.  And hearing loss is also a byproduct of aging, so there are far more people out there who&#x27;d like to regain their hearing than adults who might decide on this treatment vs a cochlear implant.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37442755" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37442755" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway290</span><span>|</span><a href="#37441673">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37442038">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37442755">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37442755">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think &quot;genetic deafness&quot; means congenital deafness.

This seems like the current gradual trend towards reversing the hidden subsidy for drivers, first by giving them less affordances at remarkably low prices or for free.<p>A few folks in the comments have mentioned a couple of times that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to make a policy like this without supporting transit. I believe the argument would be that not creating induced demand will provide market effects to encourage the use of transit, which would then create greater demand for improved transit.<p>Similarly for housing, the well substantiated claim from modern urban planners is that we&#x27;ve been prioritizing housing for cars well beyond housing for people, and the best solution for that is to overturn minimum parking requirements and unbundle the cost of parking from the cost of housing.<p>Personally, I still find these opinions somewhat counterintuitive. The weirdest part about it is that it all posits that the solution to a centralized planning problem is market solutions, and it&#x27;s coming from people you&#x27;d expect to have the opposite opinion. However, what we&#x27;ve had in terms of transportation clearly doesn&#x27;t work for people and for the environment, and the last 20 years of &quot;Shoupism&quot; has shown some serious promise in terms of reversing the trend.</div><br/><div id="40549497" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40549497" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kjkjadksj</span><span>|</span><a href="#40535313">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40552107">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40549497">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40549497">[24 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A big issue with the market argument in converting car drivers to transit riders is the respective networks operate at different scales. Think of a little neighborhood with a bus line on a road; theres probably I’m not even sure call it 20x as many roads in that neighborhood that don’t have a bus line. There is so much more built out of the comprehensive road network everywhere than there is with transit. Cities are barely establishing their cardinal direction rail transit routes today. Even living in a place as densely railed as nyc most of those routes are extremely biased in the sort of commutes they best serve (in to manhattan for the most part).<p>Since most cities can’t afford to ever build their rail networks as comprehensively as the existing road network in even a small city, we are left with bussing to build that comprehensive network. And what do you know, if you look up most cities bus networks they look pretty good and high coverage. So why don’t people take them? Its still worse than a car. A car is a direct bus on your own schedule, a bus route is a compromised route of average population and job density, might not help you get to where you are going especially for drives outside a fixed commute to a central business district. Scheduling and especially transfers can be fickle.<p>As long as the coverage and convenience are so lopsided, people are going to take cars if they can afford it, even with a shiny new light rail line or whatever is attempted. I have yet to see a project like that attract wealthy ridership that can afford choice, transit rider median demographics are working class or even at the poverty line in a lot of metros. Even nyc subway ridership is 40k income on avg, bus ridership 28k. In the most expensive city in north america no less.</div><br/><div id="40550021" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40550021" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ericmay</span><span>|</span><a href="#40535313">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40549497">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40550048">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40550021">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40550021">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It’s hard to talk about the topic at very high level but for many American cities like Columbus where I live the answer lies at least partially converting surface parking lots in downtown areas into economically productive assets like housing or businesses which are also not extractive to the local economy.

Leadership from the top down needs to change its focus. The mantra should be the best, safest car is the one you never get in.

Unfortunately, they dont have one of the other benefits that you mention, like banning cars in some areas. There are also connections to the train to go farther, but the buses are still mostly empty except for students and laborers who live outside the city. The buses themselves are typically faster and decent, as I ride them a lot. Meanwhile, the other traffic lanes are jam packed during rush hours. It is the L.A. area, so there&#x27;s just a ton of people&#x2F;drivers anyway.<p>The last time I went through there driving, it took almost 20 mins to go 2-3 miles due to traffic (and stop lights), obviously during rush hour. The buses were still nearly empty (I wished I didnt have to drive that day). At a non-rush hour time, it takes me maybe 20 mins for my whole trip home which is about 9 miles.<p>My point, I guess, is it&#x27;s not always just having a free bus lane. There are a lot of people that need convincing to take buses and alternative transportation.

There&#x27;s a very long queue to check out those books. Someone might argue that, &quot;We should buy more copies of the best selling children&#x27;s books&quot;.<p>The induced demand argument in this case would be: &quot;If we buy more copies of those books, the queue wont disappear, since it is so long, but also, if the queue gets shorter, we might have people who don&#x27;t use the library because of the queue start using it. We would be no better off!&quot;.<p>Of course in this analogy, we realize the fallacy. People are better off because more kids get to read books. Even if the queue stays the same length, we have more throughput, more kids get the benefit.<p>Now if we translate that to cars, of course, we see the difference. People who write books like &quot;Paved Paradise&quot; or &quot;The High Cost of Free Parking&quot; hate cars. They really do. They hate the suburbs too.<p>So when they see something that would enable people who don&#x27;t currently drive cars to drive cars, or for people who live in urban areas to live in suburban areas, they&#x27;re of course going to be against that.<p>&quot;Induced demand&quot; is being used here by languagehacker, as it is used by other people who are opposed to private property, as some sort of technical term that supports their case. But that isn&#x27;t true.<p>By adding more copies of popular books to libraries, we want to induce demand. We want people to read the books, and we want people who don&#x27;t currently use libraries to consider using them. The induced demand is not bad. We had a queue, it was too long, we shorten the queue, and by doing so some people who thought the queue was too long will no longer think that. This is good.<p>What languagehacker is saying, by referring to induced demand, is that, in the opinion of languagehacker cars are bad.<p>It is as simple as that. It sounds super-scientific when you use terms like &quot;induced demand&quot;, but it is not, in fact, super-scientific. It&#x27;s just a value judgement.<p>To me, if you build a highway in an area that has high traffic congestion, and after you build the highway, it still has high traffic congestion, it means more people are getting where they want to be.

Each of which could be expanded to improve throughput (more lanes:more self checkout lanes, more streets:more librarians).<p>Ultimately the problem with anti-car rhetoric is that it seeks to limit access to the objective because it is &quot;wrong&quot; to use a self checkout lane and people must be forced to check books out in the morally correct manner.<p>No one (reasonable) has a problem with the library adopting a mobile checkout app, which let&#x27;s call mass transit.

Make one faster, and people will shift from one line to the other. Though, to make it an even better analogy, make one line shorter, and people will start coming in from off the street rather than switching lines.<p>A much better example - telecommuting. IF commute is bad, one is strongly incentivized to have some work-from-home days. If the commute time is improved, then that incentive disappears and one would then consider commuting daily.<p>Induced demand I think is generally all about the idea that when something is painful - people don&#x27;t do it. Take away that pain point, and people come. I don&#x27;t begrudge people too much for driving, as an example I&#x27;ll note I do my errands on a bicycle. As such, I&#x27;m strongly incentivized to make many stops and fewer trips. Meanwhile, I&#x27;ve noticed that people in my family will make a car trip errand as soon as the need comes up. &quot;Oh, I need to go to the grocery store.&quot; They get back, then realize they also needed to go to the hardware store, drive out again real quick and back when had there been more planning, the two trips could have been combined. Switching to a bike is an extreme example to avoid the excessive&#x2F;unnecessary trips that are made simply because it is so convenient. If the drive time were tripled, then there might be a behavior shift to group errands together. Why do so though if it takes just a few minutes to make the individual trips? Eventually the cost of the trip is sufficient that a person will start conserving, avoiding that cost (which can be: travelling in off-hours, grouping trips together, not doing a trip altogether, finding a different mode of transport, removing the trip by moving, etc...)</div><br/></div></div><div id="40549833" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40549833" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seadan83</span><span>|</span><a href="#40535313">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40549193">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40549498">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40549288">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40549833">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40549833">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ah, I think i just realized how to fix the analogy!<p>The issue is with how many books are checked out a time.

If the line were infinitely fast, then why not go to the library exactly after you have finished one book to then go get one new book.<p>If an automated checkout then exists, the line time would be less, making it less expensive to go to the library, which means a person would be willing to increase their trip frequency to the library.

If it takes 10 minutes to drive and 30 minutes to take a bus, then I drive. If it takes 30 minutes to drive and 10 minutes to take a bus, then I take the bus. Eventually enough people choose to drive, or take a bus, that that mode becomes congested&#x2F;inconvenient enough that people start making other choices. In other words, there are some people who avoid highways during rush hour because the traffic jams are bad. If the highway is widened, then they would join the rush hour once again and be part of the traffic jams.

Yeah, as the cost of travel goes up, people make various decisions: bite-the-bullet, find alternatives, delay, consolidate, and&#x2F;or go without. As the cost decreases, the incentives to find alternatives, delay or consolidate trips goes down (which means roads are then used for less important reasons and less efficiently - why go to the grocery store once a week if you can go every day in half the travel time?)<p>I would agree, at some point when all alternatives are equally unattractive (or non-existent), then going without is a more attractive option.<p>Though, the &quot;consolidate&quot; option is a big one to consider. Rather than going to the city every day, perhaps people could do so every other day for the same benefit. If traffic is bad, then people will go less often (frequency of travel is a function of cost). Thus, in some cases, highway expansion is filled by people that want to go to the grocery store every day rather than going once a week. Meanwhile, those that commute to work, are still going to do so because they have to. If the commute gets too bad, then some people will decide to move.<p>On the other side of the spectrum, at some point there are so many people that want to go into the city every day - you can&#x27;t do it with single occupancy vehicles and roads. It&#x27;s a scaling problem. For example, someone did an analysis of parking decks in Seattle and whether there were not enough of them. They found if there were all filled and everyone then tried to leave - it would take 2 days for all the vehicles to exit the city.<p>There are certainly many aspects to consider.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40549025" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40549025" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tromp</span><span>|</span><a href="#40535313">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40548992">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40549376">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40549011">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40549025">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40549025">[15 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Except that having more car traffic induces more pollution, more casualties, and more time spent unproductively (you can do other things on public transit, or get exercise commuting by bike), whereas more book reading has few downsides.</div><br/><div id="40549199" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40549199" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">carlosjobim</span><span>|</span><a href="#40535313">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40549025">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40549047">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40549199">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40549199">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Investments in infrastructure is investing in huge net benefits for all members of society and the economy in the broadest sense possible.

Every time a road is widened or a new parking lot is added the city also becomes less dense, making getting anywhere useful more time consuming.

Cars work fine in small towns and low-density areas, but once the population and&#x2F;or density grows too high, traffic becomes terrible. If you fix the population density and let the city grow, the traffic that needs to cross any particular cross section of the city grows asymptotically faster than the length of the cross section (and therefore road capacity). The traditional solution was lowering the density by replacing houses with roads, but that&#x27;s no longer popular.<p>Traffic is a hard problem. There is no single solution that fits everywhere, and you will never be able to go everywhere with your preferred means of transit. At least if you are not a major political leader such as the US president.

This is also sounds like an underfunded and sparse bus system. You can do buses right or you can do them poorly, same with anything. If you have a dense enough network that most people don&#x27;t have to transfer, or enough frequency it doesn&#x27;t matter, it makes a huge difference. Public transportation (and particularly buses and coaches) are ubiquitous in some transportation systems in some very rich world cities. London comes to mind. The double decker buses are beloved.<p>Bus rapid transit can actually be really nice. You know that rock stars and politicians practically live on buses while they do traveling events? Of course a BRT isn&#x27;t going to be that private luxury, but even a middle quality charter bus that makes limited stops is pretty darn good. Having dedicated lanes removed the worst part of buses compared to trains.<p>I used to daily take the AC Transit transbay buses from the East Bay to San Francisco, which are double-decker Greyhounds and have comfortable reclining seating with tables and wifi. The single entrance&#x2F;exit is a benefit, because it only runs commuter hours and so in the morning it only picks up in the East Bay and drops off in SF. It allows enforcement of fares too. It&#x27;s a higher fare, but that also attracts a commuter clientele. The main problem with it is that it is too popular and gets crowded, and you&#x27;re SOL if all the buses are already full at your stop. But that if the flaw is that it is too popular, that&#x27;s the best and easiest problem to have. Sometimes a regular AC Transit bus would show up and we would all groan and curse.</div><br/><div id="40550810" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40550810" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DopplerSmell</span><span>|</span><a href="#40550649">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40550727">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40550949">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40550810">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40550810">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The biggest problem with public transport is usually the public.<p>Segregated services for commuters are great, but catching a bus to shop&#x2F;recreation&#x2F;restaurants is miserable and restrictive.<p>As as aside, developing mass transit always has the problem of being at the whim of the next political goal (subsidised bus routes especially).

At least as someone who buys cheap cars, tends to live within 30mins drive of my job and keeps them for a good long time. Even in a good public transit area in the US there is a significant time sink to using public transit for literally every aspect of your life. Getting to work is efficient and not significantly more time intensive than driving, but doing everything else like visiting a friend, going to a hair salon, get groceries can be a huge difference depending on what city you&#x27;re in. I lived in a city where I was faster to take the bus to work than drive, but getting groceries was a harrowing 45mins journey. Places where getting to work took twice as long, but I could walk to the grocery store. In the US there&#x27;s just no way to make public transit really work across all dimensions. Especially as we add in specificity. Like needing to bring home a large amount of items or visit humans instead of businesses.

Let&#x27;s just make up a number and say that these things average ~$150 per month, for a total of ~$406.68 per month to drive a car.<p>Now, suppose that a commute is 20 minutes each way using that car, or 1 hour if riding the bus.  And that a bus pass costs $62 per month.<p>And let&#x27;s say that a person &quot;brings home&quot; $25 per hour worked, and that they work 40 hours in a regular week (173.93 hours in a regular month), and that the commute time counts as unpaid work.<p>The car commute adds 14.49 hours per month, for 188.42 hours total time in work+commute at a cost of $406.68.<p>The bus commute adds 43.48 hours per month, for 217.41 hours total time in work+commute at a cost of $62.<p>The bus seems cheaper and slower at this point, which we all probably implicitly knew to be true.<p>--<p>But if my math is right:  By the time transportation is paid for, the person commuting by car has an effective hourly wage of $20.92 for their time+commute.  And the person riding the bus has an effective hourly wage of $19.73&#x2F;hour for their time+commute.<p>So owning and driving the car <i>may</i> be a better option than taking the bus, depending on a person&#x27;s specific situation and proclivities.  And of course, it&#x27;s more nuanced than that in ways that are harder to math out.<p>With a car, commute time is just lost time.  A person driving a car must drive that car the entire time; they don&#x27;t get to read a book or hang out on HN or whatever, but they&#x27;re only doing that for 40 minutes a day.<p>With a bus pass, commute time might be productive time.  A person riding a bus might decide to read a book or hang out on HN or whatever.  So if a person chooses to do so, they can use some of that 43.48 hours riding back and forth to work doing something that has meaning to them.<p>On the other hand:  Owning a cheap(ish) car means being able to travel to places where a bus doesn&#x27;t go, and do so on a whim, and (optionally) take a mountain of stuff along with them if that is useful for whatever reason.<p>So yeah, cars are expensive.  But buses are also expensive.  (Life is expensive.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="40550739" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40550739" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mrangle</span><span>|</span><a href="#40550649">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40550690">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40551050">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40550710">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40550739">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40550739">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Public transportation isn&#x27;t exactly cheap when used every day. Then factor in your time and frustration. Nothing is as expensive as your time.<p>Cars are amazing at their current cost, comparatively. And as I said, we should work on making them cheaper.<p>Toward an ultimate goal of making everyone &quot;richer&quot;. Which begins with reducing hidden poverty taxes like unavoidable multi-hour public transportation commutes.<p>My ultimate dream for society, as a whole, is for everyone to &quot;be rich&quot;. I don&#x27;t necessarily mean having a disgusting surplus of money in the bank, but rather to eliminate the innumerable aspects of being &quot;not rich&quot; that boil down to an endless string of otherwise unnecessary daily sacrifices, sufferings and indignities.

Instead, everyone should have access to private, fast, and cheap transportation as a human right category. This opens up easier access to work, relationships, housing, and food including breaking down the barriers of food deserts.<p>Thanks.

In fact, I probably steer clear of things like debris and potholes on virtually every ride.<p>The reason why I mention congestion is threefold. First, getting hit by a car is by far the predominant hazard. I consider avoiding cars to be the #1 safety measure for cycling. If you take away that factor, then I doubt that cycling is more dangerous than driving. Second, beyond a certain level of congestion, drivers are not fully in control of their cars, but are controlled by the pace of traffic. Third, dodging traffic is the primary distraction that would make a cyclist fail to notice something like debris on the road.<p>I&#x27;m lucky to live in a town that has a network of bike paths, bike lanes in the more dense areas, and ample routes along sleepy residential streets.

Similar for other sources of pollution. Pollution is very akin to smoke, hard to predict, and very localized. It can depend on wind, terrain, can get caught in places, underneath temperature inversions, etc.. All that said, the pollution you experience on a sidewalk next to a road, would be significantly higher than at the weather app meter station.<p>Determining pollution exposure can be done anecdotally. I&#x27;ve done a number of long distance bike trips, the few times where I was next to a highway for upwards of 8 hours - having a nose bleed by the end of that is pretty common for me. In that vein, recognizing air pollution effects is not necessarily that difficult. Symptoms include: sore throat, headache, burning eyes, etc.. The other side, people do get used to low level irritants, and yeah - you don&#x27;t really notice its there until you go somewhere else and realize &quot;the air smells different.&quot;</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40550391" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40550391" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">infecto</span><span>|</span><a href="#40535095">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40548655">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40548752">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40535262">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40550391">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40550391">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Since its my experience its anecdotal.

If cost of use is high, then the resource is used more efficiently, and the inverse is also true.<p>An example, if going to the grocery store takes a literal minute, then buying one item at a time per trip is very viable. OTOH, if that travel time takes one hour, then a person is likely going to avoid that trip, and when they do make it - they&#x27;ll buy two weeks of groceries at a time and be very careful not to forget anything.<p>In the latter case, the number of items transported per unit distance increases, usage efficiency goes up. If the cost goes down, then the number of people for whom it is economical to use that resource inefficiently will increase.  That&#x27;s induced demand.</div><br/><div id="40550025" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40550025" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bobthepanda</span><span>|</span><a href="#40549909">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40550089">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40550025">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40550025">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Induced demand gets thrown around a lot, without understanding why it is invoked.<p>Inducing demand can often be good. We build things so that we can use or sell them. A railroad should induce new trips just as a highway should.<p>The problem with highway expansion in 2024 in the US is that each new mile of highway gets ever increasingly more expensive and hard to build and produces diminishing returns, at high cost to the neighborhoods that will be bulldozed and divided. And these high costs are sucking the money away from not only the development of alternative modes which could be good backup options, but also the maintenance of the current network.

Another example I am thinking of is toilet paper during the pandemic when it was in short supply. At that time, when we were counting squares of toilet paper and predicting when you were going to run out, people used their toilet paper very efficiently. When it is plentiful, suddenly you don&#x27;t care about using every last bit as efficiently as possible.<p>In my previous example in the parent post, everyone is still making it to the grocery store and&#x2F;or work, but it&#x27;s a question of how efficient people are incentivized to be when making those trips.<p>When it comes to highways, I&#x27;m guessing that it&#x27;s more the case that inefficient&#x2F;unnecessary trips become more economical than typically enabling people to make a given trip at all. I know a lot of people are pretty lazy about planning their trips, I&#x27;m guessing there are a lot more of those people than those that cannot go to a city because it requires 45 minutes instead of 30. Just my guess there though, and certainly that is context dependent.<p>I like your points regarding efficiency of cost for expansion as well. Though, my point is more that induced demand is the minimum efficiency of a resource someone is willing to incur for it to be worth the cost of using that resource. That latter part, is a bit independent of the cost of building that resource in the first place, though that construction cost is still an important thing to consider.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40550089" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40550089" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">veqq</span><span>|</span><a href="#40549909">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40550025">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40550073">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40550089">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40550089">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s just Jevon&#x27;s paradox.

At some point you&#x27;ll buy so much you can neither store it nor consume it before it spoils.

It&#x27;s a big reason why people like to have their own car, and do things like buy one weeks of groceries and not a full months at a time.

Many cities are falling behind in road maintenance though, the true impact of which won&#x27;t be felt for ~20 years.

There is a train to the next city over where I live in the Netherlands (both around 150k) around 10x per hour on weekdays. And that&#x27;s on a single, dual track with a mix of 3 direct (intercity) trains and 2 slow trains that have 3 stops inbetween.<p>The intercity trains, when in a maximum length 6+6 car configuration of 2-floor trains, can carry over 1200 (sitting!) passengers. That&#x27;s as much as a single lane of road can carry in half an hour with average car occupancy (low). So running such a train every 15 minutes should give a similar capacity to a free-flowing road with 2 lanes, while needing less room for infrastructure. Plus people mostly go to the station by foot, bike or bus rather than car, which is also nice capacity-wise and pollution-wise.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40550208" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40550208" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">KennyBlanken</span><span>|</span><a href="#40549937">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40549987">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40550076">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40550208">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40550208">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Roads are flat, not stacked, so you&#x27;re just somewhat linearly increasing throughput.<p>Per-lane efficiency <i>drops</i> with additional lanes.

I don&#x27;t want to deal with beggars or other general hoodlums. Transport police need to be aggressive with stamping out these behaviours. If I have to interact with these people I won&#x27;t do it.<p>2) It needs to be clean and comfortable. My car has air conditioning. If I have to feel sweaty and worry about touching surfaces I&#x27;m just not going to do it.<p>3) I like a good walk, and there are also real limitations to scaling here, so I&#x27;m less rigid on this, but it does need to go roughly to where I want to go and it needs to be frequent. If I&#x27;m out in the rain for fifteen minutes waiting for a bus I&#x27;m just not going to do it, I could already be halfway there by car.<p>I don&#x27;t think these are insurmountable, Japan does pretty well, but in the absence of that, the stick just isn&#x27;t going to work. If travel times via car doubled, I&#x27;d probably just do less and then eventually move out of the city.<p>edit: I can&#x27;t reply about libraries due to rate limiting.<p>Libraries are a great example of how public transport _could_ work!<p>I love libraries!<p>The British Library is truly public. Anyone can go, anyone can enter the reading rooms. It is a lovely environment to read or work in, as they have strict rules. It is peaceful and pleasant because of the way that it&#x27;s set up.<p>It&#x27;s also a great example of how the many can come together to do more than the few. Almost no-one is able to create a home environment with that sort of atmosphere, and by sharing it we all get more.<p>I would love it if public transport were like the experience of using a good library.</div><br/><div id="40535671" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40535671" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">walthamstow</span><span>|</span><a href="#40535614">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40549309">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40535671">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40535671">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If &#x27;undesirables&#x27; are part of your local area, then they&#x27;ll be on the public transport.

Yes, if you are paying for support, they will help you a lot with the migration.<p>But if you are using a (costly) managed service it&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t want the hurdle of managing the service. Migrating off something is instead probably the most time consuming thing in a service lifecycle. So, even if it is normal to sunset products and people deal with it all the time, it&#x27;s still a big PITA if you are affected.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42777432" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42777432" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">happosai</span><span>|</span><a href="#42777603">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42777594">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42777432">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42777432">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A company with Amazons resources could keep these fringe services around as long as there are paying customers.

1. The ongoing “ktlo” (keep the lights on) maintenance cost for a  minimal public aws service is on the order of 6 SDEs. Theres a constant stream of security and integration improvements like new IAM policy features, KMS handling, billing &amp; metering, console chrome, docs, etc. These are generally nonnegotiable to keep _any_ sort of consistency across AWS.<p>This is discounting most operations&#x2F;operational support, as you cant practically scale on oncall rota that small and your example is probably referring to a small customer base and a very infrastructure light service. You _could_ move that to a cheaper dev center &amp; more shared ops,  but that in itself is a lot of work.<p>2. Theres a lot of overlap between these services. Its often not complete, and theyll have different approaches. But fundamentally Amazons distributed nature means multiple orgs will solve similar problems that are adjacent but outside their focus, and then realize that “product” is someones elses better owned feature. Culling needs tk happen at that user experience level sooner or later. The linked blog post is a good example.<p>3. “Pay the average cost” is going to be shocking to see how much some of these cost to run. This cost increase is going to feel like extortion for customers who _already use other service_ and probably pay a lot more. Earning ongoing negative feedback over a minor service is not worth it. Nearly all services are priced based on a multi year forward looking marginal cost model. I would very much expect the average cost to be 10x the customer price for a small service like app mesh that never “reached scale” or got their P&amp;L together. Then add in those dev salaries I mentioned.<p>Most importantly those ktlo dev hours in point #1 are an <i>opportunity cost</i> for AWS. They should be spent on new revenue generating work, not cost reduction, and certajnly not a dead end. More than 10 years ago the rough rule of thumb was that a dev year of work should be targeting $12M&#x2F;yr in revenue generation. I know we didnt consistently hit that, but thats the kind of benchmark that would be used to evaluate staffing. In AWS today if the overall product doesnt have a line of sight to $500M its not a viable innestment.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42777493" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42777493" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Dunedan</span><span>|</span><a href="#42777432">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42777691">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42777473">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42777493">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42777493">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">From all what I&#x27;ve heard over the years, they have a problem staffing the service teams. I imagine with the AI craze that just got worse, as they certainly shifted resources to work on that.<p>If they really have staffing problems, it&#x27;d make sense in the short-term to shut down services which don&#x27;t bring in much revenue. In the long-term that might fire back if AWS customers loose trust in the services they&#x27;re using still being there in the future.<p>The obvious solution to a possible staffing problem would of course be not fire a certain percentage of your employees every year.</div><br/><div id="42777559" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42777559" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hnlmorg</span><span>|</span><a href="#42777432">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42777493">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42777473">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42777559">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42777559">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have a lot of grips with AWS, but long term support isn’t one of them.<p>They’ve given nearly 2 years notice here (more than double what a lot of other SaaS providers offer) and there will be an army of AWS engineers available to help customers migrate too.<p>AWS do actually discontinue services all the time.

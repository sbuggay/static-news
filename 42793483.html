I&#x27;ve been part of a few &quot;structureless&quot; groups which spontaneously organized around an opportunity and were initially effective because of that structureless (e.g. somebody gets an idea,  the whole group moves like a military unit, opponents had <i>no idea</i> something like that could happen) but succumbed to the dynamics in that article on a time scale of three weeks (arguably ended a public company in that time!) to three years.</div><br/><div id="42795057" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42795057" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">leoc</span><span>|</span><a href="#42794114">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42794548">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42795057">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42795057">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There was and is a whole literature about unstructured and less-structured and alternatively-structured organisations; it even used to get a fair amount of coverage in mainstream news publications. But some time shortly after the year 2000 someone rang a bell, and now the only way to discuss the subject is to reshare &quot;The Tyranny of Structurelessness&quot; (which to be clear, <i>is</i> very good) every so often. (EDIT: And to re-emphasise, I&#x27;m not criticising yamrzou for sharing it!) Pasting one of my earlier comments on one of the earlier reposts:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36292289">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36292289</a><p>&gt; This is really a good essay and surely deserves a high profile, but it&#x27;s disappointing that it, and some bits of angst about Valve&#x27;s internal situation, seem to be the only discussions of organisational structure that get widely shared these days. Back from about the &#x27;70s to the early &#x27;90s it seems that there was quite a lot of management-theory&#x2F;theory-of-the-firm research into different organisational structures and how they affected innovation, ability to change and other desirable or undesirable characteristics of organisations. And it didn&#x27;t just stay hidden in academia, as the results got a fair amount of coverage in newsmagazines and the like in the early &#x27;90s. (Which is how I heard about it: I&#x27;m no expert.) As you might expect, the findings on relatively &quot;structureless&quot; orgs seem to have been pretty compatible with Freeman&#x27;s observations. But there was also research on many other unusual forms of structure and hierarchy, for example the &quot;matrix management&quot; which famously got implemented at Dow Chemical in the 1970s <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;1978&#x2F;05&#x2F;problems-of-matrix-organizations" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;1978&#x2F;05&#x2F;problems-of-matrix-organizations</a> .<p>&gt; But for some reason interest and attention seems to have completely faded out, at least at the popular level, by about 2000 or so. So the Valve situation gets reported on as if it&#x27;s some kind of unprecedented novelty, and not an example of a sort of situation whose outcomes had been hashed out pretty thoroughly a decade or more earlier.</div><br/><div id="42797006" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42797006" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neilk</span><span>|</span><a href="#42794114">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42795057">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42795205">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42797006">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42797006">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Management theory, at least the aspects of it which become popular, seems fad-driven.<p>Matrix managment, holacracy, consensus, etc etc.<p>Is this a field where people discover things that last?

In my mind the most interesting application of that was the contemporaneous Falun Gong movement in China.<p>Falun Gong practitioners would show up at a park and practice a set of simple physical and spiritual practices;  the organization was deliberately structureless because organizations of all kinds in China are required to admit a cadre of Communist Party members to surveil and control the organization.  No organization = no control network.  (The very act of gathering a group of people at a point, however, is a basic practice of military science)<p>The one bit of authority in the organization is a book which is said to be infallible,  which defends them from having the book rewritten by the authorities.  (We know pretty well how the Communists and Republican governments oppressed folk religion movements such as the Huxian cult,  but Taoism in its established form has always been some selection of folk practices which are approved by the authorities as long as China has had governments)<p>An unfortunate consequence of this is that Falun Gong cannot change any doctrine,  such as their belief that &quot;being gay is bad for your gong.&quot;  They lost the support of mainstream western organizations and descended into pandering to right-wing nuts to get what support they could.</div><br/><div id="42795312" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42795312" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">monadINtop</span><span>|</span><a href="#42794114">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42795205">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42797056">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42795312">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42795312">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think this misses the deeper relationship between the Falun Gong and western intelligence agencies, that goes beyond just &quot;pandering to right-wing nuts&quot; after a period of &quot;spontaneous&quot; support from mainstream western organizations.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42797056" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42797056" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">keybored</span><span>|</span><a href="#42794114">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42795057">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42795205">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42794548">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42797056">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42797056">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The organic reasons seem straightforward enough. In its context it’s an interesting perspective on a certain type of left-wing experience from that era.  It fits in with a wider discussion.  In the mainstream however it gets co-opted as (1) this is how left-wing structures work, they’re all like this, and (2) they’re just tyrannies with extra and indirect steps.  Ergo traditional structures were right all along.  No need to think about it.

There have been &quot;left-wing&quot; groups that have a strong hierarchy,  such as Lenin&#x27;s Bolsheviks,  but groups like that have limited appeal to most people by the 1960s [2] [3].  There are also the various membership-based groups such as the Sierra Club and NOW which have limited effectiveness because they aren&#x27;t accountable to members [4]<p>So conflicts like the above vex leftists because they&#x27;d like to put their egalitarian values to work.<p>My &quot;3 year&quot; case study was the time I was a leader in the Tompkins County Green Party.  After the 2000 Ralph Nader campaign we had a lot of energy and decided we wanted to build an organization to contest local elections.  We had luck early on taking advantage of fusion voting [5] to decisively settle a power struggle within the local Democratic party so people perceived we had power.<p>There were about 50 people who turned up to meetings,  but 3 or 4 people had the time and energy to do the work,  I don&#x27;t think we formed a clique,  we would have accepted just about anyone who was basically aligned with us and willing to put in the work.  I ran a web site and plastered the town with posters and mostly did as I pleased except for the few times somebody said &quot;you went too far with that poster&quot;,  that is,  most of the members were basically deferential to the people who did the work.<p>As time went on though the issue of being a spoiler [6] came up over and over again.  We got a famous green thinker who was shortlisted for the 2004 <i>Presidential</i> race by the national party [7] to run for mayor,  but people in our own party were afraid &quot;if we run Glover,  the cop is going to win&quot;.  Each time we the prospect of running a candidate happened the group would split in half and by the 2004 race we couldn&#x27;t really go forward because locally, statewide, and nationally we couldn&#x27;t make up our mind if we even wanted to run a candidate.  My strongly held opinion was &quot;Fuck &#x27;em&quot; when it came to the Democrats and that a political party that didn&#x27;t run candidates had no reason to exist;  but I couldn&#x27;t force that opinion on people that I felt a representative of and the other leaders felt the same way so we folded the organization up.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Koch_network" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Koch_network</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;genius.com&#x2F;The-beatles-revolution-lyrics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;genius.com&#x2F;The-beatles-revolution-lyrics</a><p>[3] A Leninist would say you&#x27;re a poseur if you aren&#x27;t part of an organization with the resolve and discipline to smash the capitalist class and the state the supports it.<p>[4] A case study in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotpedia.org&#x2F;Fusion_voting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotpedia.org&#x2F;Fusion_voting</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;articles&#x2F;reflections-on-the-2000-u-s-presidential-election&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;articles&#x2F;reflections-on-the-2000-u...</a><p>[7] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paul_Glover_(activist)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paul_Glover_(activist)</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42794548" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42794548" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">romanhn</span><span>|</span><a href="#42794114">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42795057">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42794812">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42794548">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42794548">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;d love to hear more about how an org structure (or lack thereof) killed a public company in 3 weeks.</div><br/><div id="42794983" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42794983" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lkrubner</span><span>|</span><a href="#42794114">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42794548">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42794949">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42794983">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42794983">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is one of the main topics that I teach entrepreneurs about.<p>I wrote something reasonably short here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;respectfulleadership.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;to-grow-you-must-build-a-beautiful" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;respectfulleadership.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;to-grow-you-must...</a><p>I wrote something much longer here, but this material is mostly from other CTOs who I surveyed:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;respectfulleadership.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;a-survey-of-ctos-how-flat-should" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;respectfulleadership.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;a-survey-of-ctos...</a><p>If you are in New York City, we have 2 different speakers who will speak to 2 different aspects of this problem, at our event on February 27th.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42794949" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42794949" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PaulHoule</span><span>|</span><a href="#42794114">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42794548">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42794983">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42794812">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42794949">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42794949">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">See<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?client=firefox-b-1-e&amp;q=etoy+vs+etoys" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?client=firefox-b-1-e&amp;q=etoy+vs...</a><p>First you need to know how conformist the culture was in the 1990s,  when my wife and I would visit Manhattan we looked like two hippie throwbacks to the 1960s and got told we were the weirdest looking people in the city.  I couldn&#x27;t have stood to live there because you would look up and see a Tommy Hilfiger billboard and look down and see a lot of people wearing Tommy and if you couldn&#x27;t take it, you couldn&#x27;t take it. You couldn&#x27;t get as good of a cup of coffee as you could get at an indy espresso bar in a small town in a flyover state because there was a Starbucks on every block to convince stock market analysts that it was like that coast to coast.<p>In Dec 1999 there were the WTO riots which have broken the WTO ever since (e.g. the old &quot;corn law&quot; fight over free trade in agriculture reached the impasse it at now) and it had an effect that washed over everyone.  For a few weeks there was a wave of honesty,  for instance I saw an article in the tech press that somebody went to a Microsoft press conference and he was bored out his mind.<p>So when Etoy had their domain stolen by Etoys many people from radical artists to people who didn&#x27;t want to have their private property taken away rallied.  We had a system where people would visit our web site and we&#x27;d use iframes to DDOS their web site.  It ran for a few days with no effect,  then I contributed a code snippet that made the attack many times more effective and brought the site down for a short time during the last shopping day of the year.  Immediately they called the FBI who pulled the server out of the rack.<p>We put a lot of effort into public relations and talking to the media, never mind flooding stock market discussion groups with propaganda.  We knew we were being infiltrated by the FBI so we used the tactic of creating new mailing lists with (we believed) a clean list of participants periodically.  (A general answer to &quot;Eternal September&quot; problems)<p>The stock dropped precipitously when we were working on it,  and a few weeks later they settled with etoy,  an event we knew about before it was announced at their earnings call.  It wasn&#x27;t a good earnings call and the stock price spiraled downward and eventually the company folded (might have been more than three weeks but the critical part was about that long)<p>The management and IT folks at Etoys would minimize the contribution of activists,  wrote a blog about how they defeated our DDOS (but we scared them enough to call the FBI, caused a panic on the most critical day of the year, and could boast that the registration numbers that they triumphantly announced were inflated dramatically by fake users we injected) and would say that the company failed because the earnings were not good.<p>I would say,  however,  that Etoys could have been a viable business in the long term if investors believed in management,  selling toys online in 1999 was an idea with legs.

The dominant civilizations at the time were the Chinese and the Ottomans.<p>Why did Europe win? Because no one could unify Europe. It was basically a collection of states.<p>Whereas China and the Ottoman Empire were centralized. The problem with centralization is that if the guy at the top says to do something, everyone must fall in line, even if it&#x27;s a bad idea.<p>China used to have the most dominant navel fleet in the world. Then in the early 1500s, their government decided to stop building ships. Which ultimately led to them falling behind in the world order.<p>In Europe however, even if one country received a decree to stop building ships, it wouldn&#x27;t stop the others from doing so. This created a hotbed of innovation and competition that allowed them to develop rapidly. And establish dominance.<p>The trade offs between centralization and decentralization are fascinating.</div><br/><div id="42795780" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42795780" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jandrese</span><span>|</span><a href="#42795033">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42799586">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42795780">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42795780">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It mirrors in a lot of ways capitalism vs. communism.  Or more precisely market based economies vs. command economies.  The ultimate problem is that efficient distribution of resources depends on the unique conditions at thousands or millions of sites across the country.  The people who are most well informed about what is needed are the people at those sites.  The fundamental problem with command economies is transmitting that information up to the central source without overwhelming the system.  Because it is way too much information to deal with they have to make simplifying assumptions, which lead to inefficiencies that compound over time.<p>The more decentralized your decision making the more efficient the system runs.  However, this has drawbacks as it becomes hard or impossible to focus on big problems.  On the flipside centralized systems are highly vulnerable to corruption.

There is no high competition (it&#x27;s concentrated by a few corporations). So deregulating it can be disastrous because it&#x27;s basically allowing a corporate monopoly to run wild.<p>If they deregulated it AND made a massive concerted effort to bring a ton of new, smaller, independent banks to the market, perhaps it could become a self-sustaining free market that truly benefits the people, with little need for government intervention.</div><br/><div id="42798747" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42798747" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TuringTest</span><span>|</span><a href="#42795033">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42796842">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42797178">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42798747">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42798747">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>As far as the market goes, I think part of the problem is that most industries are not true free markets, AKA: high competition, low barriers to entry.</i><p>That sounds like the classic &quot;if all you have is a hammer, all problems look like nails&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s true that decentralised decision making can make good use of local information. But you&#x27;re ignoring the kind of problems that are created by decentralisation itself, so they can&#x27;t be fixed by more of it.<p>A system that is being optimized with only local information is prone to getting stuck in local minima, situations which can be very far from the true optimum.<p>To escape from the local minima you need to gather global information compiled from the whole system, and use it to alter the decisions that individual actors would make from just their locally achievable information.<p>That&#x27;s the role of regulation, and why regulated markets work better than chaotic ones. Regulation can make individuals coordinate to achieve larger goals than what&#x27;s possible without it. And to enforce effective regulation you need some kind of authority, which is centralised.<p>Of course that raises the question of how that authority is created and what goals does it set; for that, we get politics, with various groups trying to influence what the authority will decree and whose interests it will pursue harder.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42797178" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42797178" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">keybored</span><span>|</span><a href="#42795033">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42795946">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42796564">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42799586">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42797178">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42797178">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; 100% agree.

Denying this reality can hinder effective action and accountability.<p>* Informal leadership is often hidden: In structureless groups, leadership often arises organically and is not formally recognized. This can lead to decisions being made by a small, unaccountable group, often based on personal relationships rather than merit.<p>* Lack of structure can empower the privileged: Without clear roles and decision-making processes, those with existing social or economic advantages may have an undue influence, silencing marginalized voices.<p>* Formal structure can be beneficial: By acknowledging and formalizing leadership roles and decision-making processes, groups can ensure greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity.<p>Essentially, Freeman argues that embracing a degree of structure, rather than blindly rejecting it, is crucial for creating truly equitable and effective groups.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42794695" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42794695" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bell-cot</span><span>|</span><a href="#42797991">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42795600">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42794695">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42794695">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sounds like she majored in Mathematics - but Wikipedia say Political Science.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jo_Freeman" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jo_Freeman</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42794729" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42794729" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">killjoywashere</span><span>|</span><a href="#42795600">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42794729">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42794729">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Every data structure comes with costs.

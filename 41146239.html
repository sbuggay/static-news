There was a LOT of global variables (seemingly random 4 uppercase letters) controlling everything.<p>At some point, the application had some bugs which were not appearing when the application was run in debug mode in Visual Studio. The solution was obvious: installing Visual Studio for each customer on site and teaching the users to run the app in debug mode from Visual Studio. I don&#x27;t know how they convinced the users to do this and how they managed with the license but it was done.<p>What happened next was even worse.<p>There was no version control of course, the code being available on a shared disk on the local network of the company with the code copied over in multiple folders each having its own version, with no particular logic to it either, V1, V2, V2.3, V2a, V2_customer_name, V2_customer_name_fix, ...<p>After that, when there was a problem for a customer, the programmer went there to debug and modified the code on site. If the bug&#x2F;problem was impacting other customers, we had to dispatch some guys for each customer to go copy&#x2F;edit the code for all of them. But if the problem was minor, it was just modified there, and probably saved on the shared folder in some new folder.<p>What happened next was to be expected: there was no consensus on what was the final version, each customer having slightly different versions, with some still having bugs fixed years before for others.</div><br/><div id="41152007" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41152007" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">onion2k</span><span>|</span><a href="#41147787">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41147832">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41152007">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41152007">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>I don&#x27;t know how they convinced the users to do this and how they managed with the license but it was done</i><p>Enterprise and business users will wade through endless swamps of crap if the software provides enough value.

Whenever files changed it would just auto commit on the main branch with the username included in the message.

Previous consultants left no documentation or anything, and a running Hadoop cluster handling (live!) 300 credit card transactions a second. Management hired 8 junior sysadmins - who were all windows sysadmins, had never used Linux before, and were expected to take over running this Linux cluster immediately. They all looked at me white as ghosts when I brought up SSH prompt, that’s the point where I learned they were all windows sysadmins.<p>2. Another company: all Java and MySQL developers who were trying to use Spark on Hadoop, refusing to learn anything new they ended up coding a Java app that sat on a single node, with a mysql database on the same node, that “shelled out” to a single trivial hello-world type function running in spark, then did the rest of the computation in Java on the single node, management celebrated a huge success of their team now using “modern cluster computing” even though the 20 node cluster did basically nothing and was 99.99% idle. (And burning huge $ a month)<p>3. Another company: setup a cluster then was so desperate to use the cluster for everything installed monitoring on the cluster, so when the cluster went down, monitoring and all observability went down too<p>4. A Cassandra cluster run by junior sys-admins and queried by junior data scientists had this funny arms race where the data scientists did what was effectively “select * from *” for every query and the sysadmins noticing the cluster was slow, kept adding more nodes, rather than talk to each other things just oscillated back and forwards with costs spiralling out of control as more and more nodes were deployed<p>Any many more!<p>This might sound like I’m ragging on juniors a bit but that’s definitely not the case - most of these problems were caused by bad management being cheap and throwing these poor kids into the deep end with no guidance. I did my best to upskill them rapidly and I’m still friends with many of them today, even though it’s nearly 10 years later now,<p>Good times!</div><br/><div id="41148355" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41148355" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">llmblockchain</span><span>|</span><a href="#41147787">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41148290">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41149802">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41148355">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41148355">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Senior&quot; holds no weight with me.

We truly did not know if we were capable of doing that. It is possible if that server was destroyed and we couldn’t restore from a back up it would take us an unknown amount of time.

You spend a lot of time on reading and learning skills. Version control? Wow, cool, what&#x27;s git, let&#x27;s try that! A new graphing library? Let&#x27;s give that a shot, maybe it&#x27;ll make things easier! You want XYZ? Let me go read about that for a day.<p>- No one having any idea what&#x27;s even possible: being treated like a wizard for introducing the tiniest piece of automation or improvement that makes someone&#x27;s day easier or doing something they never thought was possible. Lots of appreciation and excitement for showing and teaching people new things (... and I know this is somewhat selfish and ego driven, but who doesn&#x27;t like being appreciated?)<p>- Similarly people having no idea how long those things should take which, tbh, can be a nightmare if you&#x27;re not trusted and respected enough to be consulted but also great if people believe you when you say it&#x27;s gonna take 3 months.<p>- Beyond the basics just being mostly kinda left alone to do your job however: no standups or tickets or the 30 other kinds of daily (micro)management that is probably necessary but ends up feeling tiresome and stifling at an individual level<p>- Not being part of software company &quot;culture&quot;: no performance review driven development and promo packet madness, no weird rating and ranking systems, no OGPs or KPIs. No ladder. Your bosses think you did what was required of you, so then you&#x27;re good, and if it&#x27;s a good year you get a raise, and that&#x27;s that. I do recognize that with a bad boss this can be a terrible and unfair spot to be in - but again, subjectively with a decent enough boss it felt like a lot less weight on my shoulders at the time.<p>- No hacker ninja pirate segway mini quadcopter you&#x27;re the smartest people in the world and we&#x27;re the best company to work for sort of b.s.<p>- Socializing with people who are good at and love to talk about stuff other than software<p>Reading over that, I&#x27;m thinking maybe I lucked out a lot and that wasn&#x27;t most people&#x27;s experience from that era.

This functionality was not part of our actual source control system, but was instead accomplished with a series of csh shell scripts you could run after ssh&#x27;ing into our development server.<p>Each of our customers had a &#x27;master&#x27; jar file that represented the actual final compiled product (a jar file is really a zip file archive, which bundles together the resulting compiled java class files).<p>Once you had finished implementing your code changes, you ran another set of scripts which found the master jar file for each customer, unzips it, copies the compiled files from your local machine into it, and zips it back up again. Finally the source control lock is released.<p>This means, effectively, that the codebase was never compiled as a whole at any point in the process, instead, we just manually patched the jar file over time with individually compiled class files.<p>Over the years, small errors in the process allowed a huge amount of inconsistencies to creep into the codebase. Race conditions would allow two developers to lock the same file at once, or a developer would change a class that was a dependency of some other code that somebody else was changing. Sometimes code changes would make it into some of the customer jar files, but not others. Nobody knew why.<p>It took a small team two years to migrate the entire codebase to git with proper CI, and a huge chunk of that time was reproducing a version of the codebase that actually compiled properly as a whole.

Systems to &quot;lock&quot; files you were working on were pretty common because basically nobody did merges well.

There&#x27;s a reason why that&#x27;s there - at the time it was written, source control was clunky and a pain in the ass to set up, so a lot of smaller companies or ones with less mature development teams never got around to it.<p>I may be getting a little &quot;old man yells at clouds&quot; here, but be really thankful that Git is FOSS, ubiquitous, works great for 98% of projects, and is superlatively awesome compared to everything that came before it.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2000&#x2F;08&#x2F;09&#x2F;the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2000&#x2F;08&#x2F;09&#x2F;the-joel-test-12-s...</a></div><br/><div id="41148055" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41148055" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fiddlerwoaroof</span><span>|</span><a href="#41146789">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41147959">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41151181">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41148055">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41148055">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I use CVS, RCS and Subversion on my personal projects for several years before I learned git.

Basically, we also had a way to share control with one other person, and the person who was taking the second source were responsible for updating both versions at the same time manually (which never happened, so implementing a large project that touched hundreds of source files had to dedicate a couple weeks to manually hand comparing files, manually implementing the changes, and then manually retesting)</div><br/></div></div><div id="41146829" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41146829" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sir-dingleberry</span><span>|</span><a href="#41146789">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41147601">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41147015">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41146829">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41146829">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is insane.

The problem was that the system didn&#x27;t allow them to say: please, don&#x27;t send this again. And the non-natural intelligence at the central base decided to send this set again. When my youngest started working - they were loading this set back <i>for the seventh time.</i><p>Why &#x27;loading&#x27;? Because no one could find a way in the program to send this ill-fated set back on the same truck that brought it. No one, except my youngest, that is.

One of my many terrible inventions was as follows:<p>Originally our company only did business in one marketplace (the UK). When we started doing business in multiple marketplaces, it came time to modify the system to cope with more than one. Our system assumed, _everywhere_, that there was only ever one marketplace. I had a plan: I would copy-paste the system, make an &quot;international&quot; version that supported many marketplaces, then transition over our original marketplace to the international version and shut down the old system. This way, everyone could keep working on the original marketplace like normal, they&#x27;d get the new marketplaces on the new system, and we&#x27;d do a clean cutover once ready.<p>It started out quite well. I got the international version working and onboarded our first new marketplace. The business was very happy, there was lots of opportunity in the new marketplaces. They asked that I delay the cutover from the old system and focus on developing things for these new marketplaces. After all, the old system still works for our original marketplace, we can move it over once our work is done on the new marketplaces. I said yes, of course!<p>It&#x27;s now 5 years later, it turns out there&#x27;s a lot to do in those other marketplaces. To say that the system is split-brained is an understatement. When training new hires, we teach them the difference between a &quot;product&quot; and an &quot;international product&quot;. When either system does something, it double checks and cross-references with the other system via a colourful assortment of HTTP APIs. There are a variety of database tables that we &quot;froze&quot; in the old system and continued in the new system, so you could tell that an ID referred to something in the new system or the old system if it was above or below the magic number we froze it at. We have overarching BI dashboards that query both systems to produce results, and they have to heavily manipulate the old system&#x27;s data to fit with the new multi-marketplace model, and any other changes we made. Both systems are extremely tightly coupled, the old one is a ball and chain to the new one, but the new one is so tightly integrated into it that there&#x27;s no hope of separating them now.<p>I&#x27;ve learned to say no since then.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41149960" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41149960" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cmpalmer52</span><span>|</span><a href="#41148328">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41146762">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41149960">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41149960">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I once had a project to turn a customer’s Excel VBA application into a real application (I used ASP.Net).

Once I printed the VBA code because it was hard to navigate and it was like 250+ pages printed out rather compactly.<p>The worse part wasn’t the code itself (although it was bad), but the fact that there was so much abandoned paths in it and there would be three or more different versions of crucial functions with the same name (or sometimes a different name but doing the same thing) in different places and sometimes all being called by different paths in the workflow. Or not being called at all.<p>And it was very math heavy (calculating natural gas pressures and flow rates through different sized pipes and fittings and sizing regulators to meet certain loads). Think Excel formulas on cells that referenced 15-20 other cells, each of which was a formula on their own that referenced other pages and cells, some of which were filled by VBA. And that wasn’t even involving the VBA code full of brute force solvers for multi-variable equations that used heuristics he’d worked out by trial and error (if it’s a delta over 1.5, add 5 to this variable, otherwise subtract 3, but if the delta was less than 0.5, add 1 and so on - it eventually converged or found no solution, but a binary solved did the same thing, only faster and easier).<p>It took me and a junior developer several months, during which, of course, multiple change requests were going through to make it multiuser and secure.<p>Both my nightmare project and one that I’m very proud of once it was completed.</div><br/><div id="41151262" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41151262" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jahewson</span><span>|</span><a href="#41149960">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41146762">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41151262">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41151262">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">By the end of the first sentence I thought “that sounds like engineering” (the real kind).

Customer paid us, and I would take a look.<p>I had one customer who came back with the same request, slightly differently worded, every single month, and every single month I&#x27;d say the same thing.  They had this site they were running that was essentially a Yellow Pages type site.  They had a large set of companies with contact details, each with multiple business categories associated with it.  You&#x27;d choose a category, and they&#x27;d return a list of matching companies.<p>The problem was the site was really slow.  I took a quick look around, and saw that all the time was lost querying the database.  Taking a quick look at the schema I discovered that their approach to categorisation was to have a TEXT column, with semicolon separated 4 character strings in it.  Each 4 character string mapped to a business category.<p>So when someone wanted to load up, say, all pest control companies, it would check the category mapping table, get the 4 character string, and then go to the companies table and do:<p><pre><code>    SELECT * FROM companies WHERE categories LIKE &quot;%PEST%&quot;

So on each page load of the main page type the site was there to provide, it did a full text search over the category field for every single record in the company table.<p>I guess that&#x27;s probably okay for the developer without real world scale data, and real world traffic counts to worry about.  But they had lots of data in the database, and that category field could have dozens of categories against a company.  As soon as they had more than about 4-5 simultaneous customers performance started tanking.<p>I could never get them to accept that they needed to rethink the database schema.  One month they were bleating about how is it possible that Google can manage to do such a search across a much larger amount of data, much faster.  They really didn&#x27;t like my answer that amounted to &quot;By having a sane database schema&quot;.  All they were willing to do was pay over the odds for our most powerful server at the time, which had enough capacity to hold the entire database in memory.</div><br/><div id="41147191" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41147191" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwup238</span><span>|</span><a href="#41147149">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41149727">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41147191">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41147191">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In case anyone is looking for a performant way to implement categories like that in Postgres: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33251745">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33251745</a><p>I stumbled across that comment a few years back and it changed the way I handle tags and categories so just sharing it here.

PT allows for custom HUDs to be saved&#x2F;exported&#x2F;shared, and there is a cottage industry building and selling such HUDS. These HUDs can often bundle hundreds of custom stats - basically a subset of SQL queries, a simple example would be &quot;times_raised &#x2F; opportunities_to_raise WHERE position= &#x27;button&#x27;&quot;, that sort of thing.<p>For performance reasons these custom stats are cached, which obviously makes some sense. However, each cached stat creates a new column in the custom_cache table of PT4&#x27;s current database, a PostgreSQL 9.0 backend. If you play mostly Heads-Up SNG or the 3-handed Spins, it&#x27;s actually quite easy to go over the (IIRC) 4096 column limit there by purchasing and importing one too many fancy HU HUD packages!<p>This completely borks PT4, it can no longer open - and players can no longer make money! In my previous work, I&#x27;ve supported many a player and fixed this &quot;too many columns&quot; error numerous times (by deleting enough custom HUDs from their account until the PT4 can start up correctly once more).

That might just be due to me not being too comfortable with SQL and databases generally.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41146784" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41146784" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JadeNB</span><span>|</span><a href="#41146527">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41146764">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41147560">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41146788">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41146784">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41146784">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Not having to write and perform migrations for every small schema change is a bore, but it means your software doesn&#x27;t have to worry about handling different versions of data.<p>Is that &quot;not&quot; at the front supposed to be there?</div><br/><div id="41147125" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41147125" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dvdkon</span><span>|</span><a href="#41146527">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41146784">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41146788">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41147125">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41147125">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks, edited.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41146788" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41146788" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">layer8</span><span>|</span><a href="#41146527">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41146734">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41146764">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41147507">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41146788">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41146788">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; remodeling data types and schemas (which you often do as you build an application, whether or not you thought of a great schema beforehand)<p>This is not my experience, it only happens rarely.

But not the way most people realize.<p>Constraints affect outcomes in (at least) three ways:<p><pre><code>  - by absolute limitation (you cannot violate these)
  - by path of least resistance (the constraint makes X easier)
  - by strategy (creative use of knowledge &amp; skills leads to novel solutions)

---<p>There is an injured person on top of a mountain, and they need medical attention. You need to go up the mountain, get them, and bring them down.<p>You only have so much strength&#x2F;endurance, so nothing you do will ever be faster than what your body is capable of. You need to get up and down in less than two hours. You need to carry an injured person. The mountain has two slopes: a long gradual one, and a short steep one.<p>Most people would climb the long gradual slope, because it&#x27;s the path of least resistance. But it will take 4x as long to climb up and down it. Climbing straight up the steep slope would be incredibly tiring, and unsafe to bring someone down.<p>You can, however, zig-zag up and down the steep hill. It will take more time than going straight up, but faster than the long way, you will be less tired, and it&#x27;s safer to bring someone down hill.<p>---<p>Constraints can be good and bad. Good use of constraints can allow you to get something done effectively. Bad use of constraints leads to failure. So it&#x27;s important to have someone who can utilize those constraints effectively.<p>Vision, leadership, and wisdom is more important than the people, skills, materials, or time involved.

It was basically an app to allow people to create a form for their school’s evaluation criteria and then submit those forms. Sounds super straightforward, right? It was. The catch was our team was 2 CS undergrad, a masters CS student, and a high school student. All with no professional experience. We knew <i>nothing</i>. Well kind of but more on that in a second. Our manager was absolutely non technical. In fact they were the second highest person in the company (fairly small company) and were managing our project and a bunch of other stuff at the company. And somehow with almost 0 oversight we built a functional Django application that the business was able to sell and make money from. My favorite highlights were 1) the codebase was initially shared over FTP (“Hey you’re not editing file X, right? Oh you are? Ah woops I just overwrote all your changes.”) till someone intelligently suggested “Uhhh Git?” 2) the actual best programmer amongst us was the high schooler. They suggested Django, picked the DB, they suggested using Celery to speed up async work, Redis for caching, and yes, “Uhh Git?” In retrospect the only reason we succeeded was because of them. They were like top 5 on the stack overflow Code Golf site IIRC. 3) My interview was basically showing my aforementioned manager who had never coded in his life a project I worked on at school and him being like “Yeah looks good. You’re hired.”<p>With 10 years of hindsight, I cringe thinking back to all the bad decisions I pushed for and the no-doubt terrible code I wrote. But I also marvel and look back fondly at being given a shot and being in an environment where I could just build something from the ground up and learn everything soup to nuts on the job.

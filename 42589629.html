It always appears to me that such ideas and things like the &quot;execution formula&quot; should have profound implications on static analysis of algorithms and things like abstract interpretation and collapsing stacks of interpreters.<p>Has there been any literature on concrete steps in this direction, or is there anything holding back Girard&#x27;s theories from practical application (I know that Girard&#x27;s Geometry of Interaction was supposed to have problems with additives, of which exact implications I do not quite comprehend, which may or may not be relevant)?</div><br/></div></div><div id="42593457" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42593457" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">woolion</span><span>|</span><a href="#42593379">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42592291">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42593457">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42593457">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is an implementation of Girard&#x27;s &quot;transcendental syntax&quot; program which aims to give foundations to logic that do not rely on axiomatics and a form of tarskian semantics (tarskian semantics is the idea that &quot;A &amp; B&quot; is true means that &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; is true; you&#x27;ve simply changed the and to a &quot;meta&quot; one rather than the logical one). This program is more than 10 years old, with first written versions appearing around 2016, and the ideas appearing in his talks before that.<p>Girard has been a vocal critic of foundational problems, labeling them as &quot;hell levels&quot;, with the typical approach of set theory and tarskian semantics as the lowest one and category theory as a &quot;less worse&quot; one (at least one level above). 
One issue with his program is that he mixes abstract, philosophical ideas with technical ones.
So even if some things have interesting technical applications, they may be different when seen from a more philosophical point of view. 
For instance, set theory as the foundations of mathematics is a pretty solid model but it is seen as fundamentally unsatisfying for many reasons -- most famously the continuous hypothesis. Gödel and other very high-profile mathematicians thought it was a very unsatisfying issue even though from a mathematical model theory point of view, it&#x27;s not even a paradox. 
So the new foundational approaches tend to have maybe deeper philosophical problems about them; for example see Jacob Lurie&#x27;s critic of the Univalent foundations program (after the &quot;No comment&quot; meme he expressed a long list of issues with it).<p>The other issue with this particular work is that it uses new vocabulary for everything to avoid the bagage of usual mathematical logic, but it kind of give a weird vibe to the work and make it hard to get into without dedicating much work.<p>The result is therefore something that is supposed to solve many longstanding problems in philosophical and technical approaches to the foundations of mathematics but has not had a big impact on the community. This is not too surprising either because the lambda calculus or other logical works were seen as trivial mathematical games. 
We&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s a case of it being too novel to be appreciated fully, and this work seems to try to explore it in a technical way to answer this question.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;girard.perso.math.cnrs.fr&#x2F;Logique.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;girard.perso.math.cnrs.fr&#x2F;Logique.html</a> (in French, it gives an overview of the program)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;girard.perso.math.cnrs.fr&#x2F;Archives.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;girard.perso.math.cnrs.fr&#x2F;Archives.html</a> (transcendental syntax papers are there in English)</div><br/></div></div><div id="42592291" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42592291" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">idlewords</span><span>|</span><a href="#42593457">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42592315">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42592291">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42592291">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is so French that a baguette appeared in my hand after I clicked the theory link.

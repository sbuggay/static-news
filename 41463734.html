We did a test picking a few 1000 users randomly and force them to convert: they all stopped using it, even though many of them use it daily.

Non-profit organizations can and often do generate revenue that exceeds their expenses, in other words... profit. The key distinction is how that surplus is used. In a non-profit:<p>- Profits are reinvested to support the organization&#x27;s goals and activities.
- There are no owners or shareholders who receive dividend payments.
- Any surplus funds are typically used to expand services, improve operations, or build financial reserves for future needs.<p>Non-profits still need to be financially secure.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

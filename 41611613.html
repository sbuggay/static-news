Things like &quot;the total amount of energy in there must remain the same&quot;, or &quot;the total amount of angular momentum has to remain the same&quot;.<p>Let&#x27;s look at spin (which is a cousin to classical angular momentum) because that&#x27;s one of the properties folks like to work with in entanglement experiments.<p>If you create a new pair of particles, the total spin before they get created is zero, so the total spin after they get created also has to be zero. Thus whatever spin one particle has (when measured along a certain axis) the other has to be opposite.. by dint of our knowledge about the closed system that the particles inhabit.<p>Saying that they are &quot;entangled&quot; does more to represent the knowledge we have about how the particles were created than it does to represent something special about the particles themselves.<p>And this entanglement only holds as long as the wave function does not collapse, because that represents the cling-wrap around the fact that they exist within a perfectly closed system. Allowing the particles to interact with their environment in some uncontrolled fashion for example would ruin our closed-system guarantee, thus losing any measurable entanglement. They would not longer be guaranteed to have opposite spin because some other phenomena dumped some un-accounted-for amount of spin into the two-particle system.<p>So the answer to &quot;How can an entangled system be differentiated from a nonentangled system?&quot; is exactly &quot;Do you have some closed-system guarantee of a precise total amount of spin (or other conserved&#x2F;symmetric quantity) that all parts of the system must add up to?&quot;<p>This also means that if some experimenter knows the exact total spin of a given closed system, and another experimenter does not know that total, then the entanglement is only relevant to the experimenter who knows the total.<p>Does that perspective help?

There is a whole class of tasks that you can do only if you have access to entangled systems. Take another one to see how the implication you state doesn&#x27;t follow.<p>For example, quantum teleportation is only possible if you have a source that produces entangled particles. If I want to test that you have such a source, I can give you a random state (which only I know), and ask you to teleport it to a far away location [1]. If you indeed have an entangled particle source, then you can successfully teleport the state 100% of the time. However, because measurements in quantum mechanics are probabilistic, I can&#x27;t actually single-shot verify that you teleported the correct state. So we will have to repeat this task many times [2], and with each success I will be more and more sure that you have an entangled state source.<p>Now coming to your musing above: &quot;rather indicates which types of statistics govern a class of systems produced en mass&quot;<p>You can see why this is not consistent with the repeated teleportation experiment. If every single teleportation test succeeded individually, then every iteration must have involved an entangled state. The repeat is only because of my inability to verify in single-shot.

However, Bob doesn&#x27;t know what result Alice obtained.

In fact, if you perform a Bell-style experiment exactly like this (with the two measurements in the two galaxies along the same axis), you&#x27;ll get this same un-interesting result. The problem is that it works like more than this too.<p>Say you have two billiard balls on a very very large table with almost no friction. One ball is stationery, the other is moving towards it and spinning along some axis. When they collide, they&#x27;ll be sent along some random directions and each with some spin, and their spins are going to add up to the original spin of the moving ball (angular momentum is conserved in frictionless interactions in classical mechanics too). Now, when the ball arrive at a long distance away from each other, two experimenters which can&#x27;t see the balls measure their spin. They each choose some direction and measure how much their ball spins along that direction. They repeat the experiment lots of times, keeping good track of each individual result.<p>When they later compare notes, they&#x27;ll measure how much their respective results for each individual experiment were correlated. Since they were measuring along different axis, they didn&#x27;t both see the exact same result: maybe for the ball that reached one was spinning at one revolution along the 45° axis every two seconds, and the other was spinning at half a revolution along the 1° axis every second. Ultimately, they&#x27;ll find that the correlation between their experiments was about 75% (each time they measure along unrelated axis, they get no correlation, when they happen to measure along the exact same axis, they get perfect correlation, and when it&#x27;s in between, it&#x27;s some subset of that).<p>However, if we repeat the same thing with quantum particles, we actually find a higher correlation, about 85%. This can only happen if (a) measuring one particle changes the other - and we&#x27;ve quickly ruled out that this can happen at slower than light speeds, or (b) the particle pair don&#x27;t share a definite state to begin with, but assume an appropriate state only when they are measured [or (c) the axis chosen by the experimenters in each measurement somehow depends on the spin of the particle pair].</div><br/></div></div><div id="41613444" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41613444" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tbrownaw</span><span>|</span><a href="#41612711">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41613295">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41615152">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41613556">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41613444">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41613444">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Except that experiments have ruled out hidden variables.

Based on the FCC Wikipedia article I do however think your premise is flawed:<p>1) you presume a collider only brings value if it can definitively prove&#x2F;refute a theory, but the Wikipedia article lists a number of incremental improvements (ruling out &quot;a very broad class of models for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) in the GeV – tens of TeV mass scale&quot; as explanations for dark matter, improvements &quot;in precision measurements of Electroweak precision observables&quot; which supports other research, as well as &quot;new avenues in the study of the collective properties of quarks and gluons&quot;). Can you prove these incremental improvements have a lower RoI than other experiments that we&#x27;re currently ignoring?<p>2) the 17bn euro don&#x27;t disappear into a black hole. The development of these experiments requires R&amp;D in areas (e.g. cryogenics &amp; magnetics) that have produced a lot of value, but are often expensive to advance. Pushing these fields means that a portion of the budget will follow your suggestion, but it will be focused on important topics. It&#x27;s hard for me to gauge the RoI of your suggested approach because you haven&#x27;t suggested such a focus - can you give some examples?<p>In conclusion: you&#x27;re treating the RoI of accelerators as boolean, but it&#x27;s not. There&#x27;s a bunch of definitive incremental improvements as well as useful side effects, even when disregarding the potential for discovering unknown physics.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41614101" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41614101" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fnord77</span><span>|</span><a href="#41612642">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41613266">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614330">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41613099">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41614101">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41614101">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">which is why it was a crying shame the Texas Supercollider got canceled.

If you have literature that suggests otherwise I&#x27;d be happy to read it.<p>&gt;Funding Israel’s conflicts is not a fundamental part of our way of life.<p>The specifics may not be, but the purpose of an extensive global military presence is fundamentally about creating or exploiting these inequalities wherever they arise for material aims. This is reflected by the fact that the action we take is directly proportional to the material value intervention would have to our bottom line.<p>SA killing Kashoggi or contributing to direct attacks? Cool, long as they got $&#x2F;oil. Israel doing war crimes? Cool, long as they keep buying their arms from us and their ire focused on those we don&#x27;t care for. Country getting worked over by our &#x27;rival&#x27; ie taiwan or ukraine? Give them all the money and arms.<p>I&#x27;m not even trying to argue the merit of any of these decisions, I just don&#x27;t agree any analysis is as simple as &quot;stronger military = safer better happier fun time pax romana&quot;.</div><br/><div id="41615089" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41615089" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AmericanChopper</span><span>|</span><a href="#41612642">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614251">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614427">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41615089">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41615089">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Globalization is not at all designed to exploit inequalities, it is in fact the exact opposite. The purpose of globalization is to increase the efficiency of the global economy, and the effect that has is to minimize inequality. Which is how China has ended up with the worlds largest middle class, Mexico has ended up with a very respectable middle class, and the middle class in India is growing at quite an impressive rate, despite all the other problems those countries have. It is also the reason that hunger&#x2F;malnutrition and deprivation in general have been on a rather steady downwards trend over the past 80 years, &quot;the 99%&quot; are the primary benefactors of the improvements in quality of life that it has brought with it.<p>None of this would be possible without the security provided by the militaries of the western democracies. Strong militaries don&#x27;t cause this outcome, but they are 100% required if you are trying to create it. The only way to prevent all of those bad things that you have the described western militaries doing from happening where you live is to have the protection of a strong military yourself. This is such a plainly obvious fact, denying it is about on par with the &quot;defund the police&quot; rationale. Sure they can do bad things, and that can be addressed, but society needs the military possibly even more than it needs the police.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41614427" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41614427" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pstuart</span><span>|</span><a href="#41612642">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41613572">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41613676">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41613200">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41614427">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41614427">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The last two wars (Afghanistan and Iraq) are estimated to have cost the US 4-6 <i>trillion</i> dollars (not to mention the lives lost and ruined).<p>It did not make us more secure or establish democracies (quite the opposite in Afghanistan).<p>I agree that we need national defense but we spend way too much with <i>zero</i> accountability.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hks.harvard.edu&#x2F;publications&#x2F;financial-legacy-iraq-and-afghanistan-how-wartime-spending-decisions-will-constrain" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hks.harvard.edu&#x2F;publications&#x2F;financial-legacy-ir...</a></div><br/><div id="41615141" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41615141" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AmericanChopper</span><span>|</span><a href="#41612642">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614427">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41613200">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41615141">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41615141">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In principal I agree, but there is a benefit that you&#x27;re missing out.

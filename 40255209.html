So being stuck working from home, I bought parts and tools to build a brand new full suspension mountain bike. Like this person it took longer than I wanted because I was missing some specialized tools (bearing and bearing press for the rear suspension) and parts I didn&#x27;t know I needed. But it all worked out in the end.<p>When the project was finished took apart my old off-the-shelf mountain bike, now all that remains of it is a frame with the paint stripped off. I plan to convert it to internal cable routing, paint it (I&#x27;ve been watching Etoe on YouTube) and then turn it into an e-bike.<p>As a side effect of buying all the tools you need to build and repair bikes, I&#x27;ve also repaired my almost two decades sold exercise bike, which had trashed ball bearings.

It was like that with Panaracer GK+ tyres, but they have to be under pressure when I don&#x27;t ride for longer periods, otherwise there are issues.

You don’t ride for a little while and soon trying to pick it back up first means tires need a lot of air… oh that one’s going flat before the end of the block… Christ, it’s the rear one, there goes the whole afternoon expecially since I’ll for-sure mess up other stuff in the process. Guess I’ll do it next time.<p>Then I don’t, and stop riding.<p>It’s crazy that my car beats every bike I’ve owned handily in both maintenance-hours-per-hour-of-use and (obviously, by a loooong shot) maintenance-hours-per-mile. And it has complex electronics and has to contain little explosions and has parts than spin thousands of times per minute! And a damn air conditioner, which is a <i>whole thing</i> all in its own! Plus only cost as much as a surprisingly small number of allegedly-minimally-decent bikes despite requiring way more mass in materials and far more complex manufacturing. Hell, the precious metals in it alone… the bikes have none or practically none of that.<p>I love riding bikes though. Negative interest in spending any time maintaining them, and taking them to the shop all the time’s impractical (now the costs are <i>really</i> crazy, plus I have to transport them there and back)<p>[edit] fwiw when I eventually get over the sticker shock at what bikes with any nice features at all cost, I’ll probably get a low-maintenance bike like yours.

One because I failed to bunny hop a curb and blew the whole thing, busting the wheel in the process, and the others because I drove over something that punctured the tube.<p>My last bike I&#x27;ve had for about 10 years til it was stolen last year, at some point I left it unattended for like 3 years, and when I picked it up again it wasn&#x27;t at perfect pressure, but certainly wasn&#x27;t flat at all, far from it, and definitely ridable.

This is a metrics problem.<p>It&#x27;s not only developers who are evaluated by using useless metrics that don&#x27;t track the value you add to an organization. Low-level managers are too.<p>Low-level managers need to evaluate the people assigned to them, they need to evaluate them objectively, and they need to give an unbiased and objectively verifiable score. This means something they can measure, such as metrics or verifiable goals.<p>If low-level managers cannot do this, they will need to answer why they gave X and Y this score whereas poor little Z who outworked them both was scored lower. Not being able to objectively justify a score is a problem that no manager wants to have, as this is a major liability.<p>Hence the bullshit metrics and absurd goals. They need something on paper to back up their decisions. A manager might be fully aware that you unblocked half your team members throughout the year with critical help, and that you are the go-to guy to solve critical issues.

A dashboard is immensely powerful for the immediate manager to know how their team is doing, identify problems and work with the members to resolve those problems. As with many things, the numbers on a dashboard must be read with context and the closer you are to that team, the better.<p>The moment the dashboard is accessed by higher ups, several things happen: The devs become scrutinized by higher-ups that do not have all the context to make sense of the numbers, the manager is rendered ineffective because the knowledge and power they had while reporting to their superiors is taken away, and upper management will inevitably start caring about the numbers on the dashboard, and nothing else.<p>There is a level of &quot;managing upwards&quot; that lazy direct managers struggle with, and they just pass on the reporting numbers as-is without really caring what this might result in.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42039116" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42039116" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seb1204</span><span>|</span><a href="#42038912">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42039372">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42039422">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42039116">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42039116">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would argue that a managers time will be filled no matter what she does.

You also need to plan things, you need to know what&#x27;s changing over time, you need to test whether your processes are working. I use metrics to measure the aggregate impact of my influence on managing my teams, not that of any IC on any of my teams. Employee metrics are useful for a big picture view.<p>The point of the article is exactly that such metrics don&#x27;t give you any kind of a good signal <i>unless you are really into the fine details</i>. And if you <i>are</i>, then you don&#x27;t really need them in the first place.<p>&gt; quantitative details (eg a count of how much output there is)<p>For example I recently spent a week producing several thousands of lines of tedious trivial code that parses some configuration out of JSON file in pure C. Then I spent a month writing less 1k lines of very dense low-level packet parsing code and the main loop also in C. So the metrics would show you the big picture of me slacking and my performance tanking which obviously wasn&#x27;t the case. <i>You can&#x27;t substitute actually knowing and understanding of what your reports are doing with some tools providing you with trivia like number of commits, lines of code changed or tickets closed.</i></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42039142" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42039142" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PaulKeeble</span><span>|</span><a href="#42039061">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42039382">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42039142">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42039142">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One project I was on someone added a tool and posted the results of the past week of number of lines of code added, my count was -5900 and I had been put at the bottom.

I think if you&#x27;re a technical team lead in a large organization, it is rather your job to point out what&#x27;s working and what&#x27;s not working from a technical perspective. If managers could figure this out, they most likely would not end up being people managers after all (insert if those kids could read meme.jpg). Sadly, nowadays even the most large tech companies have enough red tape and bullshit going on (OKRs, alignments, escalations, Q4 plannings, weekly 1:1s with all reports etc) to keep people managers full-time occupied. Most people managers nowadays neither have the chops to understand the work that&#x27;s taking place on the ground, nor have the time to track it.<p>So it falls on a tech lead to point out who are the sailors in the ship that are not rowing (or worse paddling backwards). I&#x27;m not saying &quot;go build a git commit counter dashboard&quot; but if you&#x27;re working with dozens of people and it appears someone isn&#x27;t delivering a lot of work lately, it helps you double check your assumption. (Again, not saying commits are a good metric.)<p>This blog post is definitely relatable to most of us because we join teams that are somewhat dysfunctional, and if you have the influence capital and the chops to turn that team into a place where hiring is done properly, people have motivated and the right amount of work and the room to grow, I think you can turn the ship around.

It makes much more sense to give the manager a weekly report on how the projects are progressing instead.

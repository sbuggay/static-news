The Enchiridion is short, acerbic, enlightening and funny. You don&#x27;t get that much in philosophy, and I think that author clearly appreciates that.<p>That said, in the end I think Nietzsche is right in his criticism: Stoicism works, but it limits one&#x27;s capacity for joy because to tools you use to combat negative emotion unintentionally, but necessarily, limit positive emotion.<p>I practiced Stoicism pretty seriously for a few years and it definitely improved my life, but once you&#x27;ve used it to build a solid emotional foundation, the Stoic tactics (which essentially involve always watching yourself for deviations from the Stoic path) limit your ability to experience extremes of joy.<p>There are elements of Stoicism (like negative visualisation) that are easy to integrate into life and are pretty much only positive, but for me, full-blown Stoicism is something I only bring out when I need to re-establish that solid baseline.</div><br/><div id="36102319" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36102319" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">elliotwagner</span><span>|</span><a href="#36101633">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36100655">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36102319">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36102319">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">could you share some of the books that helped you?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36100655" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36100655" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bikingbismuth</span><span>|</span><a href="#36101633">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36099407">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36100655">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36100655">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m not a professionally trained philosopher, but I have read and taken a lot of value from ancient stoic writers (Seneca in particular). I remember reading Seneca’s letters and feeling frustrated that he almost seems to get close to a denouncement of slavery, but the argument turns into more of a cosmopolitan one (in the stoic sense of the word).<p>Having grown up poor (but checking some privilege boxes), when I first discovered stoicism it really helped me comes to grips with an unjust world. As I have climbed the social ladder, I find that the more things&#x2F;privileges I have the harder it is to be stoic. I suppose this is why I like Seneca so much. He feels like a rich dude (I’m not rich but comparatively well off) who is working on not being a bad person. A lot of what I have taken from stoicism and Buddhism are lessons on how to develop a compassionate and just mindset.<p>I’m fairly skeptical of reading ancient philosophy through a modern lens. This critique had a weird tone and it seems the author might be have an issue with modern proponents of pop-stoicism and a lack of impetus for collective action. I have seen a couple similar arguments going on in Buddhism around the idea of “big-tent” Buddhism and the question of whether or not Buddhism advocates for activism.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36099407" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36099407" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seizethecheese</span><span>|</span><a href="#36100655">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36101728">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36099407">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36099407">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Reading Epictetus’ Discourses has had a profoundly positive impact on my life.<p>One note, the authors claims Arrian wrote The Discourses over four books, but in reality it was eight and only four survive.

The way in which it&#x27;s out changes according to which norms we want to critique, but the rhetoric of the article follows from there, and it&#x27;s easy to turn that against the article itself by criticizing the norms it prefers(broadly, post-structural feminism) as a virtue signal.<p>Wilson has also translated and critiqued Seneca, according to her wiki article.

  far journeys, after he had sacked Troy&#x27;s sacred citadel.
  Many were they whose cities he saw, whose minds he learned of,
  many the pains he suffered in his spirit on the wide sea,
  struggling for his own life and the homecoming of his companions.
  Even so he could not save his companions, hard though
  he strove to; they were destroyed by their own wild recklessness,
  fools, who devoured the oxen of Helios, the Sun God,
  and he took away the day of their homecoming. From some point
  here, goddess, daughter of Zeus, speak, and begin our story.
</code></pre>
Robert Fagles (1996):<p><pre><code>  Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns
  driven time and again off course, once he had plundered
  the hallowed heights of Troy.
  Many cities of men he saw and learned their minds,
  many pains he suffered, heartsick on the open sea,
  fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home.
  But he could not save them from disaster, hard as he strove —
  the recklessness of their own ways destroyed them all,
  the blind fools, they devoured the cattle of the Sun
  and the Sungod wiped from sight the day of their return.
  Launch out on his story, Muse, daughter of Zeus,
  start from where you will —sing for our time too.
</code></pre>
Emily Wilson (2017):<p><pre><code>  Tell me about a complicated man.
  Muse, tell me how he wandered and was lost
  when he had wrecked the holy town of Troy,
  and where he went, and who he met, the pain
  he suffered in the storms at sea, and how
  he worked to save his life and bring his men
  back home. He failed to keep them safe; poor fools,
  they ate the Sun God’s cattle, and the god
  kept them from home. Now goddess, child of Zeus,
  tell the old story for our modern times.
  Find the beginning.
</code></pre>
Peter Green (2018):<p><pre><code>  The man, Muse—tell me about that resourceful man, who wandered
  far and wide, when he’d sacked Troy’s sacred citadel:
  many men’s townships he saw, and learned their ways of thinking,
  many the griefs he suffered at heart on the open sea,
  battling for his own life and his comrades’ homecoming. Yet
  no way could he save his comrades, much though he longed to—
  it was through their own blind recklessness that they perished,
  the fools, for they slaughtered the cattle of Hēlios the sun god
  and ate them: for that he took from them their day of returning.
  Tell us this tale, goddess, child of Zeus; start anywhere in it!</code></pre></div><br/><div id="36101702" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36101702" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">watwut</span><span>|</span><a href="#36100186">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36101187">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36100259">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36101702">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36101702">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Willsons is better, simple as that.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36100259" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36100259" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aloneindecember</span><span>|</span><a href="#36100186">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36101115">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36100259">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36100259">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree, and your username is hilarious and appropriate given this subject matter.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

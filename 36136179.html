We can revisit these notes at a later date, with fresh eyes, having forgotten about it entirely. It adds value, not because the original idea or note was particularly great, but because of what we are then combining it with (action and experience).<p>This is also why blindly making notes isn&#x27;t effective as a form of memorizing. You are writing just to write, you have to revisit them blindly in a new way for them to become effective with a new combination. As if you are a chemist creating a new concoction previously thought impossible.<p>So let your notes app become a giant trash pile. It&#x27;s better for you, and they should do their job with proper search anyways. Don&#x27;t spend time optimizing for note link graphs or any of that BS that doesn&#x27;t help you and you absolutely will stop caring about those &quot;features&quot; in 5 months anyways.

It allows you to jot it down while it is still fresh and offload it to focus on it later. This is super helpful in ideas, jokes, thought streams, todos, one pagers on some projects, etc. It does help you remember but also allows you to move to the next thing for now.<p>Writing down ideas is like a sketchbook, ideas&#x2F;actions&#x2F;iteration of thoughts both good and bad. It is important to write thoughts down though because how many times have you had a great idea and you are like &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget this&quot; and then a while later you are wondering what that was or you entirely move on because life moves fast.<p>Creatives, writers, comedians, developers, or just projects, are better when writing is involved in ideas to realization of those ideas.<p>Writing it down and notes is a form of brainstorming. Brainstorming allows ideas to be spontaneous and allows improvisation to get to better ideas. Even writing down bad ideas because somewhere in it is something good.<p>I use notes apps but more now just a repo (super easy with  github.dev everywhere) and notes have easy history that way and you can freely add&#x2F;remove without feeling like notes are lost. When I use notes apps or even Google Docs, yes they have history but it isn&#x27;t as fluid&#x2F;quick as github for that. The important thing is find something that works for you that makes the barrier to writing it down almost non-existent. It  needs to be very easy to write things down in between busy days and to capture these fleeting moments.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36148842" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36148842" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bazinga30</span><span>|</span><a href="#36145381">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36148140">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36145442">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36148842">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36148842">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Superbly said - “it&#x27;s really the act of letting go”<p>I think if we look at note taking as a sorting &#x2F; filtering function, then maybe this article isn’t that painful to read..</div><br/></div></div><div id="36145442" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36145442" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kajecounterhack</span><span>|</span><a href="#36145381">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36148842">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36147615">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36145442">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36145442">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I use plain text files (1 markdown doc per day) + grep so kind of in line with your recommendation here.

You&#x27;re still operating off keywords<p>It&#x27;s explore vs exploit (or hash table vs graph lookup); keywords are faster if you know what you&#x27;re looking for. But reviewing linked notes leads to more exploration about related topics, and walking the graph can still be a reasonably efficient way to find what you&#x27;re looking for. If you adopt networked notes, you get both at the cost of some notetaking overhead, but it&#x27;s typically pretty small.<p>The one thing I hate about some of the notetaking apps is (and I understand folks need to make money) notes are really personal and private and need to stand the test of time. I can&#x27;t have my notes locked away in a proprietary format or held hostage by some company charging $&#x2F;mo so Notion is a no-go for me. I also don&#x27;t really want to get locked into a workflow only to find out that the app is discontinued and then have to reinvent my workflow.<p>But yeah, networked thought is still cool and totally unrelated to why I don&#x27;t use typical networked thought tools.

If you hear small facts everyday or small bits of promotion&#x2F;propaganda everyday, it can over time evoke an pavlovian like response to the information, either good or bad. Using it can also bump up things you want to know about, and be aware when external information is being pumped.<p>Basically spaced repetition mimics how you&#x27;d naturally come across something repetitively and the learning becomes automatic, it is iterative.<p>Educational games like Nicky Case makes are awesome and really do help simplify and solidify certain topics so check them out.

Spaced repetition is just a formal procedure of testing + time that taps into already prevalent repetition function to promote information to a higher place in your mind. The brain thinks if it hears about something frequently, it is more important. If those are spaced out you can stretch that but it is also naturally how we learn.<p>Spaced repetition is based on iterative learning, small bits compounding to refine skills&#x2F;memory. The point is to get it into a higher point in memory by regularly revisiting. Spaced repetition tunes into the natural repetition&#x2F;learning cycle at a point that becomes muscle memory almost. Once it is in there, the spacing can grow and it can bring that all back up.<p>In usability for instance three or less items feels simple, over seven feels complex. When you repeat something about seven times, whether that is immediate or over time, it moves to a higher importance in your mind&#x2F;memory. When you stretch these out you can train your brain via spaced repetition but it all comes back to that it is a regular iterative practice and doesn&#x27;t have to be the exact specs of spaced repetition.<p>We are habitual creatures so if you can get a pattern going of regular learning of a topic, it becomes easier to process in small chunks over time. You can also use this to program or promote ideas and products as people when they hear things over a certain amount of times, as you mention, it moves up the importance in their thought process.<p>When working on a side project for instance, if you work on it just a little bit everyday, or a medium amount every week, it will keep rolling. If you take large breaks you have to work to reload that information and it starts to stagnate. Small, repetitive and many times, spaced iterations, compound into shipping products if you set it up right. That can be used for almost anything from education to career to hobbies and more.<p>At the core of spaced repetition is the spacing (time + testing) but really the small bits that are easy to repeat. Small bits of info regularly is almost more important than the spacing, &quot;testing&quot; size almost more important than the &quot;time&quot;.<p>The spaced repetition index cards techniques are all about this, small bits of info tested over time, stretching the time to make it last longer. This is why cramming doesn&#x27;t work very long, you have to revisit regularly and over a certain amount of times with space in between and they have to be smaller chunks of information to remember, you can&#x27;t really do that when the thing is due tomorrow. Our current work environments look more like cramming projects rather than open&#x2F;closed spaced repetition and that is a problem.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36148467" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36148467" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AlexSW</span><span>|</span><a href="#36147854">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36148092">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36147927">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36148467">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36148467">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Where are you running into problems which require these mathematical techniques?

Ideas should be thought of as streams, just like thinking. Notes and writing are simply tools which are a part of that flow. Each setting of that flow has different powers of constraint. The best ideas may start with walking, but there&#x27;s the constraint of development. Writing is best for development, but you&#x27;re thinking may be less free than walking as you have more focus in development. Then editing the writing requires a different mindset. You may then publish that writing to propogate the idea for feedback.<p>So, notes are streams. You&#x27;re not saving ideas to forget them. You&#x27;re saving them to interact with them with different tooling. A relatively small portion of those ideas will ever make it to the end the flow, which is publishing. And they lose relevance to us because our context changes. An idea is important to you in a certain moment, with certain circumstances. The following day, the context has changed. Only the ideas which stick will retain their relevance. Just like only a small number of ideas will widely resonate with others.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a need to delete them. You&#x27;re context later may return to a similar enough state that old ideas become useful again, and you can refactor them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36148572" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36148572" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mo_42</span><span>|</span><a href="#36148042">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36147221">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36148572">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36148572">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I tried countless notes and productivity apps.

More time in school after high school than before. And I didn&#x27;t finish until I was 41. In the middle (if you&#x27;re counting) there were 7 years of training in a different career, a different set of oral boards (passed, btw), and a whopping total of 3 years in the work force where I was really studying for admission into grades 23-26 (aka residency).<p>If expertise is learning all the ways to fail, I must surely be an expert in learning how to learn. I even did a survey of my medical school classmates on the subject and found some trends. I then proceeded to ignore many of those trends myself, and reaped the consequences. Finally, I implemented what I was supposed to from the beginning, and ... you know what? It fucking works.<p>Do not take a laptop to class. Take handwritten notes. Take your notes in a bound volume with a few pages at the front for a table of contents (1). Fill in the table of contents later. That will force you to re-engage with your notes and figure out what it was you meant to write, and boil it down to something very pithy in the ToC.<p>I told my kids what to do. I told them I would buy all the notebooks they wanted. I would keep them. They should never throw them away. They are now crushing it. My daughter has a 3.9 in a top school. My son hasn&#x27;t finished high school and he ran out of math classes in the local community college (2).<p>I still journal. It&#x27;s not really notes now, but I sit down at least a few times a week and write down the things that happened each day. Each and every day is documented. For a number of reasons. First, for my own letting go. Second, for remembering. Third, as memoranda for the record. It&#x27;s quite hard to plagiarize page 42 of 256 pages when all the other pages are filled in too. (3)<p>(1) I strongly favor Leuchtturm1917 A5. Better papers, slightly wider, better ToC, better bookmark ribbons. I prefer dots or grid.<p>(2) the Silicon Valley community colleges have pretty solid math. There&#x27;s a story that Hewlett Packard actually stocked de Anza&#x27;s math department with HP engineers  at one point because they projected they wouldn&#x27;t be able to fill their hiring requirements without growing their own.

So I asked him how he could possibly do that, and he explained LogSeq and how he records everything so that he doesn&#x27;t have to waste mind-space remembering things that he would certainly forget anyway.<p>I tried it out, and it took a few weeks to get used to it, but saw the same benefits immediately. I find myself less mentally taxed each day because I am streaming information into my log sequence and not trying to store it in my brain. After you trust in the process, it relieves the stress on your brain to perform more powerful tasks or give you more energy. As corny as it sounds, it actually was life-changing because I instantly had more energy at the end of the day and started performing better.<p>There is a learning curve in the process. For example getting in the habit of using things like hashtags on anything you think might be worth searching later. But this quickly becomes second nature. There is also a secondary benefit of how scanning through your notes after or during a call can help you identify connections or ideas you may not have thought of in the moment.<p>Brains are good at finding patterns, expanding on ideas, and thinking creatively. But they are terrible at remembering large streams of information. By learning to harness a note tool to manage the remembering of large streams of information, it opens up our brain to do the things it is good at like expanding on ideas or being creative instead of handicapping it by trying to remember a minor tasks someone asked you to complete after the meeting wrapped up.</div><br/><div id="36148488" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36148488" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hiepph</span><span>|</span><a href="#36146531">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36147350">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36147668">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36148488">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36148488">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Someone said &quot;Brain is for ideas, not for storage&quot;.

We usually call this the &quot;super-optimizer trap&quot; internally, where we notice that a lot of users come to our app after filling up a series of other note-taking apps with data. For some people, this is just because their organization system isn&#x27;t very well thought out and therefore doesn&#x27;t scale well. However, a lot of people <i>do</i> use a well-thought out system. Getting Things Done (GTD) is mentioned in the article, but we find a lot of users that come to our app are trying Zettelkasten[2] or some variation thereof.<p>And yet... many of those people <i>also</i> have an urge to switch once they&#x27;ve used an app for a certain period of time. I think the issue is a note-taking variation of the &quot;Hedonic Treadmill&quot;. Some people are just mentally the type of person that gets a kick out of organizing their notes and thoughts. Eventually those people return to their baseline and need to switch to a new system in order to get that adrenaline fix. More concretely, we have seen that users who say they have come to Supernotes after trying many other note-taking apps are much more likely to churn, regardless of if we have the features they say they are looking for at the beginning.<p>As far as solutions go, I think one common pattern is spaced repetition (Anki being one of the best known apps for this), where the system will automatically re-surface things it wants you to remember (and not just forget). Many in the space are now trying to utilize AI (i.e. LLMs) to give even better contextual info and resurfacing, which is a promising approach. Regardless I think features like this can definitely help make an app continue to feel fresh long after the honeymoon period. We try to solve this by just having your notes be a feed (rather than just a list of documents), which allows you to occasionally find things you forgot about. Definitely a tough challenge with lots of potential solutions!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supernotes.app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supernotes.app&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.supernotes.app&#x2F;t&#x2F;trying-to-decide&#x2F;1644" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.supernotes.app&#x2F;t&#x2F;trying-to-decide&#x2F;1644</a></div><br/><div id="36146933" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36146933" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">avindroth</span><span>|</span><a href="#36146890">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36145937">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36146933">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36146933">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Supernotes is wonderful.

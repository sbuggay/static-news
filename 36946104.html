Key for me in transitioning away from that was lower THC % products. It&#x27;s was as if I wanted to enjoy a single beer after work but the only thing available was everclear. Most vape pens are billed as 85%+ THC. Now, I still enjoy cannabis, but I have a single puff of a vape pen that is around 3% THC (the rest is usually CBD) before bed. Or I take an edible that is 1.5mg THC (very low, edibles are usually sold at 5-10mg doses). It&#x27;s a much different relationship. I don&#x27;t feel like my mind is racing out of control, I don&#x27;t build up a massive tolerance. I sleep fine without it. It&#x27;s startling to think that a single puff of a 90% pen is literally 30x as much THC.<p>However, these products are disappointingly few and far between. When I walk into a CA dispensary, I actually have to hunt around for them, if they&#x27;re even available. When I ask, staff members wonder if I&#x27;m buying it for my grandmother!

One puff can either do not much or send you spinning, and your supposed tolerance may not even matter. The flower you smoke looks the same no matter if it has 5% THC or 35% THC, so gauging the potency of inhaled THC is practically impossible.<p>Edibles are <i>very</i> consistent, at least today they are. The problem with them is that people are stupid and don&#x27;t know how to find the right dose responsibly. They take a gummy, it tastes pretty good, and then after 15 or 20 minutes they don&#x27;t feel anything so they take another, because yum, it tastes like candy so why not. Then it starts to kick in after 30 or 40 minutes and it&#x27;s double the dose so they feel nauseated and sick.<p>The best way to gauge the effects of an edible dose is to take the edible on an empty stomach, wait about 20 minutes, then eat a meal, and do not take a second dose. After eating your metabolism will get that dose into your blood stream right quick and before you&#x27;re done with the meal you will definitely be feeling the full effect if you took enough. And if you don&#x27;t feel much, then the dose is too low. Try again tomorrow. Don&#x27;t double up the dose in the same sitting, because then you&#x27;re really not getting an accurate result. Take maybe 1&#x2F;3 more the next day, try again. If it&#x27;s still not enough then the next day try a little more.

You want to eat <i>more pot brownies</i>, because they&#x27;re delicious and you have the munchies now.<p>But you&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s way easier to not &quot;overdose&quot; with inhaled THC than it is with edibles. People just need to approach the two methods differently. Inhaling is instant gratification, where as eating is delayed gratification. Not everyone is capable of delaying gratification because so many people are impatient and impulsive. Edibles are still vastly superior in terms of healthiness so long as they aren&#x27;t just 95% sugar and 5% THC.<p>Personally, these days I use &quot;Protabs&quot; which contain 0 sugar, just THC and a binder (probably corn starch) and the high is extremely clean and clear and completely guilt-free. And the dosage is very reliable and repeatable.

A highball with American whiskey is my goto chillout drink, but when I drink beer, I like subtlety-- European pilsners, really mellow dry stouts, brown ales, and things like that. Most US craft beer fans&#x27; palates, and the commensurate offerings from craft breweries, are so jacked up that they don&#x27;t even realize how distant they are from something I&#x27;m interested in drinking. The styles of the same name offered by US craft breweries are so <i>extra</i> compared to their namesake styles that they&#x27;re totally different animals.<p>I&#x27;m not going to lie-- I&#x27;m also put off by some vibes in the craft beer scene has taken on in the past 10 or 15 years.

Basically, since the law defines hemp as containing &lt; .3% D9 THC, producers just extract all the D9 THC from hemp and inject it into edibles such that the total weight of the edible means there is still less than .3% D9 THC in the edible. These get me just as baked as &quot;normal&quot; weed gummies, they&#x27;re just a bit bigger.<p>2. More surprising to me is the recent addition of &quot;THCA Hemp Flower&quot;. To me these are just normal buds - I can grind them up and vape them and they get me just as high as &quot;normal&quot; weed. Basically these flowers contain low amounts of THC, but high amounts of THCA. But when you heat it, THCA turns into THC by decarboxylation. The thing that I don&#x27;t understand is that I thought &quot;normal&quot; marijuana always needed to be heated anyway, e.g. why they say you can&#x27;t just eat a weed bud but if you&#x27;re making an edible you need to heat the oils first.<p>The gummies&#x2F;edible workaround I can understand, but the THCA flower &quot;workaround&quot; seems like it&#x27;s skirting <i>really</i> close to the edge of the law. Not that I&#x27;m complaining or anything, but it&#x27;s weird to me how people don&#x27;t know that weed is legal nationwide in the US.</div><br/><div id="36948807" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36948807" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rco8786</span><span>|</span><a href="#36948416">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36949226">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36948807">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36948807">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; it&#x27;s weird to me how people don&#x27;t know that weed is legal nationwide in the US.<p>Yes, this.

I recommend most people start out with 5-10mg.<p>What I find really fascinating is that the route of administration can affect your tolerance even if the potency theoretically should be the same. If you consume edibles often (eg for health reasons) you&#x27;ll find you increasingly need larger and larger doses until it plateaus somewhere. If you &quot;switch it up&quot; and consume the same quantity via, say, a concentrate you vaporize, it&#x27;ll hit you a lot harder.

I had a friend who is a recovering alcoholic living in TX. He would talk about going to get CBD gummies, and sometimes he&#x27;d say something about &quot;wow, I took too many, I got messed up!&quot;. I was thinking &quot;what a crackpot, you don&#x27;t get high off CBD&quot;, I live in a legal state and I&#x27;ve taken CBD-only products. He came to live with me for a while and one day came home saying he&#x27;d bought some CBD. I asked him to show it to me, it was just regular 10mg THC gummies. Now this guy had a shaky relationship with the truth, but I thought THC was totally illegal in TX. This explains what was happening, I&#x27;m sure he actually was buying THC products.<p>Also, we smoked a joint together, and it was kind of scary. I&#x27;ve smoked my share of pot with lots of people, and I&#x27;ve never seen it affect someone like this. Not long after he moved away I read something else on here tying THC to schizophrenia. This guy was already bipolar but his affect under THC was different and really bothered me - I wouldn&#x27;t smoke with him anymore after that one time. I&#x27;m no psychologist, but schizophrenic is how I&#x27;d describe his reaction to it.<p>I&#x27;ll add that skepticism follows most addictions.

It&#x27;s also hard for me to judge dosage because I have developed a really high tolerance.<p>When I first started smoking it had a completely different effect on me, including visual hallucinations.

I know that&#x27;s very generic advice, but the older I get and the more I learn, the less confident I am that I can understand how cannabis will effect other people.

This wasn&#x27;t originally my idea, and so I&#x27;m not alone in this.<p>This respect was part of my own mindset shift on usage away from habitual use. A way to remind myself to take it seriously, and to partake intentionally if&#x2F;when I do.<p>Most people I know are pretty aware of their &quot;problem&quot; but have no intention of changing it.

  * Most drugs can impair your thinking and should not be used in unsafe conditions
  * Some drugs can be dangerous due to adulterants (e.g., fentanyl)
  * One should be mindful in how they consume drugs (not under peer pressure, not appropriate time&#x2F;place, etc)
  * If you are going to use a drug, treat it as dessert rather than a meal

  * Addiction is possible&#x2F;likely when one consumes a drug frequently in a short amount of time, or by consistent use of it

I&#x27;d rather we raised awareness across the board about the benefits and repercussions of the popular substances of choice. Some general rules of thumb are good, but less compelling than direct information about the ways things can go wrong, and ultimately not useful in the moment of choosing &quot;do I partake?&quot;.<p>I think most people understand that some drugs are dangerous and some are not. But the drug conversation has been so dishonest for so long, that people struggle to assess what is real&#x2F;true, or what to take seriously. I don&#x27;t think people will take seriously anything that collapses mind altering substances under that single umbrella.<p>I think there are strong arguments to be made that psychedelics - especially psilocybin - deserve to remain in a category of their own. To associate them with &quot;drugs&quot; broadly seems counterproductive at a time when we&#x27;re finally seeing research dollars pour into the field, and the effects of these compounds doesn&#x27;t seem comparable with other recreational drugs.

It&#x27;s the same thing seen in vapes, different variations of alcohol, designer drugs, etc. In fact, vapes follow almost the same model as the &quot;cannabis industry&quot; and do quite a bit to dance around the fact it&#x27;s a drug. Vape stores in particular will sell to 50mg salt nic as a new user. A weed store will sell you medical grade 80% THC hydro as a first time user. Drugs are drugs. If you use them responsibly you probably aren&#x27;t smoking&#x2F;drinking&#x2F;injecting it to feel normal. The path to profitability is to create addicts.

I know people who smoke much more than I ever did.  I&#x27;d use every day, only after work, but I never didn&#x27;t use it after work.  I was using it as a crutch, I used it as a cure-all, I used it as a social lubricant.  As mentioned in the article, I used it for anxiety, and the anxiety got worse.<p>I tried to quit a bunch of times, some more successfully than others.  But quitting is really hard.  I&#x27;d successfully exhaust my supply, but there&#x27;s always bowl- and grinder-scrapings.  After a night or two of smoking tar and dust, &quot;fuck it&quot;, I&#x27;d find some more.<p>My #1 excuse was always sleep.  Weed is the best sleep aid I&#x27;ve ever found.  Quitting usually went fine until I wanted to go to bed.  Several hours into a sleepless night, desperation sets in.<p>Eventually, I found a hack in LSD when I first had the determination to use it without mixing THC.  I slept like a baby.  No cravings the next day, or the next.  I started dreaming again, after years of sleeping like a corpse and waking up exhausted.<p>I&#x27;ve since started and stopped a few times.  Picked it back up to be social (and, hey, it&#x27;s fun!), the habit-driving insomnia comes back with a vengeance.  Stopping with LSD seems to work reliably for me.  I only allow myself a hit of LSD per year, so that&#x27;s how often I excuse a social session.  But the last couple of times, I haven&#x27;t needed the LSD.  It seems that I finally kicked the compulsion.  Although, I don&#x27;t trust that enough to make it a more regular habit.<p>Edit reply to jrflowers:<p>No, I do not take acid to sleep.  Taking it once allows me to quit thc cold turkey.  I take it first thing in the morning, so I&#x27;m hungry for dinner and sleepy for bedtime.  Last thing I need is a new habit.<p>Edit reply to gvedem (an hour and a half later I&#x27;m still &quot;posting too fast&quot; to make a second comment):<p>I bought the acid from a friend.  I am aware that &quot;one tab&quot; is not a standardized dose and that adjacent tabs on a sheet can have significant discrepancy.

I was hanging out with one of my dealers once when they said, “if I drank as much as I smoked I’d be an alcoholic.” I realized I was an addict at that point but I didn’t think I had a problem. After all, I passed college with good grades and got a good job. I was generally happy and had few bad experiences on marijuana vastly outweighed by good ones.<p>Two things really bothered me though:<p>1. Any amount of smoking is bad for your lungs and I take my health seriously.<p>2. I don’t like the idea that a substance of any sort had power over me.<p>I made 2 changes after graduation to get things back under control:<p>1. I only do edibles except on special occasions like 04-20 or a holiday with friends. So few that I can count the number of times a year on one hand.<p>2. I only consume marijuana every other month.<p>I now consider myself a joyful consumer of the product because I prefer marijuana to alcohol on nights out with friends. I feel more in control and less tired the following day. Hitting the breaks every other month resets me. It proves to myself I’m still in control and keeps any cravings and tolerance down at a reasonable level.<p>I’m not sure if this will work for anyone else but thought I’d share.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36950451" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36950451" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tetrep</span><span>|</span><a href="#36950587">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36947176">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36950451">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36950451">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As other comments have noted, just like with other addictions, it is extremely helpful&#x2F;insightful to be able to see someone &quot;further along&quot; and say &quot;I don&#x27;t like what I see.&quot;<p>I interacted with and heard stories about family alcoholics when I was growing up and that is part of why I&#x27;m confident I won&#x27;t develop a bad relationship with it myself. It&#x27;s hard to forget what it does not just to the users, but to everyone around them.<p>Similarily, although I didn&#x27;t see it growing up, as an adult I have seen some pretty hardcore stoners (high all the time), and I do not like the lifestyle that most seem to fall into. It&#x27;s really easy to notice the cognitive decline when it happens to someone you know. Even if you want to be charitable, people at the very least behave quite differntly when they go from generally sober all the time to generaly stoned all the time. YMMV but I prefer generally sober people versus generally stoned people.<p>I think part of the strong correlation between stoners and legalization movements is because they&#x27;re (rightfully!) self-interested in improving their own lifestyle, so they&#x27;ll be the loudest and most experienced advocates. As much as I loathe the &quot;marijuana can do no harm&quot; attitude of some stoners, the <i>still</i> reactionary &quot;omg drugs bad!&quot; people are terrible. Making it illegal makes it so much worse for everyone involved, and you&#x27;re not going to stop people from being involved with marijuana. More or less the same reasons we need to legalize sex work. It&#x27;s here, it&#x27;s always been here, and we need to learn how to cope with this reality in a healthy and safe manner. &quot;Abstinence only&quot; doesn&#x27;t stop babies from being made any better than it stops people from using drugs.

An average individual smokes more now that they don&#x27;t have to work through a &quot;connection&quot; to get it - so more accessible - and they can now do it out in the open vs discretely.

Drug treatment in the US has been generally &#x27;jail&#x27; (and still is for most drugs, and for cannabis as well in many regions). Actual drug treatment in the US is something of a joke for any substance, whether you are taken seriously or not. Drug treatment programs are expensive, often not covered by health insurance (if you have health insurance), often not effective - and that is the tip of the iceberg.<p>US medicine severely struggles for holistic treatments. Drug addiction treatment needs holistic treatment.<p>For example, detox centers will help a person come down and get over the most intense part of withdrawal. This is super important for alcohol as that withdrawal can kill you. But, this is symptomatic of how US medicine works - treats the chemical and biology, but not the person.<p>Read further on the updated rat-park experiment for why &#x27;treating the person&#x27; is so important:

There’s also an issue of “minimum viable dose” - provided you have sufficient time and determination, you can get just as high with shitty weed as you can with the good stuff, but it’s an awful lot harder to get only as high with the good stuff as you did with the shitty stuff.

You are right to point out they were not as prevalent though.<p>&gt; the enormously increased availability of high-potency THC products not leading people to consume more and I just wonder what world y’all are living on.<p>This is not quite the same angle as I was getting at. I agree that larger supply generally does drive more usage. There is data that agrees with that too - studies regarding consumption in WA post legalization did find a statistically significant (but still somewhat marginal) increase in overall consumption (let me know if you&#x27;d like to see that for yourself, I can try to dig it up, IIRC it was about 10% more consumption).<p>The angle I&#x27;m coming at is two fold.<p>(1) One of the biggest harms (if not the primary harm) of cannabis consumption comes from the combustion of carbon. More carbon burned and inhaled means more harm. That is different from alcohol. For example, if I were to drink a shot of vodka, or a shot of vodka mixed with a pint of water, it&#x27;s about the same harm either way because the harmful thing there is the alcohol itself. For cannabis, that is not the case. If we smoke more, it&#x27;s more harm because of the carbon, regardless of whether we are getting more THC or not. This is almost obvious in some cases with cannabis, scrape a bong and smoke that - it&#x27;s basically smoking charcoal and the THC output is very low; it&#x27;s way worse than consuming magnitudes more THC but smoking far less [consuming magnitudes more THC may be unpleasant, but overall health wise you&#x27;re going to be better off compared to smoking charcoal (aka resin)]<p>(2) Generally if you give someone cannabis that is twice as strong, they will use about half as much (and perhaps maybe a bit more). This is generally true from my experience, there are exceptional individuals who will smoke as much as they have, always. Regardless of those exceptions, to illustrate, let&#x27;s say someone is shooting for a 1.5 gram dose of THC per day (at 10% potency, multiply that by 10 for the plant weight, ergo 15 grams of plant weight per day - this is a heavy user). Let&#x27;s say with greater supply they are now going to smoke 1.7 grams (10% increase, in line with the increase observed post legalization). For the sake of this napkin math, let&#x27;s say they increase by 20% to 1.9 grams per day (so smoking 19 grams of plant matter total). Now, even at the increased usage, let&#x27;s say they get some 20% grade weed, they still consume that 1.9 grams of total THC, but now the plant volume smoked is just shy of 10 grams. Even at higher usage, smoking higher potency, it&#x27;s still a huge net benefit to smoke 10g of plant per day compared to 15g of plant matter per day.<p>We can express this in math:<p>T(otal quantity THC) = P(otency) * Q(uantity smoked)<p>T = PQ<p>In the above, Q is the thing that causes harm. If Q is limited because there is no supply or no cash, then we have an upper bound of Q due to that factor. Otherwise, &#x27;T&#x27; generally has an upper bound, in my experience it is a pretty fixed value, which means if we increase &#x27;P&#x27; (potency) we will decrease &#x27;Q&#x27; (which is the total quantity smoked, and reducing the total quantity smoked is reducing the harm [at least the harm that is directly related to smoking cannabis, namely the inhalation of CO and other toxic elements that are by-products from the combustion of carbon).</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36948533" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36948533" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">max_lameme</span><span>|</span><a href="#36948032">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36950395">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36948533">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36948533">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I smoked a lot of weed daily (~1gram&#x2F;day) for almost 10 years.

While I was a heavy user (6+ years) I was a strong proponent of legalization etc. &quot;Better than booze&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s only a gateway because it builds connections with people that have other stuff available&quot;.<p>But there is arguably a physical dependence at that routing usage. First thing every morning, every 1-2 hours another J. I wanted to quit almost every day. I&#x27;d have conversations with my partner about quitting every few days. But neither of us could. If we had none we wouldn&#x27;t sleep for 48+ hours, just didn&#x27;t happen. Anxiety sets in, stress about everything. You just want to sleep, so you smoke. You go broke you scour the house to find enough coins or bottle to return (EU here) to get .2g to roll once to just get to the next day. You leave the house to do anything and you&#x27;re so anxious and paranoid you become misanthropic. Only way to deal with it is to go home and &quot;relax&quot; to manage the borderline panic. Just for reference, before I was maybe a bit awkward sometimes but had absolutely no issues with the outside world.<p>I also don&#x27;t agree that afterwards you&#x27;re in the clear. I used to be borderline photographic with my memory. I&#x27;d pull random statistics from papers I&#x27;d read years earlier in conversation with references that I could use to validate when challenged. I no longer can even remember what I decided to go to the grocery store for, even though it&#x27;s a ~2 minute walk. I forget what I started a sentence to express while typing. I&#x27;m a systems engineer, when I change tabs in an IDE I lose nearly all the context I took with me to the new tab. Sure context switching breaks flow yadda yadda, but it&#x27;s just different.

Also, instead of  a slow buildup, it usually hits a few seconds after taking a hit already and doesn&#x27;t last as long, plus the effects were really paranoia inducing for me, to the point where I had auditory hallucinations and was afraid I gave myself schizophrenia for the rest of my life. But it was so addicting that stopping even for a full day felt like an insurmountable feat. I was already quite depressed before, so the feeling wasn&#x27;t <i>that</i> much different, but at times I just couldn&#x27;t wait to get home, light up a joint and blast myself with podcasts (usually reports from other countries and other cultures, something as far away from home as possible), sports broadcasts or the 10th The Office re-watch.

I used it daily in high school and college since the age of 15 or 16. The effects on my learning and memory were profound, but I never noticed how bad until I was off it for 1-2 months. I was flunking Calculus, got busted my parents, then my head cleared, I picked up the subject in a month without even studying and aced the AP Calc exam. Same thing happened in college studying engineering, I’d flunk the first exam, decide to quit, then learned the material easily. Most people aren’t trying to learn STEM so it’s probably impossible to tell how bad it’s impacting you. The withdrawals weren’t so bad, just feeling kind of spaced out and weird for one or two months, but it was just hard to quit because you don’t see the reason to. I haven’t smoked much since school, but my memory is so bad now 10 years later it’s sad.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36946542" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36946542" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">imadethis</span><span>|</span><a href="#36948910">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36946542">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36946542">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you know any ER docs&#x2F;nurses&#x2F;techs, ask them about cannabinoid hyperemesis and the denial that patients are in around their level of addiction.</div><br/><div id="36949026" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36949026" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">genocidicbunny</span><span>|</span><a href="#36946542">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36949026">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36949026">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m surprised this isn&#x27;t mentioned more, because it kind of blows away the argument that &#x27;weed isn&#x27;t physically addictive&#x27;.

Learn how to learn well, continuously, and sustainably. Tech changes rapidly. And you will want to hop from one domain to another, just for keeping things interesting and to move with markets. This is both a blessing and a curse. It is a blessing because you can start late and still be in the top percentile if you have the brains and work hard for it. It is a curse because you will be doing this no matter how many years of experience you have.<p>2. Hone your non-technical skills– caution: these are compounding over time (both good and bad habits) – being disciplined, thinking clearly, articulating clearly, being professional, being trustworthy, managing your physical and mental health, being dependable&#x2F;reliable, having a growth mindset, thriving in ambiguity and uncertainty etc. then, honing your communication skills – effectively  collaborating with people, give&#x2F;receive effective feedback, do&#x2F;get mentoring&#x2F;coaching, working with cross-functional people, working with very seniors, very juniors, peers etc. read a lot, develop mental models, deeply craft your personal approach to first principles problem solving, to making tradeoffs&#x2F;bets etc.<p>You can do the above all by yourself, through reading, and observing people from afar, and engaging with people (even strangers on forum like this one) in dialog.</div><br/><div id="42292566" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42292566" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">McScrooge</span><span>|</span><a href="#42290327">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42290478">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42292566">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42292566">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve been in a similar position of having to learn solo for 10+ years and lesson #2 above has been FAR more important than #1 in my experience.

3. I apply that thing to some novel problem.<p>Through this cycle of Discovery-Tutelage-Application, I can assess my level of comfort with new material and understand when my struggles are due to trying to short circuit the process.<p>It&#x27;s likely that you have some form of learning process that is equally cyclical, yet undefined -- once you identify and codify those steps, you can evaluate your progress when it comes to acquiring new skills.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42292939" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42292939" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wruza</span><span>|</span><a href="#42290327">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42290478">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42290606">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42290537">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42292939">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42292939">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I tell myself to not adhd it and instead take time and read through a whole manual, experiment in a local sandbox, grasp the limits of knowledge and features and also where it gets deep.<p>Then in a regular work I explicitly detect where it pays off and feel “see I told you”.

It seems like you are already doing this well.  Other places to meet them are at local and virtual meetups for the software or packages you use, tools you use, industry societies, etc.  Linkedin is also an underrated and underutilized tool for this IMO.<p>- Free or low cost remote courses.

A lot of data systems are full of problems because they were designed and implemented by inexperienced people.

Code reviews by ChatGPT can&#x27;t compensate for lack of more experienced colleagues.<p>The best way to grow as a fresh grad is to join a medium sized, established business. There you are going to be a part of a team where you will get to learn the ropes of your field (that&#x27;s something you won&#x27;t find in ChatGPT or university) and at the same time the pressure won&#x27;t be so hard. And while you aren&#x27;t going to get the perks of working at huge companies like Google or Facebook, you likely won&#x27;t have to deal with  assorted corporate BS that comes with it either.<p>Only once you get a few years under your belt think about startups, small companies, etc.</div><br/><div id="42290607" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42290607" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aleph_minus_one</span><span>|</span><a href="#42290586">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42292910">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42290607">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42290607">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; 
If you want to grow you will need to change jobs. Small companies are not a good fit for a fresh grad with little to no experience. In a small company you are by necessity a jack of all trades because there are only so few of you. [...]<p>&gt; The best way to grow as a fresh grad is to join a medium sized, established business.

Also, at small companies, you know the colleagues better, so that the culture is often more &quot;humane&quot;. Also, exactly because at a small company you are a &quot;jack of all trades&quot;, you by necessity learn a lot more; but be aware that on the other hand you won&#x27;t specialize so deeply into the topic. So, if you want to deeply specialize in a topic, you better look at a medium or large company (but be aware that there might exist few or no jobs there that allow you to specialize in the topic that you are into).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42292910" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42292910" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ac130kz</span><span>|</span><a href="#42290586">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42292910">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42292910">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Technical lead (not even a Senior!) after 6 months?

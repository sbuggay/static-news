(and have worked with some of the people in the article).<p>I will comment that the major expensive most facilities face is the cost of the service contracts, which are partially parts, but also partially the need to pay multiple talented service engineers to be available to fly in on a moment&#x27;s notice, and troubleshoot and fix the microscopes. Electron microscopes break constantly, and most users are not skilled enough to even troubleshoot, let alone fix them.<p>I will also point out that this part of the article:<p>&gt;Levels of 100 kiloelectronvolts (KeV)—one-third as high—suffice to reveal molecular structure, and they reduce costs by eliminating the need for a regulated gas, sulfur hexafluoride, to snuff out sparks<p>Is wildly inaccurate. Relative to the cost of a microscope, SF6, and a high tension tank are absolutely pennies. Frankly, the cost savings are primarily in two areas:<p>1) The fact that Thermo Fisher isn&#x27;t involved (the Tundra is a joke and a move for market monopolization)<p>2) Going from 300 kV (or even 200 kV) drastically reduces the needed tolerances for parts. 100 kV microscopes have been around forever, though, and almost none are going to the resolutions of 200 and 300 kV microscopes, although like Russo and Henderson, I agree that&#x27;s a solvable problem. It&#x27;s worth noting that the resolutions they are describing, while encouraging, are not great. 2.6 Å on Apoferritin, which is a best case scenario never seen in the &quot;real-world&quot; is quite a ways behind even the cheaper 200 kV scopes that have gotten down to 1.6 Å. This is still firmly in &quot;screening and learning&quot; territory for most flexible samples, which is not without value, but not the answer to the 5 million dollar Krios that we all so desperately want.<p>Re: the national centers in the article, it depends which one you go to. NCCAT is fantastic, in my experience, but S2C2 is in the costly bay area and they just can&#x27;t afford to pay their staff scientists enough. So what happens if you get tossed in with a fresh PhD that is underpaid and uninterested in your project. I&#x27;ve seen, in general, a lack of caring by the staff there, and no desire to understand specific problems each user is trying to solve. That results in lots of wasted iterations, especially if you are starting from scratch with no experience.</div><br/><div id="38438996" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38438996" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fabian2k</span><span>|</span><a href="#38438561">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38440964">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38438996">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38438996">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wonder how much potential there is to make them a lot more reliable and easier to use.

SEMs that operate in the 10 kV range can be had for a full order of magnitude cheaper, although that price probably scales a bit with achievable resolution. But for an example, the 200 kV&#x2F;300 kV microscopes can&#x27;t change temperature by +- 1°F over a 24 hour period without the lenses going out of alignment (presumably because of the resistance change in the electromagnets).<p>&gt;Regarding the last paragraph, it&#x27;s incredibly frustrating if you see time on expensive instruments wasted because there aren&#x27;t enough experts around and people have to try and figure out stuff for themselves.

Plenty of groups are working on what you describe but the details are tough. To give a non-technical description of the problem, most structure techniques rely on either explicit or implicit averaging to get good resolution. Small crystals or particle numbers, conformational heterogeneity, and beam-induced radiation damage are big resolution killers. People have figured out all kinds of tricks that amount to purifying a ton of protein, making sure it crystallizes well&#x2F;is relatively homogenous with a good distribution of ways it sticks to a grid, and minimizing sample beam exposure during diffraction&#x2F;SPA, which require relatively little, anyway. With cryo-ET, though, you aren&#x27;t taking a ton of micrographs of a ton of particles or quickly zapping (well, you&#x27;re rotating it and exposing it for some time under a little jet of super cold air, but hey, it works) a crystal that diffracted precisely because you got a large, relatively structurally homogenous lattice, you&#x27;re taking a series of micrographs of the same cell, which is structurally probably way more different from other cells than one protein conformation is from another (and that’s if you culture&#x2F;sort your cells ahead of time instead of working with tissue). Meanwhile, you&#x27;re frying your sample from the prolonged exposure time a tilt series requires and not even getting a full tilt series because you can&#x27;t rotate the darn sample holder 360 degrees (though people train CNNs to get around the missing wedge problem now). Once you&#x27;ve reconstructed a structure from your tomographs, how are you going to assign the blobs and squiggles you think you see in your gray static? You either need to know what you&#x27;re looking ahead of time which requires pre-existing structures and good guesses on location (presumably reasonable to do with something like actin or microtubules, pretty tough with John Doe globular, cytosolic protein that looks like everything else at bad resolution), some kind of labeling (so now you probably need a cryo-CLEM or whatever too or to add something pretty big&#x2F;distinct which comes with other problems), or you add mass-spec somehow. Oh, and I took the FIB milling for granted when describing this, btw (if you want to look at an entire cell, trying to FIB mill the entire thing is like trying to replace all your walls with glass, so we&#x27;re back to sampling the right parts&#x2F;averaging). If you add mass-spec, you’re basically trying to make the smallest laser micro dissection slices ever on a sample that you might have to almost destroy if you want to see more than figments of your imagination. So, hundreds of stupid little problems but people are working on it, and there&#x27;s work for people with strong computer vision&#x2F;ML backgrounds.<p>RNA is a totally different problem since it&#x27;s often described as pretty &quot;floppy&quot; compared to protein and we don&#x27;t have that many RNA structures, so presumably it&#x27;s harder to assign things unless you&#x27;re looking at well-studied complexes. Aren’t transcriptomics people working on this, though? Maybe MERFISH does kind of what you want just without pipelines for depth assignment yet (or maybe these exist).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38441831" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38441831" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">heyoni</span><span>|</span><a href="#38438561">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38440964">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38439582">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38441831">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38441831">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have a question that’s unrelated to the article you might be able to answer…is it viable to use something like alphafold to predict whether a protein variant is folding the same way as the wild type or would you always need to validate that with imagery?</div><br/><div id="38442538" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38442538" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ravila4</span><span>|</span><a href="#38438561">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38441831">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38439582">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38442538">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38442538">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">AlphaFold is a real game-changer in predicting many protein structures, but its precision in dealing with single residue mutations, particularly in non-standard proteins, isn&#x27;t a sure bet.<p>The tool excels because it&#x27;s been trained on a massive database of known protein structures.

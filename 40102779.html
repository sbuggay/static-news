He noted on Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast in late May that when there’s no real constraint on hiring, “you hire someone, and the first thing that person wants to do is hire other people.” The reason is that “the more people who report to you, the higher your prestige, the more your power in the organization…So every budgeting process is, ‘I really want to hire,’ and that to me is the root of all the excess.”<p>I’ve seen this first hand. One place where I worked HR even had a table of team size vs manager compensation. When I pointed out that it may not be the best idea to directly incentivize managers to hire more people they were less than understanding. Of course it went totally out of control.<p>But sadly there just is no counteracting force (except perhaps mr Musk). When you apply for your next job as a manager they will ask you “How big was your team?”, and they won’t be impressed when you say “I managed to keep it down to four people”. It’s just something that resonates very strongly with the primitive side of our brains (“You say you were the chief, how big was your tribe?”).</div><br/><div id="40108666" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40108666" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">7thaccount</span><span>|</span><a href="#40103317">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40108902">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40108666">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40108666">[26 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s called &quot;empire building&quot; and is also part of the principal-agent problem where the manager is the agent and is assumed to have the firm&#x27;s best interests in mind, but in reality doesn&#x27;t. As a result, the principal (for example an owner) has to come up with methods to keep their management honest (example... tying most compensation to stock price - although I think this just makes management short sighted).<p>I was once in a meeting where an IT manager was told his group would have to handle the install for a piece of software that like 2 engineers used. The guy asked for 3 additional head count and my jaw dropped. If someone has ever seen the Avatar Airbender show, I was like Prince Zuko speaking up at his father&#x27;s meeting. You see I was there as a courtesy and tried to point out that even one headcount seemed like a lot for something that should take less than a week of work for a single employee. At the time I didn&#x27;t understand that the manager understood this, but was playing for more staff to build their own importance. I didn&#x27;t understand the games they play. As part of the game...you always say your people are swamped no matter what...or refer to a massive backlog of work even though that backlog is all super low priority and existing employees can be reprioritized.</div><br/><div id="40110981" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40110981" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sowbug</span><span>|</span><a href="#40103317">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40108666">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40112530">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40110981">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40110981">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A common miscommunication in an R&amp;D organization is asking another team to do a task, and getting the reply that they&#x27;re willing to do the task if you provide headcount.

I&#x27;ve had managers convey things to me that ultimately led to me quitting and finding other work, but I hold them in high esteem because they clearly communicated what needed to be done to meet demands and I decided it wasn&#x27;t for me and didn&#x27;t hold it against me.<p>There are good managers.

They’ll be able to talk about all the big sexy “hyperscale” stuff they have managed with lots of terabytes and Kubernetes and terraform and helm charts. Most people would probably hire this person.<p>I’d hire the second person.<p>It’s basically the midwit meme, which is so popular because it illustrates something real.<p>There seems to be a core conflict in society between systems as things we build to do things vs systems as ends in themselves. Morons just do things. Geniuses just do things. Midwits get mixed up into the process of doing things and forget the point.</div><br/><div id="40110816" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40110816" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">starky</span><span>|</span><a href="#40103317">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40109542">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40111869">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40110816">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40110816">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;“I eliminated the need for a complex deployment by rearchitecting a bit and consolidating systems, so then I only had to manage a few things.”<p>That is more of a marketing issue, write something like, &quot;Improved efficiency of deployment by x% by re-architecting systems x, y, and z which saved $xxM&#x2F;year.&quot;</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40111869" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40111869" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jbirer</span><span>|</span><a href="#40103317">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40109542">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40112347">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40111869">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40111869">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well said.

Reading the whole article it seems that Bayer is moving to a system better known as QBR, mixed with OKRs and most likely some sort of agile model.<p>There is no no-hierarchies. Working in a 3 month cadence on an organizational level puts a lot of pressure on all people. Usually QBRs work top down and there is more monitoring along the process.<p>What sounds great is more or less success theatre as well as inflexibility. No one wants to lack behind in a QBR report. Risking 4 times a year being red flagged in a report sparks fear.<p>Also approval processes and idea sharing are the first victims of such reorganizations. No one risks a 2 week sprint for some improvement sprint or working on technical debt in tech for example.<p>I’ve seen this within a company with 100k employees worldwide.<p>People will regret QBRs.<p>Usually companies want to get rid of the costs of middle managers, which are usually elder than normal staffers. Also companies want to include younger folks, because they are on average cheaper per resource from a controlling perspective.<p>Young guns without leadership with delivery pressure by an even older senior management layer means having a large gap and divide between them.<p>Senior management adds so called assistants to their staff, the hidden layer.<p>I watched a lot of mobbing at the lower level as a result. Fear of tumbling over mistakes aka receiving a bad performance review is rampant when you need to report all the time results.<p>Mixing teams every QBR sounds fun, but isn’t. It means even more being in constant competition. Who is the most flexible employee and most successful under different circumstances?<p>Large organizations are hard to manage. People will very soon miss their middle managers to cover things up in a human way.<p>QBRs don’t help if there is a clear product strategy missing.<p>There is no perfect system, but QBRs are some of the most toxic form of working and collaboration that I have witnessed so far.</div><br/><div id="40111535" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40111535" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">_heimdall</span><span>|</span><a href="#40109092">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40109987">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40111535">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40111535">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m been really frustrated by OKRs specifically.

If we look at 100,000 employee orgs, this gets even sillier.<p>If you even attempt something like this, what will actually happen will be a chaotic hierarchy arising within the larger group, with people playing politics to rise above their peers.<p>Edit: I should add that I absolutely believe a bottom-up organization can work, but it needs to be built with the right organizational model in place. You can&#x27;t just say &quot;no managers&quot; and expect people to work directly for the CEO. You can put in place rules so that employees can self-organize, appoint representatives to interact with other teams, vote for collective decision making and so on.

I.e. there is always a bit of chaos and change at the upper levels reflecting to change in the business and competitive landscape, but as much as possible I tried to protect my team from this unnecessary churn.

for you as a leader would be far worse.<p>If you cut at the bottom, you cut the part of the workforce that&#x27;s actually comparatively cheap on a per-head basis, and you basically give a demotion to everyone who is left who used to be a manager, because you&#x27;re either cutting their team size or demoting them from manager to IC.  So, the workforce you&#x27;d end up with would be more costly and less motivated than what you end up with if you cut the middle of the hierarchy instead.<p>So, this is basically just a corporation exercising the only option it really has in this situation, and dressing it up as some kind of deep insight about organizational structure.<p>But, even if the context was different, even in the context of a growing and successful business, &quot;flat structure&quot; and &quot;self-organizing&quot; are often euphemisms for other things.<p>For example, it could be a euphemism for a kind of social Darwinism where, instead of appointing a manager and risking the appointment of a &quot;weak&quot; individual, you just wait to see who it is who ends up beating the others into submission, thus, by definition, ending up with the &quot;strong&quot; ones bubbling to the top of the hierarchy. It&#x27;s needless to say that this process is cruel and creates a ton of collateral damage.<p>What I&#x27;ve also seen in connection with &quot;flat structure&quot;, &quot;self-organization&quot;, and &quot;bottom-up&quot; rhetoric is the situation where the company is actually run by a secret cabal of people who know damned well who&#x27;s on the inside and has power, and who is on the outside and does not.  But the people on the outside don&#x27;t know that, and are instead given the &quot;flat structure&quot; and &quot;self-organization&quot; rhetoric.  This reinforces the secrecy of the power structure, and serves as a convenient gaslighting device to make it look to the outsiders like their powerlessness is their own fault, rather than the organization putting them in a place where they have no power.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40111676" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40111676" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lifeisstillgood</span><span>|</span><a href="#40112295">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40110984">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40111676">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40111676">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree that “managers” are these days mostly a legacy from

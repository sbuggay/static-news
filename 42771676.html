People who have the love of family and friends, a clear conscience, health, their physical needs met, and thankful hearts, are far wealthier than a majority of people in this world who have a large number in their bank account.<p>Yet in our consumer world, people are continually thinking of their worth simply in terms of the money they have or the money they make. I’ve known many married working moms, who decided to leave the workforce and be homemakers, who constantly felt like their worth diminished because of the decrease in their wealth, not recognizing that the bond they had with their children, was growing stronger and greater, and didn’t recognize how incredibly valuable that truly was.<p>Note: I’m not saying working moms can’t have strong bonds with their children, I’m talking about specific situations where for them it was hindering their relationships, and their relationships improved but was at the cost of less money.</div><br/><div id="42774691" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42774691" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dowager_dan99</span><span>|</span><a href="#42771864">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42773301">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42776065">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42774691">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42774691">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The social pressure to play the game, even when you don&#x27;t need to, is so strong.

Most failed startup founders never admit it.  The original author is not one of them and he was willing to be open about it - that’s a compliment by the way.<p>“Many” may benefit from them.

A company can utterly fail and still represent a win.  I had one of those.<p>I started a self-funded tech company around 1998.  This was hard tech, hardware and software.  And I was the sole engineer doing all the work.  This meant 18 hour days, 7 days per week to get the plane off the runway.  Two years later, after booking lots of sales, we finally moved out of the garage and I started to hire people.  Yes, I ran this beast entirely on my own for two years.  A few years later a large well-known company expressed interest in acquiring the technology.  The number being floated was in excess of $30MM.<p>What happened?<p>Well, 2008 happened.  The economic implosion caused this company to second-guess entry into the market we had pursued --which they intended to do by acquiring us.  The deal went from being a couple of meetings away from an acquisition to evaporating in front of my very eyes.<p>The bad news was that the economic downturn truly hurt us over the next couple of years.  I had to shut it down in 2010 and lick my wounds.<p>This thing went from pouring all of our savings and an incredible amount of very hard work into a crazy idea, executing well enough to get a $30MM+ offer to closing the doors and nearly losing it all in the process.<p>At the time this felt like an abject failure and a waste of ten years of my life.  It took me months to get my head back on straight.  Today, looking back, I see it as a success.  I took an idea from nothing to close to a massive life-changing exit and did so mostly on my own through hard work, grit and determination.  That&#x27;s a success story nobody can take away from me.  I learned a lot along the way and most of those lessons were part of success in future endeavors.<p>Life can be funny and cruel sometimes.

You can’t slowly ramp up most restaurant concepts with a DIY budget— you need to invest a lot upfront, and you need a lot of existing expertise for even pretty trivial concepts. (And before people say <i>food trucks</i> and <i>catering</i> and <i>private chef</i> and the like— catering and private cheffing are totally different businesses with very different processes and institutional knowledge, and in most places, food trucks aren’t dramatically cheaper than opening a small restaurant.) Folks seem eager to start acting like a CEO and delegating things to people paid with investor money rather than making something themselves and getting it off the ground. Maybe that’s what the business requires? Maybe in software markets, customers aren’t interested in scrappy small players anymore, perhaps worried about lack of support, shitty UX, them going out of business or whatever.<p>Just speculation.

Notice that these are true regardless of the existence of central banking:<p>Opportunity Costs of Waiting: Money available now can be used to address immediate needs or desires—buying goods, accessing services, or achieving goals. If that money is delayed, those opportunities may be lost, diminished, or deferred, reducing its practical utility.<p>Uncertainty Over Time: The future is uncertain, and there is a risk that the purchasing power or usefulness of money might change due to factors like inflation, changes in circumstances, or unforeseen events. Money available now provides a guarantee of utility that might not exist in the future.<p>Personal Preference for Timing: People often value immediate access to money because it aligns with their current priorities. For example, having money now could allow someone to travel, invest in education, or address urgent health needs—opportunities that may not hold the same relevance or availability later.</div><br/><div id="42774743" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42774743" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scarface_74</span><span>|</span><a href="#42772762">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42774578">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42773969">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42774743">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42774743">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And even if you ask it straight out.

What impressive perseverance, and also a positive outlook. But, reading it made my FOMO worse. I guess one has to experience it fully to apply it. Or maybe not.<p>I quit my job a year ago to pursue my own ideas. Like the author, I had made some money from a IPO. The post-IPO environment with heavy bureaucracy killed the vibe and I quit. Note that it wasn’t a Google tier company, but I made enough money that I could take a risk for some years without income.<p>For me it has only been a year. But I feel like a huge loser at times. In no scenario will I give up until I’m utterly defeated or captured the castle - I’m not a quitter. But this feeling gnaws at my soul.<p>I have failed to find a co-founder. Most of my friends are not interested in startups. So, I have had to look elsewhere. Between people who screwed me over equity, people who didn’t want to do the work, and my own imposter syndrome (I’m from a low ranked state college, and people I meet in SF are elites), I feel horrible and alone. I tried and even successfully built some projects over the past year, but ultimately nothing worked out.<p>Now, I’ve decided screw it. All the advice about sell first and get a co-founder - sounds great on paper. And I have some doubts around that whole belief but that’s not important.<p>I know actual pain points I’ve faced in my decade long career. I’ve done both highly technical and highly functional work.  I’ve talked to enough people and validated my idea. I wish this thing existed and that I’d worked on it sooner instead of trying something different with randoms.<p>So, I’m just going to go and build it. I like building things, and I’ve gotten enough recommendations and performance reviews that point out that I’m good at delivering value for the customer and making sure my team succeeds.<p>So I’m building a product. I am able to dogfood my own product as I build it which is great. It’s a somewhat complex, b2b AI enterprise product, and having built multi-billion dollar enterprise software and delivered multiple multi-million dollar implementation projects, I feel that there is really no rush. Most enterprise software and organization processes are awful and not well engineered nor well thought out.<p>If this fails, whatever. I tried. If it works, amazing. I like building good things and have a track record of doing so, albeit for others.<p>But I fear I will keep feeling like a failure until it is successful. On the other hand, it would be very cool to build a solo founded enterprise product and deliver actual success.<p>Anyway, thought I’d share my thoughts it feels good to type it out.

But it makes that &quot;empty return leg&quot; unreliable. And of course, the further ahead you plan, the less reliable it is.<p>So there&#x27;s one circle of people who can afford their own (whole or partial) jet. There&#x27;s one circle who just want reliable A to B.<p>What you&#x27;re left with is people who have enough to make it a business, but not enough to charter a plane themselves.<p>So your market are price insensitive enough to be preparedto pay more, but also don&#x27;t really plan their travel, or don&#x27;t need to travel reliably.

Often copyright and patents are infeasible for small business, and people simply can&#x27;t build or defend things like a large firm. Thus, initially design products&#x2F;services to last maybe a year or simply be disposable...  When 270 desperate cloners show up to dilute the market sector... people quickly understand why they can&#x27;t rely on Android, Steam, or Apple ecosystems to protect their bottom line.<p>4. There is zero loyalty without treasure.  The only people that care if your firm goes into the red is you, and maybe the small-time shareholders.  Most people can&#x27;t take the constant adversarial posture with problematic staff, opinionated shareholders, and high-demand customers.
Everyone thinks a CEO is lame till you become a CEO for a year or two... Every conversation from that point on is about money or marketing, and most people keen on building things tend to burn out of the role eventually due to social isolation.<p>5. No company lasts forever, if the operation is a projected liability it is your job to respond accordingly. Even if that means executing an exit strategy, and firing the entire problematic division.<p>6. Ask business people about their memorable experiences, and not about their money source. The superficial apparent function of a business is usually very different from the actual revenue model.<p>Best of luck, =3</div><br/></div></div><div id="42776834" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42776834" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mikesabbagh</span><span>|</span><a href="#42773453">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42773169">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42776834">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42776834">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">seems his problem is mainly marketing and finding product market fit.

That&#x27;s really true, <i>e.g.</i>, here[1] is a comment from 11 years ago where I mentioned that a lisp you wrote for the Apple &#x2F;&#x2F;e informed a lisp for the Apple &#x2F;&#x2F;e that I wrote.<p>Especially in my college years (2009-2013, ish), the world seemed smaller, and to me, a lot of what you wrote was like looking through a keyhole into the real world. Grown-ups can apparently write lisp at JPL[2]! Google was chaotic[3][4][5][6] to work in 2000, especially if you commuted from Burbank. A name change[7]. And, variously, surveillance, more lisp stuff, <i>etc</i>. Now I&#x27;m an adult and I still haven&#x27;t professionally written lisp, but I&#x27;m glad to have read about it anyway.<p>Anyway, it might surprise you to learn that when I think of your writing, though, I think of your HN comments first. There is a kind of influence that you can only get with a steady, unthanked build-up of seemingly-small contributions over a long period of time. In the right place they compound. I probably cite you to other engineers once a month or so.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6199857#6200414">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6199857#6200414</a>

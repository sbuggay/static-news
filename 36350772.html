Eating less and working out more will lead to reduced weight loss, but how people may be able to achieve this, especially on the long term, is unclear.<p>The evidence for any kind of nutrition finding is slight. CICO has the advantage that it matches very basic thermodynamic principles, so it has to be true to some extent. But beyond this basic level, all you get in reality are some broad strokes. We know how much calories maximum can be extracted from a piece of food. We know how much energy minimum you need to consume to perform a particular excercise. But no one really knows how much calories one particular person will actually get from eating one particular piece of normal food, no one knows how much it will actually vary between people, no one knows what might affect that difference. No one also knows how much energy you&#x27;ll actually use for doing a particular exercise given efficiency losses from your movements; and no one actually knows how much energy your body is passively consuming - nor everything that affects both of these.<p>Beyond the problem of actually measuring CICO, there is the additional problem of treating humans as fre will agents when it comes to food, when we know full well we are biological machines that have biological imperatives. We may be able to suppress our base instincts to achieve longer term goals, but this ability is obviously limited. Things like appetite are not within our control, and our ability to prioritize the longer term goal versus the short term need that our body is signaling is also obviously limited.<p>And not only are these limited, we know very well that they are affected by all sorts of internal processes. There are many psycho-active medications that are very very strongly proven to have an effect on appetite (lithium, SSRIs), as are certain diseases (thyroid issues for example).<p>But sure, keep blaming people for their diseases. It worked great for curing AIDS, so I&#x27;m sure it will work on obesity any day now.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36368496" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36368496" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scrollaway</span><span>|</span><a href="#36350993">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36368414">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36368475">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36368496">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36368496">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No. The evidence largely points to CICO being harmful bullshit.<p>Reducing things to thermodynamics is not useful to people trying to lose weight.

Muscle mass influences calorie burn. Gut microbiome impacts fat and caloric absorption by the body.

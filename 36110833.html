You can see the love and spirit they have for it, but it often looks like something too disconnected from the interests of young people and the vicissitudes of the changing economy to survive for much longer. A <i>kissaten</i> (old-style cafe) owner in Nagasaki who shared stories and gave me an umbrella (apparently his practice); a jazz bar owner in Sasebo who stays open so as &quot;not to disappoint patrons who might show up&quot;, even though he doesn&#x27;t really get enough business to justify it due to the waning of interest in jazz in Japan. Their low popularity also means they don&#x27;t charge high prices.<p>It&#x27;s a huge contrast with the anonymous, impersonal service you get in big cities and chain stores; a similar anonymity you get all over the world wherever poorly-paid workers don&#x27;t have a stake in the businesses they work for. The difference is a profit motive versus simply enjoying a practice or being a place for community. Both get shoehorned into the concept of a &quot;business&quot;, but they&#x27;re worlds apart. And in a climate of increasing rents, individualistic places tend to die out, barring the occasional dagashi vendor that manages to reignite community interest in its offerings.</div><br/><div id="36122405" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36122405" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">totetsu</span><span>|</span><a href="#36121493">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36121733">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36122405">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36122405">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Someway along past the end of Isezaki Mall in Yokohama, there is a old Video game arcade full of 90s Street fighter machines, and also some custom ones running some arcane emulator software, full or 1000s of even more arcane titles from Japanese video game history, run by one ageing proprietor.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36121733" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36121733" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lmm</span><span>|</span><a href="#36121493">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36122405">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36121414">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36121733">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36121733">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Meh.

Many times there are a number of employees standing around “doing nothing”. In America that would be considered fat to be trimmed. But the number of times I have walked around a big box store in the US trying to find <i>someone</i> who works there makes me feel that the American model actually cheapens the experience and having redundant employees allows the store to adapt to varying traffic flows. Americans seem to be used to this hollowing out but I don’t like it. Stores should not be vending machines.<p>Anyways, I would <i>really</i> like to see a breakdown of costs between an American restaurant and various foreign ones.

It&#x27;s not just Japan; western Europe is also generally much cheaper for restaurants (when comparing similar quality).<p>One big difference I see between the two is the level of service expected.  In the US, the waiters are constantly interrupting and bugging the customers, hoping for a bigger tip.  In Europe and Japan, this doesn&#x27;t happen; you need to signal to your server that you need something, and there generally seems to be less staff as a result, which reduces costs.<p>Basically, this is just another way that America is broken compared to the rest of the developed world, and it&#x27;s not just the strength of the dollar.</div><br/><div id="36121960" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36121960" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">techsupporter</span><span>|</span><a href="#36121414">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36121816">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36110927">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36121960">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36121960">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; In the US, the waiters are constantly interrupting and bugging the customers, hoping for a bigger tip.

It is very frustrating.<p>On the other hand, when we have taken friends to the places we like that are far more laid back, at least one person has commented on how the service is &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;inattentive.&quot; I think we are culturally used to being asked if we need service and are reticent to go find help or do for ourselves (except when it comes to using a machine at the grocery). So I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s solely in search of a better tip, except that <i>everything</i> in a US restaurant is for that.<p>Foodservice in Europe, broadly, is one of those amazing but unexpected things I tell people who are preparing to travel for the first time to really look at and try to enjoy.

Like all tools, finding the right place to use RL concepts is a big deal. I think one thing that is often missed in a classroom setting is pushing more real world examples of where powerful ideas can be used.

And I agree with you (and with the amazing post I already referenced [1]) that it is hard to get it to work at all. Sorry to hear you have been disappointed so much!<p>Nonetheless, I would personally recommend even just learning the basics and fundamentals of RL. Beyond supervised, unsupervised, and the most-recent and well-deservedly hyped semi-supervised learning (generative AI, LLMs, and so on), reinforcement learning indeed models the learning problem in a very elegant way: an agent interacting with an environment and getting feedback. Which is, arguably, a very intuitive and natural way of modeling it. You could consider backward error correction &#x2F; propagation as an implicit reward signal, but that would be a very limited view.<p>On a positive note, RL has very practical sucessful applications today - even if in niche fields. For example, LLM fine-tuning techniques like RLHF successfully apply RL to modern AI systems, companies like Covariant are working on large robotics models which definitely use RL, and generally as a research field I believe (but I may be proven wrong!) there is so much more to explore. For example, check Nvidia Eureka that combines LLM to RL [2]: pretty cool stuff IMHO!<p>Far from attempting to convince you on the strength and capabilities of DRL, just recommending folks to not discard it right away and at least give it a chance to learn the basics, even just for an intellectual exercise :) Thanks again!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alexirpan.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;14&#x2F;rl-hard.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alexirpan.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;14&#x2F;rl-hard.html</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.nvidia.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;eureka-robotics-research&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.nvidia.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;eureka-robotics-research&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40271218" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40271218" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chaosprint</span><span>|</span><a href="#40270264">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40270177">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40271218">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40271218">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great resources!

The student should build intuition for <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> vector space &quot;axioms&quot; hold by learning that fundamental operations like addition (which they already grasp) are being extended to vectors in Euclidean space.

Most programmers are not this rigorous!<p>Mathematicians, on the other hand, write mathematics for other humans to read. They expect their readers to have done their homework long before picking up the paper. They do not have any time to waste in spelling out all the minutiae, much of which is obvious and trivial to their peers.

Specific variables configurable parameters. Something that happened implicitly or with a single line of code  gets handled by its own function.

It’s a lot less teachable and certainly not self-evident any more.<p>The problem with math education is that we think the solution approach would be inherently superior to the first, and would make a better textbook—because it’s more generic.

That is exactly how we would train a ANN. Not be regurgitating the canned solution but by giving it all sorts of data and letting it generalize for itself. So why don’t we do this for human students?

I regularly had students who put off their required programming course until senior year. As a result, some were well into graduate-level mathematics and at the top of their class but struggled deeply with the rigor required in implementation. Think about, e.g.,  missing semi-colons at the end of lines, understanding where a variable is defined, understanding how nested loops work, simple recursion, and so on.

It&#x27;s all fine and well to wave your hand at &quot;Syntax rigour&quot;, but if your code doesn&#x27;t even parse then you won&#x27;t get far toward &quot;correctness&quot;. The frustration with having to write code that parses was extremely common among the students I am referring to in my original post -- it seemed incidental and unnecessary. It might be incidental, but at least for now it&#x27;s definitely not unnecessary.<p>2. It&#x27;s not just syntactic rigor. I gave two other examples which are not primarily syntactic trip-ups: understanding nested loops and simple recursion. (This actually makes sense -- how often in undergraduate math do you write a proof that involves multiple interacting inductions? It happens, but isn&#x27;t a particularly common item in the arsenal. And even when you do, the precise way in which the two inductions proceed is almost always irrelevant to the argument because you don&#x27;t care about the &quot;runtime&quot; of a proof. So the fact that students toward the end of undergraduate struggle with this isn&#x27;t particularly surprising.)<p>Even elementary programming ability demands a type of rigor we&#x27;ll call &quot;implementation rigor&quot;. Understanding how nested loops actually work and why switching the order of two nested loops might result in wildly different runtimes. Understanding that two variables that happen to have the same name and two different points in the program might not be referring to the same piece of memory. Etc.<p>Mathematical maturity doesn&#x27;t traditionally emphasize this type of &quot;implementation rigor&quot; -- even a mathematician at the end of their undergraduate studies often won&#x27;t have a novice programmer&#x27;s level of &quot;implementation rigor&quot;.<p>I am not quite sure why you are being so defensive on this point. To anyone who has educated both mathematicians and computer scientists, it&#x27;s a fairly obvious point and plainly observable out in the real world.

If we are comparing apples to apples, “rigor” meaning “this person is talking about a technique they have run across in their context and rather than abstractly indicating that it can be used to fix a problem without exact details of how it does that, they know the technique inside and out and are going to patiently sit down with you until you understand it too,” well, I think the point more often goes to the mathematician.<p>- Meanwhile you invoke correctness and I think you mean not just ontic correctness “this passed the test cases and happens to be correct on all the actual inputs it will be run on” but epistemic correctness “this argument gives us confidence that the code has a definite contract which it will correctly deliver on,” which you do see in programming and computer science, often in terms of “loop invariants” or “amortized big-O analysis” or the like... But yeah most programmers only interact with this correctness by partially specifying a contract in terms of some test cases which they validate.<p>That discussion, however, would require a much longer and more nuanced discussion that would be more appropriate for a blog article than for an HN comment thread. Even this comment pointing out that there are at least three meanings of rigor hiding in plain sight is too long.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38064388" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38064388" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">barrkel</span><span>|</span><a href="#38062342">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38064283">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38064556">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38064433">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38064388">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38064388">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>Syntax rigour has almost nothing to do with correctness.</i><p>Yes, that&#x27;s the point.

(Neither does the word “vector”, really.) In the context of that book, the idea is more or less as follows:<p>Suppose you are playing a game. That game involves things called “vectors”, which are completely opaque to you. (I’m being serious here. If you’ve encountered about some other thing called “vectors”, forget about it—at least until you get to the examples section, where various ways to implement the game are discussed.)<p>There’s a way to make a new vector given two existing ones (denoted + and called “addition”, but not the same as real-number addition) and a way to make a new vector given an existing one and a real number (denoted by juxtaposition and called “multiplication”, but once again that’s a pun whose usefulness will only become apparent later) (we won’t actually need that one here). The inner workings of these operations in turn are <i>also</i> completely opaque to you. However, the rules of the game tell you that<p>1. It doesn’t matter in which order you feed your two vectors into the “addition” operation (“add” them): whatever existing vectors v and w you’re holding, the new vector v+w will turn out to be the same as the <i>other</i> new vector w+v.<p>2. When you “add” two vectors and then “add” the third to the result, you’ll get the exact same thing as when you “add” the first to the “sum” of the second and third; that is, whatever the vectors u, v, and w are, (u+v)+w is equal to u+(v+w).<p>(Why three vectors and not four or five? It turns out that you have the rule for three, you can prove those for four, five, and so on, even though there are going to be many more ways to place the parens there. See Spivak’s “Calculus” for a nice explanation, or if you like compilers, look up “reassociation”.)<p>3. There is [<i>at least</i> one] vector, call it 0, such that adding it to anything else doesn’t make a difference: for this distinguished 0 and whatever v, v+0 is the same as v.<p>Let’s now pause for a moment and split the last item into two parts.<p>We’ll say a vector u deserves to be called a “zero” if, whatever other vector we take [including u itself!], we will get it back again if we add u to it; that is, for any v we’ll get v+u=v.<p>This is not an additional rule. It doesn’t actually tell us anything. It’s just a label we chose to use. We don’t even know if there <i>are</i> any of those “zeros” around! And now we can restate rule 3, which <i>is</i> a rule:<p>3. There is [<i>at least</i> one] “zero”.<p>What the remark says is that, given these definitions and the three rules, you can show, without assuming anything else, that there is <i>exactly</i> one “zero”.<p>(OK, what the remark <i>actually</i> says is that you can prove that from the full set of eight rules that the author gives.<p>But that is, frankly, sloppy, because the way rule 4 is phrased actually assumes that the zero is unique: either you need to say that there’s a distinguished zero such that for every v there’s a w with v+w= that zero, or you need to say that for every v there’s a w such that v+w is <i>a</i> zero, possibly a different one for each v. Of course, it doesn’t actually matter!—there can only be one zero even before we get to rule 4. But not making note of that is, again, sloppy.<p>This kind of sloppiness is perfectly acceptable among people who have seen this sort of thing before, say done finite groups or something like that. But if the book is supposed to be give a first impression, this seems like a bad idea. Perhaps a precalculus course of some sort is assumed.<p>Read Spivak, seriously. He’s great.

In mathematics this begins with linear algebra, and then with abstract algebra, real analysis and topology, and eventually more advanced subjects like differential geometry.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to explain to someone whose exposure to serious mathematics is mostly on the periphery that being exposed forcefully to this kind of thinking is a critical step to be able to make great leaps forward in the future. Brilliant developments of mathematics like, for example, the realisation that &quot;space&quot; is an intrinsic concept and geometry may be done without reference to an ambient Euclidean space begin with learning this kind of abstract thinking. It is easy to take for granted the fruits of this abstraction now, after the hard work has already been put in by others to develop it, and think that the best way to learn it is to return back to the concrete and avoid the abstract.</div><br/><div id="38065940" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38065940" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bscphil</span><span>|</span><a href="#38062342">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38064590">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38064763">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38065940">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38065940">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The point of starting with physical intuition isn&#x27;t to give students a crutch to rely on, it&#x27;s to give them a sense of how to develop mathematical concepts themselves.

On the surface the opposite is true - you complain, for instance, that the text jumps immediately into using technical language without any prior introduction or intuition building. My take is that intuition building doesn&#x27;t need to replace or preface the use of formal precision, but that what is needed is to bridge concepts the student already understands and has intuition for to the new concept that the student is to learn.<p>If you read the book in the original post you may find it&#x27;s absolutely for you.<p>Axler assumes you know only the real numbers, then starts by introducing the commutative and associative properties and the additive and multiplicative identity of the complex numbers[1]. Then he introduces fields and shows that, hey look we have already proved that the real and complex numbers are fields because we&#x27;ve established exactly the properties required. Then he goes on to multidimensional fields and proves the same properties (commutativity and associativity and identities) in F^n where F is any arbitrary field, so could be either the real or the complex numbers.<p>Then he moves onto vectors and then onto linear maps. It&#x27;s literally chapter 3 before you see [ ] notation or anything that looks like a matrix, and he introduces the concept of matrices formally in terms of the concepts he has built up piece by piece before.<p>Axler really does a great job (imo) of this kind of bridge building, and it is absolutely rigorous each step of the way. As an example, he (famously) doesn&#x27;t introduce determinants until the last chapter because he feels they are counterintuitive for most people and you need most of the foundation of linear algebra to understand them properly.  So he builds up all of linear algebra fully rigorously without determinants first and then introduces them at the end.<p>[1] eg he proves that there is only one zero and one &quot;one&quot; such that A = 1*A and A = 0 + A.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38066351" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38066351" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Ridj48dhsnsh</span><span>|</span><a href="#38062342">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38063116">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38066665">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38064073">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38066351">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38066351">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I absolutely agree about additional rigor and precision making math easier to learn.

The definition of it to someone who hasn’t been exposed to a lot of math seems fine but not interesting without motivation — it looks just another vector space that’s the same as the original vector space if we’re working in finite dimensions.<p>However, the distinction starts to get interesting when you provide useful examples of dual spaces. For example, if your vector space is interpreted as functions (for the novice, even they can see that a vector can be interpreted as a function that maps an index to a value), then the dual space is a measure — a weighting of the inputs of those functions. Even if they are just finite lists of numbers in this simple setting, it’s clear that they represent different objects and you can use that when modeling. How those differences really manifest can be explored in a later course, but a few bits of motivation as to “why” can go a long way.<p>Mathematicians don’t really care about that stuff — at least the pure mathematicians who write these books and teach these classes — because they are pure mathematicians. However, the folks taking these classes aren’t going to all grow up and be pure mathematicians, and even if they are, an interesting &#x2F; useful property or abstraction is a lot more compelling than one that just happens to be there.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38063853" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38063853" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">resource0x</span><span>|</span><a href="#38062342">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38063585">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38065454">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38066610">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38063853">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38063853">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your post represents a common viewpoint, but I don&#x27;t agree with it.

The second one will require a hell of a lot more conceptual baggage than the first one. It’s also what the book is geared towards.<p>It is also intended for people who know something about the trade; it isn’t “baby’s first book on maths”. (Why can you graduate high school, do something labelled “maths” for a decade, and still be below the “baby’s first” level, incapable of reading basically any professional text on the subject from the last century? I don’t know. It’s a failure of our society. And I don’t even insist on maths being taught—but if they don’t teach maths, at least they could have the decency to call their stupid two-hundred-year-old zombie something else.)<p>That conceptual baggage is not useless even in the applied context. For example, I know of no way to explain the Jordan normal form in 19th-century “columns or numbers” style preferred by texts targeted at programmers. (Not point at, not demonstrate, not handwave, <i>explain</i>—make it obvious and inevitable why such a thing must exist.) Or the singular value decomposition, to take a slightly simpler example. (Again, <i>explain</i>. You task, should you choose to accept it, is to see a pretty picture behind it.) And so on.<p>Again, you can certainly live without understanding any of that. (To some extent. You’ll have a much harder time understanding the motivation behind PageRank then, say. And ordinary differential equations, classical mechanics, or even just multivariable calculus will look much more mysterious than they actually are.)

It may be a little bit too terse, but mathematics didn&#x27;t evolve by knowing the applications before doing something.<p>Without doing some playing around from sqrt(-1) and discovering how it connects one thing to another, nobody is able to come up with real applications. You need to at least build a placeholder of the concept in your mind before you can examine what&#x27;s possible.<p>So a person with a similar mindset as those who were the first people to use complex numbers, would just try to find a way to express a square root of a negative number and see how it goes. It starts with a limitation of an important tool and tries to close a perceived conceptual gap. The mathematicians themselves that write this book probably all think that way. I wouldn&#x27;t call myself a mathematician but I didn&#x27;t need anything more than that sentence to believe someone was motivated enough just from that reason alone.<p>So really there&#x27;s a whole audience out there - arguably that a professional mathematician most wants to address - that could appreciate this sentence just as-is. So it&#x27;s not true that it&#x27;s natural to think the audience requires further explanation. Whether you should care is another matter. But as this is a book about linear algebra not complex numbers, some others would have accused the author of digression if he granted your wishes.<p>So I don&#x27;t think what you&#x27;re demanding is fair. Maybe it&#x27;s a reasonable request after the fact, but it&#x27;s a little too harsh to think it&#x27;s something the author must have addressed in his text to his intended audience.

They were unavoidable, as existing operations inevitably kept producing them. Since they kept coming up, it forced people to eventually recognize that these seemingly nonsensical concepts continued to behave sensibly under the operations that produced them.<p>Once addition and subtraction were defined on natural numbers, (1, 2, 3, ... etc), the concept of zero was latently defined. The concept of &quot;nothing&quot; was not immediately recognized as a number, but there is only one consistent way of dealing with 2-2, 5-5, 7-7, etc. Eventually that concept was given a name &quot;zero&quot;, notation &quot;0&quot;, and adopted as a number.<p>It was discovered, in that it was already determined by addition and subtraction, just not yet recognized.<p>Similarly with negative numbers. They were also latently determined by addition and subtraction. At first subtracting a larger number from a smaller number was considered nonsensical.

Open to the page you need to read, get out some paper and a pencil.<p>- If notation is defined, make sure you know what it means. Your pencil and paper should come in handy here.<p>- Look up the definitions of all words that you do not understand.<p>- Read the statement of the theorem, corollary, lemma, or example. Can you work through the details of the proof by yourself? Try. Even if it feels like you are making no progress, you are gaining a better understanding of what you need to do.<p>- Once you truly understand the statement of what is to be proven, you may still have trouble reading the proof—even someone’s well-written, clear, concise proof. Try to get the overall idea of what the author is doing, and then try (again) to prove it yourself.<p>- If a theorem is quoted in a proof and you don’t know what it is, look it up. Check that the hypotheses apply, and that the conclusion is what the author claims it is.<p>- Don’t expect to go quickly. You need to get the overall idea as well as the details. This takes time.<p>- If you are reading a fairly long proof, try doing it in bits.<p>- If you can’t figure out what the author is doing, try to (if appropriate) choose a more specific case and work through the argument for that specific case.<p>- Draw a picture, if appropriate.<p>- If you really can’t get it, do what comes naturally—put the book down and come back to it later.<p>- You might want to take this time to read similar proofs or some examples.<p>- After reading a theorem, see if you can restate it. Make sure you know what the theorem says, what it applies to, and what it does not apply to.<p>- After you read the proof, try to outline the technique and main idea the author used. Try to explain it to a willing listener. If you can’t do this without looking back at the proof, you probably didn’t fully understand the proof. Read it again.<p>- Can you prove anything else using a similar proof? Does the proof remind you of something else? -<p>- What are the limits of this proof? This theorem?<p>- If your teacher is following a book, read over the proofs before you go to class. You’ll be glad you did.<p>[1] Reading, Writing, and Proving: A Closer Look at Mathematics By Ulrich Daepp and Pamela Gorkin.</div><br/><div id="38063336" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38063336" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">reader5000</span><span>|</span><a href="#38061602">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38062576">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38061685">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38063336">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38063336">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think in the modern era a very good piece of advice, particularly for those of us without gorilla-like stamina to comb through a math text, is to go on your favorite video website and watch through multiple videos on the topic.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38061685" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38061685" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zeroonetwothree</span><span>|</span><a href="#38061602">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38062576">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38064726">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38061685">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38061685">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Meh, there&#x27;s different goals you could have.

TLDR; Having a good text is a good start. To increase adoption and usage, create  teaching materials, which saves valuable time for instructors.

Thanks to Sheldon Axler for making it available for free. This is intended to be a <i>second</i> book on Linear Algebra.<p>For a <i>first</i> book I suggest &quot;Linear Algebra: Theory, Intuition, Code&quot; by Mike X Cohen. It&#x27;s a bit different than a typical math textbook, it has more focus on conversational explanations using words, although the book does have plenty of proofs as well. The book also has a lot of code examples, which I didn&#x27;t do, but I did appreciate the discussions related to computing; for example, the book explains that several calculations that can be done by hand are numerically unstable when done on computers (those darn floats are tricky). For the HN crowd, this is the right focus, math for the sake of computing, rather than math for the sake of math.<p>One insight I gained from the book was the 4 different perspectives of matrix multiplication. I had never encountered this, not even in the oft-suggested &quot;Essence of Linear Algebra&quot; YouTube series. Everything I had seen explained only one of the 4 views, and then I&#x27;d encounter a calculation that was better understood by another view and would be confused. It still bends my mind to think all these different perspectives describe the <i>same calculation</i>, they&#x27;re just different ways of interpreting it.<p>At the risk of spamming a bit, I&#x27;ll put my notes here, because this is something I&#x27;ve never seen written down elsewhere. The book has more explanation, these are just my condensed notes.<p>4 perspectives on matrix multiplication<p>=======================================<p>1 Element perspective (all possible dot &#x2F; inner products)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p><pre><code>  (row count × row length) × (column length × column count)

  In AB, every element is the dot product of the corresponding row of A
  and column of B.

  The rows in A are the same length as the columns in B and thus have
  dot products.

</code></pre>
2 Layer perspective (sum of outer product layers)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p><pre><code>  (column length × column count) × (row count × row length)

  AB is the sum of every outer product between the corresponding columns
  in A and rows in B.

  The column count in A is the same as the row count in B, thus the
  columns and rows pair up exactly for the outer product operation. The
  outer product does not require vectors to be the same length.

</code></pre>
3 Column perspective (weighted sums &#x2F; linear combinations)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p><pre><code>  (column length × column count) × (column length × column count)

  In AB, every column is a weighted sum of the columns in A; the weights
  come from the columns in B.

  The weight count in the columns of B must match the column count in A.

</code></pre>
4 Row perspective (weighted sums &#x2F; linear combinations)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p><pre><code>  (row count × row length) × (row count × row length)

  In AB, every row is a weighted sum of the rows in B; the weights come
  from the rows in A.

  The weight count in the rows of A must match the row count in B.</code></pre></div><br/><div id="38063374" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38063374" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ndriscoll</span><span>|</span><a href="#38062151">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38065455">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38063374">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38063374">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The most important interpretation IMO is that a matrix is a specification for a linear map. A linear map is determined by what it does to a basis, and the columns of a matrix are just the list of outputs for each basis element (e.g. the first column is `f(b_1)`. The nth column is `f(b_n)`). If A is the matrix for f and B the matrix for g (for some chosen bases), then BA is the matrix for the composition x -&gt; g(f(x)). i.e. the nth column is `g(f(b_n))`.<p>The codomain of f has to match the domain of g for composition to make sense, which means dimensions have to match (i.e. row count of A must be column count of B).</div><br/><div id="38063870" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38063870" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Buttons840</span><span>|</span><a href="#38062151">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38063374">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38065455">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38063870">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38063870">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s debatable what the &quot;most important&quot; perspective is.

As for Linear Algebra, due to its wide relevance, it is hard for one book to accommodate to all needs of people from different fields and levels of mathematical maturity. I would say there are 2 main reasons for one to study LA:<p>- To understand and use its toolbox in practice: in fields like computer graphics, engineering, statistics, data analysis, modeling, etc.<p>- To understand and use its toolbox in other fields of (pure) math: single, multivariable, and functional analysis, abstract algebra, etc.<p>(Sometimes the latter goal is coupled with a secondary goal of introducing the student to mathematical proof. However, for the self-learners, I don&#x27;t think using a LA book is good for learning how to write proof for the first time.)<p>Unlike in calculus where Spivak serves as the one-size-fits-all, readers should identify their reasons before picking an LA book. I have not much experience with the first goal. Strang&#x27;s book seems quite popular, and given the title, I would say it fits this goal. Axler&#x27;s book falls squarely into the second goal, and I wager it&#x27;s a good book for this purpose if not for two things: his avoidance of determinants and the dearth of any computational aspects or applications (yes, even theoretical LA books ought to be grounded in reality). There are three books that, in my opinion, do better than Axler here:<p>- &quot;Linear Algebra&quot; by Stephen H. Friedberg, Arnold J. Insel, and Lawrence E. Spence: dry, does not instill in me the sense of excitement that Axler does. However, it is comprehensive and rigorous, with a decent amount of explanation and a good selection of exercises. Application aspects are present but quite disparate and incoherent. This is the old and long-standing recommendation.<p>- &quot;Linear Algebra&quot; by Elizabeth S. Meckes and Mark W. Meckes: a new book that somehow manages to combine the material of Friedberg and the eloquence of Axler. The rigor and exercises are comparable to Friedberg, but the applications are presented much better here.<p>- &quot;Linear Algebra&quot; by Sterling K. Berberian: a little bit more abstract than the other two, but the exposition is still very clear. It connects LA to other fields of math and gives plenty of examples and motivations (shocking I know). The exercises department is good.<p>Honorable mentions to the classics of Serge Lang and Paul Halmos. They are concise and, as with the rest of their works, wonderfully written. For &quot;Linear Algebra Done Wrong&quot;, well, I feel like it&#x27;s a stripped down Friedberg: shorter but not better. (The proof of the multiplicativity of determinant is just some hand-waving at &quot;a lucky coincidence&quot;.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="38063222" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38063222" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">slowhadoken</span><span>|</span><a href="#38065076">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38061415">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38063222">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38063222">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">the good old indispensable and underappreciated linear algebra</div><br/></div></div><div id="38061415" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38061415" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">readthenotes1</span><span>|</span><a href="#38063222">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38066348">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38061415">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38061415">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Linear Algebra Done Right This Time We Promise (4th try)<p>J&#x2F;k ;)</div><br/><div id="38064002" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38064002" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">selimthegrim</span><span>|</span><a href="#38061415">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38066348">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38064002">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38064002">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">4th sequence</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

At the time the institutional thinking was that this was &quot;a good thing&quot; because existing infrastructure had a 0% of meeting covid testing demand. The FDA and other regulators more or less abandoned what little oversight of lab developed tests (LDT) there was during this period. They remain lightly regulated. Fast forward to today, a large number of the covid testing startups still exist and are sitting on mountains of cash, having come up in the age of LDTs they are going to continue to min&#x2F;max that shaky regulatory framework. People in the startup sphere of influence constantly complain about the FDA being too involved in regulation. LDTs will lead to innovations as well as a abuses, I predict many people will complain their regulation is too lax.

The medical system is very slow to pick up on new research and Long Covid is so debilitating that people don&#x27;t have a choice to wait the 20 years it takes it to adopt the research.<p>Its not just happening in the USA its a worldwide phenomena. The more the world and healthcare especially ignores the Long Covid problem the more people will turn to private diagnostics and treatments away from existing healthcare.</div><br/><div id="40628781" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40628781" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">notjoemama</span><span>|</span><a href="#40626116">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40628781">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40628781">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Do you know if there’s been any advancement on the cause?

There is evidence of viral persistence (even those without Long Covid), auto immune antibodies and dysfunction immune T and B cells and a host of metabolic and cellular adjustments as well as clotting and a host of other issues, its completely systemic and that makes it really hard to pick apart.<p>I don&#x27;t know if the research will get down to one thing or a multitude of treatments or how quickly its going to be, things are going quite slowly its a very complex disease. Nothing is in development yet directly targeting it due to a lack of accepted biomarker and true understanding. Its not that we don&#x27;t know a lot we just don&#x27;t know which bits matter and whether existing treatments work on them.<p>Its pretty concerning, that there is no treatments let alone a cure, because every infection can cause Long Covid. Its about 13% chance every time you catch Covid. There is no lasting immunity to Covid or Long Covid that we know of nor genetic commonality. Current CDC projections suggests everyone will have this disease in their life and recovery is very rare. We are looking at a worldwide disabling event and not a lot of research money to get to the bottom of it from governments nor any social support for the 100s of millions already disabled by it.</div><br/><div id="40630555" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40630555" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">azinman2</span><span>|</span><a href="#40626116">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40628978">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40630555">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40630555">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are there 100s of millions already disabled by it?

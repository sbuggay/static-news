Imagine a _hypothetical_ situation where Shipt is 100% on point and driving a fairer version of the algorithm patch removing a way for workers to &quot;optimize&quot; for short, well paid trips, resulting in pay cuts to those who had learnt how to do it, while not changing&#x2F;increasing pay for everyone else. We would see the same kind of result: some portion of workers would get paid 10% less, some 10% more.

They were doing the same work they’d always done, yet their paychecks were often less than they expected.<p>Edit:<p>&gt; On Facebook and Reddit, workers compared notes. Previously, they’d known what to expect from their pay because Shipt had a formula: It gave workers a base pay of $5 per delivery plus 7.5 percent of the total amount of the customer’s order through the app. That formula allowed workers to look at order amounts and choose jobs that were worth their time. But Shipt had changed the payment rules without alerting workers. When the company finally issued a press release about the change, it revealed only that the new pay algorithm paid workers based on “effort,” which included factors like the order amount, the estimated amount of time required for shopping, and the mileage driven.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40874100" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40874100" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ChrisMarshallNY</span><span>|</span><a href="#40873616">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40874141">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40876599">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40874100">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40874100">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">IANAL, but I suspect that there&#x27;s US law, specifying that there needs to be a clear, transparent formula for pay.<p>Even convoluted ones, like commissions for sales, or shared tips, are covered by law.

However, the data analysis results as presented in the article do not support the article&#x27;s main point. &quot;40% are getting paid at least 10% less&quot; is not unnatural to expect whenever pay is redistributed, especially since some 30+% are getting at least 10% more. Imagine a _hypothetical_ situation where Shipt is 100% on point and driving a fairer version of the algorithm patch removing a way for workers to &quot;optimize&quot; for short, well paid trips, resulting in pay cuts to those who had learnt how to do it, while not changing&#x2F;increasing pay for everyone else. We would see the same kind of result: some portion of workers would get paid 10% less, some 10% more. This does show that workers are paid differently for the same work they have been doing, but does not prove the change is unfair.</div><br/><div id="40873007" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40873007" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tossandthrow</span><span>|</span><a href="#40872802">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40873011">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40873007">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40873007">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You are looking for this in the article<p>&gt; It wasn’t a clear case of wage theft, because 60 percent of workers were making about the same or slightly more under the new scheme.<p>Your statement that &quot;some 30+% are getting at least 10% more&quot; assumes that there is no wage theft - which is not cut in stone.</div><br/><div id="40873146" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40873146" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">or_am_i</span><span>|</span><a href="#40872802">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40873007">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40873015">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40873146">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40873146">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To clarify, I was basing the &quot;some 30%&quot; on the wage change distribution histogram that comes somewhat further down in the article from the statement you quote.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40873015" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40873015" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chgs</span><span>|</span><a href="#40872802">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40873007">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40873146">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40873011">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40873015">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40873015">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Aren’t gig workers contractors?

I can think of at least 3.<p>Most likely, they don&#x27;t publish it because they don&#x27;t want people to try to game it. If your goal is &quot;pay people proportional to their efforts&quot; and you have some model you developed that tracks &quot;effort&quot; if you release the model, the obvious thing people are going to do is try to break the model which is infinitely easier when you have the actual weights.<p>It could be straight up a challenge technically if its just some collection of random sklearn modules slapped together and fine tuned by some data scientist manually looking through it and editing the model on the fly.<p>It could be a trade secret &#x2F; give them some sort of edge on the competition or may do so in the future.<p>Anyhow, I don&#x27;t think Shipt necessarily has done anything wrong in this case, as the figure in the article suggests, most delivery drivers are making *more*. The ones who aren&#x27;t can find another app to deliver for if they think they&#x27;re being underpaid, its not like doordash, uber, grubhub, lyft, postmates, instacart, etc etc etc. aren&#x27;t all out there trying to build a moat of drivers or something. Surely in a hotly competitive market, wages are roughly fair for the amount of supply and demand yeah?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40872714" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40872714" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jval43</span><span>|</span><a href="#40873011">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40872714">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40872714">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Looks like nothing happened after:<p>&gt; <i>They asked for a meeting with Shipt executives, but they never got a direct response from the company.

But, when it is more out of your control, it hits harder.<p>I was young, I spent all my nights and even my whole summer holiday thinking&#x2F;coding. I dreamed about the success or career it will bring with my friend.<p>Then it was a success and we were generating some ad revenue, which was great &amp; much needed for two university students. The money was absorbed by our lives like water dripping onto dry soil. The morale was high, there was an air of optimism for the future!<p>It was an android app, and one day, I woke up with my friend&#x27;s call. He was literally crying because the google algorithm deleted and banned our account, without any explanation or recourse. You are right that it never goes away, I can still feel the pain.<p>After that, I remember walking up and down a popular and long street with my friend, without speaking much and trying to process &quot;end of the adventure&quot; feeling. Not related to google we had other human&#x2F;life problems in our lives and the simple hope we thought we built for ourselves was also gone. I was heartbroken and lost all my enthusiasm for mobile development.<p>I still wonder what would happen if I could continue down that path, with initial little success, enough money to survive as a student, and an opportunity to build upon that... It is just a parallel universe now. Google could delete our app, but guide us to the right path. If I could know the rules, I could continue and be a good citizen in google&#x27;s walled garden. While spammers can always found a way, and find motivation with their low-effort tries... google lost a developer with good intentions. I don&#x27;t think it had any effect on the algorithm or overall corporate strategy.<p>On the bright side, this event thought me to never trust a business partnership where I can not shake hands with a human that I trust and who geniunely wants my success&#x2F;not treat me as some replaceable number. (Also insert some rant about why AI overlords can be harmful and why human history created law-based order with human judgement...)<p>I think it happened over 10 years ago, I can&#x27;t even pay money to use a Google service now :) I don&#x27;t change my email, just so that it reminds me this lesson. But if I was a scammer&#x2F;spammer I would find many solutions to circumvent google AI. I tried contacting via forms when I couldn&#x27;t pay for a service and when I felt like doing so. Surprisingly, in some cases I could even reach some people via these official channels. Alas, they are powerless, they had to give template answers. I assume the last word is spoken by the Algorithm, and I&#x27;m banned for life :)<p>Overall, It is the first time I wrote about this online. I hope it helps a little. I should also say that I have no hard feelings for people working at google, they brought us great value over the years. But the brand of the company will always remind me those days, and I will always upvote when someone criticize google :) (What power do I have as a little, disposable developer? ;) ) And, no you can&#x27;t escape by changing your name to Alphabet or Alphabet soup...</div><br/><div id="37911533" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37911533" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">namanyayg</span><span>|</span><a href="#37907167">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37911184">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37911189">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37911533">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37911533">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What did your app do?

I was making maybe $70 a month or something, and dealing with bug reports. SwiftUI was not mature enough yet to use, so I was still using UIKit and I would constantly run into really hard to fix edge cases.<p>The thing that made me throw in the towel was when Google claimed I was clicking my own ads and stopped serving them, effectively cutting off all revenue. It made me realize I&#x27;d worked so hard to build this thing, and it was all at the whims of these tech giants. Apple gets a 30% cut (this was before they dropped it to 15% if you are doing under x amount per year &quot;because COVID&quot;) of every IAP, I make peanuts from ads and Google can turn those off for no reason with no way to appeal.<p>I also wasn&#x27;t trying to make a bunch of money off the app, but I needed to justify spending my time and energy on it and I just couldn&#x27;t.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37912016" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37912016" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Brian_K_White</span><span>|</span><a href="#37906826">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37907380">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37912016">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37912016">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s not all that different from the countless hours countless infinite people have spend on infinite projects that never meant much to anyone else.

There&#x27;s no standard what they need or must have - rather depends on the size of the risk, resources available at their disposal. Which often is a result of whether they have ever been hacked or not. A lot of banks never have been and feel they are invincible, and that shows in their security&#x2F;redundancy measures.<p>&quot;where the money is stored&quot;.. that one. In a nutshell, 99% of people (HN crowd including) do not understand, what is money in a bank, imagine it like some kind of electronic vault, which you as a client can access securely and transfer it (semi physically). Money in a bank does not exist. An IT guy would say &quot;it&#x27;s bits and bites, nothing more&quot;. A finance guy would say that it is a web of collaterals and liabilities. Simple example: 100 clients each open accounts with a bank and deposit 100 EUR; bank has 10&#x27;000 EUR assets and 10&#x27;000 EUR liabilities (it owes 10K to its customers); bank deposits that money, say, with TARGET2 interbank gross-settlement system (which again has accounts with other banks), so its clients can make&#x2F;get credit transfers. So, as soon as money is deposited, it gets transferred to other parties, pledged, lent or invested - it is almost never &quot;in the bank&quot;. So there&#x27;s little to steal. Even if you do, the trouble is that somebody&#x27;s asset is typically another party&#x27;s liability (and vice versa), i.e. stuff is recorded by different actors - and all that can be traced back, you can&#x27;t hack into all of them. Hence, stealing bank&#x27;s funds without a trace is close to impossible.

Privacy obviously being a crucial issue for something as potentially invasive - continuous automatic screen and audio recording - questions came up browsing the ‘Privacy first’ section:<p>“Encrypt your data using FileVault - 
Apple FileVault works with Rewind. With it enabled your data is encrypted.”<p>Is there anything Rewind does to make Apple FileVault ‘work with Rewind’?

The animations just feel so satisfying.<p>Market data is extremely complicated and I&#x27;ve seen so many get fooled into thinking it&#x27;s easy. It&#x27;s understandable, if you can google any stock and get the price, you&#x27;d assume the data is free or public domain or something like that right? Maybe a small fee at most to power an API to get it. For those wondering, it tends to go like this:<p>You look into it and it&#x27;s not quite so simple... the exchanges, like most financial services, are stuck in the past... but theres a cool website called IEX that is &quot;revolutionizing&quot; market data and can provide stock data for fairly cheap.<p>It looks like your idea might work, until you realize something is off with IEX&#x27;s data. The prices aren&#x27;t very accurate. Well it is accurate actually, only for stock trades that take place on IEX. Not NASDAQ. Not NYSE. Turns out the price of a stock that users expect is actually the last trade across ALL of the major stock exchanges.<p>Surely there is a way to get the &quot;consolidated&quot; price that reflects all exchanges? Not just IEX&#x27;s measly 2% of volume? There&#x27;s what is called the &quot;consolidated tape&quot; which is just that. Wait just kidding. It&#x27;s &quot;consolidated&quot; but requires you enter into agreements with two separate organizations called CTA and UTP, also known as SIPs (security information processors). These are the only companies allowed to license the data, so they set the prices extremely high, starting at thousands of dollars per month.<p>Well, maybe you could deal with that if your app gets enough traction. There&#x27;s more though... you can&#x27;t actually get the data from CTA or UTP. You have to have a &quot;vendor&quot; do it for you, and pass on the data. The vendor is essentially a wrapper around the SIP that handles distributing the data to end-companies (not end-users, because realistically very little individuals can afford this, and vendors aren&#x27;t too interested in dealing with individuals). Since the vendor focuses on the distribution, you&#x27;d assume their API would be top-notch. Instead you can tell it&#x27;s built upon layers and layers of technical debt and edge cases. Oh well.<p>So, you then pay for the licenses from the SIPs, and the data from the vendor. You are now burning at least 10k a month. You get your first user, and they complain they can&#x27;t find &quot;SPX&quot;, the largest stock index in the world. Oops. It turns out indices, futures, options, and other securities, are all separate SIPs. You have to deal with even more backwards organizations to get licenses for each type of security. Don&#x27;t forget the vendor wants another couple thousand for each SIP, more if you need realtime streaming or historical charting. Maybe just get indexes since they are popular? Indexes are once again spread across tens of organizations, depending on who owns the IP for the index. At this point you give up and just focus on U.S. stocks for now, until you get more funding.<p>Then one day, you are selected for a &quot;random&quot; audit by the SIP. They ask for personal information on every user you have, and claim that some users are actually financial professionals (such as a CFA or stock broker). They try to fine you 50x the price you expected because some users happen to have the same names as professional traders. (They charge a massive amount per professional trader vs per &quot;ordinary&quot; person) You have to deal with explaining what that even means and why it&#x27;s important to your users to try to avoid this fine. Maybe your application was used on TV, or over the phone, or even on an elevator. There are different licenses for that. Ridiculous? Well, the SIP is authorized by the SEC to distribute the data, and enforce it. You have no upper hand in any negotiation.<p>To be continued in blog post someday maybe<p>FWIW, your new project already has some good traction. I&#x27;ve heard about it before (not sure where, but I 100% remember seeing it)</div><br/><div id="37910422" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37910422" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">twog</span><span>|</span><a href="#37908151">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37908231">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37910422">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37910422">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great write up &amp; very accurate detailing of the problem.

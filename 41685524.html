That component is used on the 737NG and 737Max.<p>These things are relatively common in aviation. An incident happened, everything went OK, but during the investigation a problem was found. The NTSB then writes a set of recommendations and it&#x27;s likely that the FAA will issue an Airworthiness Directive (AD) that tells all operators to fix this problem.<p>Depending on the severity and the FAA&#x27;s estimate of the risk that AD will either be a &quot;fix now&quot; which is very disruptive or a &quot;fix at the next [some type] inspection&quot; which is more common.<p>Specifically with this component the NTSB seems to think it can be removed until a replacement is available:<p>&gt; Additionally, the NTSB recommended that the FAA determine if actuators with incorrectly assembled bearings should be removed from airplanes, and if so, to direct U.S. operators to do so until replacements are available.<p>In that case the plane won&#x27;t be able to do a cat III autoland anymore, but from the text is looks like it would operate normally apart from that restriction.</div><br/><div id="41685880" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41685880" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tialaramex</span><span>|</span><a href="#41685760">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41685782">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41685880">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41685880">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Category III autoland (other than to &quot;keep your hand in&quot;) is relatively rare anyway because it solves only a specific narrow problem.<p>Suppose there is one plane and it needs to land right now, but all nearby airfields are fog bound so a human couldn&#x27;t land a plane there: they&#x27;d get to minimums, still not be able to see the field and abort every time until they divert to somewhere with better weather - the Cat III autoland doesn&#x27;t need to see the field, it will land anyway. You have to absolutely trust the machine, this is a rare Fail Active system - humans can&#x27;t necessarily help even if things go wrong so once it reaches minimums it <i>must</i> land the plane even if it later ceases to have 100% confidence that it can do so correctly due to systems failure.<p>But now we&#x27;re done, the plane is on the ground, on a runway, the passengers are no longer in the sky, if the plane was about to explode or run out of fuel that&#x27;s awesome, but we can&#x27;t do this again, autoland doesn&#x27;t <i>taxi</i> the plane, and it can be pea soup out there, the pilots still can&#x27;t see the ground even though they know their plane is firmly landed.<p>So if there&#x27;s a stack of fifty planes for JFK and it&#x27;s zero visibility this technology lands one plane per runway, maybe you can land three or four, then it&#x27;s effectively closed, that&#x27;s 46 planes left to divert, it&#x27;s not useless, especially when visibility is marginal rather than truly zero, but it does not allow the airports to stay running normally.</div><br/><div id="41685918" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41685918" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">raverbashing</span><span>|</span><a href="#41685760">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41685880">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41685782">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41685918">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41685918">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; the pilots still can&#x27;t see the ground even though they know their plane is firmly landed.<p>They get a &quot;Follow me&quot; car to help the plane taxi out<p>Slower, but it is not like the plane will stay on the runway</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41685782" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41685782" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aflukasz</span><span>|</span><a href="#41685760">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41685880">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41685797">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41685782">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41685782">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Note that despite what media headlines will make of this, it wasn&#x27;t a Boeing issue in this case.

Specifically I chose to see a psychiatrist who was well versed in talk therapy, not just drugs, because I think this stuff should be approached as evidence based, medical in nature, and administered by a doctor.<p>However, one takeaway for me was that when it comes to talk therapy, some of it is evidence-based, scientific, and backed by high quality studies, however <i>most of what&#x27;s out there is not.</i> Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has good evidence of efficacy and so do maybe a few other techniques - Googling &quot;evidence based therapy&quot; is a good way to start going down the rabbit hole. It&#x27;s not that hard to learn how to do CBT, at first with a professional, and eventually on your own.<p>Once you progress past the evidence-based stuff, IMHO you&#x27;re basically just talking to a (hopefully) wise friend who you trust, which is great and might work similar to placebo, but also $200&#x2F;hr and has the potential to medicalize stuff that doesn&#x27;t need to be medicalized, so your time and money may be better spent building connections with other people (support groups, plain ol&#x27; friends etc).<p>So my point here is I think as long as you understand its limitations therapy is great. If someone is unambiguously suicidal they should probably be put on drugs plus talk therapy and then weaned off the drugs as it becomes clear they are no longer a risk to themselves, since the alternative is they die.</div><br/><div id="37086403" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37086403" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zealtrace</span><span>|</span><a href="#37084150">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37084902">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37084522">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37086403">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37086403">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I used to have the same opinion and found my model has shifted quite a bit. There are a surprising lack of high quality studies on a lot of this. However, there’s really good data on a couple points: Therapy is likely to create significant, lasting improvements compared to placebo, and the more significant factor is therapeutic relationship, not modality.<p>There’s a lot of evidence for CBT because it’s a modality that is relatively easy to study, and so it’s studied a lot. It’s very structured and designed to produce results quickly. This doesn’t mean it’s superior in general.<p>Chronic psychological disorders are strongly correlated with early attachment issues and adverse childhood experiences. There are many ways to address this, but I would view a successful long term therapy as reprogramming a nervous system rather than talking to a friend or building new habits. In my experience, even many therapists fail to understand this distinction.

CBT, which is an insufficient band-aid invented to give us practical tricks to cope with the contradictions of a capitalistic society in order to get back to being productive and “functional”, may very well fit your description. In fact it gives you tricks and homeworks you would not need if you had a community or good and deep relationships.<p>Psychoanalysis on the other hand is something else completely.
It does not solve you, judge you, nor offer answer.

If you have the money and the confidence required to share very personal things with four different psychiatrists, it may work for you—it doesn’t seem likely to for me.<p>2) Knowing my own dislike for pseudo- or cargo cult science, I foresee how we would have to spend a lot of time diving into the “why” underlying every point, and I know from experience how it’s awkward (not to mention a waste of money and time) when you have done your own research and start noticing that a professional, in fact, (A) doesn’t know something and (B) unable to admit it and do more research (made worse if that person (C) charges by the hour).<p>Really, I <i>can</i> get on board with the idea of someone telling me that I’m in denial and me snapping out of it, but assuming I can’t acknowledge that when <i>my friends</i> say so why would I suddenly believe a person who knows me much less and, no offence, for all I know may well be making a living doing something not very far removed from fortune telling?<p>Long story short, it’s likely a Bad Idea(tm) to take these matters into your own hands[0], but I instead try to educate myself on the fundamentals by reading books. Among my recent findings on this topic is Iain McGilchrist’s <i>The Master and His Emissary</i>, if the above resonates with you may like it too (though I’ve only recently started it, not yet halfway through). Iain is, no surprise, a psychiatrist, but with a huge lean towards neuroscience, which is a good combination that to me makes for an interesting&#x2F;palatable read. Being more or less the opposite of a self-help book, it builds on analysis of fairly hardcore well-sourced research and so far I feel enabled to make my own conclusions as to how it may (or may not, yet to be seen) apply to my psychological balance (slash lack thereof).<p>[0] Of course, this should go with a big red warning label that *I have not tried therapy* (yet?). Don’t listen to me, probably.</div><br/><div id="37086073" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37086073" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tveita</span><span>|</span><a href="#37085854">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37085341">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37086073">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37086073">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It might be a helpful framing to think of handling emotions and dealing with adversity as life skills, like cooking.<p>There isn&#x27;t one single &quot;correct&quot; way to cook. Most people pick up some cooking skills naturally as they grow up - from family, from friends, through reading books or TV shows. But some people grow up with parents who are bad at cooking, in an environment where most people don&#x27;t cook, and they will themselves be bad at cooking as adults. If they realize that later, &quot;How come all my friends talk about cooking rice like it&#x27;s no big deal&quot;, they might benefit from taking a cooking class, or sitting down and reading a basic cookbook. It could be a &quot;food science&quot; book that tells you the chemistry of Maillard reaction, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be. The important thing is to try out different ways to cook than what you&#x27;re used to, guided by someone who is good at cooking. That will be more effective that sitting down and trying to rediscover how to make an omelette from scratch.<p>Most people are getting by with their normal cooking skills, but everyone who could probably discover some ways to improve by watching a cooking show, or taking a cooking class. We could consider teaching more cooking in school to make sure everyone knows some minimum amount of cooking to get by in life.</div><br/><div id="37086461" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37086461" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">strogonoff</span><span>|</span><a href="#37085854">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37086073">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37085341">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37086461">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37086461">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Nice analogy, and there’s similarity between cooking and mental health care in how either can probably be explained quite formally at low levels, but the rabbit hole is so deep that to get any real-life utility in reasonable timeframe it seems like you just have to give up theory and follow some guidance or recipes.<p>Which I don’t mind, generally (discovering and applying meditation or other therapy techniques). What I mind about typical “therapy” as described here is that consulting someone, unlike with cooking, seems to require disclosing a lot about yourself to a person whom you probably don’t have enough information to determine the skill and depth of until after that disclosure has happened.<p>Plus, I suspect if you become sufficiently interested in how cooking works, you are not going to be satisfied by recipes or just-so advice.

In the story, Breuer helps Nietzsche with his despair while Nietzsche offers philosophical insights that challenge Breuer’s own beliefs and practices. The book delves into existentialism, psychotherapy, and the therapeutic process in an engaging manner. It provides a fictional account of the possible origins of psychotherapy while exploring the deep emotional and intellectual challenges faced by both men.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37085349" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37085349" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neom</span><span>|</span><a href="#37085341">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37085470">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37085349">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37085349">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Her twitter and tiktok are interesting, one of the few young folks publishing about philosophy.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;noampomsky" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;noampomsky</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tiktok.com&#x2F;@bookbearexpress" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tiktok.com&#x2F;@bookbearexpress</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37085470" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37085470" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">airbreather</span><span>|</span><a href="#37085349">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37086401">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37085470">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37085470">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There are undoubtably many cases where therapy is needed to help someone who is stuck, or so badly hurt or damaged they really need some one elses help to get past where they are at..<p>But, TBH, my experience is that in a fair few cases therapy is for people that just can&#x27;t be honest with themselves.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37086401" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37086401" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bowsamic</span><span>|</span><a href="#37085470">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37084534">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37086401">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37086401">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Therapy is no more a monolith than medications in general are a monolith.

If you&#x27;re amending a commit surely the &quot;change&quot; has changed so the change ID should also change? If the &quot;change&quot; isn&#x27;t tracking the actual changes then what could it be tracking?<p>Overall I think this is just more confusing than using git but I think it&#x27;s cool that people are building alternative clients. That&#x27;s definitely the way to go if you want adoption.<p>Making history manipulation easier seems like a bit of a recipe for disaster given my experience training people. That old XKCD about git comes to mind and honestly that&#x27;s where most people stay, if you bother to learn it then things like Jujitsu are probably harder to use for you. If you aren&#x27;t interested in learning git to that level then I doubt you want &#x2F; need something like Jujitsu.<p>For those curious the &quot;multiple branches&quot; at a time thing they&#x27;re selling can be done with git, IMO easily, using worktrees: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;git-worktree" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;git-worktree</a></div><br/><div id="40843849" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40843849" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">FranGro78</span><span>|</span><a href="#40843406">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40843456">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40843849">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40843849">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’ve also run into problems with tools that aren’t worktree aware so often that I’ve stopped using it.<p>I’ve been using jujutsu for about 6 months now, and the only time I’ve reached back for git was when I had to rebase and amend someone else’s branch to get it merged (when they weren’t available to do so themselves of course).<p>Switching between changes in jujutsu has been a pleasant experience for me thus far, although I’m not as good with it as I was with stacked-git to keep local only changes (things I’m hacking to match my workflow &#x2F; local setup) out of change sets.<p>The way it displays diffs is also still something I am getting used to, and have made plenty of mistakes when pulling in changes from trunk. That’s probably more of a case of “old dog new tricks” than jujutsu.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40843456" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40843456" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fragmede</span><span>|</span><a href="#40843406">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40843849">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40843456">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40843456">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">worktrees are pretty great but they make some things a bit more complicated conceptually compared to just checking out two copies for some people</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

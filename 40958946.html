BLE sends beacons hundred times per minute, even from phones. For privacy reasons the Mac addresses are randomized.
The attacker can further analyze the beacons for imperfections in the rf signal and get a fingerprint for devices from frequency offsets&#x2F;drift&#x2F;iq imbalance.<p>Haven&#x27;t seen the new paper, but the article suggests the a firmware change can even reduce this attack vector. I guess that introducing further randomization in chipset parameters for each beacon can make this kind of tracking harder still. I doubt that this hides all aspects of fingerprinting and settings stepsizes would still be observable, just harder to track. &quot;Randomization pattern F is this manufacturer gen 2025 devices&quot;<p>My take on this: most of the day, I would not need any beacons at all - maybe there is an intelligent limit on avoiding them? Configurable? Only when unlocked? Only when in motion?
Sometimes sending half the beacons would double the time needed for tracking already. Again, this would boil down to &quot;a firmware update could improve privacy&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="40959232" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40959232" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">IshKebab</span><span>|</span><a href="#40959627">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40959232">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40959232">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a very confusing article.

These beacons enable features like Apple’s “Find My”--a tracking service to find a lost device as well as COVID-19 tracing apps; and connect smartphones to other devices such as wireless earphones.<p>&gt; The current approach taken by smartphone companies to make the devices hard to track by their Bluetooth signals is to randomly change the phone’s identity, its MAC address. However, that doesn’t address the physical-layer fingerprints inherent in each device’s transmissions due to unique hardware imperfections.<p>&gt; All wireless devices have small manufacturing imperfections in the hardware used to emit these beacons that are unique to each device. These fingerprints are an accidental byproduct of the manufacturing process. These imperfections in Bluetooth hardware result in unique distortions, which can be used as a fingerprint to track a specific device.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40959308" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40959308" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">0xDEADFED5</span><span>|</span><a href="#40959232">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40959614">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40959274">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40959308">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40959308">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">it all makes sense if you read the paper linked at the top of the article.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40959274" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40959274" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">arlort</span><span>|</span><a href="#40959232">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40959308">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40959274">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40959274">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think they might be referring to ble advertisement packets</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

When we&#x27;re discussing capitalism, people seem to get it in their head that it&#x27;s either what we have now, or you can fuck off to North Korea.<p>How I would characterize my ideal economy is one where the feedback loop works: people can make reasonable guesses about what a product is, how long it will work for, and what its cost is. They can adjust their purchases according to their needs, which tells us which products should exist and which should not. Businesses do not trick the customers into thinking a thing has more value than it actually does. A very large part of this economy is accurate information, and a very large part of accurate information is trust. After all nobody is going to know more about the product than the people who made it, and they will always have an interest in representing their product in the most positive light. Lemon problem.<p>The thing that seems to characterize the economy now is that businesses will violate your trust in order to make money. They know that you won&#x27;t read the license agreement when you sign up for a service, and they will use that. They know that you won&#x27;t be checking what kind of joins your sofa has. They know that you won&#x27;t get as much value from their items as the adverts say. All of these abuses can be done within the law, perhaps because these same businesses are involved with shaping the law.<p>The feedback loop is broken, and this leads to the same problem as what the Soviet Union had. Their problem wasn&#x27;t that people were lazy and didn&#x27;t go to work. Their problem was that they made the wrong stuff. Things that nobody wanted, often with the same quality issues as what you get these days buying an item from a market economy. Note that GDP figures will still not know this, it just sees all the crap and counts the money paid for it.<p>Often we pick on MBAs when it comes to this sort of critique, and there&#x27;s some merit to it. If your only goal is to make money, and the economy is riddled with loopholes where you can make money without providing value, then we will have an economy that doesn&#x27;t provide a lot of value, because MBAs are really good at finding these types of things.</div><br/><div id="40552390" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40552390" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">refulgentis</span><span>|</span><a href="#40552363">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40552261">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40552390">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40552390">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This sort of thing is satisfying to write and even more satisfying to read and nod along to.<p>But it&#x27;s paper-thin histrionics.<p>&quot;an ad said I&#x27;d value something and I didn&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;I didn&#x27;t read the license agreement&quot; are trans-mutated into &quot;abuse&quot; that should obviously be illegal, and somehow become grist for all sorts of grand invocations, GDP, capitalism, MBAs, North Korea...<p>You&#x27;re free to check what joins your sofa has.

The focus should actually be &quot;how we found out&quot;, something like what the book A Brief History of Everything traces out. Things like &quot;we used isotopes with different masses to figure out this thing about phosphorous in DNA&quot;.<p>In general, the &quot;what&quot; makes no sense without the history. Why were we searching for DNA in the mid 20th century? What did we already know? Retracing science as an investigation would be much more beneficial to kids than making them remember the conclusions. It&#x27;s much more portable as a skill to understand the path of investigation than some facts about organelles that they aren&#x27;t likely to use.<p>But the real reason I dropped biology when the choice came (and why did it come, dear IB organisation?) is that biology is not seen as the smart kid subject, when compared to physics and chemistry. Part if this is that you can grind your way through memorizing the biochemical cycles, probably easier for most than learning calculus that you need for physics. But part of it is simply reputation, and it&#x27;s not reasonable.<p>I have a friend who is a postdoc stats guy in the biology field.

We know a lot about how cells and proteins work now. But despite this fact, it is still extremely difficult to understand exactly what is happening within a given cell <i>in situ</i>. Many measurement methods are likely to destroy or alter the thing you’re trying to measure… think Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle - the act of measuring the thing changes its state. Everything is sensitive to temperature, shear, ionic strength, pH, etc… and of course most methods rely on these levers to gain resolution and signal. So you have to have a clear idea of what you think is happening to even select a measurement technique that won’t ruin it. This is part of why, while we know a lot of the fundamentals, it is still hard to engineer functionality in specific environments .. engineering requires a lot of measurement and feedback.<p>I think that also offers insight into why software can be engineered so quickly. It’s a discipline where you can (relatively) easily place a probe wherever you want and understand exactly what’s happening in a (sometimes) deterministic manner. Everyone else is taking fuzzy shots in the dark compared to software. Imagine <i>replicates</i> being a thing you have to think about when debugging a program. Like in software, running your code again with no changes after it just failed is insanity. In every other engineering discipline, you sometimes have entire meetings to decide <i>how many times</i> to retry something that just failed.</div><br/><div id="40110806" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40110806" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jbm</span><span>|</span><a href="#40110618">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40111147">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40110806">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40110806">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is exactly why I switched to computer science after finishing my biology BSc.<p>I don&#x27;t get nightmares about analytic chemistry anymore, but the level of self-loathing you get from doing labs that never work out for reasons that defy understanding make the annoyance of debugging code seem quaint almost.<p>(I should really say &quot;it used to&quot;, but now that I can run an LLM call locally and get a completely different response than the deployed version of a piece of software, with all other factors seemingly being equal...)</div><br/><div id="40111024" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40111024" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">adonovan</span><span>|</span><a href="#40110618">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40110806">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40111147">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40111024">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40111024">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I too switched from biochem to CS: it was such a relief to work in a field where I felt that, as in math, you can get by remembering axioms and rules and derive the rest, without all the arcana of biology.

Perhaps what makes computer science unique is how unusually successful it has been in wrangling physics into a machine that appears to execute the laws of mathematics. Physics does rear its head from time to time (e.g. rowhammer and &quot;single-event upsets&quot;), but it is truly impressive how little we have to consider the physical nature of the machine nowadays.<p>However, other engineering disciplines do also try to build similar abstractions with varying levels of success. We&#x27;ve managed to build simple books of electrical standards that can be used by electricians around the world to build and reason about power systems without having to understand the weird quantum mind of an electron.

You need to learn an awful lot of facts before you can start putting the puzzle pieces together to see the big picture. But once you do, the view is amazing!<p>As an aside, I lament that the author equates &quot;biology&quot; with &quot;molecular biology&quot;. He completely ignores the wonders of ecology - the beauty of biodiversity, the marvel of trophic cascades, the intricacies of ecosystem functioning. In fact, I think the challenges he sees for molecular biology are heightened for ecology: what you learn of it in high school is often even drier, you need even more background knowledge to be able to see the big picture, and research is even more challenging because experiments can seldom be done in a lab. Yet, once you&#x27;ve dug your way into it, you get to see systems at work that span the globe, that are as complex as anything that happens in a cell, just more vibrant and tangible and alive.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40112523" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40112523" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mogoman</span><span>|</span><a href="#40112476">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40109069">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40112523">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40112523">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As others have mentioned, this resonates well.

The great revelation for me was that at its core, biology is a physical, engineering discipline - it&#x27;s all about how 3D shapes and surfaces interact and fit together to produce structure and function, from protein complexes up to tissues and organs.<p>I wish more biology education focused on cultivating that sense of awe at the nanoscale world of the cell. Imagine if introductory classes posed biology as the greatest reverse-engineering project in the universe - here is this self-replicating machine of staggering complexity, your task is to figure out how it works! Let students discover for themselves the logic and elegance of core concepts like the Central Dogma.<p>The other key point is that evolution needs to be the central organizing framework, not an afterthought. You simply cannot make sense of biology without viewing it through the lens of evolutionary processes shaping structure and function over deep time. When taught this way, even rote memorization takes on new meaning.<p>We are living through a golden age of biological discovery, from the frontiers of neuroscience to the dizzying possibilities of synthetic biology.

So, if thats a plausible upper limit for how many genes we can hold in our head too, then we’re toast. Each cell has thousands of distinct proteins, and many more small molecules. When we knock out one gene, we regularly see hundreds change in response. We just can’t hold that large of a system in our head. Parts of it, maybe, but genes are so interconnected that it’s very hard to draw a sensible boundary between distinct “parts”. Also biology behaves in really unintuitive ways. Feedback loops, randomness, long tailed distributions. These are very important concepts for biological systems. Humans are also notoriously bad at thinking about all of them.<p>It’s just too big and too weird to try to think about a single cell.

Yes, taxonomy can be a drag (certainly in high school, or even early college). But you need to learn something about what&#x27;s out there before you can start to think about, and wonder at, how it works. Ecology is an amazing subject, as complex and intricate as anything in molecular biology. (In a way, it&#x27;s even more cryptic than the latter, because most of the experiments can&#x27;t be done in a lab.) The problem is that most people have no clue what&#x27;s out there, and so they never see the beauty that surrounds them, or realise the wonderful web of life playing out all around them.<p>Come for a walk with me through the woods, and let me tell you something about how ants grow their own food, or go to war with a neighbouring tribe, or treat their wounded with antibiotics. Or let&#x27;s take a look at a dead tree, and see how the fungus has softened the wood, how beetles have burrowed through it, how they in turn attract woodpeckers, whose holes are then re-used by owls.<p>Due respect to Feynman as a physicist, but he had no clue about ecology.

Living organisms managed to develop chemistry in very tough conditions.<p>All is done in environment full of water. Water itself is good solvent for some reactions. However, in many of other reactions it acts as reagent and before chemical process is started the water needs to be removed. Biochemistry laughs at water.
Another thing is the temperature. Considering human (but there are many organisms without internal temperature control, and there is much colder than in our bodies) it is only 37 deg. C. Many chemical reactions are endothermic, they require a lot of energy to pass the activation barrier. In the laboratory we can keep the reaction under the reflux, which means constant boiling for hours or sometimes even days.
Another thing is the pH. Some reactions require to be done in more or less acidic or basic environment. Biochemistry also laughs at pH and all is done in 7.4 (considering human). 
And finally, stereochemistry. It is also very important how the molecule is oriented in space. Things like proteins need to fold in specific manner.<p>If someone looks on the biochemical pathways they are indeed very complex. But it is not without purpose.

But showing your work is tedious in some fields, and impossible in others. The questions posed in biology must be formulated to be answerable a-priori with evidence that often appears to be biased towards confirmation outside of the domains of specialized experts.<p>It&#x27;s hard to inspire wonder in the juxtapositional environment where any discovery will, at minimum, produce a magnitude more questions - all to be relegated to labels until another wave of motivation and technological processes facilitate another plateau of progress to be confronted.<p>Biology is hard. It&#x27;s like reverse engineering, from scratch, the watch you found on the beach; 50 years and 50 miles away from the watch factory.</div><br/><div id="40109451" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40109451" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wrs</span><span>|</span><a href="#40109241">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40108922">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40109451">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40109451">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It’s much, much harder than that! The watch was at least designed by a human, with parts that have at most a few simultaneous functions.

Biology is just a giant soup of whatever works. Any organizing principles are accidental or only exist in the eye of the beholder.<p>Finding some temporary unifying mechanism or principle to organize understanding with is the only way to make progress, but the history of biology is packed with ideas that eventually hardened into dogma and blocked progress until somebody managed to blow them up.</div><br/><div id="40109620" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40109620" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Jerrrry</span><span>|</span><a href="#40109241">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40109451">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40108922">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40109620">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40109620">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Biology is just a giant soup of whatever works.

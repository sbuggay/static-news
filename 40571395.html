Who wants to switch jobs when it means studying for a month or two? Also, if you get unlucky and some try hard drops an atomic LC hard bomb on you now you have an entire company you can no longer apply to for a year.<p>2) A way to mask bias in the process while claiming that it’s a fair process because everyone has a clear&#x2F;similar objective.<p>Meet someone who went to your Alma mater? Same gender? Same race? Give them the same question as everyone else, but hint them through it, ignore some syntax errors, and give them a strong hire for “communication” when they didn’t even implement the optimal approach…<p>Or is it someone you don’t like for X reason? Drop a leetcode hard on them and send them packing and just remain silent the entire interview.<p>To the company this is acceptable noise, but to the individual, this is costing us 100s of thousands of dollars, because there’s only a handful of companies that pay well and they all have the same interview process. Failing 3 interviews probably means you’re now out $200-300k of additional compensation from the top paying companies.<p>I’ve interviewed for and at FAANGs. I can’t believe the low bar of people that we’ve hired, while simultaneously seeing insane ridiculous quad tree&#x2F;number theory type questions that have caused other great engineers to miss out on good opportunities.<p>Someone will reply to me “if you know how to problem solve you will always pass.” Ok, come interview with me and I will ask you verbatim one of those quad tree&#x2F;number theory&#x2F;inclusion exclusion principle questions and I’d love to see you squirm, meanwhile another candidate is asked a basic hash map question.</div><br/><div id="40571561" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40571561" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">emodendroket</span><span>|</span><a href="#40571515">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40571636">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40571561">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40571561">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m sure anyone determined to do so can act unfairly regardless of what process is in place, but the fact that there is a standardized test in my mind does the opposite and makes the process much fairer.

Leetcode is used to select for one of (or both of these) 2 things for the average IC hire:<p>1. Do you work hard (i.e a person who studies many problems, memorizes solutions, and regurgitates then)<p>2. Are you smart (i.e a person who doesn&#x27;t do any leetcode but knows the fundamentals and can sythesize past knowledge well enough to answer a new question)<p>Now in a vaccuum, my takeaway from someone who doesn&#x27;t pass a leetcode question is that they are more likely to not be either of those (given no other information about them). In my opinion, solving at least one leetcode easy - medium question (maybe with some direction from the interviewer) should be the standard for any role where you need to code.<p>And realistically, companies index less on leetcode skill as you become more senior or apply to more niche roles. And plenty of companies out there have bug squash rounds, system design, behaviorals, take homes, trivia, background specific questions, etc. Leetcode is usually not the be all end all for hires above entry level. Leetcode is not meant to magically select for the best engineers. Its simply another signal for the hiring committee to use.</div><br/><div id="40571621" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40571621" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kristopolous</span><span>|</span><a href="#40571551">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40572203">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40571621">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40571621">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s skills that a 4-year college student learns at approximately 19 and then promptly does not use for their next 50 years of actually building things.<p>It leaves out looking at the engineering skills it takes to put something past the finish line on budget.<p>It&#x27;s at best, an adjacent sideshow and at worse a proxy for ageism to preference people closer to 19 and less capable at getting quality software out the door.<p>And maybe that&#x27;s why the industry has such a damn hard time getting quality software out the door.<p>Maybe.<p>Here&#x27;s a far better idea. Give them a broken build or crashed code or some other failure and ask them to fix it. If they can navigate around a system, diagnose a defect, find the cause, offer a patch, and match the coding&#x2F;commenting style etc, that&#x27;s an actual player you need, not someone who can still solve an algo question from their CS101B midterm exam at 37.<p>This version can go deep as well. You can have separate branches and an issue tracker, maybe with the conversation of the bug already going. Maybe the comments have a patchfile that needs to be manually applied. Maybe the patch has a new bug in it ... Perhaps it&#x27;s a red herring and addressing a similar but unrelated issue. Maybe it&#x27;s a closed bug and a regression and nobody wrote a unit test for it.

At that point I politely pointed out that we are not a good fit and wished him the best. 30 mins later my friend called me to ask what happened. The CTO apparently told everyone how poorly I behaved and how measly my skills are. When I told him about what really happened he was quite shocked. He talked to the CEO who did call me next day.

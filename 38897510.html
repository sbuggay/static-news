We hear claims like &quot;harmful world&quot;, &quot;shapist&quot; (as a derogatory term for the natural human desire to be surrounded by like-minded individuals), &quot;society cracks and splits&quot;, and a rather distasteful analogy between supposed biases and dirt. None of these assertions are ever justified by the authors. They are simply assumed to be correct, and presented to the reader as moral axioms.<p>But of course, such claims are amenable to empirical analysis. One obvious approach is to compare rural and urban environments. Rural, isolated societies tend to be much less diverse than those found in modern &quot;world cities&quot;. If the moral valuation implied by this article is correct, it should be possible to demonstrate that the society in a typical metropolis is, in some obvious way, &quot;better&quot; than that in a typical village.<p>It certainly isn&#x27;t obvious to me that this is indeed the case. I&#x27;ve lived in places where a dozen languages could be heard spoken on the street, and I&#x27;ve lived in villages that looked like they were frozen in time. I&#x27;ve been part of the majority, and I&#x27;ve been a one-in-a-thousand outsider, catching stares from random people who passed me by.

Perhaps your friend has opportunities to pursue passions in women&#x27;s sports, but what if she wanted to enter the corporate world and work her way up to management, C-level, etc? She will find it more difficult to pursue this opportunity than you would. Even in women&#x27;s sports she will have a different (and subjectively worse) experience than a man would have in his sporting career: to this day women in sports earn less than men and are often treated not as athletes but as sexual objects that compete for the attention of male viewers -- for example, in 2021 the European Handball Federation imposed a fine on the Norwegian women&#x27;s team because they wore shorts instead of bikinis during their match, like the men&#x27;s uniform.<p>&gt; Of course all children everywhere do not have the right to choose their own path.

External factors still collide all too often.<p>Children not having the right to choose their own path is not a recent development, it is a fact which has long been historically true and in the context of this history draws a throughline to reduced opportunities to this day. To give one oft-cited example, consider generational wealth disparities between white and black Americans. White families have had generations to accumulate relative wealth, comfort, and security, dating back to the founding of the United States, wealth in many cases built from slave labor, in other cases from discriminatory laws such as the Homestead Act and redlining. This wealth gives them access to opportunities, such as economic access to higher education, but also access to better (more expensive) neighborhoods with better schools and so on. Black families in the US have been historically unable to build generational wealth due specifically to this history of racism, and today a black child has significantly reduced opportunities for these reasons among others (institutional racism in other forms is still a big deal in the US). A black family has never been able to choose the same paths as a white family in the United States, now and throughout the history of the country.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38898748" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38898748" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jojobas</span><span>|</span><a href="#38898531">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38898670">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38899238">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38898957">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38898748">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38898748">[15 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s no reason every child has to have equal opportunity.

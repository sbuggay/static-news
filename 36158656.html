As a former Math&#x2F;CS major  turned eye surgeon, I can&#x27;t help but think about how much easier my life would be had I stuck with tech. It&#x27;s hard to understand exactly how hard the job is until you&#x27;ve lived it. I saw 40 patient&#x27;s in clinic today in 8 hours without lunch or any kind of downtime and then spent 2 hours at the hospital because a patient needed an emergent procedure. They might go blind despite my efforts and I have to live with that. I also may get sued, if they&#x27;re feeling spicy, despite going to heroic lengths to help this person.  My son was asleep before I got home.<p>There&#x27;s just no reason to do the job when you can get the same compensation working remotely in tech. Looking through the &quot;Who&#x27;s Hiring&quot; thread is soul-crushing. Physician salaries are the only ones that do not grow relative to inflation and have decreased year-on-year relative to inflation for decades.<p>I do believe that the rigorous training model leads to a higher quality of care and much deeper understanding of the disease process. But, why would anyone want to do the job? It&#x27;s just not worth the liability anymore. That said, is anyone hiring an ophthalmologist with CS and Math degrees?</div><br/><div id="36174572" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36174572" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">weatherlite</span><span>|</span><a href="#36173985">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36174106">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36174572">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36174572">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; There&#x27;s just no reason to do the job when you can get the same compensation working remotely in tech.

Most U.S physicians make 300K + after residency with job security set for life. The real bright ones, the &quot;faang&quot; doctors make close to a million. Show me anyone in tech who can have that guaranteed for him. You&#x27;re basically guaranteed to join the millionaire club if you decide to work enough years even as a mediocre doctor.
Yes its an extremely difficult job I have no argument there, but there&#x27;s no comparison to tech in terms of compensation or job security.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36174106" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36174106" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xvedejas</span><span>|</span><a href="#36173985">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36174572">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36174553">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36174106">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36174106">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The biggest complaint I always hear from people in the medical field is the long hours.

Even though the system was not efficient, it wasn&#x27;t disastrous by itself, only suboptimal.<p>I am sorry but it is total BS. I grew up in late USSR and can attest that its economy was in free fall. Central planning was one big demotivator and major contributor to the economic disastor. There were no incentives whatsoever to do your job well. Social mobility, career growth depended on factors outside of your direct control. Productivity was a fraction of what it was in the West. Bottom line -- any attempt on economic central planning first has to solve the problem of motivating productivity of human free agents.

Results
South African students trained in Cuba have had beneficial experiences which orientate them towards primary health care and prevention. Their subsequent training in South Africa is intended to fill skill gaps related to TB, HIV and major trauma. However this training is ad hoc and variable in duration and demoralizing for some students. Cuban-trained students have stronger aspirations than those trained in South Africa to work in rural and underserved communities from which many of them are drawn.<p>Conclusion
Attempts to assimilate returning Cuban-trained students will require a reframing of the current negative narrative by focusing on positive aspects of their training, orientation towards primary care and public health, and their aspirations to work in rural and under-served urban areas. Cuban-trained doctors could be part of the solution to South Africaâs health workforce problems.

Some would say US doctors are more productive.<p>The alternative is not more doctors, but more &quot;advanced practice&quot; providers - Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants (or Associates).  Their numbers have increased dramatically, and they have taken over anything routine and many ancillary functions of complex cases.  PA schools in particular have proliferated, and produced an over-supply of PA&#x27;s, who depend entirely on having a supervising physician.  NP&#x27;s by contrast benefit from the long history of unionization in nursing, have taken over management in many cases, and restrict the supply at the school level.  Overall they top out at what doctors start at, even with decades of experience.  It&#x27;s good for young professionals, but there&#x27;s not a lot of headroom.<p>As for dependence on foreign schools, the US has more foreign graduates in every field, and most have been hired into hospital systems as a way of combating medical practice groups.<p>The independent medical practice groups almost completely died out, as hospital systems refused to contract out to practices, and instead hired doctors as employees so they could control costs.  Recently with private equity targeting specific local monopolies, you&#x27;re getting specialty practices in radiology, anesthesiology, cardiology (mostly stenting) and now even GI, where the same private equity firm coordinates everyone in a geographical area (and pursues a number of dark-billing practices).  There may be small internal practice in the hospital for poor people to get middling care, but the good doctors go into the practice groups.<p>Access to care comes down to logistics (terrible IT) and PCP&#x27;s being used to reduce care.  They hate it, which is why those who can avoid primary care.<p>The other side of supply is loss. Doctors are leaving the profession at a high rate because they&#x27;re not really doing medicine (and they can afford to leave).  They need better systems and adjuncts and more sensitive administration.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36173467" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36173467" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nine_zeros</span><span>|</span><a href="#36173832">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36173581">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36173467">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36173467">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Most problems in a rich country like America are entirely created due to backwards, uneducated policies.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36173581" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36173581" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">whitemary</span><span>|</span><a href="#36173467">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36173996">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36173581">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36173581">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Socialism or Barbarism.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

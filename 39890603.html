Adding 1991 and -3 to +3 years to the plot should show the trend change.<p>&gt; Huge quantities of particles from Pinatubo&#x27;s tall ash cloud injected into the global wind system in the stratosphere. These particles affected the weather in two ways. Tiny aerosol droplets reflected sunlight away from Earth causing cooling at the surface. Scientists observed a maximum global cooling of about 1.5°C. Sunsets and sunrises were more brilliant because of the fine ash and gases high in the air.<p>I wonder if artists painting pleinair before&#x2F;after the eruption would show the intensity change of sunset&#x2F;sunrises in their work too.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ngdc.noaa.gov&#x2F;hazard&#x2F;stratoguide&#x2F;pinfeat.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ngdc.noaa.gov&#x2F;hazard&#x2F;stratoguide&#x2F;pinfeat.html</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39891725" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39891725" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">isodev</span><span>|</span><a href="#39891407">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39891481">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39891725">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39891725">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We’re a bit like the dinosaurs only when the asteroid is approaching, we put all our energy and resources into making NFT photos of it and train AI models to generate photos of asteroids based on a text prompt.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39891481" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39891481" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">roughly</span><span>|</span><a href="#39891725">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39891384">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39891481">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39891481">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Click on over to the Sea Temperature graph on that page if you’re looking for a good time.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39891384" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39891384" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">oceanplexian</span><span>|</span><a href="#39891481">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39891480">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39891384">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39891384">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So, to cherry pick an example, the chart has data from 1954, three years before the launch of Sputnik.<p>How high is the confidence in the global surface air temperature data before the existence of satellites?

(mean temperature, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature) can be well
reproduced by ERA5 reanalysis over China. ERA5 tends to exhibit more misdetection
for the duration of extreme temperature events than extreme temperature intensity and
frequency. In addition, ERA5 performed best in the summer and worst in the winter<p>But even in Europe the dataset can have some issues, e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;2073-4441&#x2F;14&#x2F;4&#x2F;543" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;2073-4441&#x2F;14&#x2F;4&#x2F;543</a><p>&gt; Comparing ERA5 with the other two datasets, ERA5 temperature presents more extreme temperature and small outliers for regions southern of 40° latitude and less extreme temperatures in areas over the Black Sea. In Scandinavia, ERA5 temperatures are more frequently extreme than the observational ones<p>There are more articles like these on how well ERA5 captures temperature&#x2F;wind speed&#x2F;etc, or certain global events, extremes, anomalies, etc., in different locations and time, but I couldn&#x27;t find more for your other questions (on mobile).</div><br/></div></div><div id="39891610" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39891610" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">defrost</span><span>|</span><a href="#39891384">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39891643">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39891480">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39891610">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39891610">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Given ground based measurements were used to tune and &quot;ground truth&quot; satellite readings your concerns are exactly arse backwards.<p>Given the spread of civilisation across the globe and relative nearness of cities to each other (with the obvious exception of Perth, Western Australia) and the &quot;coarseness&quot; of a <i>global</i> mean .. the law of averages and the heat equations provide a mean that has high confidence.<p>How high?

As an exercise, let’s double it to 2% of GDP.<p>Now, given that climate mitigation is projected to cost 1-7% of GDP [2].<p>Economically, trying to “solve” the climate costs as much or more than it saves. It also results in a lower quality of life. For example, people not using their air conditioners because of high energy costs, or people spending 10 hours on a train rather than 2 hours on an airplane, or people being coaxed to eat insects rather than steak. Not to mention high energy costs which impact the poorest people disproportionally more than they do for the Al Gores of the world.<p>It would seem that in terms of worldwide health, that reducing actual pollution (particulates, poisons in water, chemicals in food, carcinogens, etc.) would have a far greater positive impact on the world than trying to fight temperatures. I wholehearted support reducing environmental toxins and improving our seemingly poisoned food supply.<p>All of this is assuming that human-derived CO2 is having a material effect on temperature, which is extremely hard to prove to a strong enough degree to warrant literally changing the entire world’s economy.<p>During the lockdowns, California roads were almost empty. Air travel was significantly reduced worldwide, Industrial output was severely curtailed. This was true in many places across the world and yet, was there even a single degree of temperature difference? Was there even a tenth of degree effect? If shutting down the economy didn’t affect temperatures, then covering the landscape with windmills and solar panels is going to do even less. Driving up energy and transportation costs when even a near shutdown of the world economy didn’t change anything seems to be foolish.<p>Taxing “carbon” is ridiculous. Literally everything is carbon. A tax on carbon is a tax on life itself. We might as well tax breathing. Which probably is the goal. Make breathing more expensive so fewer people choose to do it. It’s dystopian and this whole discussion in not dissimilar to the “settled science” of eugenics 100 years ago. “Science,” celebrities, and popular politicians of the day were all convinced that Eugenics would save humanity. Hitler took that idea to its natural extreme which made people realize that Eugenics wasn’t all that great when it meant that you were next in the gas chamber.<p>“Science” was convinced on their Covid theories. The six foot social distancing was made up [4], natural immunity was ignored [5], and masks didn’t do anything, and school closures were a disaster. The “vaccine” was a joke (the first vaccine in history that made you more likely to get the disease it was supposed to prevent.) Remember when the lab leak theory wasn’t just criticized, but even sharing the theory would get you banned on social media? Yet a virus that started in a town where they had a lab doing gain of function research on viruses just like the Covid virus — it was apparently completely ridiculous to conclude that the virus came from that lab? Two weeks to flatten the curve? Really?<p>If we got Covid so wrong despite “Science” and politicians being so sure and the pundits being so convinced that closing beaches and telling people to stay inside to day drink was safer than people going outside in the fresh air.. then is it too crazy to suspect that these same “experts” are probably wrong about other “Science” as well? Fool me once..<p>I’m convinced that climate policy isn’t about climate. But about an attempt to redistribute wealth and control society. [3]<p>So yes, for many of us, this is nonsense.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41467-023-41888-1#:~:text=Climate%20change%2Dattributed%20economic%20costs%20from%20extreme%20weather%20events%20vary,annually%20over%20the%20study%20period" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41467-023-41888-1#:~:text=C...</a>.<p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s44168-023-00041-w#:~:text=Total%20costs%20of%20global%20climate,1a" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s44168-023-00041-w#:~:text=T...</a>).<p>3. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lemonde.fr&#x2F;en&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;article&#x2F;2022&#x2F;11&#x2F;05&#x2F;thomas-piketty-it-is-impossible-to-seriously-fight-climate-change-without-a-profound-redistribution-of-wealth_6003038_23.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lemonde.fr&#x2F;en&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;article&#x2F;2022&#x2F;11&#x2F;05&#x2F;thomas-...</a><p>4. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;homenews&#x2F;sunday-talk-shows&#x2F;572926-gottlieb-nobody-knows-where-six-foot-distancing-recommendation&#x2F;amp&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;homenews&#x2F;sunday-talk-shows&#x2F;572926-gottli...</a><p>5. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;disinformationchronicle.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;nih-scientist-testifies-government" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;disinformationchronicle.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;nih-scientist...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39891023" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39891023" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">willsoon</span><span>|</span><a href="#39891578">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39891023">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39891023">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It looks like anything to me.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

To get away with it for an extended period of time it is necessary to convince the victims that institutions won&#x27;t help them, so performing abuse in front of a representative of the institution can be a ploy to reinforce their power.

I think he would say that more children are traumatized today. Whether they are traumatized more deeply is another matter.<p>The earlier trauma happens, the more amplified the effect is. Sometime in the 1950s it became a common parenting approach in the US at least to &quot;not coddle children&quot;. That creates trauma for a sensitive child to not have their emotional needs met (an insensitive child may be just fine). There are different degrees of trauma- others that fight wars may experience a much deeper trauma later in life. The trauma to the ignored baby is not as traumatic of an event, but the baby does not have any abilities to cope and the effects are amplified in early developmental stages.<p>There is less community today to help with the coping process and emotionally distant parenting styles also make coping harder. And there is less religion today- religion both provided community and sometimes specifically helps people deal with trauma.<p>Trauma can be generational- someone that suffers trauma is much more likely to have difficulties raising their children. Consider someone that survived war but lost their home and witnessed horrors. They may turn to drugs to cope with the psychological pain. Being drug dependent, they have difficulty raising their own children. Those children don&#x27;t have their emotional needs met, and a cycle of trauma can continue.<p>From Mate&#x27;s point of view addiction rates would probably be one way to measure the trauma of society. Drug addiction is a way of coping with severe psychological pain. Drug overdosing is becoming a leading killer in some age groups.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40435348" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40435348" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sobkas</span><span>|</span><a href="#40433187">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40436346">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40433609">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40435348">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40435348">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Are children more traumatized now than in the past?

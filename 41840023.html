Everybody in healthcare knows about the problems in various measurement methods as well as individual responses to measurement anxiety and the physical and emotional state you are in that particular time. The only accurate measurements are direct measurements through an arterial catheter which is a very invasive procedure. 
Routine clinic measurements are used only to have a general idea about trend and secondly to catch severely high BP which is usually due to a secondary disease.
Also, if BP is high above a certain limit it is significant regardless of if you took rest for 5 minutes and other precautions. Because if BP is high the normal BP regulating system should kick in and lower it regardless of the cause. With advancing age and hardened arteries this response becomes less optimal and you need the support of anti hypertensive medicines. You can see this in real time in patients under anesthesia. A young healthy patient would have an initial peak in response to pain or other surgical stimulus but they will be able to lower it either spontaneously or with minimal outside intervention. Whereas in older individuals much more effort is required to control and lower the BP. 
The general trend has been to treat both hypertension and diabetes early because the microvascular complications start much earlier before they become apparent clinically.</div><br/><div id="41846223" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41846223" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scotty79</span><span>|</span><a href="#41844275">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41841006">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41846223">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41846223">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Does the body of a patient under anesthesia react to (unfelt?) pain by raising blood pressure?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41841006" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41841006" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crazygringo</span><span>|</span><a href="#41844275">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41846398">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41841006">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41841006">[49 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s definitely a huge variance in blood pressure readings depending on posture, relaxation, arm position, recent activity, etc. If you buy a blood pressure monitor, it&#x27;s really interesting to see how &quot;random&quot; a single reading at the doctors&#x27; is, and how large your fluctuation throughout the day is.<p>That being said, it really makes me wonder about studies that correlate blood pressure with other things.

When it&#x27;s time, an appropriately sized cuff should be wrapped around your bare upper arm, right above the elbow; it should never be wrapped over clothing. At least two readings should be taken, with the average recorded. Ideally, readings should be taken in both arms, with the highest readings recorded.<p>When was the last time you got it measured properly? Literally never for me in a clinical setting.

And yes, you want to idealize conditions if you’re considering aggressive emergent treatment protocols that can have serious side effects.<p>Like I said, the best option for evaluating chronic hypertension is 24 hour ambulatory BP (which of course would include quite a bit of resting time) - usually 15 to 30 minute intervals. Why? I think the first two sentences of the prior comment are pretty intuitive.<p>And truth be told if the reading comes up 160&#x2F;100 they’ll still send you home and tell you to follow-up with your PCP. There are of course other factors (like say having heart failure, symptoms other than headache), but usually it’s BP north of 180&#x2F;120 where the ER starts getting concerned, and even then you will likely be released for outpatient follow-up +&#x2F;- some oral medication.<p>In the public, hypertension is primarily a chronic condition and a slow killer.

The science does smell funny. I read a bunch of hypertension papers this last year (I have a home machine and wanted to know how to interpret the results). Beyond the fact that inter-reading repeatability is very poor and a lot of the explanations are very ad-hoc (&quot;fear of doctors&quot; etc), there are other issues.<p>First problem: natural variance across healthy people is huge. Doctors have a target they think everyone should hit but it&#x27;s just a gross average, they don&#x27;t seem to take into account the possibility of genetic variance at all.<p>Second related problem: it&#x27;s common to be told what a healthy BP is for an &quot;adult&quot; although BP averages for men and women are quite different, and BP is also heavily affected by age (controlling for health).<p>Third problem: correlation is not causation. It&#x27;s a cliché because it&#x27;s a real issue. The public health community is prone to blurring the line between &quot;two variables are found to be related in a study&quot; and &quot;one therefore causes the other&quot; without doing the work to prove causality, and when I went looking for what studies established BP-&gt;cardiovascular disease causality it was remarkably hard to locate firm evidence. It could easily be the other way around. Indeed in most hydraulic systems it&#x27;s understood that pressure is the result of other mechanisms and under&#x2F;over pressure is the result of malfunction in pumps or piping. In healthcare they argue it&#x27;s the other way around: that over&#x2F;under pressure is the cause of malfunction elsewhere. There&#x27;s probably a circular relationship but all the material targeted at regular people makes strong claims of causality when the underlying literature seems far less certain.<p>Fourth problem: perhaps unsurprisingly given the third problem I found studies where people were put on anti-hypertensives and there was no improvement. Actually I read one study where the treatment outcome was purely negative: there was no effect on heart disease or other outcomes of interest but there were lots of patients who fainted due to excessively low BP. This study seemed reasonable well constructed but the negative outcome didn&#x27;t seem to reduce the field&#x27;s certainty in anything (a super common problem in public health). Doing trials like this is hard because any time anti-hypertension drugs fail to work it&#x27;s interpreted as evidence  that the damage was already done earlier in life thus requiring ever longer studies to detect.<p>Fifth problem: a lot of the underlying scientific claims trace back to one longitudinal study in a single village in Japan, done decades ago. It&#x27;s remarkable how often you follow citations and end up back at this dataset. When you look at what the study did it&#x27;s kinda sketchy and not particularly convincing, but because the BP-&gt;CVD link is hypothesized to be a very slow acting effect it takes a huge effort to collect data.

This is anecdata based off of my own experience with my heart, brain and body.<p>(Note that this is based off of someone capable of developing a heart problem in his late thirties so hopefully none of this will apply.)<p>Before I started running for fun, running up to a doctor’s office would absolutely spike my blood pressure. That was a combination of anxiety (which is&#x2F;was an issue), cardiovascular health and basic physical reactions to exertion. Since I started running for fun, that relationship has completely changed. I don’t get the anxiety based blood pressure changes because I find running really fun and rewarding.<p>When I lift weights, my blood pressure will read a little higher for at least 24 hours after. The heavier I lift, the more my blood pressure will lift. I see a similar relationship with volume, but it’s not as linear as weight. So if I have to do fifty total reps to failure my blood pressure will be higher, but not as high as if I had done ten total reps to failure.<p>Food and alcohol have tremendous impacts. Cannabis has an impact but nowhere near the impact of either food or alcohol. Armed only with blood pressure data, I could make a good case for fast food and beer to be illegal. My case wouldn’t be as strong for cannabis. Caffeine is really fucking weird - it increases blood pressure up to the point of addiction. Then, not feeding the addiction will spike my blood pressure even more.<p>And I haven’t even begun to talk about how heavily my brain is involved. I dealt with undiagnosed ADHD through developing some very obsessive habits.  As a consequence, I can quite literally obsess my way back to blood pressure medication.<p>Judging by how much personal data I have on my blood pressure, I’m sure you’re very surprised that I tend to be obsessive. :)<p>So anecdotally, you are 100% correct. But I can add some more anecdotes to hopefully ease your mind. When I got out of the hospital, I had to promise my cardiologist three perfect readings a day; meaning that I would religiously check my blood pressure at the same three times each day. Needless to say, I checked it way more than that. But there is an awareness that different levels of need require different levels of scrutiny.<p>The only part I still wonder is if my cardiologist knew that giving an obsessive person metrics would lead me into running. This may have just been a way to get me back into shape.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41841110" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41841110" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">WarOnPrivacy</span><span>|</span><a href="#41841153">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41843099">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41841110">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41841110">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Automated BP cuffs painfully over-inflate; my BP is 20+&#x2F;15+ higher when they&#x27;re used.<p>I ask nurses to take my BP manually.</div><br/><div id="41841837" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41841837" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">elric</span><span>|</span><a href="#41841110">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41841210">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41841837">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41841837">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had a similar issue, which was remedied by getting a larger cuff.

If you accept an NIH grant to conduct a rigorous study and falsify your data, then you have defrauded the federal government. If you are a supervisor, a department head or an administrator and you turn a blind eye to implausible results and indefensible practices, then you are complicit in fraud. If your journal claims to be rigorously peer-reviewed but your reviewers are rubber-stamping papers that they haven&#x27;t read, then the institutions that buy very expensive subscriptions are being defrauded.<p>Only in academia is fraud treated as a faux-pas rather than a crime. We have accepted a status quo in which academics and academic institutions play by a different set of rules to the rest of society.

Especially in a tough, competitive job market like today&#x27;s, having a credible portfolio of work, published content, and external validation makes a huge difference. It can take a good candidate to the top of the list, and when that list is a few dozen great applications, that&#x27;s critical.<p>As a hiring manager I weigh a candidate&#x27;s public presence at 10~15% of my initial decision, even more if it&#x27;s exceptionally impressive. And I hear from other hiring managers that they view this similarly.<p>If you have good academic qualifications and a great record of past work experience ... guess what, there are several other candidates with great academic qualifications and an impressive work experience. Having a strong portfolio of public work can be what distinguishes you and gets you the opportunity to be invited to interview.<p>One important note: just having publicly available content isn&#x27;t enough. It also has to be credible and impressive. Original articles that demonstrate deep expertise and are valuable to others. Serious codebase you wrote yourself or made significant contributions to. Real achievements on things like Kaggle competitions. I sometimes see people including a link to a &quot;business card&quot; type website with their photo and links to their social media or a blurb about themselves. That doesn&#x27;t impress and won&#x27;t make a difference.</div><br/><div id="36874465" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36874465" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">existencebox</span><span>|</span><a href="#36873918">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36874337">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36874465">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36874465">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">(Obvious disclaimer all views are my own and not my employer&#x27;s)<p>First, let me say that I don&#x27;t disagree, pragmatically, with the truth of what you&#x27;re saying, in terms of increasing your odds on the whole as a candidate.<p>But that said, as another hiring manager, let me respectfully disagree with this as a strong hiring signal. I say this, to boot, as an engineer with an, in my experience, above average OSS contribution, research, and patent portfolio, although these things are a bit power-law-esque so obviously I&#x27;m nothing next to many.<p>When I interview, I want to know you have a track record of high quality delivery, and are good for the skills you attest to.  I can understand some folks looking at the public displays as a proxy to that, but I&#x27;d argue, at that point, indexing on the &quot;public&quot; part is orthogonal to what we&#x27;re looking for it to display, and carries both false positives and negatives.<p>To some degree we may be agreeing loudly here, where you&#x27;d say &quot;well that&#x27;s what them putting it in public is&quot; but I&#x27;d worry that by caring about the public component vs. a more generalized examination of professionalism and accomplishment, we preclude folks who have no time or interest in curating that sort of profile.<p>If I put myself into the absolute edge case of two candidates all things being equal but one seems to have also made a more visible portfolio of work, MAYBE, MAYBE that would move the needle in terms of establishing a degree of external validation, but I think I&#x27;d be looking _hard_ for other aspects to differentiate that would seem to have more direct applicability to our day-to-day needs, and am hard pressed to think of a time in the last few hundred interviews I&#x27;ve had to make such a choice without a stronger differentiator for any candidate above a very junior level.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36874337" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36874337" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">buro9</span><span>|</span><a href="#36873918">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36873772">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36874337">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36874337">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">First they need to look at your application &#x2F; resume.<p>Then they need to have questions, which triggers curiosity that has them looking for more.<p>Only then does having a piece of content help you.<p>Yes it helps, but it doesn&#x27;t help as much as having a resume that suggests you&#x27;re a potentially good match without oversharing why you&#x27;re not a good match.

(And yes, despite your protestations, they are indeed transphobic.)  And also for claiming that gender dysphoria is essentially a mental illness to be cured.<p>You clearly think these are all reasonable positions to hold, but the fact of the matter is that these sorts of things will be considered red flags by many recruiters and hiring managers at many tech companies.  You may believe that these things should have no bearing on whether or not you get a job, but what matters is the reality, not what you believe.<p>On the technical side:<p>* You don&#x27;t want to work in any language but C.<p>* You claim that you can&#x27;t read&#x2F;understand code written by others, citing a dubious &quot;theory of mind&quot; excuse.<p>Most tech companies don&#x27;t use C these days.  Certainly there are some, but most that write internet-facing programs don&#x27;t use it.  Even a company that does have C positions might be concerned about your unwillingness to write anything else.  And reading, understanding, maintaining, and adding features to other people&#x27;s code is a huge part of nearly any software development job.<p>I have no doubt that some of your technical achievements are impressive, but companies consider much more than that when making hiring decisions.<p>All this is just from a few minutes perusing your website.<p>&gt; <i>I live in a place where people generally share the same values, so those other posts shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</i><p>I&#x27;m assuming you live in Utah based on some of the things I read on your website; I don&#x27;t expect there are a ton of tech-company employers there.

Why don’t more people do it?”</div><br/></div></div><div id="36873957" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36873957" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">testtestabcdef</span><span>|</span><a href="#36873658">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36873797">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36874126">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36874399">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36873957">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36873957">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s what the README page is for that you can create and gets shown at the top of your profile.

My former personal network doesn&#x27;t respond to my emails anymore, etc.. Might have to do with some defamation that happened in 2016 by an employer, but that shouldn&#x27;t be surfacing until the reference check after I get an offer--unless I&#x27;m on black lists that are decently circulated. Another possibility is my reach is just limited when I post content with depth, as opposed to things that will get more engagement. People used to read my blog directly, which has been shut down for years.<p>I&#x27;m open to the possibility that my presentation is just terrible, that my SEO needs work, stuff like that. Keeping all my web properties up and producing content up to modern standards has been pretty out of reach given my life circumstances... not complaining, just saying.<p>My temp bosses are always happy with how good I wash dishes, anyway. I&#x27;ll never stop publishing my tech work online, but I know it takes more than just publishing what I&#x27;m doing to stand out as a job candidate. I&#x27;d love to get an objective view about what else I&#x27;m lacking or penalized on almost as much as I&#x27;d like some good old fashioned Agape love, to help me want to check my email and notifications that I&#x27;m programmed to dread checking by now (usually due to non-responses to everything I send, if not trolls).<p>Sorry that this may come off as negative. I&#x27;ve really had some success standing out and just publishing for most of my career, it&#x27;s been really hard to figure out how to get out of the crater that it has become. I don&#x27;t even talk like this that much, to anyone who wants to say my negativity pushes everyone away... I get that, too. Hard conversations are different than negativity; negativity is more like being a parasite, whereas I&#x27;m genuinely trying to find the issues which actually exist and fix them.<p>Things I know I can fix:<p>* Maintain properties and populate search engine&#x2F;open graph fields for SEO
* Produce thumbnails and editorialize headers
* Increase my engagement in ways that are selected for</div><br/><div id="36874039" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36874039" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dehrmann</span><span>|</span><a href="#36873818">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36873794">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36874039">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36874039">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Took a quick look at your profile.<p>It&#x27;s rare that I look at projects when interviewing, but I&#x27;d rather see a complete, published open-source project than a dev sandbox.

I like to compare honest work to Allies fighting World War II -- doing whatever is necessary to win, wherever it leads you. No plan is stupid if it works, there is nothing shameful about trying and failing. There will be setbacks because life is not fair and on short time scales the rewards are never assured. But what makes winners different from losers is what they do in response. If they can persevere, through their setbacks, experience, hard work, the focus they put in they will gain the knowledge that lets them win on the long time scale.

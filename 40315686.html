Working memory capacity varies considerably between people and is a performance limiting factor when designing complex systems. You see analogues of this in other engineering disciplines too.<p>Over my many years of working in software development I have come around to the idea that most software developers do not have sufficient working memory capacity to reason about memory management in addition to everything else they must reason about at the same time. They may know mechanically how to properly do manual memory management but when writing code they drop things if they are juggling too many things at once mentally. It isn&#x27;t a matter of effort, there simply is a complexity threshold past which something has to give. Automatic memory management has its tradeoffs but it also enables some people to be effective who otherwise would not be.<p>On the other side of that you have the minority that get manual memory management right every time almost effortlessly, who don&#x27;t grok why it is so difficult for everyone else because it is literally easy for them. I think some people can&#x27;t imagine that such a group of engineers exist because they are not in that group and their brain doesn&#x27;t work that way. If you are in this group, automatic memory management will seem to make things worse for unclear benefit.<p>I&#x27;ve observed this bifurcation in systems software my entire career.

And it only takes a single oversight to cause havoc, be it a CVE, leak that causes a long-running program to slowly grow memory, or hair-pulling bug that occurs 1 in 1000 times.<p>Yes, logic bugs have the same issues, and even in languages like Java we can sometimes (albeit rarely IIRC) get memory leaks. But memory-safe languages are an <i>improvement</i>. Just like TypeScript is an improvement over JavaScript, even though they have the same semantics. We have automated systems that can decrease the amount of memory errors from 1% to 0.01%, why keep leak and UB prevention a manual concern? Moreover, the drawbacks of memory-safe languages are often not an issue: you can use a GC-based language like Java which is easy but has overhead, or an enforced-ownership language like Rust which has a learning curve but no overhead. Meanwhile, while logic bugs can be a PITA, memory bugs are particularly notorious, since they don’t give you a clear error message or in some cases even cause your program to halt when they occur.<p>Tangential: another solution that practically eliminated a class of bugs is formal verification. And currently we don’t see it in any system but those where correctness is most important, but that’s because unlike memory management the downsides are very large (extremely verbose, tricky code that must be structured a certain way or it’s even more verbose and tricky). But if formal verification gets better I believe that will also start to become more mainstream.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40327974" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40327974" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">elondaits</span><span>|</span><a href="#40327791">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40328978">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40327831">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40327974">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40327974">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I worked with manual memory management for a decade (24&#x2F;7 systems) and don’t miss it.

At the time I was a contractor for a big bank that is sadly&#x2F;not sadly no longer with us any more. This was when the status of faxes in confirming contracts hadn&#x27;t been sufficiently tested in court so banks used to book trades by fax and the system that sent the fax would also send a document to a particular printer which would print the trade confirm out and there was some poor sap whos job consisted of picking up the confirms from this printer, calling the counterparty and reading them out so that they were all on tape[2] and legally confirmed.<p>Anyhow one day the memory leak caused the printer driver to fall over and fail to print out one of the confirms so the person didn&#x27;t read it out on the telephone. The market moved substantially and the counterparty DKd the trade[3]. A lot of huffing and puffing by senior executives at the bank had no effect and they booked a $5m loss and made a policy to never trade with that particular bank again[4].  The fax printer job was moved to windows NT.<p>[1] According to the excellent &quot;Expert C programming&quot; this was eventually fixed because Scott McNealy, then CEO of Sun Microsystems had been given a very underpowered workstation (as CEO) so was affected a lot by this problem and eventually made enough of a fuss the devs got around to fixing it <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;progforperf.github.io&#x2F;Expert_C_Programming.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;progforperf.github.io&#x2F;Expert_C_Programming.pdf</a><p>[2] Calls in the securities division of banks are pretty much always recorded for legal and compliance reasons<p>[3] DK stands for &quot;Don&#x27;t know&quot;.

I think you&#x27;re working on an interesting set of components that will prove useful to GA aircraft technology. Bringing fly-by-wire, and lowering the cost of maintenance&#x2F;manufacturing are both great efforts.<p>That being said, my personal view is that stick-and-rudder control is one of the less critical components to improving GA safety. Everything else - flight planning, comms, automation, navigation, weather, inspections, procedures, regs, and most importantly - working in the federal airspace system - are the &quot;hard&quot; parts of flying and where problems tend to occur. It&#x27;s common belief that single-pilot IFR is the most challenging type of flying, because of how much you have to do all at once.<p>It may sound snobby - but I&#x27;m not super excited about the idea of lowering the barrier to entry for GA on a foundational skill basis. Like the light-sport rating, it encourages more people to be in the (already congested) airspace system who haven&#x27;t really gained all the other skills necessary or experience to be there.<p>To be clear - I think improving technology and lowering costs = good. Lowering early-skill requirements for pilots and pushing more people without all the other skills into federal airspace = very bad. In general, I&#x27;d frame this effort more as an effort to raise the bar for system technology, not lower the bar to become a pilot in the first place.</div><br/><div id="41165674" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41165674" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aeternum</span><span>|</span><a href="#41164783">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41168275">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41165674">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41165674">[19 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Excellent points, it&#x27;s really these other aspects that get pilots into trouble.<p>For example it&#x27;s crazy that most pilots are still taught to calculate W&amp;B using printed charts and approximate takeoff performance.<p>I think you could save more general aviation lives with a fairly minimal system.<p>A gas gauge sensor that calculates whether you have enough fuel to get to your destination + reserve.

It&#x27;s ridiculous that we still have so many belly landings and consider it a &quot;good&quot; to rely on training and human memory to prevent them.  How much cheaper would complex airplanes be if we didn&#x27;t have the crazy insurance rates due to this?<p>Angle-of-attack and spin warnings.  It&#x27;s ridiculous that even $1mil+ Cirrus planes can&#x27;t detect when you&#x27;re too slow in a base to final turn and sound a warning before you spin.

Then we open our iPhone app (EFB or electronic flightbag) and do it there. In fact, part of the reason we do it there is because most of them phone home to their maker and log that we did it. So if there&#x27;s an accident people can know &quot;well they did their W&amp;B&quot;<p>&gt; the rest of the things<p>Regulations have made aviation so expensive that it&#x27;s ridiculous. A lot of airplanes flying today are flying with their same avionics from 60 years ago because upgrading is expensive. To get the gas calculation you mention would require a certified GPS (on the low end from Garmin that&#x27;s $6,000) and an engine monitor ($5,500 from Garmin), plus installation costs of another few thousand dollars.<p>Most planes have a gear down warning (ie, 3 indicator lights) but their original &quot;bitching betty&quot; is hard to hear because we now wear ear protection when we fly and have noise cancelling headphones. You probably can&#x27;t even integrate that with a new Garmin system because they&#x27;ve gone full encrypted CANBUS to lock out integrations.<p>re: spin warnings - not sure what to tell you there. Stall speed is based on weight and configuration (flaps) and 99% of GA planes have no idea what they weigh or if their flaps are deployed.<p>But again, it&#x27;s not that we can&#x27;t do those things, it&#x27;s just that they&#x27;re completely cost prohibitive.

Even simple sensors are lacking, for example accelerometers are nearly free yet GA planes give you no warning that you&#x27;re in a skid.<p>Similarly given yoke input, bank angle and speed you could warn of an impending stall well before it actually happens with a few position encoder sensors.  As you point out, the current system relies on pilots recognizing a stall which is a foolish thing to rely on and almost all GA stall warning sensors are only on one of the wings and require actual airflow disruption to work.  In many cases that is already too late or the other wing could stall first.  The calculation doesn&#x27;t even have to be perfect since most pilots want plenty of margin of safety on a base to final turn.  I&#x27;d much rather have a false alarm + go-around than an inadvertent spin.<p>The collision thing is also ridiculously irrational.  The FAA requires drones over half a pound to continually transmit their location yet somehow considers it sufficiently safe for planes to fly without a radio nor transponder around most of the airports in the US relying only on pilots looking out the window.<p>It&#x27;s just disappointing that the vast majority of GA accidents could be completely avoided with slightly better avionics.</div><br/><div id="41167499" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41167499" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sokoloff</span><span>|</span><a href="#41164783">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41166508">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41167141">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41167499">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41167499">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; the vast majority of GA accidents could be completely avoided with slightly better avionics.<p>Reading accident reports or the annual summary McSpadden Report (previously called the Nall Report), I get a different view: if pilots would keep fuel in the airplane and flowing to the engine(s), not fly into weather beyond the capability of the airplane and crew, and divert or not takeoff at the onset of signs that an aircraft is not airworthy, would reduce serious accidents by half or more. Better avionics has relatively little to do with that (other than the proper use of a fuel totalizer or better).<p>Complacency kills more pilots than weak avionics.</div><br/><div id="41168041" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41168041" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aeternum</span><span>|</span><a href="#41164783">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41167499">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41167141">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41168041">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41168041">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Most cars give you significant warnings that you&#x27;re about to run out of gas and as a result very few people do.<p>Improved avionics could warn you that you&#x27;re flying into a storm or that the airplane is not airworthy or that you are converging with other traffic.<p>Complacency kills because it sneaks up on pilots, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way.  We should not accept that the FAA&#x27;s answer is an IMSAFE checklist.  Pilots should not have to die simply because they didn&#x27;t realize they were feeling slightly stressed or emotional prior to takeoff and forgot to check a single one of the 40+ items on the preflight&#x2F;runup&#x2F;takeoff checklists.<p>Of course good pilots should check it all anyway but just as NHTSA requires safety warnings for cars, we could save many more lives if we required low fuel warnings, terrain warnings, gear warnings, speed warnings, etc. in aircraft avionics.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41167141" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41167141" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nradov</span><span>|</span><a href="#41164783">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41166508">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41167499">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41166170">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41167141">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41167141">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Civilian drones are fairly new.

Everything seems so needlessly complicated. Even small aircraft cost so much that I couldn’t imagine a computer controlled system and fly by wire would be cost prohibitive. Even a new C172 is close to $400k at the low end, and anything you’d actually want to fly is much more. A few grand in electronics seems worth it and can probably easily save itself back quickly in added fuel economy and maintenance, not to mention any monetary value you might place on your safety.<p>But then I watched as the ADS-B mandate (or whatever you want to call it) came into effect and GA enthusiasts started tossing around concentration camp metaphors. So many of the people in the industry are very old and just don’t want anything to change.<p>Also shocking is how expensive everything is. It’s like new blockbuster prescription drugs, and perhaps for similar reasons (FAA testing is maybe very expensive?) but with no expiration date. At least in 25 years that new drug will be cheap, adding a simple GPS to your plane is still going to cost more than your Lexus.<p>It feels like the real problem in this industry is lack of competition. There’s a chicken and egg problem: planes are expensive because so few people buy them, but so few people buy them because they’re expensive.<p>Light sport aircraft were supposed to be the solution, but the difficulty of flying (which you’re addressing) seems to have precluded that.<p>All of which is to say: you’ve got a wide open field here and I hope you do well at it, aviation needs this.</div><br/><div id="41166062" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41166062" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nikitaga</span><span>|</span><a href="#41165006">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41165100">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41166062">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41166062">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; It feels like the real problem in this industry is lack of competition. There’s a chicken and egg problem: planes are expensive because so few people buy them, but so few people buy them because they’re expensive.<p>Lack of competition is not the root cause. It&#x27;s all the regulations. Certifying a new GA airplane takes a lot of time, and costs a fortune. This translates to high development costs, and certification costs, and ALSO is a huge barrier to entry for new companies, and a significant barrier for existing companies to develop new modern designs.<p>I could potentially muster enough resources to design and build an ultralight aircraft (that does not need any certifications), but a type-certified aircraft even as simple as a Cessna 152? Forget about it.<p>You could argue whether those certifications are worth it for safety, e.g. by comparing Canada&#x27;s much more generous ultralight aircraft max weight allowance compared to US, or looking at the change in accident rates in European countries that recently deregulated ultralight aircraft, but whether it&#x27;s worth it or not, regulation is the single most impactful market force driving the cost of GA aircraft.<p>Lack of competition is also sometimes directly enforced by the government. For example, several countries mandate the use of FLARM, a proprietary collision avoidance system for light aircraft. Governments gave this company a monopoly without requiring their protocol to be made interoperable, open source, and dis-encumbered from patents.</div><br/><div id="41166210" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41166210" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mattmaroon</span><span>|</span><a href="#41165006">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41166062">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41166125">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41166210">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41166210">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I do believe that’s a factor (and mentioned it further down) but there are shockingly few companies that build planes.<p>The regulatory cost is amortized over the number of planes built.

I think this is a pretty cool project, and while it may not achieve the lofty goals you’ve set forth, any improvement in safety is worthwhile.<p>As other commenters have point out though, where this stuff falls short is ultimately still the human. Ok, great… your aircraft won’t stall in Normal Law. However you’ve now lost a generator and a whole FCC and you’re in direct law. The 400 hr pilot hasn’t actually flown a plane with direct input since their primary training 5 years ago. They also don’t remember what the different flight envelopes do and do not provide. Essentially the system is more complex but normally it works so the complexity is hidden. They’re not equipped to handle flying the airplane anymore.<p>This is where GA really ultimately falls short IMHO, proficiency. Airlines are the safest they’ve ever been because the pilots make an entire career out of being prepared for every contingency. People using airplanes as a personal travel tool can be trained and proficient to the same degree but often they are not because flying an aircraft is ancillary to their primary mission.</div><br/><div id="41165423" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41165423" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">morning-coffee</span><span>|</span><a href="#41163849">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41163951">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41165423">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41165423">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This.

In practically every example so far in aviation, adding automation makes things harder, not easier. In general, the more complex the automation, the harder it is to understand and safeguard against failure.<p>One safety factor in a lot of small GA planes is that pilots can often lose all power (engine, electrical, etc) and still fly and land their aircraft. Fly by wire removes that ability.

I&#x27;ve looked at it a few times.  But the only train line near me only has a train at it 2 or 3 times a week, at some crazy hour like 2:30am.  If I&#x27;m taking a Monday-Thursday business trip, I&#x27;d have to arrive at my destination the Friday before and return home late night on Sunday.  It&#x27;s just not a realistic choice, unless you&#x27;re <i>really</i> excited about trains.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that the website is terrible at helping you plan a trip, if you say &quot;I want to leave on Monday&quot; but there are no trains at the station on Monday, it just takes you to a page saying &quot;there are no routes, sorry&quot; instead of suggesting the next day a train <i>is</i> available.  I found a download link for the train schedule, and it took me a solid 10 minutes to figure out what I was looking at.  (If you&#x27;re following along at home: the big bold date at the top of the page is completely irrelevant.  It&#x27;s just today&#x27;s date, so you know when you downloaded the PDF. Because of course that&#x27;s why you downloaded the PDF in the first place.)<p>I have a friend who <i>is</i> really excited about trains, and he wanted to take a weekend Amtrak trip.  The only way he could make it work was to ride the train up and have someone at his destination who was willing to drive him back. And even then, most of the trip was plodding along in the darkness, because the train only stops at our city in the dead of night.<p>They&#x27;re supposed to be putting in some new lines in the coming years, one of which will stop by our city.  I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic, though I&#x27;m not sure how useful those lines will be if there&#x27;s no trains rolling on them at reasonable hours.</div><br/><div id="41167055" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41167055" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">callalex</span><span>|</span><a href="#41163947">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41165630">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41165248">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41167055">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41167055">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is also ignoring that it’s entirely possible for Amtrak to miss the schedule by literal days.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41165248" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41165248" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stetrain</span><span>|</span><a href="#41163947">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41165077">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41165630">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41166213">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41165248">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41165248">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Even if you build the train some people won&#x27;t give it a try, sadly.

I think that the core problem with GA is that most people in the United States want to travel distances beyond what an affordable GA aircraft can in a single flight.  I live in the midwest and I generally want to travel to the East or West coast or Southwest or Florida and the range of a Cessna just isn’t going to cut it.  The only practical vehicle would be a Phenom 300 or Honda Jet II, but I don’t have $8 million lying around.<p>Reality is that without North American continental range, it just isn’t worth it to go get a pilots license and buy a plane for the few trips that I can just easily drive.  Maybe if I lived in Boston, General Aviation would be great, but for many Americans who live in areas in the middle that aren’t near large airports, the range of these aircraft just make them expensive toys that aren’t very useful for the size of North America.</div><br/><div id="41163777" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41163777" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">n_ermosh</span><span>|</span><a href="#41163660">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41164940">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41163777">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41163777">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re definitely right that the cross continental trip is a big and common one. however, 90% of long distance trips are made by car in the US with a median trip distance of about 200 miles. If we can make flying as easy as driving, the ability to make that trip in half to a third of the time, we believe that&#x27;s a big win and incentive for a lot of people. There are 19,000 small airports in the US and 300M people live within 15 miles of at least one.

America is just too big a place for these types of aircraft.<p>Plus, while there may be all these airports that you are mentioning, can you really count on getting fuel to take you back at these minor airports or the FBOs to service outside a much shorter list of airports?

This means that if you don’t want to die, you have to cancel a lot of flights at the last minute, which makes it only useful for trips where you have a viable alternate means of transportation.<p>From a speed perspective, one thing that would make a lot of difference is speeding up the preflight.  Now you have to pull the plane out of the hangar, go to the fuel pump, fill multiple fuel tanks, check the oil, sump the fuel tanks, etc.  Electronic sensors for oil and water in the fuel, a simpler fuel system, and a built-in electric motor for getting out of the hangar might save 20+ minutes per flight, which would actually be better than even a faster plane because these tasks are annoying and dirty.<p>Another thing that would be great is a bigger baggage compartment with electric power for folding e-bikes or scooters.

I think it’s the same for any autopilot really. And there’s always a big “disconnect autopilot” button in case it goes haywire.<p>I think they will need to consider that situation though, if the autopilot does fail the pilot would still need to have enough skills to land the plane. Even ATP pilots have this issue where they over rely on automation too much and lose their ability to land manually in an emergency situation.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41165509" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41165509" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">n_ermosh</span><span>|</span><a href="#41165444">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41165932">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41166510">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41165509">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41165509">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">redundancy in sensors, computers, and actuators reduces the probably of a system failure due to random errors&#x2F;failures and dissimilar computer systems help reduce the probability of a common mode software bug causing a failure.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41166510" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41166510" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ArpanRau</span><span>|</span><a href="#41165444">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41168293">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41166510">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41166510">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Former pilot (now paragliders) and founder&#x2F;engineer here-<p>I&#x27;m not sold that this approach - eliminating the need for coordinated flying- really removes the big barriers to flying.

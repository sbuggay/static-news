At all. I&#x27;ve re-read several times. You sound like you&#x27;ve seen things we people would not believe . . . attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion . . .

Seeing how that ends<p>This seems like a problem of a programmer who does not understand the domain. FWIW, that&#x27;s not new ground either. You&#x27;re standing on the shoulders of giants. Consider that Admiral Hopper&#x27;s contribution to computing, the person oft-claimed as inspiration for women in computing, after a lifetime, that contribution was  . . . COBOL. Things go wrong. It&#x27;s ok. We can fix it.

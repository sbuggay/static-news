It was horrible. I am doing much better now!<p>The trick is to not care enough about your job to get hurt but not care so little that you could short-term be hurt.<p>In many places if you get hurt&#x2F;burnt out on the job the upper seats are looking for any reason to curb stomp you. There&#x27;s no reason to give a company your all unless you have an actual stake in it or they are there to hold you up when you&#x27;re dragging. I&#x27;ve worked at multiple places where influential people died, yes dead, below average life expectancy, - on the job - and corporate did everything they could to not even pay out on their legal obligations (life insurance, D&amp;D). In some cases employees joked or snickered about the person who died later on - in meetings.<p>In tech. I&#x27;ve found that you&#x27;re not on your own but you are at the mercy of who is in charge of your schedule and rates your performance. If you lose trust in that person your best option is to leave as quickly as possible. Otherwise they will do what they can to destroy you for as much &#x27;profit&#x27; as they can claim. Being clear. It is not about realized gains, it could even be at great detriment to a company. It is about short-term line item claimable gains. &quot;We got 4 good months out of her...&quot;, &quot;they were terminal and now they will be working somewhere better for them...&quot;, &quot;he really wasn&#x27;t closing as many tickets as the rest of the team...&quot;, &quot;they weren&#x27;t helping as many team members as the rest of the team...&quot;, &quot;we never needed someone with an advanced degree...&quot;, etc.<p>Check in with yourself regularly. Know the signs of burn out. The company you work for does not depend on any person caring about you in the slightest.</div><br/><div id="42668429" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42668429" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Centigonal</span><span>|</span><a href="#42667301">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42668009">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42668429">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42668429">[35 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The trick is to not care enough about your job to get hurt but not care so little that you could short-term be hurt.<p>It really depends on your personal psychology. After I burnt out in a demanding role that I adopted as a big part of my identity, I joined a new company vowing to not take work as seriously (I remember telling myself, &quot;if excess effort isn&#x27;t rewarded, the optimal strategy is to maximize compensation, minimize necessary effort, and eliminate excess effort&quot;).<p>After a few months of recovery and ruminating on why I still felt so bad (plus therapy), I learned a few things about myself:<p>1. I feel like garbage when I&#x27;m half-assing something at work or not giving my all -- especially when the people around me are putting in the work.<p>2. When I <i>am</i> giving my all and I feel like I&#x27;m not being recognized, I begin to lose motivation and burn out. Simple tasks become very laborious. This is a gradual, months-long process that is difficult to recognize is happening.<p>3. When I start to burn out, I am forced by my mind and body to half-ass things, which makes me more demotivated, which exacerbates the burnout.<p>Putting these insights into action, I&#x27;ve so far been able to keep burnout at bay by finding roles where I can give work my all, receive recognition, and be surrounded by others who are putting in similar effort. This doesn&#x27;t mean blindly trusting the company or destroying my work-life balance -- I believe that &quot;recognition for hard work&quot; includes proactively protecting hard workers from their workaholic tendencies and giving them the flexibility to take breaks. I&#x27;m lucky to work with really great people where I frequently pass along responsibilities or take work from others to avoid over-stressing any one person and enable things like multi-week vacations. I have no idea how I will change my approach if I lose this workplace dynamic or pick up more forcing functions on my workday (e.g. having kids) in the future, but it&#x27;s working pretty well for me right now.<p>All of this is to say: for me, the low-trust &quot;do the bare minimum to stay employed&quot; approach didn&#x27;t actually help me get out of burnout into fulfillment -- What helped was finding a work situation where I could give my all and not feel taken advantage of. People are wired differently, so I want to caution against a one-size-fits-all approach.</div><br/><div id="42669541" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42669541" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">EtCepeyd</span><span>|</span><a href="#42667301">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42668429">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42669687">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42669541">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42669541">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yours has got to be one of the best comments that I&#x27;ve ever read on hacker news.<p>&gt; for me, the low-trust &quot;do the bare minimum to stay employed&quot; approach didn&#x27;t actually help me get out of burnout into fulfillment -- What helped was finding a work situation where I could give my all and not feel taken advantage of<p>What you just described (so vividly) is <i>meaning</i>, and (likely) &quot;flow&quot; too. <i>Meaning</i> must be there for everyone, in their efforts; the need for meaning is universal. (We can call it intrinsic motivation too.)<p>Some say that you can find meaning outside of work, and then can mostly ignore work; and it&#x27;s also said (correctly I guess) that &quot;psychological richness&quot; (closely related to resilience) is important: drawing meaning &amp; satisfaction from multiple sources.<p>Sure, but I have a practical problem with that: if you need to work 8 hrs&#x2F;day to cover your family&#x27;s needs, you don&#x27;t have time, energy, or opportunity left to find meaning <i>elsewhere</i>.<p>And, as others have repeatedly said it here, if you are a full time employee making quite beyond your (family&#x27;s) needs, and think about decreasing your working time (giving up excess money, but regaining much needed time &amp; freedom), <i>that</i> is what is strictly forbidden by the runners of the Village of Happy People. You will find effectively no jobs that let you work (say) 5 hours per day, for 62.5% of your original salary. That way, you&#x27;d just not be a good slave, a good cog in the machine. Society is engineered such that you <i>must not</i> have free time.<p>Therefore the only practical option is to find (or create) work that provides meaning for you intrinsically. I see no other option. You can be an employee or run your own business, the same applies. And, unfortunately, this is unattainable for most of society.</div><br/><div id="42670343" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42670343" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Centigonal</span><span>|</span><a href="#42667301">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42669541">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42670890">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42670343">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42670343">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I appreciate the kind words!<p>The second part of your post is something I&#x27;ve thought about a lot.

You will eventually find yourself needing to do the same again after you’ve mastered the new challenge. Keep it up and you will run out of leaps. However if you want to exist in a place for a while you need to accept that not every project, task, idea will be exciting work. Once you accept this, it also opens up doorways with what else you can do with your time. Since you have a mastered skill set, these menial tasks should not be weighing you down to free yourself from the drudgery of work.<p>&gt; As for being proud of my work... well I&#x27;m always proud of my work. I still burned out. I don&#x27;t want to even touch the things I&#x27;m proud of.<p>You should always be critical of past mistakes and look to correct but you should always put your best effort forward. That is what pride in work means. You shouldn’t have to admire every piece of work you deliver as a masterpiece, which is what I assume you mean by wanting to touch it. You should always carry a positive mindset about your work and not treat each success and failure in your life as some sort of definitive legacy. Invite in and operate under best intentions.<p>A lot of my advice is about how it works in harmony, not some quick instant burnout solution. Resting is important as well (breaks, vacations).<p>Anecdotally I was recently hired at a company that is in dire straights. This weighed on me heavily for the first six months, eventually they shrunk my team. However I cannot afford to get burned out.

There is a gender pay gap. This is a very complex problem with multiple causes and effects: sexism, maternity leave, married couples making the rational economic decision that the lower earning spouse looks after the kids at home, etc. A person looks at a field, sees that it&#x27;s lower pay and prestige, and sees that it&#x27;s filled with women. If they are more sexist than average they draw the conclusion that women&#x27;s work is worth less and justify discrimination&#x27;s effects as caused by innate differences. Even if they are less sexist than average they are concerned that other people&#x27;s sexism has demonetized that line of work. Thus the rational move is often to also perpetuate the disparity by avoiding the &quot;pink collar&quot; job, or not care that a high end job has features unfriendly to women.

The org chart cares about headcount - it doesn&#x27;t matter to them who fills the count. Only plausible heads who could pass some random interview. The upper bosses don&#x27;t see you as human, only as chess pieces to move around to fit a narrative.<p>If the narrative against you shifts to the negative, there are many ways to justify your exit. They don&#x27;t care if you die, or your children go hungry, or you lose your house or healthcare. What they care about is narratives that justify their own existence in the org chart. They don&#x27;t even care about the services or products they build. It is just about their own existence. Every other effort be damned.<p>Reader, now that you are aware that they don&#x27;t care about anything - and certainly not about you - it is really up to you to secure yourself financially, physically, emotionally and preserve your time. If they come at you with reviews or other BS, you should consider your time is up, safeguard yourself, and sabotage them if you can.<p>This is fair. Remember that you are playing with the same rules as them. If they can&#x27;t care about engineering, you sure as hell don&#x27;t need to. If they care about politics, you sure as hell play it with them.<p>Take it as a toxic game but secure your life - as far away from corporate toxicity as possible.</div><br/><div id="42668784" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42668784" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nostradumbasp</span><span>|</span><a href="#42667301">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42668281">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42667574">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42668784">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42668784">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There are tons of companies that don&#x27;t even produce things anymore, all they do is buy and sell other companies as a &quot;portfolio&quot;.

The truth is, this whole thing is unsustainable, and will collapse on it&#x27;s own. No one actually has to do anything to sabotage something like this.<p>I recommend instead to &quot;document&quot; and &quot;socialize&quot;. The people who operate this way are sloppy, greedy, and think they are invincible. Don&#x27;t do anything to convince them they are though. They are always, and I mean always, fucking up. Spread the good word of your documented and likely illegal treatment to a pro-bono employment lawyer before or after a likely illegal lay-off and get a severance as a settlement avoiding court entirely (if you wish).<p>Socialize with others you trust in your industry about the treatment at the companies that operate this way. Be weary of slander, that&#x27;s what documentations helps with. Word travels fast. In the old days this was how people dealt with societal outcasts. With the internet, this is easier than ever.<p>That said, I can&#x27;t control what someone decides to do but I will share. One of the &quot;worst&quot; things you can do at a company like this is be really nice to people inside and outside your team, and do your job within your means. It drives the creatures up a wall.

Burnout is on the rise, but not in the way I expected. The definition of burnout continues to expand as it becomes further embedded in common vernacular.<p>It was tough for us doing the mentoring because someone telling us they were experiencing burnout could have meant anything from a severe condition resulting from years of extreme effort against personal and professional headwinds, to the person who was simply bored at work and needed a long weekend with friends to recover.<p>I’m not trying to gatekeep, but rather point out that there is no longer a single definition of burnout. There are parallels to how conditions like Autism Spectrum Disorder are now being diagnosed in alarmingly high numbers, but when you look closer you realize that the common definition has been stretch far from the original narrow definition.<p>This creates some difficulty for people experiencing the deepest burnout. When their peers think “burnout” is just a word that means you’re kind of tired and bored in a way that can be easily fixed with a good vacation.<p>I’ve also noticed a growing trend of people with clear signs of depression mistaking it for burnout. These situations are very concerning for me because by now I’ve seen a lot of people quit their jobs due to “burnout” and then their symptoms get progressively worse, not better, because their real problems were not primarily the result of their job. This problem is becoming more common as “burnout” trends on social media and news headlines with empty advice.

I&#x27;ve been burned out.  Many years ago, early in my career.  My cure: I was in the lucky position that it was a good time to spend a year and half going back to school to knock off a graduate degree that simultaneously moved my career forward, gave me a total change of scenery, and gave me some break time between leaving the job and starting classes, time that I devoted 100% to hobbies and home improvement projects.  And of course, an easy-to-tell story when reentering the job market.<p>So on the topic of agenda... if what you are working on is your own agenda, you don&#x27;t burn out.  You might change the agenda by redefining goals, but in the end, you are sailing your own ship.  Not only do you not burn out, it is curative.  It is when you absorb someone else&#x27;s agenda and make it your own to an unhealthy extent that you burn out.  Always be computing that dot product between your employer&#x27;s agenda vector and your own agenda vector.

Unless leadership is unusually adept at punishing <i>the first signs</i> of this behavior, it quickly becomes pathological.

In times of growth it&#x27;s painful enough, but in times of limited resources, it&#x27;s pure bloodsport.<p>There are people who can effectively detect and push back on the behavior, but they seem to be rare, and even more rarely make it into positions of influence. My theory is that it&#x27;s so exhausting to be sensitive to the drama that you can only make it to the top if you combine it with a big dose of sociopathy.

A lot of people who now live in the bubble grew up in other parts of the country. They still visit their families for holidays and special occasions. They were brought up middle-class in normal suburbs like I was and retain a deep familiarity with the experiences of different types of people. They loved the mall, too.

    &gt; In another generation this will become less and less true. There will be an army of slender, highly cultivated products of Mountain View and the Upper East Side and Bethesda heading to elite schools that has been groomed since birth in the most competitive and rarefied environments with very limited exposure to the rest of the country.

    &gt; When I was growing up, there was something of an inverse relationship between being smart and being good-looking. The smart kids were bookish and awkward and the social kids were attractive and popular. Rarely were the two sets of qualities found together in the same people. The nerd camps I went to looked the part.

    &gt; Today, thanks to assortative mating in a handful of cities, intellect, attractiveness, education, and wealth are all converging in the same families and neighborhoods. I look at my friends’ children, and many of them resemble unicorns: brilliant, beautiful, socially precocious creatures who have gotten the best of all possible resources since the day they were born. I imagine them in 10 or 15 years traveling to other parts of the country, and I know that they are going to feel like, and be received as, strangers in a strange land. They will have thriving online lives and not even remember a car that didn’t drive itself. They may feel they have nothing in common with the people before them. Their ties to the greater national fabric will be minimal. Their empathy and desire to subsidize and address the distress of the general public will likely be lower and lower.</code></pre></div><br/><div id="42669108" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42669108" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">noirbot</span><span>|</span><a href="#42667564">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42668943">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42668824">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42669108">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42669108">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not sure I at all agree with that quote though. Most of what he&#x27;s describing was equally true of the old landed aristocracy or other wealthy families of the past. It feels like someone who didn&#x27;t grow up rich now being rich and going &quot;Wow, rich people live differently&quot; as if that&#x27;s some revelation and not something that&#x27;s been true for centuries.<p>Who does he think went to Harvard and Yale and Princeton and Oxford and Cambridge before now? Those people felt as superior if not more superior to a random person in &quot;normal america&quot; than the current crop of new wealth. The Gettys and the Morgans were probably even more detached from the rest of the country than anyone is now and likely had more overt power over their lives than their modern equivalents.<p>I don&#x27;t mean this as a defense of these people, just that &quot;the elites don&#x27;t have the best interests of the population at heart&quot; is a complaint as old as civilization. I don&#x27;t think Greer or Yang makes a compelling argument that the 2019 American moment is worse than even recent memory. Greer tries to make a point about how people had smaller goals in the past, and fought more for their local interests and prestige, something I&#x27;m both not sure I agree with and would love a citation for, and also looks past the fact that the major WASPy families did literally run the federal government for decades! Often to the detriment of states and regions they cared less about, which seems to be what he&#x27;s claiming will be an issue with this new elite.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42668824" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42668824" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MPSimmons</span><span>|</span><a href="#42667564">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42667221">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42668824">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42668824">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve personally burned out a couple of times.

Personifying the &quot;system&quot; is misleading.<p>&gt;We&#x27;re trained to tell ourselves we can do it, that sustained super-human effort is within everyone&#x27;s reach, &quot;just do it.&quot; This is the core cheerleader narrative of the Village of Happy People: we can all overcome any obstacle if we just try harder. That the end-game of trying harder is collapse is taboo.<p>It is still a problem for individuals to solve. We all have to find our own solutions. Broken institutions need to be fixed by individuals or individuals need to find ways to work outside of the existing institutions.

You are sure to burnout if you frame your expectations around them.<p>Sure, we all burn-out, but if you want results, you have to pick yourself back up and go again.

If you can&#x27;t square the circle, you must pick either a square or a circle. It&#x27;s just not possible to have both when they&#x27;re so out of harmony.

Stiffness is something you can picture directly, so the data -&gt; conclusions inference &quot;stiffness&quot; -&gt; &quot;mass and short range&quot; follows directly from the facts you know and your model of what they mean. Whereas &quot;particles have mass&quot; -&gt; &quot;short range&quot; requires someone also telling you how the inference step (the -&gt;) works, and you just memorize this as a fact: &quot;somebody told me that mass implies short range&quot;. You can&#x27;t do anything with that (without unpacking it into the math), and it&#x27;s much harder to pattern-match to other situations, especially non-physical ones.<p>It seems to me like the right criteria for a good model is:<p>* there are as few non-intuitable inferences as possible, so most conclusions can be derived from a small amount of knowledge<p>* and of course, inferences you make with your intuition should not be wrong<p>(I suppose any time you approximate a model with a simpler one---such as the underlying math with a series of atomic notions, as in this case---you have done some simplification and now you might make wrong inferences. But a lot of the wrongness can be &quot;controlled&quot; with just a few more atoms. For instance &quot;you can divide two numbers, unless the denominator is zero&quot; is such a control: division is intuitive, but there&#x27;s one special case, so you memorize the general rule plus the case, and that&#x27;s still a good foundation for doing inference with)</div><br/></div></div><div id="42717008" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42717008" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lilyball</span><span>|</span><a href="#42714062">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42716112">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42714502">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42717008">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42717008">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Besides the fact that stiffness shows up as a term in the equations, stiffness is a concept that can be demonstrated via analogy with a rubber sheet, and so lends itself to a somewhat more intuitive understanding.<p>Also, the math section demonstrated how stiffness produces both the short-range effect and the massive particles, so instead of just handwaving &quot;massive particles is somehow related to the short range&quot; the stiffness provides a clear answer as to why that&#x27;s the case.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42714502" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42714502" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">drdec</span><span>|</span><a href="#42714062">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42717008">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42721265">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42714502">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42714502">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you read far enough into the math-y explanations, stiffness is a quantity in the equations.

It definitely would be overkill to make it an axiom.<p>So say you have a spring if you compress it, it pushes because it wants to go back to its natural length and likewise if you stretch it there is a restorative force in the opposite direction.  The constant of proportionality of that force (in N&#x2F;m) is the stiffness of the spring, and the force from the spring[1] is something like F=-k x with x being the position measured from the natural length of the spring and k being the stiffness. So not knowing anything about electromagnetism I read this and thought about fields having a similar property like when you have two magnets and you push like poles towards each other, the magnetic field creates a restorative force pushing them apart and the constant is presumably the stiffness of the field.<p>But obviously I’m missing a piece somewhere because as you can see the force of a spring is proportional to distance whereas here we’re talking about something which is short-range compared to gravity and gravity falls off with the square of distance so it has to decay more rapidly than that.<p>Edit to add: in TFA, the author defines stiffness as follows:<p><pre><code>   For a field, what I mean by “stiffness” is crudely this: if a field is stiff, then making its value non-zero requires more energy than if the field is not stiff.
</code></pre>
So this coincides with the idea of restorative force of something like a spring and is presumably why he&#x27;s using this word.<p>[1] Hooke’s law says the force is actually H = k (x-l)ŝ where k is stiffness, l is the natural length of the spring and ŝ is a unit vector that points from the end you’re talking about back towards the centre of the spring.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42717734" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42717734" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">exmadscientist</span><span>|</span><a href="#42714062">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42721265">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42721185">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42717734">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42717734">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In addition to what the sibling comments have said, the &quot;axiom&quot; is actually the term in the equations.

It was spooky how group theory had manifested in something as ubiquitous and tangible as the structure of the periodic table.

He&#x27;s just dumbing it down in an extreme way so that non-physicists could have the faintest hope of understanding it. Wich seems odd, because if you actually want to understand any of this you should prepare to spend two or three years in university level math classes first. The truth is that in reality all this is actually a lot more complex. In the Higgs field (or any simple scalar field for that matter) for example, there is a free parameter that we could immediately identify as &quot;mass&quot; in the way described in the article. But weirdly enough, this is not the mass of the Higgs boson (because of some complicated shenanigans). Even more counterintuitive, fermionic (aka matter) fields and massive bosonic fields (i.e. the W and Z bosons mentioned in the article) in the Standard Model don&#x27;t have any mass term by themselves at all. They only get something that looks (and behaves) like a mass term from their coupling to the Higgs field. So it&#x27;s the &quot;stiffness&quot; of the Higgs field (highly oversimplified) that gives rise to the &quot;stiffness&quot; of the other fields through complex interactions governed by symmetries. And to put it to the extreme, the physical mass you can measaure in a laboratory is something that depends on the energy scale at which you perform your experiments. So even if you did years of math and took an intro to QFT class and finally think you begin to understand all this, Renormalization Group Theory comes in kicks you back down. If you go really deep, you&#x27;ll run into issues like Landau Poles and Quantum Triviality and the very nature of what perturbation theory can tell us about reality after all. In the end you will be two thirds through grad school by the time you can comfortably discuss any of this. The origin of mass is a really convoluted construct and these low-level discussions of it will always paint a tainted picture.

If anyone here wants a relatively understandable deep dive, my favourite books are Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted Amateur [aka graduate student] by Stephen Blundell [who taught me] and Tom Lancester [his former graduate student], and also Quarks and Leptons by Halzel and Martin.

When you write down the field equations for a massive boson field, you get an additional m^2 term in the denominator of the propagator, which contributes a e^(-r&#x2F;m) term to the interaction force at low energy, such as the decay of a neutron or a weak-mediated nuclear decay.<p>Is there an ELI5 version of this?  I think the article tries, and it&#x27;s always cool to see physics described from a different vantage point.<p>My ELI5 version would be: fields with a massive gauge boson are &quot;dragged down&quot; in energy by the mass of the boson, so interactions propagate as if they have negative energy.

So as far as evidence goes, &#x27;what really exists&#x27; might be higher-dimensional strings, or cellular automata, or turtles all the way down, or whatever.<p>Instead, physics has some number of models (either complementary or competing) that people find compelling, and mechanisms on top of those models to explain our observations.

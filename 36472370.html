It was a bit of surreal experience. The people at the conference were very nice and intellectually curious people and I liked them, but the contrast to the environment in dance communities was very strong. I felt like almost everybody there thought of them-self as a brain, piloting a body like a big mecha. In the dance environments, even during lunch breaks etc., it always felt like there was a lot of subtle awareness in everybody about their own body, the other bodies in the space, the distances and empty space between bodies, a non-verbal channel full of quiet energy and information. In the computer science conference this channel was just dead.</div><br/><div id="36477294" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36477294" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pelario</span><span>|</span><a href="#36472609">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36472935">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476952">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36477294">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36477294">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t know how common is that story...

You can only lug a big hunk of iron into the air so many times before you start thinking about how much we really have in common with a gorilla.

He did a weekly physical class that is meant to tie mind and body together (I forgot the name, I watched this like 15 years ago). As he said he did it for like 5 years and felt like he got nothing out of it but did it regardless, until one day it just all synced up and he &#x27;got it&#x27;.<p>A similar thing happen with me over the years, the more I got out and moving, the less I found myself involved in the realms of high intellect. Not in an &#x27;ignorance is bliss&#x27; kind of way, but not identifying with it as much. It went from &quot;why dance, lift, walk etc - it achieves nothing&quot; to, that is it. It is the flow of the world. It doesn&#x27;t achieve anything because it doesn&#x27;t have to, it is a happening, like all life and the universe itself is but an happening. I have had a very similar experience to you with these conferences, it just feels kind of dead in a way, or more you can sense the lack of potential.<p>That disconnect between the bring and the body is something I have seen many times with those that partake in Buddhism and its many flavors. It was Ajahn Brahm said when he was in university and beginning his path, that one day he was talking with other students and professors and suddenly realized that he did not want to be like these people and that the same path as them, to be a brain and nothing more. He is now a Theravada Buddhist in Western Australia.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36473098" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36473098" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mieubrisse</span><span>|</span><a href="#36472609">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36472935">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36474179">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36472964">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36473098">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36473098">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That sounds like a fascinating journey that I&#x27;d love to read; have you written anything about it?

His behavior, attitude, and responses there (and even in general, really) really hit on Stoic values.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bTGPfJUJRh0">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bTGPfJUJRh0</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36475033" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36475033" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zachkatz</span><span>|</span><a href="#36472609">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36473077">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36473451">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476963">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36475033">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36475033">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; we did not evolve to sit all day, inside, at desk, gazing into screens<p>What I love about Apple Vision Pro is that it has the potential to solve this!</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36476963" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36476963" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">satokema</span><span>|</span><a href="#36472609">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36472631">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36476963">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36476963">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I walk to the store when it&#x27;s reasonable.

I would argue the advice given is really good and valid for most people and so that&#x27;s a good thing. I am sorry you feel under-represented and hope you find something valuable for yourself elsewhere.<p>Additionally I think lots of people find that they have to force themselves to start and finish a workout and only some eventually come to learn to like it. But for many it starts as a chore like preparing food or doing laundry or taking a shower. It costs time and effort and often hurts. And people can go for a while without any of those but it usually has consequences which are usually worse in the long run than the initial invest.<p>You seem to have a fairly static view of who &quot;you&quot; are. I used to be in the camp of &quot;my body is just a vehicle for my brain&quot; camp and did not understand why I would exercise at all since I was always skinny (but also super weak) and my mind was what I was working with. And then my grandpa told me: &quot;A healthy mind likes to reside in a healthy body&quot; and that took a few years to really sink in. And now I realize that pushing myself through regular workouts and making myself deliberately suffer exhaustion, fatigue and pain makes me more happy, stable and relaxed in general and I even think of myself as a fit athletic person now and made that part of my identity.<p>And lastly I am kind of curious about a thing: You said that you only want to do it when it&#x27;s attached to a game. So if you share the notion that exercise is good and you already know that this is how it&#x27;s easier for you to do it, then why not focus on exercises which are also games. There are so many of them. And for everyone else who does not need or want a game, meditating or doing yoga seems to be another great venue to start.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36477244" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36477244" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shafyy</span><span>|</span><a href="#36476963">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36477284">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36477100">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36477244">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36477244">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I see where you&#x27;re coming from.

I was surprised to learn that even elite runners are doing 80% of their training at a pace that&#x27;s really slow relative to their race pace. Of course training plans will vary depending on the target distance, but I think this still applies if you are training for shorter distances.

All trails are graded with a difficulty, so you pick one that suits you and start the decent.<p>They can be windy smooth trails through the forest, or rocky technical trails to test your bike handling, or gnarly steep downhill trails, or jump trails, the list goes on. You have full control over what you get yourself into, and I can just barely scratch the surface of the variety of riding available across all the disciplines and locations. The basics are the same, you and your bike on some trails.<p>You can develop your bike skills and challenge yourself on fast or technical trails, or you can just take it easy on flowy easy trails or cross country trails. You can dial up the adrenaline as much or as little as you want, and the terrain can be vary wildly from trail to trail so it&#x27;s always new and interesting.

It&#x27;s very easy to try without spending much.<p>The only equipment you need is a helmet, any bike helmet will do for your first rides. You&#x27;ll figure out the rest of the gear as you go.

I just wish it didn&#x27;t require driving. The good stuff is 10+ miles from where I live. Not that far, but it&#x27;s still burning gas just to ride a bike.<p>I also suggest XC &#x2F; blue &#x2F; &quot;intermediate&quot; &#x2F; rolling trails. They&#x27;re less exposed and dangerous than steep descents, and better cardio. The MTB industry and press is increasingly downhill-oriented, but you can ignore that noise. Before you buy a bike, try renting a few, and riding them on your own local trails. It&#x27;ll give you a better idea of what sort of bike and riding you want. If you don&#x27;t have much singletrack nearby but you have dirt roads, consider a gravel or &quot;all-terrain&quot; road bike instead (like a Kona Dew, Kona Rove, or Hudski Doggler). It&#x27;s not mountain biking, but still a lot of fun, and you cover more ground. (They&#x27;re also simpler and cheaper than modern mountain bikes.)<p>Bike fit is important, take your time to get it right. Don&#x27;t buy the wrong frame size! (I&#x27;ve made that mistake at least twice.) Find a shop (or experienced friend) to help you dial in the fit, and expect to swap some parts. This (and physical conditioning) makes the difference between riding kind of hurting, and being comfy on the bike for 2+ hours.<p>Obviously you can get hurt. MTB injuries tend to be less severe than road cycling, because you aren&#x27;t riding in car traffic. But several years ago I tore out my triceps, going over the front of the bike in a rock garden and landing on my elbow. That was a surgery and slow recovery. I&#x27;m fine now, and even with that injury, cycling has been a benefit to my health and enjoyment of life.<p>It can be a gear-intensive hobby. I have a mostly-bikes room. It can also be an expensive hobby (though doesn&#x27;t need to be). Still much cheaper than motorcycles, sailing, and so forth.<p>Sorry, one last thing. Be courteous to hikers. Yield to them by default, call out if approaching them from behind. Making hikers feel safe and respected is more important than carrying your speed. When riders forget this, angry hikers show up to meetings and agitate for closing trails to bikes.</div><br/><div id="36477003" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36477003" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ehnto</span><span>|</span><a href="#36472631">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476736">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476188">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36477003">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36477003">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great advice allround, especially on gravel and XC.

Couple of reasons. First: The deeper you get into it the more you learn its primarily an intellectual pursuit - its just hidden in a very physical endeavor.  When I&#x27;m doing Jiu Jitsu, I have to actively think, engage my problem solving skills, I can&#x27;t go on auto pilot as I do in other things - rowing machine for instance.  Second: Anyone can do it, at nearly any age with any body type.  If you&#x27;re older and not super athletic, your Jiu Jitsu will be different than say a 20yo who is very athletic.  But that in no way means your Jiu Jitsu or experience will be any less effective.  First time posting on HN.

If you go 100% full competition all the time and never want to tap out - then yes I would agree there is significant risk of injury.  But that&#x27;s true with any physical endeavor.  If you instead train with the long run in mind, pick and choose your rolling partners, and tap out when you&#x27;re not in a good situation then you can mitigate those risks quite successfully.  Having weight trained, ran track and trained BJJ, I&#x27;ve had far more injuries in weight training + track despite having far more time on the mats than weight training and track by a very large margin.

So, shifting time to morning turned out to be impossible to maintain when I was living alone - I could hold such schedule for maybe a week at most, gradually oversleeping more and more. Still, it was <i>possible</i> then and I wish I tried harder, because now it&#x27;s strictly not - I have two small kids, and one true thing about them is that they always wake up earlier than you[2]. So there&#x27;s no space for personal time in the morning.<p>Also I wonder if I&#x27;m the only one here who feels that their mind takes some 2&#x2F;3 of the day to get into high gear?.It&#x27;s probably more about emotional balance than cognitive functions, but I feel like I&#x27;m best able to focus only from late afternoon onward, making late night the only time that&#x27;s useful for anything.<p>--<p>[0] - I tried all kinds of things. Music blaring from the speakers at 06:30 sharp? Within a week, I&#x27;ve mastered getting up, hitting the power button on the amplifier, and falling back to bed in one, smooth move, with ballet-like fluidity. Got an alarm clock that requires you to solve math problems to turn it off? I quickly realized I must&#x27;ve mastered the art of multiplying 2-digit numbers in memory while unconscious, because I would wake up at 11:00 to discover multiple such alarms disabled, with no memory of doing it, or even hearing them ring.<p>[1] - Yes, that means business trips are especially hard for me. When traveling alone, I rely on wake-up calls from my wife (and check-ups afterward).

That&#x27;s as far honest as I&#x27;m willing, although it is pretty close to truth nowadays. I was a lot more snarky a year ago.<p>2. Humans are very good at adapting. If you told me 3 years ago that I have to go through all these, I&#x27;d never think about getting a kid. But somehow it actually feels OK now. And that&#x27;s what I tell other people.<p>3. Having kids basically means having a completely different life style for me. I can see why some people actually feel so excited about it because their life style actually fit. It&#x27;s about trading one life style to another, and this is something we rarely told others, who nevertheless never bother to ask anyway, because they don&#x27;t know what to ask. Nowadays, I&#x27;d tell any young people to get their dreams done before getting a kid, unless they really really want it. You want to go travel the world? Do it before getting a kid. You want to teach yourself a long chain of Mathematics&#x2F;Physics topics? Do it before getting a kid.

I do not think there&#x27;s an absence of ambition at all. I think for a particular segment of society  we&#x27;ve actually gotten much better at putting ambitious people to work. In the past, an ambitious person had fewer options and would strike out on their own, which fueled a entrepreneurship. Now there are hundreds (thousands?) of large enterprises that slurp up ambitious individuals and put them in charge of important things.<p>I&#x27;ve been reading about postwar corporate culture recently and its pretty amazing that orgs would just sit on these amazingly talented people - and knew they were talented - but just didn&#x27;t care. Not only were some of their most skilled workers not promoted, they weren&#x27;t even paid more. I think WWI and WWII greatly shaped the attitude of corporate leaders from this period that you just simply hired someone to do their job and made sure they did it well and that was that. Very reminiscent of military ranks.

There&#x27;s this great essay from Stephen Jay Gould on why we haven&#x27;t had 0.400 hitters in baseball for so long. His argument was that the overall pool of baseball players got too good so you&#x27;re not seeing strong outliers anymore! I&#x27;d say that this is a phenomenon we see across all kinds of life, not just sports.<p>From a paper reviewing the evidence of Gould, I can&#x27;t find the original essay online:<p>&gt;Gould then supposes that the decline in batting average peak (the .400 hitter, the outlier) is due to decreased variation in the population of hitters. In other words, as the skills of both hitters and pitchers improved, and as the pool of talented players to choose from increased, the variation in talent (the difference between the best to the worst batting averages) should decrease. Therefore, players in Major League Baseball in more recent period are arguably reaching the “wall” of human performance. Gould’s analysis of the data supports this idea, as the standard deviation of league-wide batting averages has decreased steadily since the early 20th century.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sabr.org&#x2F;journal&#x2F;article&#x2F;can-stephen-jay-goulds-theory-explain-why-there-were-no-batting-triple-crowns-in-mlb-for-45-years&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sabr.org&#x2F;journal&#x2F;article&#x2F;can-stephen-jay-goulds-theo...</a></div><br/><div id="37073430" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37073430" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">paganel</span><span>|</span><a href="#37070735">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37071446">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37072110">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37073430">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37073430">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">On the other hand football has seen two of its best players ever (Messi and Cr.

But I think Paul Graham was speaking of ambition in terms of revolutionary or world-changing type stuff.<p>For instance in a parallel world Elon Musk ends up going to work at Boeing and perhaps even gradually works his way up to becoming their chief engineer. But in this world it&#x27;s unlikely he would have even been able to create fully reusable rockets. That was not only an expensive and extremely high risk venture, but one which many key people, such as Tory Bruno (CEO of ULA - a Boeing&#x2F;Lockeed partnership), were aggressively dismissive and even mocking of, until SpaceX proved it.

The only progress since then has been the work of Ki, Kim and Lee in 2009, who improved this slightly to {\Lambda &lt; 1&#x2F;2}. The primary proposed aim of this Polymath project is to obtain further explicit improvements to the upper bound of {\Lambda}. Of course, if we could lower the upper bound all the way to zero, this would solve the Riemann hypothesis, but I do not view this as a realistic outcome of this project<p>To your point, there was some excitement and progress in the beginning, but it remains an unusual approach to mathematics.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37071904" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37071904" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">somenameforme</span><span>|</span><a href="#37070735">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37071179">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37071040">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37071904">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37071904">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think there&#x27;s an ongoing bias for many of us. During our lifetimes things have changed so rapidly, and generally positively, that we kind of assume that this is the normal direction of things. And so when things slow down we look for some profound meaning to it. In reality, we have all been fortunate enough to live through a really weird time in history.<p>One of my favorite quotes: &quot;The more important fundamental laws and facts of physical science have all been discovered, and these are now so firmly established that the possibility of their ever being supplanted in consequence of new discoveries is exceedingly remote. ... Our future discoveries must be looked for in the sixth place of decimals.&quot; - Albert Michelson, 1894<p>That quote is from from Albert Michelson of the famous Michelson-Morley experiment. [1] For some really brief background, before Einstein it was believed that light had to have a medium to travel through in space. Light was seen as a wave, and waves can&#x27;t propagate in a vacuum. That medium was called the luminiferous (light) aether. Morley set out to experimentally prove the existence of this medium by showing that the speed of light measured from 2 perpendicular directions would be different, given that the trajectory of the aether, and thus the speed of propagation, would be different.<p>Yet he kept measuring near the exact same value for light. He was so convinced in the correctness of the luminiferous aether (which had dominated scientific thought for centuries, and was imminently logical) that he doubted his own results and would continue to repeat similar experiments for decades. Hence, the context of his quote. But then of course Einstein was soon enough to be on his way and discover relativity, which would not only completely invalidate the aether but completely revolutionize science. And then quantum mechanics was also right on the way.<p>The point of all of this is that Albert Michelson was convinced science had effectively come to an end in terms of major discoveries, let alone revolutions, let alone those driven by one off thinkers, in much the same way you do. And there&#x27;s no real reason to think anything has really changed. Science has historically always had long lulls, as well as societies driven to the point of assuming as absolutely true ideas which are ultimately proven to be fundamentally and completely wrong, and whose assumption of truth was actually one of the reasons progress lulled.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_exper...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37071040" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37071040" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">acover</span><span>|</span><a href="#37070735">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37071904">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37073419">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37071040">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37071040">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Even simple things are hard to do in developed countries.

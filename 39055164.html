Something that is affordable for giant monopoly profit driven FAANGs, but harder in smaller orgs.<p>Even within my team, the &quot;level of difficulty&quot; of writing an API depends on its user base.  If I am the primary user, it&#x27;s easy.  There&#x27;s one really sharp kind on my team, if he is going to use it, then 2x the difficulty.  If I need it to handle the median dev on my team, then 2x again.  By the time you get to the below median dev, add another 2x.

Skilled or good, sure, but “great” implies mastery.<p>&gt; I’m very much in the, “you wrote it, you run it,” camp.<p>As a sibling comment of mine pointed out, these are generally orthogonal skillsets. The main problem I’ve seen with it is that due to the relative ease of XaaS, dev teams with little to know knowledge of infra can indeed stand up an entire stack, and it will work quite well at first.<p>Databases, for example, are remarkably fast at small scale, even when your schema is horrible and your queries are sub-optimal. But if you don’t know the fundamentals (my first point), you won’t know that it’s abnormal for a modern RDBMS to take hundreds of milliseconds for a well-written query (assuming it’s not a cold read). You see that your latency is “good enough,” so you move on with the next task.<p>Then, when the service gets more popular, you hit the limits of the DB, so you vertically scale (if it isn’t already “Serverless” and auto-scaling – barf).

The business was unhappy with teams oriented around specific projects, and felt we were struggling to produce quality releases according to the roadmap because teams had lack of understanding of the big picture along with competing priorities.<p>With a CFT, we would focus on a vertical slice of whatever systems it took to deliver a feature, and orient our team structure around the right expertise in the systems we’d need to touch. We would also take responsibility for managing our own releases rather than relying on bottleneck-prone maintainers to do it.<p>This seemed sensible at first, it even gave us a sudden burst of productivity. It soon fell apart, however, as now it became incredibly difficult to manage releases across products where multiple teams have competing priorities. Quality quickly plummeted and we had an even worse time releasing software, and every end of sprint the problem compounded. We still ended up with a bottleneck of a few experts to sort through the firehose of changes each team was trying to push out and get it handled. Our workload actually increased, along with stress and frustration.<p>The issue in this case was a perfect storm of tech debt, poor planning, poor architecture, and simply too many priorities. The business thought that rotating the team structure 180 degrees magically multiplies our productivity, and somehow convinced themselves that the work these teams do are completely independent, all while building out a roadmap with very little cooperation from the engineers. On top of investing in fixing the technical and organizational issues just producing software, I would rather leadership had focused the entire business on a small set of complimentary or at least non-competing (limited by available resources, of course) priorities so we could each focus on an piece of the puzzle and bring our particular expertise to bear on producing a coordinated and high quality solution. I certainly agree that teams oriented around their microservice or whatever was bad, but orienting around a project&#x2F;feature really any different; we should have been oriented around a holistic product and the customers’ well-being.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39055560" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39055560" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">braza</span><span>|</span><a href="#39064720">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39062386">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39055560">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39055560">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I can resonate with the author, giving the context working on Scaleups and Big companies, where the coordination and communication plays a very heavy toil on the actual work.<p>I do not believe in this model of “big collaboration” with folks swarming around a problem and each one with partial context trying to fix something that structurally has a huge communication, coordination and technical coupling.<p>The best work experiences that I had was in teams that we establish the APIs, S3 buckets where the processed batch files will stay an maybe a e-mail list where someone will reply if something change.</div><br/><div id="39055690" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39055690" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blastro</span><span>|</span><a href="#39055560">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39062386">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39055690">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39055690">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">First two sentences describe my current situation.

Leadership quality is a problem that silos can greatly exacerbate.<p>Silos exacerbate two problems. The first problem is that there is an area between two silo&#x27;s which can be poorly owned or lack stewards. The second problem is that the first manager above two different silos is the de facto resolver of disputes and resource application for and around those silos. This area often has no advocate, because to advocate for resource application to that area is to volunteer yourself. This area becomes a blind spot to leadership through systematic neglect. In many cases this leadership can be a checked out ex-google CTO who has never run an org under resource constraints who isn&#x27;t hungry because they are already well off. Checked out Rest and Vest early employees who, through the peter principle, end up in CTO positions can also be extremely dangerous to organizations.<p>If you have poor leadership, you end up with two silos that don&#x27;t want extra responsibility, because more responsibility without more resources is a losing prospect. Under bad leadership, anything that is not feature production is not rewarded. The end result is that each silo becomes aligned against other silos, rather than aligned to a business goal.<p>Defining an API seems like the primary goal is to completely remove the area between two silos, thus alleviating the problem of opaque ownership. I agree. Explicit ownership for all artifacts helps an organization run much more effectively.<p>The real problem is a culture where every individual employee does not feel responsible for business outcomes with proportionate recognition by leadership of taken responsibility for those outcomes.<p>Here is Admiral Rickover&#x27;s take on culture:<p>&gt; Professionalism occurs when individuals act in the best interest of those being served according to objective values and ethical norms, even when an action is perceived to not be in the best interest of the individual or their organization. That is, there are times when professionals must sacrifice their own interest (or that of their organization) to meet the objective values and ethical norms of the profession. Professionals, in this sense, are serving something greater than the bureaucratic organization that employs them.<p>&gt; If Admiral Rickover had a mantra to shape a professional culture, it would have been, &quot;I am personally responsible.&quot;<p>When leadership does not practice personal responsibility or engages in blame, that ripples through the entire organization. Silos that don&#x27;t function well are symptoms of leadership failing to take responsibility and cultural failure, not necessarily structural failure.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39055380" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39055380" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">internetter</span><span>|</span><a href="#39062386">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39055945">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39055380">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39055380">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I thought this was going to be about siloed products.

It&#x27;s the minimum you could possibly have to allow communication. So the silos can &quot;work together&quot; though that API, but problems then occur due to lack of understanding of how each silo actually works under the hood.<p>Imagine a bunch of microservices built by different teams. They just send each other their OpenAPI specs and some URIs. So they start calling each other&#x27;s APIs. Everything seems to work fine.<p>But wait. Are there limits on this API? How many calls, or how much data can I send? What&#x27;s the SLA on these transactions? What happens to data, how it&#x27;s stored, processed, backed up? If I send X data to service Y, do I know service Z is going to get the same data? If one of these services goes down, is everything going to go down, and is that team staffed for 24&#x2F;7 support? Do they even know what to do when things are down? When everything does down, how do these silos know which thing was the cause and who to alert to fix it? Does it require multiple silos to fix?<p>All of that and much, much more, is deeper knowledge related to the entire system, which is the inter-relation of all these silos from top to bottom and sideways. The API doesn&#x27;t solve these problems or answer the questions. The API only tells you how to do one thing.<p>The premise of silos is the idea that you don&#x27;t need to know anything else about the rest of the world but some tiny bit of information. Well, reality says different.<p>DevOps is not about &quot;merging teams&quot;, but <i>communication</i> and <i>collaboration</i> between teams. They should understand each other well, or at least make it much easier to discover the right information in order to improve outcomes. You absolutely have to have specialized teams where people have domain knowledge. But you also need to provide the tools and practices that enable very different teams to work together to build things right and solve problems quickly.<p>Say you&#x27;re building cars. A dealership&#x27;s mechanics notice a belt keeps rubbing on a cable or hose. That needs to be quickly notified to the assembly people to see if it&#x27;s an assembly problem, and if not, it needs to be sent to the mechanical engineers to address a potential design flaw. That all needs to be done quickly, as soon as the problem is noticed, because cars are shipping every day. The longer it takes for that whole loop to complete, the more bad cars are shipped. By focusing on improving the loop between all these different groups, you improve business outcomes. But &quot;an API&quot; isn&#x27;t going to do that.<p>That&#x27;s why the idea of a &quot;DevOps Engineer&quot; is wrong. This isn&#x27;t an engineering problem. This is a business process problem. The communication between teams is not an API, it is really organizational structure and practice. Engineers noticed the problem, and wanted to fix it, but they failed to use the language of management. So instead people slapped &quot;Engineer&quot; on the concept and everyone got confused.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39057307" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39057307" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pphysch</span><span>|</span><a href="#39056712">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39055374">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39057307">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39057307">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Nothing wrong with having clear boundaries and different owners across high-quality data sources, but IME &quot;silo&quot; usually comes up in the context of egregious data duplication and ambiguous sources of truth.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39055796" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39055796" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nine_zeros</span><span>|</span><a href="#39055374">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39055796">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39055796">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have seen managers create task funnels for requests coming from other teams.

But the claim that they weren&#x27;t empires is arguing from absence of evidence. We mostly don&#x27;t know what they were.<p>For an interesting pairing, see Bryan Ward-Brown on the fall of Rome, interviewed here by Razib Khan (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.razibkhan.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;bryan-ward-perkins-the-material-consequences" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.razibkhan.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;bryan-ward-perkins-the-material-...</a>). There we do know what happened when an empire ended, and it was very bad for the people in it. That&#x27;s because big empires are usually not replaced by anarchy, or by democratic nation-states, but by small empires, which have fewer economies of scale and therefore more taxation and exploitation.</div><br/><div id="40943469" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40943469" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DiogenesKynikos</span><span>|</span><a href="#40943152">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40943228">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40943469">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40943469">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In a lot of the former Western Roman Empire, taxation ended when the empire fell.

The combination of ever advancing technological capabilities and stagnant sociopolitical maturity should be prompting any thinking person to ponder how we could possibly learn and evolve long-term sustainable social structures.<p>The underlying &#x27;freedom vs empire&#x27; theme that permeates the article is too simplistic. E.g., in the modern era empires fragmented into national states, granting &quot;freedom&quot; to populations self-identifying as &quot;one people&quot; yet the local extractive elites did not disappear, they persisted and promptly collaborated in a variety of supranational cartels.<p>The human society &quot;equation&quot; that would guide us how to reach a desirable stable state has never been written down. If it is close to anything it is highly complex and non-linear system, admitting a variety of solutions as &quot;N&quot; (our numbers) and &quot;C&quot; (the collective cultural imprints in our brains) keep cumulating, but &quot;P&quot;, our planet, remains fixed.<p>Oppressive hierarchical societies seem to have been a relatively stable state in various phases of human development. This does not make them natural or inevitable under all conditions. Even a simple linear string will admit different solutions depending on boundary conditions.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40942581" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40942581" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mikhmha</span><span>|</span><a href="#40943228">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40943577">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40942581">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40942581">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve thought about this idea a lot. It seems like the idea we have of the centralized empires of the past is mostly based on movies and fiction - and maybe from the actions of the last remaining empires in the 19-20th century. I think we take for granted advancements in communications and transportation that allowed for the governance of large areas of land in more recent history.<p>Are maps of ancient empires even accurate? What do they even mean. If you went back in time to some backwater village on the edges of some Empire map and asked the villagers who was the emperor could they even tell you? Or would they still name some king from 50 years ago?</div><br/><div id="40942881" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40942881" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">prox</span><span>|</span><a href="#40942581">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40942978">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40942881">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40942881">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That really depends. I have been reading a lot recently on early Indian civilization, and really most of what we know in terms of historicity, aka writing in the earliest times, is only in the north, the Indus, the Ganges plains and so on. However there were many cultures living in the subcontinent south. Some of those “tribes” were deep in forests and survived relatively intact to the current day, with at least some features unscathed.<p>Then there is the trade of the early CE time. Trade between India and the Roman Empire over sea was of incredible proportions. Recently a sanskrit brahmi script was uncovered in an old Egyptian harbour port. So there must have been also a large group of people exposed to trade and exchange of ideas.<p>So I don’t think any broad sweeping statements can be made. To answer your question, it totally depends on the place and time you want to look at.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40942978" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40942978" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ijidak</span><span>|</span><a href="#40942581">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40942881">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40943577">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40942978">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40942978">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s true.

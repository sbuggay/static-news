First, there are easy options if the individual is a citizen of one of five countries with its own visa; these are Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, and Singapore.  These countries have free trade agreements with the U.S. that give rise to these visas.  If the individual is not a citizen of one of these countries but is employed in H-1B status by another company (or previously was employed in H-1B status), then an H-1B change of employer application is usually the best option and an easy one.  If the individual is not employed in H-1B status (and never has been), then we look at the O-1.

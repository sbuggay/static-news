An non-employer owner is essentially employing themselves, right, having to do the work of an employee, just with the added work and benefits of being the owner.

And a deal that isn&#x27;t fair is an exploitative one.<p>Capitalism doesn&#x27;t really have an &quot;intent&quot;. It&#x27;s just an economic system with unbounded private ownership of capital, hence the name. However, there are certain things that inherently follow from that notion, to wit: because the ability to extract economic rent is proportional to the amount of capital owned, all else being equal, past a certain amount of rent extracted there is a positive feedback loop. Or, simply put, large businesses - and their ultimate form, monopolies - are the natural outcome of capitalism. And since larger businesses have a higher imbalance of power wrt both their employees and their customers, it results in deals (for both products and labor) that are less and less fair - and thus more and more exploitative. Thus, capitalism is also inherently exploitative.<p>And you can certainly counter that by things like strong trade unions and rigorously enforced anti-trust legislation, but it&#x27;s kinda like putting a motor on a boat that&#x27;s rowing upstream - it helps, but why are you going in that direction in the first place?</div><br/></div></div><div id="40021131" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40021131" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ajmurmann</span><span>|</span><a href="#40020180">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40021005">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40021429">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40020918">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40021131">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40021131">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What does &quot;exploit&quot; mean in this context?

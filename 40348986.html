She would lecture at extremely fast pace for a few minutes, then select a student to do a related problem on the board. If the student got stuck, they could ask for help from the class and if the whole class was stuck we could ask for help from the professor of course. The in-class work wasn&#x27;t graded so it was pretty low-pressure once you got used to it. After the problem, the professor went back to lecturing and repeat.<p>But I could also easily see this backfiring in certain ways. A couple other things that enabled this to be a positive experience:<p>1) It was a higher level math elective, everyone in that class chose to be a math major and chose to take that particular elective. This avoids having students who simply don&#x27;t care, which often ruined similar situations in high school in my experience.<p>2) It was a relatively small class, I think about 15 students, in a relatively small university. Because it was a small school, I already knew most of the other math majors, and the class had a more personable and trusting atmosphere. Even if you didn&#x27;t know a person, and thought they were stupid or annoying, you didn&#x27;t want to burn that bridge because you were almost guaranteed to be in a class with them again later. Because of all this, making a mistake was no big deal, even the shyer less-confident students didn&#x27;t seem particularly nervous.<p>3) Class attendance and participation was not graded. This made it very clear that doing the problems was for our benefit, it wasn&#x27;t busy work.<p>4) You didn&#x27;t volunteer, and it wasn&#x27;t an option to sit out. The professor literally was going person-by-person based on how we were seated, starting from a random person each class. This way it wasn&#x27;t an oppurtunity for know-it-alls to show off, and less motivated and shy students couldn&#x27;t just disengage<p>With a slightly different setup it sounds like torture. But as it was, it kept the class engaged and you could immediately apply what you were learning in lecture to cement it.<p>That was the hardest math class I ever took (discrete and combinatorial mathematics) because--for scheduling reasons--I&#x27;d gotten an exception to take it before I&#x27;d met the the prereqs, which meant I was a freshman taking this 3000-level elective in parallel with calc 2 lol. If it was with a worse professor I definitely would have failed, I was not at all prepared. I&#x27;ve taken classes with a completely &quot;flipped classroom&quot; and I just don&#x27;t have the motivation to do well in classes like that, but I also can&#x27;t focus enough on lectures with no engagement (at least I couldn&#x27;t back then before I started ADHD medication)</div><br/></div></div><div id="40352121" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40352121" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">devjab</span><span>|</span><a href="#40351313">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40352481">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40351315">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40352121">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40352121">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think part of the issue is how we learn differently. For some students the lecture is important, for others it’s a time where your mind wanders and then you’re sort of “left behind” because you didn’t pay attention. So it’s likely always going to be a complicated mix of things where you can’t really get it right for every student if you sort of follow traditional learning.<p>I’m an external examiner for CS students as a side gig. Now that I’ve been one for 8 years, it’s a relatively easy task for me because I’ve been through their curriculum twice every year. I remember the first time, however, and how I subsequently decided I’d better refresh my own… I’m not sure if learning is the right word here, but my own “what I had been taught in CS”. I did so with edx.orc where I took a few Harvard and MIT courses on CS. What struck me about those courses was just how good the video lectures were for me. I have ADHD and bipolar type 2, and I can honestly say I didn’t really do well with CS lectures when I attended university. But these video lectures were so good, that it honestly taught me the first year of introduction and parts of the later courses in a couple of weeks. Sure… I had the foundation with me, but it also made me wonder if you couldn’t just use these lectures everywhere English speaking. Now, I don’t mean to disrespect my own professors but they were terrible at lecturing by comparison. Which isn’t too weird I guess, I imagine it’s natural for some of the top universities in the world to have some of the best lecturers. In this modern age, we can frankly share these awesome video lectures. Lectures you can pause, rewind a bit, rewatch and so on. All the things I would’ve personally benefited from immensely.

Spaced repetition should work fine for adolescents, it probably doesn’t work for very young children, and for the ages 5-10 it’s going to need some adaption.<p>Spaced repetition is a trick to get the adult brain to retain knowledge, something it does not do easily. Adults are optimized to forget daily life  (what did you have for lunch yesterday?), but to remember sporadic and important events, things that have may impact on survival. Spaced repetition tricks the adult mind into thinking that your daily Spanish vocab is important because you didn’t test today’s word for three months.<p>Younger children are different.

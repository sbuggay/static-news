The anime adapts the manga source by adding a time travel story, which is one of the cornerstone tropes of visual novels today, and was first realized on the PC-98.<p>The PC-98 is comparable to the Amiga in that its audiovisual potential cemented it as a kind of &quot;visionary platform&quot; for certain genres of gaming - but instead of speedy hardware that could support a lot of sprites, smooth scrolling and raster effects for action games, the high resolution and color palette pushed the balance towards slower-paced adventure and strategy games.<p>Both platforms habitually use enormous HUDs and tiny gameplay screens because filling the screen with assets would be too memory-intensive.</div><br/><div id="38411296" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38411296" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Dwedit</span><span>|</span><a href="#38411006">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38411331">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38411296">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38411296">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Meanwhile, the FM Towns had the speedy hardware that supported a lot of sprites.</div><br/><div id="38411598" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38411598" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">snvzz</span><span>|</span><a href="#38411006">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38411296">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38411331">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38411598">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38411598">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But x68000 was the king.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38411331" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38411331" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">snvzz</span><span>|</span><a href="#38411006">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38411101">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38411331">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38411331">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">While it is true the PC98 had (and still has) quite the share of doujin games, I do not like how the article makes it seem as if all software was games, as if all games were doujin, and all doujin were perverted.</div><br/><div id="38412202" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38412202" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway82843</span><span>|</span><a href="#38411331">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38411497">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38412202">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38412202">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A History of Eroge [1].<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shii.org&#x2F;geekstories&#x2F;eroge.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shii.org&#x2F;geekstories&#x2F;eroge.html</a></div><br/><div id="38412241" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38412241" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">snvzz</span><span>|</span><a href="#38411331">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38412202">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38411497">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38412241">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38412241">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">NXDOMAIN.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38411497" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38411497" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gryson</span><span>|</span><a href="#38411331">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38412202">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38411660">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38411497">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38411497">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, the article is more about the (often incorrect) Western perception of the PC-98 than what it existed as in Japan.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38411660" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38411660" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Dalewyn</span><span>|</span><a href="#38411331">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38411497">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38411101">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38411660">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38411660">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;as if all games were doujin, and all doujin were perverted.<p>My sincere opinion, as a Japanese-American, is that I have experienced the best stories that games have to offer in eroge (erotic games), that stuff beats out so-called mainstream titles (AAA and otherwise) any day of the week.

I worked for a US utility software company that had a deal with a major Japanese software distributor to make for them Japanese versions of our products and to develop new products they asked for. PC-98 was a big part of the Japanese market so we had to deal with it.<p>It was not quite IBM PC compatible, by Microsoft supported it in MS-DOS and Windows which hid most of the differences but that still left some surprises.<p>One of the biggest was drive letters. A: was always the drive you booted from, so if you had two floppy drives and one hard drive instead of A: and B: being the floppies and C: the hard drive like they would be on an IBM PC, you&#x27;d have A: be the hard drive and B: and C: be the floppies.<p>That broke a heck of a lot of US software that I tried to run on PC-98.<p>The biggest surprises I had developing software for Japan though weren&#x27;t technical. They were cultural. I remember two things that caught me by surprise.<p>1. There was an intermittent bug that was only happening on a particular model laptop that we didn&#x27;t have. The Japanese distributor sent us one. I set it up on my desk, and plugged in its power adaptor. After many days of fiddling around I managed to get the bug to happen and I was running a debugger.<p>It was in something that another developer was more familiar with, so I decided to take the laptop over to his office and show him.<p>I unplugged the power adaptor...and the damn thing instantly shut off!<p>It turned out that there was no battery in the laptop. Later the Japanese distributor explained that many people in Japan who didn&#x27;t need portable computers used laptops anyway instead of desktops because they had small apartments and laptops took up less space.<p>So some laptops, like this one, had multiple bays that could hold the user&#x27;s choice of batteries, hard disks, floppy disks, and optical disks. If you were just using it as a desktop you could omit the battery and use that bay for another disk, which was the case with this one.<p>2. We had another very intermittent bug where sometimes during installation of our newest product the computer would lock up. By &quot;lock up&quot; I mean everything froze on the screen (including mouse cursor if you were on Windows), CTRL-ALT-DEL did nothing, CAPS LOCK and NUM LOCK would not toggle the keyboard LEDs. No disk activity. No network activity.<p>We talked to the Japanese distributor about it and they decided they didn&#x27;t want to delay the release over this. It seemed rare enough that they expected it to just hit a handful of people, and they&#x27;d be able to handle that via tech support (this was in the days when products came with free tech support for the life of the product).<p>It turned out that actually quite a few more people than expected ran into it...but they weren&#x27;t reporting locked computers. They were reporting that installation was very slow. After something like 20-40 hours it would unfreeze and finish the installation and everything was fine after that.<p>This completely gobsmacked me. I can&#x27;t imagine any American consumer being so patient with a locked computer that they would let it sit that way long enough to discover it really was just a 20-40 hour delay.<p>But in Japan apparently nearly everyone who ran into it did just that.<p>(The problem turned out to be that the way we were doing some device probes hit a case on some optical disk controllers that caused them to lock things up while waiting for something that would never happen and had a very long timeout. We were able to replace that with probing that would avoid the problem).</div><br/><div id="38411523" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38411523" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">userbinator</span><span>|</span><a href="#38411024">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38411315">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38411523">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38411523">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>But in Japan apparently nearly everyone who ran into it did just that.</i><p>Like you said, the difference is cultural --- I suspect they&#x27;d rather wait it out than embarrass themselves by jumping to a conclusion; of course, the unusually long install time is what they would report, bur only after they&#x27;d done as much as they could to attempt to show that it wasn&#x27;t their own fault.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38411315" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38411315" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">charcircuit</span><span>|</span><a href="#38411024">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38411523">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38411291">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38411315">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38411315">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For people interested in this story, he also told it in this post: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23168518">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23168518</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38411334" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38411334" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">snvzz</span><span>|</span><a href="#38411291">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38410713">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38411334">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38411334">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;hNJ9o" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;hNJ9o</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="38410713" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38410713" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">classichasclass</span><span>|</span><a href="#38411334">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38411186">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38410713">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38410713">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">NSFW on one of the images.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

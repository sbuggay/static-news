A few samples with raccoon dog DNA were found with a few SARS-CoV-2 reads; but almost all the SARS-CoV-2 in those samples must have come from infected humans, and there&#x27;s no evidence those reads didn&#x27;t too. The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 presence and raccoon dog presence is negative, and that correlation is most positive for non-susceptible animal species; so I again think that&#x27;s noise.

These bat viruses are more distant genetically from the human samples than the civet and racoon dog viruses were; but they&#x27;re significant because of the prevalence and diversity of such viruses. This suggests that SARS-1 evolved mostly in bats (the reservoir hosts), then spilled to civets and racoon dogs (the proximal hosts) and evolved a little more, then spilled to humans.<p>SARS-CoV-2 is close enough genetically to SARS-1 that we knew immediately that the reservoir host was bats. The proximal host still hasn&#x27;t been found, despite the much greater effort to search. This doesn&#x27;t mean SARS-CoV-2 is necessarily unnatural, since the exact zoonotic transmission path is still unknown for other viruses that are certainly of natural origin (e.g. Ebola).

That is mostly a rhetorical question, because unless I have missed something, it is. Why do so many folks want to pretend that this has been proven incorrect?<p>There is no such consensus. That is one hypothesis. The other hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2 was the product of gain-of-function research carried out at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. There have been a number of papers published arguing for either hypothesis. Interestingly, it was recently discovered that the authors of one of the papers arguing against the lab leak hypothesis had privately expressed the opinion that the lab leak hypothesis was almost certainly correct.<p>&gt; Perhaps I have a selective memory but I seem to remember that most of the pushback against the lab origin theory from people like Fauci was primarily intended to combat racial and ethnic tensions that were growing at the time. Especially when it came to the notion that the virus was purposely released.<p>That doesn’t really make any sense if you think about it. The uptick in violent crime against Asian-Americans started in the summer months alongside the more general uptick in violent crime. Furthermore, the official narrative essentially blamed the pandemic on Chinese people buying unsanitary exotic meat from wet markets.

He left behind a number of important works, being the first writer to thoroughly investigate the psychology of socialism. For a long time, noted Le Bon, psychologists regarded belief as voluntary and rational….” But a shocking discovery was made. Psychologists discovered that mass belief is an unconscious process, “under the influence of mystical and affective elements independent of reason and will….” We do not fully understand why people believe irrational things, noted Le Bon, but they do.”[36]<p>According to Le Bon, the decisive role of the unconscious means that the decisive factors in belief are: “prestige, affirmation, repetition, suggestion and contagion.” These factors sway the mind independent of reason. “The power of these influences on the genesis of beliefs” is “proved by their effects on the actions of even the most cultivated men,” noted Le Bon. Man is not so much the “rational animal” as he is a “rationalizing animal” whose irrationality is supported by seemingly logical arguments. Le Bon wrote, “We have arrived thus at this important philosophical law: Far from presenting a common intellectual origin, our concepts have very different mental sources and are ruled by very different forms of logic. From the predominance of each … are born the great happenings of history.”[37]<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jrnyquist.blog&#x2F;2023&#x2F;07&#x2F;23&#x2F;about-the-s-word-a-polemic&#x2F;#_edn2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jrnyquist.blog&#x2F;2023&#x2F;07&#x2F;23&#x2F;about-the-s-word-a-polemic...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37095553" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37095553" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">iamthepieman</span><span>|</span><a href="#37095416">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37095506">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37095553">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37095553">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Useless if censored.

New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Korea, and China remained open for business throughout most of the pandemic precisely because they had strong institutions and because they successfully enforced expert consensus.<p>Even within the US, the map of covid deaths is practically an electoral map, which is itself practically a map of trust in institutions. San Francisco had a death rate of 134 per 100k. King County (Seattle), 158. And less you think it&#x27;s an urban&#x2F;rural thing, rural Vermont sits in the 150s. Meanwhile, almost nowhere in the South or Great Plains is below 400 per 100k, and almost everywhere that is is a blue island amidst a sea of red. Raleigh-Durham, Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Houston, Chicago, and St. Louis are all visible clear as day on a map of death rates.<p>Even if we assume that expert consensus got covid&#x27;s origins wrong - a fact that is far from demonstrated - I will happily take a temporary error in a relatively unimportant fact about the virus&#x27; origins over hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths and years of shutdowns that could have been avoided with better coordination any day.

If we are talking theoreticals w.r.t. your following disease&#x2F;vaccine combination I would like to add the following:<p>It only works when the vaccine has no side effects long or short term.<p>Suppose that the scenario happens and a vaccine is in place at light speed.

Is it worth causing, for example, horrendous birth defects to preserve herd immunity? Now you have to choose between saving people <i>now</i> versus saving people in the <i>future</i>. We have no idea what effects mandatory vaccination will have in 10, 20, or 30 years. That is a very scary proposition given how widely issued it was. It&#x27;s also strange the FDA said it would take 70 years to release all the data. I think it&#x27;s naive to think that there won&#x27;t be <i>any</i> effect. Perhaps not as extreme as thalidomide - but how do we know <i>today</i>?<p>If someone doesn&#x27;t want to take a vaccine they should be allowed to not take it. They are not immune from consequences.

There are cases being heard right now against major social media companies on their collusion with government officials to push a narrative.

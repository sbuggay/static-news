Using LP solvers like this team selection games, and an ELO+regression approach for score&#x2F;margin prediction games. Mostly as a way to beat friends while spending little or no time following the actual competition.<p>For team selection games the LP approach works great but does not dominate, as described in the OP. I&#x27;ve found it to work less well over the years and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the fantasy game vendors have been explicitly adding countermeasures - things like temporary wildcards, round-specific rules, trading limits and velocities, etc all mess with your LP constraints. Not that you couldn&#x27;t also code that up but it&#x27;s time consuming. You end up needing to follow the competition closely anyway and using your model as an advisor to spot &quot;good deals&quot; in the data.<p>edit: a few times I have also back tested my models vs the odds offered by the bookies (for the margin prediction games). Unsurprisingly the bookies have better models than me. Could be just using the bookies odds as the pick is a better approach.</div><br/><div id="40983261" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40983261" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dmurray</span><span>|</span><a href="#40983089">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40983418">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40983261">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40983261">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not sure if the article is tongue in cheek, but almost all of the skill <i>and</i> almost all of the noise in these games usually comes from your choice of value function, i.e. your ability to predict how many points a player will get in a given week.<p>Picking the best team subject to the constraints is trivial in comparison and you can solve the knapsack problem  by eye, or with some kind of greedy&#x2F;beam search approach.<p>This is different from the financial markets where almost all of the alpha (outperformance of one stock over another) has been taken away by other market participants, so a lot of professional time is spent on risk management, portfolio optimization, etc.</div><br/><div id="40983334" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40983334" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">2d8a875f-39a2-4</span><span>|</span><a href="#40983089">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40983261">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40983418">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40983334">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40983334">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The value function is crucial, sure. But back testing over a couple seasons I can usually land on something much better than what I as a (usually pretty casual) fan has in my head.<p>From an automation perspective the harder problem is getting match day squad selections (some sports regularly announce last minute teams, like at the time of the toss) and accounting for whatever special cases the game rules have tossed in (e.g. select a captain and vc, special reduced fees on trades this round, etc).<p>And to really win these games, rather say just beating your friends and landing top 5% globally, you also need risk management and portfolio optimisation strategies: e.g. when to play your &quot;captain scores double this round&quot; card? everyone has Mbappe, do you also pick him to hedge your riskier picks? I have no doubt that some players have built all this automation but I sure haven&#x27;t.</div><br/><div id="40983406" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40983406" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dmurray</span><span>|</span><a href="#40983089">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40983334">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40983418">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40983406">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40983406">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you want to maximize your chances of winning a very large game like this, you need to play quite a lot riskier than is intuitive, you definitely do not want to pick a popular player if your model predicts someone else will outperform him.<p>If you want to finish top 5%, having the best model should do it, with some attention to risk management in the last few games of the season (play riskier if you are in the 90th percentile than in the 99th).<p>If you want to maximise your chance of beating your friends, have the best model and think a little game theory at the end of the season based on whether you are leading or chasing.</div><br/><div id="40983671" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40983671" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alexmolas</span><span>|</span><a href="#40983089">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40983406">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40983618">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40983671">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40983671">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t have the numbers to back this opinion, but I believe that consistently ranking in the top 5% in all the games will greatly increase your chances of winning the league.

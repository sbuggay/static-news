One teammate handed the issue off to me at 2 AM her time and I needed to figure out how the team should proceed the next morning (before I would be awake).<p>I just started writing an email with our goals, what the obvious options were, how the options mapped onto the goals, what other contingencies might arise, etc. Through the course of writing the email it became pretty clear what the best option was, and what the fallback option would be in the likeliest contingencies.<p>As I was describing the situation to my kid the next day, I told her that sometimes when we write things down in emails or letters, it&#x27;s just as much for distilling our own thoughts as it is about communicating with others.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39701698" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39701698" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">piou314</span><span>|</span><a href="#39701272">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39701568">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39701698">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39701698">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Kind of reminds me of the book by zinsser: writing to learn</div><br/></div></div><div id="39701568" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39701568" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pickingdinner</span><span>|</span><a href="#39701698">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39700791">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39701568">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39701568">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Writing is thinking.

The second is to attempt to read and investigate the details. The third is to use a hands-on mechanism of engagement, which doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean &quot;write software&quot; for software development, it means priming yourself to be involved, which could mean writing notes, creating art or attempting to teach what you just learned. All of those things create facets of understanding that aren&#x27;t accessible in a passive context, and the more modes of that you access, the more likely it is that you have a good grasp on the knowledge.<p>My approach to developing has grown more consciously iterative as I&#x27;ve caught on to this. I copy things back and forth between paper and the screen manually, and I just spent an hour today designing some personal versioning&#x2F;project organization(a micro-project for an audience of 1 - start by applying Syncthing&#x27;s sync and versioning, then add a script that tracks and clones subdirectories in a CSV - add comments, auto-logging and tags to taste in the CSV format, edit that file manually for all fine adjustments, and you are good to go in under 100 lines).<p>I realized that I didn&#x27;t need &quot;version control&quot; so much as &quot;iteration control&quot; - sometimes I have a branch that has ambiguous relationship to an existing repository because it&#x27;s rewriting stuff or is a different kind of artifact from code. Writing a blogpost is very much that kind of thing since it refers to work you did do, but it isn&#x27;t a code repository.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39701311" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39701311" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">p0d</span><span>|</span><a href="#39700791">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39700411">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39701311">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39701311">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My blog has been private for twenty years.

If I don’t like it, I keep working, and eventually we get to a place where we like it.”<p>&gt;And somewhat counterintuitively, he doesn’t consider the audience at all:<p>&gt;“The audience comes last… I’m not making it for them. I’m making it for me. And it turns out that when you make something truly for yourself, you’re doing the best thing you possibly can for the audience.”<p>&gt;Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt a similar point:<p>&gt;&quot;If you think about the greatest products, they&#x27;ve almost always been designed for the benefit of the people who are actually building them.”<p>&gt;Uber started out as a private timeshare limousine service for Garrett Camp and his friends. Microsoft started when Bill Gates and Paul Allen wrote a Basic interpreter for the Altair so they didn’t have to write machine language to program it. Drew Houston built Dropbox to make his files live online after forgetting his USB stick. Larry Page and Sergey Brin built Google for Stanford—and particularly for themselves—with the first server in Larry’s dorm room.<p>&gt;There’s of course a delicate balance here between building for yourself and talking to users—you don’t want to be “fake Steve Jobs”.<p>&gt;Perhaps legendary coach Bill Campbell said it best in response to Steve Jobs’s approach of relying solely on the taste of Apple’s team members:<p>&gt;“I don’t think a marketing person would have created the Macintosh, but [talking to users] would have made it better.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IVe9-_ebyXk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IVe9-_ebyXk</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39700768" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39700768" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bugbuddy</span><span>|</span><a href="#39700433">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39700768">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39700768">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Too long did not read.

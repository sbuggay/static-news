And not just wandering over to a fellow cuders desk to ask them about a problem I am facing, but actually give me some productive solutions that are actually inspirational to the outcome.<p>It’s amazing.<p>So why do people think that coding is coming to some kind of end? I don’t see any evidence that artificial intelligence coding assistants are about to replace coders, unless you… suck badly at building things, so what are people getting on about?<p>I feel like somebody came along and said, “foundations are now free, but you still get to build a house.

You used to come across people who could do things like solder components to a board and hook up various ICs as well. Heck, I did this at uni.<p>Now that layer of craftsmen is gone. You are either an uber-expert in how computer hardware works, or you just buy the hardware and treat it like a kind of magic.<p>Traditionally to become an expert you went through an intermediate stage, showed your interest, and got trained. Your hobby could turn into a profession, since the step up was gentle and interested people were needed to do some of the supporting work.<p>Nowadays if you&#x27;re going to work in a chip fab, it&#x27;s not because you were a soldering iron kid. You go through a quite long academic process that doesn&#x27;t really recruit from the ranks of the hobbyists, though of course you&#x27;d expect there to be some natural interest. But the jump isn&#x27;t gentle, you end up learning some pretty advanced things that make soldering seem like the stone age.<p>Software has this layer of craftsmen still, though it is rapidly dying, and not just from LLMs. There&#x27;s a enormous number of people who can more or less hook up a website and make it work, without knowing everything about how exactly it does that. There&#x27;s also plenty of excel people and python scripting people who use code in their day-to-day, but can&#x27;t tell you advanced concepts. There&#x27;s a lot of modern services that make this sort of thing easier (wordpress etc), and this level of skill is very learnable by people in the developing world. It&#x27;s not like you can&#x27;t become a real expert in those parts of the world, but economically it makes sense that there are a lot of intermediately skilled there.<p>What will happen with GPT and the like is the experts will not need as much help from the juniors. If you&#x27;re a software architect in charge of a whole system, you won&#x27;t just sketch out the skeleton of the system and then farm out the little tasks to junior coders. Maybe there are pieces that you&#x27;d farm out, but you will definitely save on the number of juniors because an LLM will give you what you need.<p>The result being that we&#x27;ll get fewer people trained to the highest levels, but those who are will be much more productive. So those guys will indeed be entering the quantum age, but it strands a lot of people.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38260706" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38260706" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fauigerzigerk</span><span>|</span><a href="#38260315">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38260756">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38260600">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38260706">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38260706">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree it&#x27;s amazing.

Or will there be half as many developers? Or will the same number of developers get paid far less than today?<p>These questions arise even if not a single existing dev job can be completely taken over by an AI.<p>A secondary question is about the type of work that lends itself to AI automation. Some things considered &quot;coding&quot; require knowing a disproportionate number of tiny technical details within a narrowly defined context in order to effect relatively small changes in output.

There are whole levels that a coder needed to understand in the past that recent entrants to the field do not understand, that can still subtly affect how things work, if no one understands the things the craft depends on, then the craft is waning.<p>For anyone who started programming more than 13 years ago in the most widespread programming discipline for the past few decades (Web technologies), which in this career makes you super-old, the craft is waning because every year it becomes more and more difficult to understand the whole stack that the web depends on. Not even considering the whole stack of technologies that my first paragraph alluded to.<p>For Frontend coders it is waning because there are ever increasing difficulties to find out how to do something someone else did by looking at their code - modern build technologies means looking at the code of a site is not worthwhile. And people were already complaining about that 13+ years ago.<p>If you have kids or outside work responsibilities then in combination with this and the need to produce things and the ever increasing eating of stuff by software (opening new problems and business areas one might need to be cognizant of) it becomes less possible, for those not in school, to hone their craft via purposeful working. For this reason it may be that the craft is waning.<p>Finally improving productivity is not necessarily something that correlates with improving the craft - industrialization may have improved productivity and made many products available to many people that did not have them before, but it is pretty well known that it was not beneficial to the crafts.

Here&#x27;s a seminal project proposal from 1955:<p>&quot;We propose that a 2 month, 10 man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves. We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer. “</div><br/><div id="38260289" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38260289" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Miraste</span><span>|</span><a href="#38257511">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38260139">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38259834">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38260289">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38260289">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">GP didn&#x27;t say that AI was easier than expected, rather that AI is easier than robotics, which is true.

I’d be surprised if they aren’t.<p>The training systems we use for LLMs are still so crude. ChatGPT has never interacted with a compiler. Imagine learning to write code by only reading (quite small!) snippets on GitHub. That’s the state llms are in now. It’s only a matter of time before someone figures out how to put a compiler in a reinforcement learning loop while training an LLM. I think the outcome of that will be something that can program orders of magnitude better. I’ll do it eventually if nobody else does it first. We also need to solve the “context” problem - but that seems tractable to me too.<p>For all the computational resources they use to do training and inference, our LLMs are still incredibly simple.

Especially as they get better.<p>But that is just one part of being a good software engineer. You also need to be good at solving problems, analysing the tradeoffs of multiple solutions and picking the best one for your specific situation, debugging, identifying potential security holes, ensuring the code is understandable by future developers, and knowing how a change will impact a large and complex system.<p>Maybe some future AI will be able to do all of that well. I can&#x27;t see the future. But I&#x27;m very doubtful it will just be a better LLM.<p>I think the threat from LLMs isn&#x27;t that it can replace developers. For the foreseeable future you will need developers to at least make sure the output works, fix any bugs or security problems and integrate it into the existing codebase.

Yes, yes, I know some of you sell these tools and some of you have even been very successful in that effort but in my anecdotal experience from 98 municipalities, it’s never once worked, not for long anyway.<p>By contrast we now have digitally inclined employees creating and automating things with the help of CharGPT. Much of it is terrible in terms of longevity the same way the previous RPA or workflow tools were, but unlike those, people can now also maintain them. At least as long as you keep the digitally inclined employees onboard, because they’re still not software developers and things like scaling, resource usage, documentation, error handling and so on isn’t being done. But it could be, at least for around 90% of it which will frankly never really matter enough to warrant an actual software developer anyway because it mostly “frees” a few hours a month through its automation.<p>But with this ability, and the improvements in things like SharePoint online (and likely it’s competition that I don’t know about) a lot of the stuff you’d need either staffed software developers or external consultants to handle, can be handled internally.<p>This isn’t the death of software engineering as such. Like I said, it doesn’t scale and it’s also going to create a bunch of issues in the long term as more and more of this “amateur” architecture needs to function together, but at the same time, if you need to Google how to get some random lines of text from a dictionary, then I’m not sure you aren’t in danger either. And I really don’t say this to be elitist, but everything you google program can be handled fairly easily by GPT and “good enough” that it’s simply going  to happen more and more in our industry.<p>If you look into my history you’ll see that I’m both impressed and unimpressed by LLMs (well GPT, let’s be honest the others all suck). This is because it really hasn’t been able to help us develop anything in our daily work. It writes most of our documentation, and it’s scary good at it. It also does a lot of code-generation, like auto-generating types&#x2F;classes&#x2F;whatever you call them from Excel data mapping sheets + CRUD functionality. Sure, we did that before by writing some short CLI scripts, but now GPT does it for the most part. So it’s not like we don’t use it, but for actual well designed code that handles business logic in a way that needs efficiency? Yeah, it’s outright terrible. Maybe that will change over time, so far it’s not improved in the slightest.<p>But look at our industry as a whole. I know a lot of HN users work in American Tech or startups, but in the European non-tech Enterprise industry and the massive IT and consultant industry supporting it, there are a lot of developers who basically do what GPT excels at, and as these tools get better, we’re frankly just going to need a lot fewer software developers in general. Most of those people will likely transition into other jobs, like using GPT, but many won’t as other professions start doing their coding themselves.<p>What worries me the most, however, is that we still teach a lot of CS students exactly what GPT is good at. I’m an external examiner for CS students at academy level, and GPT can basically ace all of their curriculum because it’s mainly focused on producing a lot of “easy” code for businesses. I’m scared a lot of those students are going to have a rough time once LLMs really pick up, unless the curriculum changes. It won’t change in time though, because it’s already been sort of “outdated” for a decade because of how slowly our higher educations adapt to the real world here in Denmark.</div><br/><div id="38260498" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38260498" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">d3ckard</span><span>|</span><a href="#38259380">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38259669">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38260158">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38260498">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38260498">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What you&#x27;re describing is really about empowering users and pushing code where it was not possible before due to cost - so basically confirming efficiency paradox.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38260158" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38260158" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ken47</span><span>|</span><a href="#38259380">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38259464">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38260158">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38260158">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It feels like this article was not written by a programmer, and it feels like a number of the commenters are not professional engineers.

Can it still do all the other parts? Take ambiguous requirements and seek clarity from design, product, etc. (instructing an AI to a sufficient degree to build a complex feature could almost be a coding task itself). Code reviews. Deal with random build failures. Properly document the functionality so that other programmers and stakeholders can understand. Debug and fix production issues. And that’s just a subset.<p>Realistically, in the future there will be a long phase of programmers leveraging AI to be more efficient before there’s any chance that AI can effectively replace a decent programmer.<p>This will be an advantage to engineers who think on the more abstract side of the spectrum.

You&#x27;d need a real AGI to take over work that has that many social aspects and requires that much planning and consideration.<p>There is algorithms and datastructures, which is important for developers to learn, but usually not important to write yourself unless thats literally your job.

I could see LLMs taking some of this work away, which everyone would probably appreciate.<p>In the end, I believe that AI and in particular LLMs just help programmers, and will maybe replace the 6€&#x2F;hour outsourced copy paste programmers, but that is... not very scary.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38260491" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38260491" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">delbronski</span><span>|</span><a href="#38260084">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38260576">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38260491">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38260491">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I used chatgpt4 recently for two projects.

First, is coding some sort of competition like Go or chess? I have heard of competitive programming or code golf, but have little clue how that compares to “the craft of code” or why using GPT-4 diminishes it. Is it cheating if I use GPT-4’s assistance to write code? On the other hand, I do see why it would be harmful for people who don’t have the knowledge or experience to be relaying answers from an LLM to others on forums.<p>Second, I am seeing a parallel here with the college educators being preoccupied with how to teach calculus. Yesterday, I was reading the preface that Martin Gardner wrote to “Calculus Made Easy” by Silvanus P. Thompson and he wrote something along the lines of how many students and even educators (circa 1998) do not see the point in knowing how to differentiate or integrate by hand. I suppose now more than ever, some people even suggest to stop teaching calculus to high school (and even college students) in favor of some kind of vague statistics, data science, or information literacy course. But most mathematicians would discourage that kind of approach.<p>I think I agree with the last point about how it is not really about the knowledge of code itself but rather it is about being curious and knowing enough to not let yourself be taken advantage of.</div><br/><div id="38258187" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38258187" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">advaith08</span><span>|</span><a href="#38258046">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38260397">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38258187">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38258187">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the point of the comparison with chess is to show what happens when AI becomes vastly better than humans at something.

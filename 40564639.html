I would argue the commissioning system is better than the previous aristocratic commissioning system, but still relatively poor at mating skills to positions.<p>I think churn is a couple of problems for a couple of different potential reasons:<p>1) constantly moving positions tends to leave the more complicated problems unsolved. For one, it&#x27;s difficult to truly understand the dynamics of a complicated system in a short period. Secondly, if someone is concerned with promotion, attacking small problems tends to get you a win during your tenure, while it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ll make much headway on a really difficult or complicated problem. Even worse is the commander who has all kinds of great ideas they want implemented even before they really understand the problem (ie the &#x27;good idea fairy&#x27; dilemma)<p>2) military churn can bias toward giving people responsibility beyond their capability, simply because they need someone to fill that role. This is especially with younger organizations (and the military definitely biases young). Meaning you tend to people with a lot of power&#x2F;responsibility before their frontal lobe is even fully developed.<p>Now I do think the military does a pretty good job at accountability, which can mitigate some of those factors. But if that&#x27;s the case, we should be trying to optimize for &quot;accountability&quot; and not &quot;churn&quot;.<p>The better military organizations seem to have &quot;churn&quot; in the uniformed services in charge but a steady cadre of professional civilian staff supporting them.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40565474" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40565474" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ralegh</span><span>|</span><a href="#40565409">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40565529">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40568322">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40565474">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40565474">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well said, also applies to many human dynamics - friendships, relationships, work relationships, etc. Ceding power is a ratchet and you either put your foot down to start with or it grinds away.</div><br/><div id="40565686" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40565686" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">redserk</span><span>|</span><a href="#40565409">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40565474">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40568322">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40565686">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40565686">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hard disagree.<p>Healthy relationships include negotiating when potential boundaries are in question, or if things change that require re-aligning boundaries.<p>It&#x27;s reasonable to give more to the other party from time-to-time, and reasonable to discuss with the other party if it becomes a point where it feels unfair.<p>Instead we (Americans) take an unnecessarily adversarial stance against what our government could do, ensuring it is perpetually unprepared.</div><br/><div id="40565785" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40565785" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LeafItAlone</span><span>|</span><a href="#40565409">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40565686">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40566796">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40565785">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40565785">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Healthy relationships<p>In reality, the vast majority of relationships aren’t actually healthy in this way.

That kind of power in the hands of a sophisticated used car salesman like Sam Altman will be bad in so many ways.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40566785" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40566785" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zer00eyz</span><span>|</span><a href="#40567726">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40565274">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40566785">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40566785">[35 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; And finally, we need more steps like the FTC’s recent move to ban all employee noncompetes (no carve outs, no limitations, no exceptions).<p>YOU need to be out there beating the drum for a major exception to this.

Perhaps some bureaucratic reforms similar to the ones that occurred in Estonia, the kind that result in major cost reductions without any loss in quality of service.  Universal healthcare?

Nothing&#x27;s stopping me or my clients from contacting senators, reps, and regulators, joining political organizations, or signing open letters. We have our own voices. Some of us know enough to use them.<p>It&#x27;s hard to tell what, exactly, the position on &quot;open source AI&quot; was. It&#x27;s presented here in glittering generalities. Given the many conversations I&#x27;ve had on-theme with not-public-tech-co people, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say all of &quot;little tech&quot; has one view or position, when you really get down to details. I rather doubt the whole YC-o-Verse sees it all one way, either, given its burgeoning size.<p>More broadly, I&#x27;d expect positioning off as &quot;little tech&quot; to flop. Policy players know how to follow the money. They know &quot;Big Tech&quot; brings the money that buys startups—they&#x27;ve read about it in exec summaries of the committee reports. They&#x27;re also plenty aware that startups get founded by, and recruit from, a lot of the same pools of people. They&#x27;ve been lobbied by various policy groups speaking for smaller tech companies, often funded by the bigger tech companies, for years. If they dig just a little bit, they&#x27;ll see the barriers to entry, and resulting big-co dependencies, for small-cos doing AI work.<p>There&#x27;s bipartisan support for &quot;going after Big Tech&quot; competition-wise. I don&#x27;t think the pols need a tech-co splinter group as reinforcement there. Unless and until IPO becomes the main path of successful ascent again—perpetually private isn&#x27;t popular—I don&#x27;t have great arguments against generalizing startups to Big Tech Farm League. There are plenty of gripes up from startups against the Great Houses, especially from investors. But that&#x27;s feudalism for you.<p>Compare, say, DHH&#x27;s lobbying. 37signals had the Bezos investment, but it was an unusual deal, not within the usual system.

I totally agree with the sentiment, but isn’t YC part of the whole machine? Seed funding to VC to  Wall Street IPO exit to big billion dollar corporation? Sam Altman is a product of YC culture, he ran the place, same as you do now.<p>I wanted to join YC in the past 12 years and applied multiple times. We never made it to the interview, but I have gotten an outsider’s perspective on the industry and the root causes of the problems <i>you currently really want to solve with government</i>. Instead what if I told you <i>YC under YOUR leadership can solve them worldwide and far better?</i> Hear me out…<p>Peter Thiel who invested the first $500K into Facebook famously taught that “competition is for losers, build a monopoly”, and I imagine the lessons to capture <i>and extract</i> maximum value from the ecosystem for shareholders has affected many founders, including Mark Z:
<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;peter-thiel-competition-is-for-losers-1410535536" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;peter-thiel-competition-is-for-...</a><p>Mark Zuckerberg was an open source guy on the east coast. He open sourced Synapse instead of selling it to Microsoft. He wanted to make Wirehog, a peer to peer file sharing system, but Sean Parker and the VCs “put a bullet in that thing”. I was there at TC Disrupt in NY where Parker proudly told the story: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;05&#x2F;26&#x2F;wirehog&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;05&#x2F;26&#x2F;wirehog&#x2F;</a><p>Sean Parker himself learned that lesson bitterly when his company disrupted a <i>different but similar</i> industry that was about owning and monetizing intellectual property - RIAA, MPAA, etc. After Napster was defeated he opened Plaxo and learned to play the “correct game”. He wanted to make sure Mark didn’t follow his open sensibilities too far, letting the public share stuff too freely, because shareholders need profit!<p>We are LUCKY that Mark Z still retains some of his original open source sensibilities because his company has been the only one giving away models trained for large amounts of money, to the community. Ok maybe Llama research edition leaked but they OWNED that thing, and became to openness what Apple is to privacy.<p>I mean when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed (set off by the same Peter Thiel), we found out that most VCs even banked at the same bank! There has been a LOT of centralization.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.laweekly.com&#x2F;restoring-healthy-communities&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.laweekly.com&#x2F;restoring-healthy-communities&#x2F;</a><p>This article goes into more depth than my post can, about how the incentives to enrich shareholders leads not just to enshittification of their own ecosystem but surveillance capitalism, and generally externalizing cost to society. Across the board! Teen girls have highest rates of depression. Adult men are on opiates and 20% of middle-aged women are on antidepressants. Elderly are in nursing homes and kids are in public schools (which pg once compared to prisons) and medicated for ADHD to sit still while their parents work long hours with less and less job certainty. Some even just do the gig economy, while Instacart ir Uber collects HALF of every driver’s fare for its shareholders!<p>Our society is perpetually angry now because algorithms select for more engagement, and it turns out clickbait and outrage maximizes it even more than sex. So the market selects for one sided stories that evoke outrage, and publishers pick an audience to pander to. While social network algorithms produce echo chambers and radicalization. And this is before we get to any AI bot swarms.<p>I believe there is ONE WEIRD TRICK that YC can do to help society at large A LOT over the next decade. I would like to see a way to transition shareholders organically to utility tokenholders before the public offering. Kind of like the differenc between Disney Dollars and shares of Disney Corp. Disney’s shareholders don’t live in Disneyworld and thus dont have the incentives that customers and workers do. They become an everpresent landlord class extracting rents forever, holding earnings calls even after the original investors had sold their shares. Same with other ecosystems.<p>The founders don’t need THAT machine necessarily, to be handsomely rewarded to the  tune of billions of dollars and have the startups become worldwide movements that serve humanity. YC and VCs could still have their exits while preventing the parasitic rent extraction from getting out of control post-IPO. YC being upstream of most VCs could operate a HUGE lever, and like Archimedes, could move the world towards a better system, as you once did with SAFE notes! That’s would solve a lot of the incentive problems without the need for heavy-handed government regulation!<p>Two years ago, a different very ambitious and politically connected Sam — Sam Bankman Fried - also went around begging for his space to be regulated. But the incentives inherent in shareholder profits (instead of stakeholder accounting) and competition (instead of cooperation) are what leads to negative externalities, in many ways, and that includes pollution, ecosystem collapse, factory farms and much more. You guys can consider introducing that one SMALL change — transitioning shares to utility tokens gradually.<p>I would be very happy to come meet and explain more if it is of any interest. Just reply to my message and let me know how to reach out if you see potential here.<p><i>PS: In addition to utility tokens, open source and protocols help create maximum value for the world, through collaboration over competition. For decades, the US government wielded its mighty antitrust regulations over Ma Bell and the phone companies it split them into. And yet long distance calls were still $3 a minute. Then, VOIP open protocols democratized the pipes and turned the telcos into dumb replaceable infrastructure. It was open protocols that brought the cost of not just calls but video and broadcasting down to near-zero, something government couldn’t do. Wikipedia beat Britannica. The Web beat AOL and all closed systems. I could go on, but open and free beats closed in the end, AND each open platform (Linux, the Web, etc) leads to far more wealth creation than when gatekeepers extract rents. That’s another aspect. And meanwhile, since 2014 people have discovered that utility tokens can help to monetize open source and digital content including journalism, in healthier ways than ads and surveillance capitalism. As my VC friend Albert Wenger from Union Square ventures wrote a book along the same lines: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;worldaftercapital.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;worldaftercapital.org</a></i></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

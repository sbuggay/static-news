I think the use of a linear optical resonator to amplify a weak optical nonlinearity is quite genius, and something the relatively small nonlinear photonics community has been trying to do forever. That they showed this kind of &#x27;all-optical-ish&#x27; nonlinearity on a relatively mature process in a foundry is nothing to scoff at, and likely one of the biggest results in semiconductor photonics in a while. At the single device level I think it makes so much sense, but what concerns me in general is how well this scales from a few perspectives:<p>1. resonators and device-to-device variance: in general it&#x27;s pretty hard to get these resonant effects to line up with each other from a production POV, especially with large arrays. Silicon photonics has come far, but I don&#x27;t think it has approached the level of uniformity as electronics. They have demonstrated some level of electro-optic tunability, which is the traditional solution, but they still need to leverage that for their nonlinear effects too.<p>2. area and space: the &#x27;minimum&#x27; trace size of these planar photonics circuits is still quite large (~200 nm minimum feature size typically for these waveguides). This is essentially due to a minimum size needed to confine light within a waveguide which depends generally on the waveguide&#x27;s refractive index and target wavelength. These are currently all integrated on a planar manner, so each channel becomes quite large, especially if now you also need a relatively large ring resonator, which in this case is at least ~100 micrometers or so in diameter<p>3. the combination of 1 and 2: high device-to-device variation, along with a large planar footprint means that these things are quite expensive and difficult to manufacture, without some kind of miniaturization benefit that you would typically get with electronics (at least not yet). This effect appears to be more than the sum of 1 + 2.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42706390" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42706390" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">danpalmer</span><span>|</span><a href="#42706682">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42706329">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42706390">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42706390">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This sounds impressive, but this bit stood out to me:<p>&gt; This process works by sending a tiny bit of the optical signal to a photodiode that measures how much optical power is there.<p>It seems that the benefit of the approach in general is to keep compute in optics, because crossing the optical to electrical boundary takes too long.

This device directs a fraction  of the incident optical power ∣b∣2 into a photodiode by programming the phase shift θ in an MZI. The photodiode is electrically connected to a p–n-doped resonant microring modulator, and the resultant photocurrent (or photovoltage) detunes the resonance by either injecting (or deplet-ing) carriers from the waveguide.<p>... and a couple of notes on the observed latency later in the paper<p>&gt;We experimentally characterized the computational latency of the NOFU in this mode, finding that the response time for carrier injection was shorter than 100 ps and that 75 μA of photocurrent was sufficient to detune the resonator by a linewidth, corresponding to a static power dissipation of 60 μW.<p>&gt;As our architecture computes entirely in the optical domain and is integrated onto a single photonic circuit, inference latency is limited only by the optical time of flight through the chip</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42706329" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42706329" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">4b11b4</span><span>|</span><a href="#42706390">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42706329">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42706329">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hmm...

You&#x27;d make a single 2D sketch, draw some lines in box shapes, and put some constraints on those boxes. Free&#x2F;unbound dimensions would read out the distances that you needed to know. The whole thing would take less than five minutes for someone with beginner-level skills (i.e., me), and maybe an hour or two to learn from scratch. It&#x27;s not as cool as doing this with CSS&#x27;s constraint solver, but it might add a new tool to your toolbox, and the value of that is difficult to overestimate.</div><br/><div id="40268863" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40268863" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mauvehaus</span><span>|</span><a href="#40268679">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40270098">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40268863">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40268863">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Having used AutoCAD, Draftsight, and PTC ProEngineer in the past, and FreeCAD (for actual CAD, generally 2D, as input to a Shopbot) and Sketchup (for design renderings for clients) regularly currently, I would suggest that the learning curve on constraint-based drafting is fairy steep for most folks.<p>I&#x27;d also submit that it&#x27;s of limited value if you aren&#x27;t using the same package as your shop. The browser-based method is at least all but guaranteed to be available to the people building the cabinets.<p>Since they&#x27;ll have to do shop drawings anyways, you aren&#x27;t gaining much even if you can interchange drawings with their CAD software.</div><br/><div id="40270058" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40270058" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">exmadscientist</span><span>|</span><a href="#40268679">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40268863">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40270098">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40270058">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40270058">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I mean, we&#x27;re talking about making the napkin sketch that you hand to the real draftsman. The format really doesn&#x27;t matter; they want a PDF (or whatever). They are not going to open your HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS tool even if it would be trivial to them. They have better things to do with their lives. So what tool you choose is up to you and should be whatever is best for you. It doesn&#x27;t matter what the shop is using.<p>Proper constraint-based drafting is indeed quite hard! But I think the whole &quot;lay out this 2D grid-like structure with a few rectangles&quot; problem is probably one of the first things anyone would learn to do with it, and I&#x27;d submit that it is indeed probably about a couple of hours&#x27; work, for someone already reasonably technical. The moment there&#x27;s more than a single sketch involved, or complex geometry in that single sketch, I agree with you that it&#x27;s asking too much.<p>The real benefit is that you are starting to learn something new. CSS is not going to help you (insane contortions aside? I really don&#x27;t want to find out) when things like circles appear. And yet, if you know how to do 2D sketches, you can find yourself using them to solve other problems, <i>just because you already know how to do it</i>. And that&#x27;s pretty cool! (For example, I&#x27;ve had living rooms that were just awful to lay out. It was a real nightmare to figure out how to get a TV into that place. So I sketched it up and messed around until I got something viable. My original plan was just to print out some pieces of paper to scale, then mess around with those, but it was soon clear I could do it all onscreen, so I did.)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40270098" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40270098" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alnvdl</span><span>|</span><a href="#40268679">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40268863">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40267560">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40270098">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40270098">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Mid-way through development, once I still had to solve the problems of sharing and printing, I almost gave up on continuing the work because I thought: &quot;it surely must be easier to just learn a CAD application&quot;.<p>But as another commenter highlighted: that meant a learning curve not only for me, but for my wife as well.

The program suggests 4 x 18.6cm = 74.4cm, but the actual remaining height is 74cm (92 - 15 - 3).

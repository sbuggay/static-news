There are no libs: I write everything myself in asm (my preferred is z80 but I can do 68000 amiga stylez). Everything is in my head ; on my msx I write opcodes; not even an assembler needed! Wat is deployment? It already runs!<p>I guess that is indeed cosy and, for people who grew up with the horror that is npm and left-pad, not really understandable, but when they try, it is incredibly liberating.<p>I own most 70-80s systems (I mean brands, even vague east block, russian, hong kong ones; I miss a few but those are just too rare), they all work (I cheat; I can fix them, I do replace quite a lot of capacitors during the decades, but at least with these I <i>can</i>), and they are lovely.<p>Edit; I know I Can do the same thing on my linux machine; just use C and no libs, but for the reasons named in the last paragraph of the article, it doesn&#x27;t relax me; I don&#x27;t need more money, yet I cannot detach modern computers from productivity; it helps that with these 40 year old machines you <i>cannot</i> make money. So I do dream of a laptop running on an mcu with an eink screen that has 1 month of battery but no commercial power. And running common lisp at boot as that&#x27;s all I need anyway.  I am close to just forking over 10k to have one custom made, but still hope someone else will do it.</div><br/><div id="41423728" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41423728" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AndrewOMartin</span><span>|</span><a href="#41423515">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41423691">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41423728">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41423728">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a nice comment and speaks to the notion that every medium has its own characteristic feel even is not &quot;better&quot; by some metric (e.g. vinyl vs CDs, vs cassettes, vs live radio, vs mp3, etc.).<p>A similar feeling of immediacy without any intervening concerns is hacking away at a Processing [<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;processing.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;processing.org&#x2F;</a>] sketch. In some sense it&#x27;s the complete opposite of retro computing, but it engenders similar experiences.

If you wanted to write DOS software and games, you can still write them. Nothing is stopping you.<p>I don&#x27;t own much of the old hardware because:<p>- I don&#x27;t have space<p>- I don&#x27;t want to maintain them<p>But I like emulators and will use them when I can.<p>&gt; So I do dream of a laptop running on an mcu with an eink screen that has 1 month of battery but no commercial power.<p>Look into emulators that run on e-ink devices. Most run Android of some sort and can emulate systems of the yesteryear. You don&#x27;t need to spend 10k.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

Of course.<p>But right now they really really seem to be failing at it. Maybe the core tech in gemini is great. But it&#x27;s nowhere.<p>Just as an anecdote, I tried to actually pay google for an AI product they claimed to have launched - the image generation, Imagen 2. And apparently, I can&#x27;t. Even after tens of e-mails and a call with an account manager, the response is &quot;uh, follow us on twitter and explain why you are good at building AI tools&quot;. 
Jeez, buying a service is not supposed to be like a job interview. It&#x27;s supposed to be like buying the same service from OpenAI - enter credit card details and go.<p>So, the issue with google is that they took the wrong approach - build it in-house at a big company. What a big company has, are lawyers. Very good ones. The job of lawyers is to avoid risk. And they are great at it. However, building these sort of cutting edge services requires taking risk. And you can&#x27;t really do that at a large company.<p>This is why Microsoft is winning - they realized that investing into a startup that has no lawyers and is willing to take risk is the right path to quickly getting to the result. This is also why dalle3 and chatgpt4 are available for everyone today.

I appreciate the context as someone who hasn&#x27;t kept a close eye on Google&#x27;s AI efforts, but Ben doesn&#x27;t cover why Google has a right to win outside of search data. Interestingly, there is no mention of AWS and Amazon&#x27;s wider efforts to create AI tools. There is hype around chat bots but what is the likelihood chat functionality is the premier AI gateway in the near future?<p>Edit: I thought about the topic more while wrapping up my work work. I am on the periphery of AI at one of the large US tech companies and we&#x27;ve placed AI bets along many of our existing products. Every day I run into this – &quot;I manage xyz product, we plan to add AI to help with XYZ in 2024&quot; or we added this chat functionality for &quot;manual job to be done.&quot; I don&#x27;t claim to have insight into the future on which of these solutions will be successful for their intended clients. The pattern I see is that AI can be quickly (relative) integrated or coupled onto existing software services. Is that the secret to AI? It will permeate through our digital lives either in small or big ways – but critically it isn&#x27;t one AI to rule them all. AI micro services will act like intermediaries between humans and some end service.<p>It is like chocolate. Why not pair chocolate with [enter any food stuff]? You could hit a home run like chocolate with peanut butter or chocolate chip cookies. Now we have chocolate everywhere including drinks, but chocolate isn&#x27;t required for a tasty result.

I like the succinctness of text when I need to send a quick update or ask a short question, but I normally always call someone for an in-depth conversation.

When typing, I can think about the next phrase or sentence. When talking, I find it much more difficult to &quot;think ahead&quot;, so to speak.<p>I wonder if this would change as we got more familiar with interacting with a voice AI. I think a lot of the extra brain power that goes into talking versus typing is the assumed need to keep talking at a constant pace because that is what a human listener expects. If we were more comfortable with pausing while talking and not feeling like we need to always know what to say next as soon as we get to the end of a word, it might not take as much brain power to speak to a computer anymore.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38693151" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38693151" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">flappyeagle</span><span>|</span><a href="#38692262">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38692602">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38693199">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38693151">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38693151">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Young people text because it’s considered bad etiquette to call unannounced.<p>No such issue with robots.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38693199" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38693199" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway290</span><span>|</span><a href="#38692262">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38693151">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38692516">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38693199">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38693199">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Just look at anyone under the age of 25 (35 maybe?)

Several people I had worked with were there during the golden days and would reflect on them with great nostalgia...<p>Back then, special names we use today like &quot;computer science&quot; or &quot;data science&quot; were not commonly used. In this era, this field was simply called &quot;Operations Research&quot; (i.e. the application of quantitative methods and data analysis to improve operational and strategic decision making).
- Without going off course too much, I previously made the case that places like the RAND Corporation for all practical purposed invented the field of what we call data science today, but may so-called data science practitioners would not know what the RAND Corporation was, nor would many people at the RAND Corporation in modern times have connected the dots to recognize that they had pioneered this field.<p>For anyone interested in reading more on the theme of applying quantitative methods &#x2F; operations research in the area of US public policy, it&#x27;s reading about the &quot;Whiz Kids&quot;:

I hope I can find a copy online so I can link it to this article, as many of the ideas were incorporated into the design of RAND&#x27;s future&#x2F;replacement campus in Santa Monica, CA.<p>- The ideas on office&#x2F;campus design were quite good and even included the subject of floor planning and desk assignments. Despite the inherent draw of organizations to divide office space by departments and functions, the RAND ideas were to deliberate interleave the locations of personnel such that people would have increased chances of collaborating with others that they would not naturally be drawn to directly in executing their work. This extended further to how walkways and passageways should be designed to connect floors, buildings etc... ensuring that people would pass by and see other people&#x2F;functions&#x2F;departments that they would not normally see or consider in their day-to-day work. I recall trying to cite some of these ideas when I worked in other research organizations (e.g. Google Research) where one of the principal complaints was siloing&#x2F;lack of collaboration, yet teams were allowed to physically silo themselves in seating plans (by their own request&#x2F;demands).<p>- I never got to see the original campus, as it was demolished and later turned into a public park. However, the drawings and photographs of the original campus reminded me of something that resembled an American high school or small university campus.<p>- There are many small details about working at RAND that were part of deliberate efforts to influence an individual&#x27;s experiences and decisions to improve their creative&#x2F;work potential. For example, the equivalent of Vacation&#x2F;PTO time at RAND is called &quot;sabbatical time.&quot; RAND employees were paid more, on an hourly equivalent rate, when taking their &quot;sabbatical time&quot; than for regular work time; this idea was not implemented to reduce financial liability of unspent PTO time for the company under modern standards, but because it was believed and understood --through research-- that employees were more likely to bring their best selves to work when having sufficient and periodic time away from their work -- often bringing back new ideas that wouldn&#x27;t have emerged simply by grinding away at a problem... So they hoped to incentivize employees to take that time away from a problem by paying them more during their time off.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40850649" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40850649" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Animats</span><span>|</span><a href="#40851346">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40852412">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40850649">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40850649">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Gen.

In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers. The prospect of domination of the nation&#x27;s scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present — and is gravely to be regarded. Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;It is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integrate these and other forces, new and old, within the principles of our democratic system — ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society.&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="40850805" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40850805" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AlbertCory</span><span>|</span><a href="#40851923">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40851607">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40850805">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40850805">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had an offer from them.

The firm, it transpires, was in the process of constructing a brand spankin’ new office building, right next door. The old one was going to be torn down. So it was in a state of, shall we say, disrepair. In fact, it looked as though they’d stopped doing anything with it, several years earlier.<p>&gt; But I found the basement irresistible. It drew me in like a tractor beam. Long, stale, sunless corridors, cracked linoleum at your feet, illumined by flickering fluorescent light-fixtures. Like something out of (or inspired by) Last Year at Marienbad. Nary a footstep now treads down those halls, which had overheard such secrets, hushed whispers, momentous occasions and portentous events.<p>&gt; One day, to my surprise, I turned the corner, and there, sitting in his cell, was none other than Manuel Noriega, the ex-dictator of Panama. Seeing as how I did not know him personally, but recognized him from his many media appearances, I hastened to introduce myself. “How are they treating you?” I asked. “Si si, not so bad. Every now and then some junior CIA type comes in and we do some more – what is it, water-surfing? Boogie-boarding? No, no, water-boarding. But it is more for his pleasure, than mine.” I told him that the U.S. actually had given Panama the canal. “Yeah, I heard about that,” he replied. “But how about all of the new peoples who are there now, think of all of the opportunities for a little friendly mordida!” I said I was gonna mosey on, but I’d be back. “Please bring me some of the CDs by the band Pink Floyd,” he said. “They are like the thinking man’s AC&#x2F;DC – I got so sick of all that puerile metal crap they were blasting at me when I was in the compound.” “Better than Sadam Hussein,” I replied. “They got him in a spider hole, and it didn’t look as though he was enjoying any music!” “They got Sadam, too?” he replied, querulously.</i><p>- David Kronemyer, <i>My Days at RAND Corporation</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20080815050205&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kronemyer.com&#x2F;2007&#x2F;07&#x2F;15&#x2F;uncategorized&#x2F;my-days-at-the-bland-corporation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20080815050205&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kronemyer....</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40853128" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40853128" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nimbius</span><span>|</span><a href="#40851607">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40853128">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40853128">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The thing that killed RAND was government oversight and neoliberalism.<p>These days its not possible to innovate something like switched ethernet (which RAND had a hand in) unless you submit bids from forty GSA vendors and hold fifty meetings on which third party implementation consultants you need to hire for the work neoliberalism insists you not do anymore as a corporation because outsource culture is king.  wrap it all up in a mountain of project managers and &quot;best practices&quot; because youre too chicken-shit to do anything that 200 other companies dont do, and viola. the punishment for failure FAR outweighs the reward for any breakthrough you think you can achieve.<p>youre not a thinktank anymore youre just a consulting firm with a particularly attractive media spend.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

They have a few gold records. To this day they still tour every year and make enough money off touring and royalties to make a good living. I grew up on punk and thrash metal, so had never heard of his band, so it surprised me how close to 30 years later they still get booked at Disney and on rock cruises, but happy he still gets to keep doing that.</div><br/><div id="41198941" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41198941" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hn_throwaway_99</span><span>|</span><a href="#41197817">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41198282">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41198941">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41198941">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah, one of the things I didn&#x27;t like about this analysis is that it really didn&#x27;t do a very good job of differentiating between a band that really is a &quot;one hit wonder&quot; and a band that may only be in the top 40 for a short time but still has a dedicated following and is able to make a good, long career of it.<p>Take his &quot;prototypical example&quot; of Of Monsters and Men. I am glad that he did mention that the band &quot;has enjoyed continued success since their 2012 breakout&quot;, but as a big fan of this band, I&#x27;d say they have a really dedicated following. I think in their case they were more of the &quot;quirky band shoots has an immensely mainstream popular single, then goes back to being a quirky band, just with a much bigger following&quot;.<p>Rather than just look at placement in the top 40, which is only going to be songs that have wide applicability and are usually heavily promoted, I think it&#x27;s more applicable to see how long these folks can have a career in music. As another example, think of someone like Andre 3000. Sure, he may never surpass his fame from Outkast&#x27;s &quot;Hey Ya&quot; in 2003, but he&#x27;s been working prominently for 30 years.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41198282" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41198282" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">golergka</span><span>|</span><a href="#41197817">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41198941">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41198999">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41198282">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41198282">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Once you get into a heart of a teen, you remain there for the rest of his life.

I&#x27;d bet that Of Monsters and Men is perfectly happy to make an okay living off of their remaining fanbase, because they still get to tour and make new albums. They might be even happier about it if they could get a second hit, but there are so many musicians who have never had a breakthrough hit, who make a happy living opening for other bands, meager royalties, Patreons, etc. Basically, this post assumes a causal link between chart success and life satisfaction that probably doesn&#x27;t exist.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41193799" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41193799" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">the__alchemist</span><span>|</span><a href="#41194964">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41197379">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41193799">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41193799">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Green Day + Rancid are still filling stadiums to capacity.

My wife and I have made a hobby of going to concerts and festivals for the past few years. Just in the last three years, we&#x27;ve seen KMFDM and NIN multiple times, Tool, Madonna, Judas Priest, Kreator, Queensryche, Slowdive, Echo and the Bunnymen, Metallica, Dead Kennedys, Social Distortion, Bad Religion, Rob Zombie, Alice Cooper, Filter, New Order, Ministry like five times. We&#x27;ve got Slayer, Weezer, and Flaming Lips coming up in the next couple months. I have pretty badly <i>wanted</i> to see Massive Attack, Juno Reactor, and Spiritualized, but their tours never hit the US.<p>Some of these were multi-generational megastars. Some of them charted once or twice 30+ years ago. Some of them never charted at all. All of them have devoted fanbases and they sell out venues. Some of these are 80,000 seat arenas, some are small clubs with standing room only, but they&#x27;re all enough to sustain the band for decades.<p>You don&#x27;t need to be on the Billboard top 100 to make a living. A whole lot of fans continue to be fans and will love you their entire lives regardless of whether a single one of your songs hits the mainstream ever again or even if you don&#x27;t release new material at all. KMFDM thankfully does release new stuff damn near all the time (now 40 years of conceptual continuity), but my wife and I met at one of their shows. We&#x27;ve gone to see them every single time they come within 100 miles of us ever since and we always will. They&#x27;re a far more important part of our identities than Icona Pop is to the casual radio listeners that sung along to their one popular song for a summer and then forgot about them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41192824" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41192824" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wizardforhire</span><span>|</span><a href="#41193826">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41199314">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41192824">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41192824">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is worth the read if you happen upon it.</div><br/><div id="41193015" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41193015" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dpee123</span><span>|</span><a href="#41192824">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41199314">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41193015">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41193015">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh wow, thanks a bunch!

Many musicians (especially those that have only one hit, or even no hits at all) simply make music because it&#x27;s what they love to do. If enough people are interested in them for them to be able to make a living out of it, that&#x27;s enough &quot;professional success&quot; for them. That&#x27;s the reason why many bands stay together (or artists stay active) for decades after they had a top 40 hit. If they were just chasing stardom, they would have probably given up after a few years. For example, this band I went to see a few weeks ago in Cologne: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=INiKwU2JPF0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=INiKwU2JPF0</a> (the concert recording is not mine) - they were pretty big stars in the nineties with two hit albums (and a James Bond title track), then had two less successful ones, had a fallout with their record company, went on hiatus, then reformed in 2012 (with the original lineup!) and since then had three more albums (recorded in their own studio, published by their own record label) which were critically pretty well received, with a fourth one apparently on the way. Most people probably don&#x27;t even know they&#x27;re still around (or rather, around again), but as long as their loyal fans keep listening to their music and going to their concerts, they&#x27;re happy...</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

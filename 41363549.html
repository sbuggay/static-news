I still take some here and there, but not as many as before. Some of the courses are amazing and unbelievably rewarding, like Daphne Koller&#x27;s Probabilistic Graphical Models, Robert Sedgewick&#x27;s Analytical Combinatorics, and Gerald Sussman&#x27;s course on system optimizations. I&#x27;m very grateful for such learning opportunities. Unfortunately over time, I also found that these courses had diminishing returns for the following reasons:<p>- Due to the nature of MOOC, the assignments are largely either multiple-choice questions or programming assignments that merely asked students to fill in some blanks in some functions (there are a few exceptions of course). What a descent US university does really well is challenging students with tough yet insightful and inspiring assignments. That&#x27;s how students learn deeply and retain the knowledge, at least for me. Merely listening to lectures and ticking off a few ABCDs hardly helps real learning.<p>- Lack of feedback. A university course assigns TAs, gives tutorials and office hours, grades assignments with detailed feedbacks, and it is so much easier to form study groups and have high bandwidth discussions. MOOCs try their best to offer such help, but they don&#x27;t work as well or at least not as conveniently.<p>- Many courses are watered down. For instance, Andrew Ng&#x27;s ML course on Coursera is far less rigorous than that (229? I forgot) offered in Stanford? The course is great for students to gain some intuition, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s good enough for one to build solid ML foundations.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41364101" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41364101" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ecshafer</span><span>|</span><a href="#41364965">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41364028">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41364101">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41364101">[37 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t really like how any of the MOOCs run, and I think my issue is that they are not run like universities, they are run like job training centers.

Other than a few actual schools like Georgia Tech with OMSCS which actually seems to be trying to innovate to give degrees online at a fraction of the on-campus cost, they also don&#x27;t seem to be trying to actually give degrees.<p>A successful MOOC in my mind isn&#x27;t one that will have some credits for an online certification for programming or nursing that can transfer to a <i>Real school</i>. A successful MOOC is one where I can take a course on Ulysses or Semantics or Mathematics or Plato or whatever just like I could in a real undergrad, but without the same financial and time constraints.

The MOOCs (and any well-run university, probably the minority) have excellent data on what classes students want to take.<p>Well over 90% of the searches on their site are for tech-related topics. And most of the remainder are probably for business.<p>You can fantasize about a USA where people want to read Plato and accidentally get English degrees. I also think that would be great. In our current reality, only the trust-fund kids, who already know they never need to work, will want to pay for that.

If people want to learn a tech skill and don&#x27;t care about credentials, they invariably find a lot of other ways far superior to university courses. The closest I&#x27;ve seen to university style courses that people actually find useful is Udemy. Very few people seem to get much use from EdX or Coursera classes, far fewer still think it&#x27;s a good idea to take classes at their local university.<p>Same with Plato. You can read Plato on your own, you can listen to many more hours of free lectures on Plato, usually from better quality speakers, than you&#x27;d ever get at a university, you can join groups of people who want to discuss Plato&#x27;s philosophy. These people will actually be individuals interested in the topic, not bored university classmates who spend half the time talking about other things because of their disinterest. This is all for free.<p>Even discounting the cost, university education trails far behind other forms of learning. Once the cost is factored in, the only appeal ends up being the credentials and the four year summer camp environment.<p>That&#x27;s why when I see MOOCs brought up these days in the wild, it&#x27;s usually from people who are taking them for credentials. Once credentials are taken away, MOOCs and universities just don&#x27;t have a ton to offer for a motivated learner. It would be good if credentials and education were decoupled (for instance, like with the CFA), but there doesn&#x27;t appear to be much of a push for that.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41365377" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41365377" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">authorfly</span><span>|</span><a href="#41364101">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41364578">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41365564">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41364949">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41365377">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41365377">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think you are very correct.<p>The other point, as made in the &quot;EdTech doesn&#x27;t scale&quot; post the other day, is that Edutainment is one of the only really scalable ways to do EdTech profitably, and that favours consumption, not growth or testing (because for learning to be effective, it more or less has to be quite hard).

If a firm hires someone with a degree, what they&#x27;re paying for is knowing that a person actually learned the material, which requires human intervention to do grading and to prevent cheating. That costs a lot of money, because technological innovations don&#x27;t really make the grading or cheating prevention any cheaper. Education is the prototypical example of an industry affected by Baumol&#x27;s cost disease.<p>The cheapest part to scale is the educational material and lectures, but that&#x27;s always been the case, even before MOOCs. It has been possible for more than a century to go a library for free and get access to more educational material than one person could read in a several lifetimes.

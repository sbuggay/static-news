My advice would be don&#x27;t build an AI product at all.<p>To my mind an &quot;x product&quot; is rarely the framing that will lead to value being added for customers. E.g. a web3 product, an observability product, a machine vision product, an AI product.<p>Like all decent startup ideas the obviously crucial thing is to start with a real user need rather than wanting to use an emerging technology and fit it to a problem. Developing a UI for a technology where expectations are inflated is not going to result in a user need being met. Instead, the best startups will naturally start by solving a real problem.<p>Not to hate on LLMs, since they are neat, but I think most people I know offline hate interacting with chat bots as products. This is regardless of quality, bots are rarely as good as speaking with a real human being. For instance, I recently moved house and had to interact with customer support bots for energy &#x2F; water utilities and an ISP, and they were universally terrible. So starting with &quot;gpt is cool&quot; and building a customized chatbot is to my mind not going to solve a real user need or result in a sustainable business.</div><br/><div id="38227340" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38227340" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">deepGem</span><span>|</span><a href="#38222356">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38224531">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38227340">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38227340">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For most of us technologists, figuring out user need is way way harder than doing research or building something. That&#x27;s the reality. So we tend to take comfort in building technology and figuring out the user need later on.<p>Even discovering a real problem, a problem that warrants the expense on technology, is unfortunately out of the comfort zone for a lot of technologists. We often assume that the problem is real, or worse hope that the problem be real and jump into solving it right away because that&#x27;s our comfort zone, building stuff.<p>There ain&#x27;t nothing wrong with this attitude or process. In most cases, where technologists have solved real problems, the real problem has been a serendipitous unraveling during the build-iterate-shut process. So the best shot at figuring out a real problem for technologists is not spending time in problem discovery, but in a better ship-iterate-shut cycle. A cycle, in which in one can look at current usage and postulate the future and take rapid decisions on what to build, or what not to build.<p>Having read the biographies of many tech leaders, I have come to the understanding that the key skill that has set them apart is that exponential growth in their ability to hone the intuition about future demand, in a very short span of time, starting from a barebones MVP.</div><br/><div id="38227908" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38227908" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hiAndrewQuinn</span><span>|</span><a href="#38222356">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38227340">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38224531">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38227908">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38227908">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Gotta burn the candle at both ends a bit to make it big.

I think this is correct for many reasons.  Firstly, you probably don&#x27;t want to compete directly with ChatGPT, even if you are using OpenAI under the hood, because ChatGPT will likely end up being the better tool for very abstract interaction in the long run.  For instance, if you are building an app that uses OpenAI to book hotels and flights by chatting with a bot, chances are someday either ChatGPT or something by Microsoft or Google will do that and make your puny little business totally obsolete.  Secondly, relying too heavily on SDKs like the OpenAI one is, in my opinion, a waste of time.  You are better off with the flexibility of making direct calls to their REST API.<p>However, should you be adding compilers to your toolchain?  IMO, any time you add a compiler, you are not only liable to add a bunch of unnecessary complexity but you&#x27;re making yourself <i>dependent</i> upon some tool.  What&#x27;s particulry bad about the author&#x27;s example is that it&#x27;s arguably completely unnecessary for the task at hand.  What&#x27;s so bad about React or Svelte that you want to use a component cross-compiler?  That&#x27;s a cool compiler, but it sounds like a complete waste of time and another thing to learn for building web apps.  I think every tool has its place, but just &quot;add a compiler, bruh&quot; is terrible advice for the target audience of this  blog post.<p>IMO, the final message of the article should be to create the most efficient toolchain for what you want to achieve.  Throwing tools at a task doesn&#x27;t necessarily add value, nor does doing what everyone else is doing necessarily add value; and either can be counterproductive in not just working on LLM app integration but software engineering in general.<p>Kudos to the author for sharing their insight, though.</div><br/><div id="38225862" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38225862" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">goalieca</span><span>|</span><a href="#38222440">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38222702">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38225862">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38225862">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; run.

This shift raises fascinating questions about the future of creativity and the evolving role of the human in the creative process.<p>My key message is this: &quot;So what if your business heavily relies on OpenAI models?&quot; The unique prompts you craft hold intrinsic value. They don&#x27;t diminish the time, expertise, and knowledge you invest in shaping the results. Take designing a 3D chair using an AI system, for instance: achieving optimal results hinges on your ability to precisely describe what you need, a skill that itself depends on your understanding and knowledge of design. In this context, delving into classics and broadening your educational horizons is more crucial than ever. It equips you with the nuanced articulation needed to harness AI&#x27;s potential fully.<p>P.S. An AI model assisted me in crafting this comment, but the experiences and insights I&#x27;ve shared are my own, as is the majority of the words in this text. The advantage I gain from AI is the better articulation of my ideas. This tool is akin to a dictionary, a grammar checking tool, or a system that translates my native tongue into English.</div><br/><div id="38228192" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38228192" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway290</span><span>|</span><a href="#38228146">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38228167">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38228192">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38228192">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; It&#x27;s not that AI executed 90% of the work<p>Obviously not.

I think Zendesk (ticketing software for customer support) already has some AI available.

How will their system automatically decide whether all those should be separate images&#x2F;layers or one composted image? To do so they trained a model that examines web pages and &lt;img&gt; tags and see&#x27;s their location. Basically, they are under the assumption that their data has good decisions and you can learn in which cases people use multiple vs one image.<p>I could be misunderstanding :)</div><br/></div></div><div id="38224780" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38224780" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mnutt</span><span>|</span><a href="#38222275">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38222518">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38224866">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38224780">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38224780">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They have a known system that can go from specified coordinates to images in the form of puppeteer (chromium) and so they can run it on lots of websites to generate [coordinates, output image] pairs to use for training data.

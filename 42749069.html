That&#x27;s because the queen bee&#x27;s stinger has no barbs, and the reason for that is that the queen must not die easily, and she <i>must</i> use her stinger, so if she&#x27;s going to survive at all her stinger has to not have barbs.  The queen almost certainly has to use her stinger when she exits her cocoon: to kill ther other queens that are about to hatch or have hatched already.  She also has to possibly use her stinger when she goes out to mate (though she does go with attendants who will defend her if attacked).<p>I was surprised not to find mention of this in TFA.<p>&gt; A honey bee dies when it stings you because its stinger is covered in barbs, causing its abdomen to get ripped out when it tries to fly away. And surviving with your guts spilling out everywhere is pretty bloody hard.<p>There&#x27;s another interesting detail here: when the worker tries to fly off after stinging, she has to try <i>really</i> hard because the barbs hold the stinger in place, and trying hard causes two things to happen:<p><pre><code>  - noise that attracts other workers
    to attack the same creature
  
  - spreading of the dying bee&#x27;s
    distress pheromones that also
    attract other workers to sting
    the same creature
</code></pre>
So when you get stung by a bee near other bees you will be in trouble.  That&#x27;s how you go from one sting to hundreds.  And hundreds is enough to kill a human.  That&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t go near a hive without protection.  Being in or near a swarm is safer than being near a hive: the bees in a swarm don&#x27;t have much (larvae, honey) to protect, so they don&#x27;t attack.</div><br/><div id="42752601" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42752601" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cryptonector</span><span>|</span><a href="#42751483">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42754617">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42752601">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42752601">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">BTW, when I get stung, if the stinger doesn&#x27;t get stuck I sometimes don&#x27;t even notice till much later -- this happens when I get stung through my gloves.  If the stinger does get stuck in my skin the first thing I notice is the buzzing of the bee that stung me.  The frequency of the buzzing of the bee that stung me and that is trying to rip off the stinger is absolutely terrifying because I know what comes next: a dozen more bees will flock right to where the one bee stung me and will all try to sting me, and since the one bee was able to it might be the case that her sisters will succeed as well.  That buzzing spreads her injury pheromones, and the frequency of its sound also acts as a very loud and clear signal to her sisters.  The buzzing lasts about 1 second or less; the pain from the sting comes a second or two later.  It takes her sisters about 1 to 2 seconds to find the bee that stings successfully.  Getting stung by a dozen bees at once is panic inducing, and the swelling that will create will take two weeks to subside.  I was stung 13 times at once one time, and 5 times another time.  It&#x27;s no fun.</div><br/><div id="42754365" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42754365" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jimmaswell</span><span>|</span><a href="#42751483">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42752601">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42754617">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42754365">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42754365">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why are bee stings such a common occurance to you?

Thus reproduction doesn&#x27;t produce perfect clones, &quot;mutations&quot;  take place. This is largely because there are so many different ways to derive one individual out of two individuals&#x27; complex genitic material. This is all a feature. This is why individuals have unique characteristics. Think about how different humans are from each other, even though we&#x27;re all <i>humans</i>. This same thing applies to all creatures. Every individual is different. Those who have &quot;disabilities&quot; (disadvantages in their context) are less likely to survive. So those with advantageous traits survive and pass their traits on through reproduction, making those specific traits more prevalent.<p>The answer to &quot;why didn&#x27;t x evolve to do y?&quot; is usually just that that specific mutation might have never occurred or caught on randomly. This is also why different species do different things differently. It&#x27;s all random mutations. Some were beneficial in their context and environment so those who had them were more likely to survive and pass those traits along.<p>It&#x27;s not that &quot;the objective of life is to survive&quot; in a spiritual sense, it&#x27;s that life randomly happens and some of it survives and it makes more life like itself. In some ways, I suppose the purpose of life is to create more life. Systems that replicate themselves successfully survive. We call these &quot;life&quot;.

And if the same gene is in a kin, then it can favor enhancing the survival of kin that carry copies of itself.

Assuming honey bees&#x27; genetic variation is not much more extreme than human variation, we&#x27;re talking about 99.5% vs. 99.75% sharing, which sounds more like an explanation of why altruism would be preferred in general rather than uniquely affecting bees.<p>The article does eventually circle around to acknowledge this, but it&#x27;s easy to miss and very underdeveloped compared to the discussion of kin selection: &quot;So why do bees die when they sting you?

There are obvious answers, we make tradeoffs to improve performance early in life at the expense of long term function, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like the reproductive benefits of caring for a grandchild that only shares a 1&#x2F;4 of your DNA necessarily tips the scales of selection towards longevity. Especially when, in theory, men remain fertile their entire lives and thus there should have always been some selection for longer life spans. You would expect the reproductive benefits of a 70 year old caring for their own child might be at least comparable to 70 year old caring for a grandchild.</div><br/><div id="42754587" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42754587" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">EdwardDiego</span><span>|</span><a href="#42749819">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42749963">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42749990">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42754587">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42754587">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Obviously because Tree-of-Life didn&#x27;t survive on Earth, so we could never achieve our final form.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pak_Protector" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pak_Protector</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42749990" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42749990" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lcnPylGDnU4H9OF</span><span>|</span><a href="#42749819">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42749963">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42754587">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42750580">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42749990">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42749990">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; why don&#x27;t we live indefinitely in the first place?<p>It doesn’t seem to be necessary for the survival of our genes.<p>&gt; You would expect the reproductive benefits of a 70 year old caring for their own child might be at least comparable to 70 year old caring for a grandchild.<p>They’re competing with 20-30 year-olds with better physical fitness for a mate.

Ever watch bees?, bugs?, other things, up close and in the danger zone?   I do.  A bee&#x27;s stinger will embed in you, or me, and then the venom sack rips right out of the bee and it is possible to watch the venom sack pump venom without the bee
itself attached anymore.
 I was attending my mother in her herb garden and commented on there bieng honey bees around, which she disputed, so I caught one, and held its legs
while it tried to sting me, and showed her this,
but my hands are so callused, that its stinger would not go in, then I let it go.

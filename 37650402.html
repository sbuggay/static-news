It turns out this is one of the favorite attacks by &quot;SBS proponents&quot; against those who challenge the scientific reliability of the diagnosis. We are called &quot;denialists&quot; and we&#x27;re accused of &quot;denying the existence of child abuse&quot; (?). Parents in my organization (Adikia) who face false allegations of abuse are said to be in &quot;denial&quot; of their own abusive behavior. This story line appears to be quite credible and powerful within the medical and judicial communities.<p>Here&#x27;s one among thousands of examples, from a really terrible paper by one such powerful SBS proponent here in France [1] (another of his papers was actually retracted this year [2]).<p>&quot;Fake news 11: the caretakers’ denial is sincere<p>Clinicians and defenders can become intoxicated by the denials of parents suffering the agony of having their child in dire condition, and at the same time being grilled for their possible responsibility. The mental mechanisms of self-denial are well-known to psychiatrists. A perpetrator, after a violent burst, and faced with its terrible consequences, can experience a dissociation mechanism similar to witnesses of catastrophes, dissociation being understood as “a break between the memory, the perception, the consciousness and the identity…when faced with unbearable feelings”. Sincere denial easily elicits compassion from the medical staff as well as defenders, a natural response which is enhanced by professional training. Some authors have documented with functional imaging the sincerity of denial in a case of convicted child abuse and concluded that the sincerity of denial is not a criterion for innocence.&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s00381-021-05357-8" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s00381-021-05357-8</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s00381-023-05889-1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s00381-023-05889-1</a></div><br/><div id="37684257" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37684257" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">btilly</span><span>|</span><a href="#37669629">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37680647">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37680869">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37684257">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37684257">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve always called this &quot;cognitive dissonance&quot;, but it is the same thing that <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;identity.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;identity.html</a> talks about.

All were admitted and diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. ... The second part of his study involved a hospital administration challenging Rosenhan to send pseudopatients to its facility, whose staff asserted that they would be able to detect the pseudopatients. Rosenhan agreed, and in the following weeks 41 out of 193 new patients were identified as potential pseudopatients, with 19 of these receiving suspicion from at least one psychiatrist and one other staff member. Rosenhan sent no pseudopatients to the hospital.&quot;<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rosenhan_experiment" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rosenhan_experiment</a></div><br/><div id="37685333" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37685333" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jdietrich</span><span>|</span><a href="#37669629">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37678481">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37680101">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37685333">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37685333">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In fairness, psychiatry is totally different today than in 1973. The obvious change is that a huge reduction in the number of inpatient beds, combined with increasing demand, have created huge pressures to admit only the most obviously unwell patients and discharge them as quickly as possible. Most psychiatric inpatient stays are just a few days - just enough to get a patient through a crisis, revise their medication and (hopefully, but not always) arrange for appropriate outpatient care and support. The downtown of most US cities is a testament to the fact that, in 2023, under-treatment of severe mental illness is a far greater concern than over-treatment.<p>On an ontological level, psychiatry made a huge leap forward in 1980 with the publication of the DSM-III. One of the core goals of the DSM-III was to address the concerns raised in the Rosenhan experiment, making diagnostic criteria more robust and reliable. While there are still many controversies and shortcomings - most prominently regarding the over-diagnosis of less severe conditions - we now have a suite of reliable, validated diagnostic instruments for most serious conditions. For the most part, we aren&#x27;t diagnosing or treating patients based on the gut instinct of an individual practitioner; we&#x27;re using objective criteria with proven inter-relater reliability, guided by the over-arching principle that, regardless of symptomatology, no-one is mentally ill unless a) they&#x27;re experiencing distress and&#x2F;or b) they&#x27;re causing significant harm to others. There are many shortcomings in how psychiatric medicine is practised today, but the era of locking people up just because they behave strangely is definitively over.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37680101" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37680101" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dekhn</span><span>|</span><a href="#37669629">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37678481">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37685333">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37671014">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37680101">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37680101">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My favorite control experiment!

One of my family members was a lawyer for the regional Children&#x27;s Aid, and I worked for him for a few years. Another family member was a child protection social worker for two decades, but retired early because they felt the organization didn&#x27;t prioritize the welfare of children (as is their mandate) but rather the needs of the organization or (perhaps more realistically) the needs of their own careers.<p>MANY social workers feel this way. They got into the field out of a genuine concern for the well-being of the most vulnerable members of our society, and instead found themselves dealing with politics (both real and office).<p>I&#x27;m not sure how it is in other countries, but in my region, they actually appoint a lawyer for the child. This is great, but it also tells you a lot about what everyone else&#x27;s priorities are that children need their own lawyers:<p>(1) Parents want their kids back, of course. Not all parents are fit to get them back. But their lawyers fight for the return of their kids regardless of circumstances or reasons for their removal.<p>(2) Child protection agencies are under constant attack, so at the executive level, they lose sight of the individual kids and are instead worried about the needs of the organization and public relations.<p>(3) The social workers themselves are handcuffed to do anything about it and have to follow procedure, even if they can see it plainly that the procedure is not in the best interests of the child.<p>(4) Police want nothing to do with any of it and are quick to wash their hands of these situations.<p>(5) The children&#x27;s lawyer somehow has to represent the needs of the child, which may place them at odds with their own clients (the kids).<p>(6) Activist groups will generally support the parents blindly, because by law, for the privacy of the children, the only parties listed above who can publicly speak about any given case are the parents themselves. So you can only ever hear one side of the argument. That&#x27;s right: If a father, for example, sexually abuses his kids and as a result has them removed, he&#x27;s free to say just about anything he likes about the matter, without ever acknowledging that he&#x27;s a child molester. The other parties can&#x27;t say a thing about this.<p>As a result, it&#x27;s impossible, as a member of the public, to ever know whether it was appropriate or not that the children were removed from the care of their parents. I happen to know, from first-hand experience, that it&#x27;s a mixed bag: Some parents shouldn&#x27;t be allowed anywhere near any child ever, much less their own. Others are victims of a system gone haywire. And we, the concerned public, can&#x27;t have an informed discussion about any of it.<p>All in all, it transforms child protection into a game of who-has-the-best-lawyers rather than trying to do what&#x27;s right for the kids. Is it any wonder so many kids end up traumatized by this system?</div><br/></div></div><div id="37680271" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37680271" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">michael1999</span><span>|</span><a href="#37669629">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37680346">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37671834">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37680271">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37680271">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Baby-stealing is a deep drive.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37671834" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37671834" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sam_goody</span><span>|</span><a href="#37669629">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37680271">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37679049">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37671834">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37671834">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; It’s just incredible the injustice that can be done in the name of protecting children<p>Whatever it is:<p>- If it&#x27;s in the name of protecting the children, odds are it is not justice.<p>- If it is not justice, at some point the excuse will be to protect the children</div><br/><div id="37672579" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37672579" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smolder</span><span>|</span><a href="#37669629">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37671834">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37679049">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37672579">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37672579">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; - If it is not justice, at some point the excuse will be to protect the children<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a very solid maxim.

There are no algorithms and the guidelines rarely perfectly fit the situation a case worker is given. Keep this in mind. CPS is horrifically under funded meaning that intelligent and competent staff readily leave the field for better paying gigs.<p>The biggest problem I see with foster care at large is the rampant classism, sexism, racism, and other isms. The providers tend to be solidly middle class degree bearing people who have no personal connection to primary instigating factors of foster care involvement. Namely and typically presenting cross generationally: poverty, crimes of despair or desperation, and  trauma whether that be internal or external to the family unit or community such as neighborhood violence, caregiver assault, or tragic loss.<p>It easy for providers to casually profile incoming children and their families as poor uneducated violent predacious drug dealing junkies. Providers are given extreme control over the entire family and their extended relations and use this power to coerce whatever behavior they desire out of the people. If the provider dislikes the family they have a lot of tools to inflict suffering on them and oppositely they have a lot of tools to assist families and keep them together.<p>Honestly, the entire system is such a god damn mess that it should be rebuilt with the same level of distrust of staff that they can exercise against families.<p>Perhaps the most pressing single metric to focus may be the foster to prison pipeline.<p>Sorry for the meandering post, bookcases could be filled with anecdotes and descriptions of the flaws in these systems. In general, I think the failure of child protection agencies reflects the decay in America at large. I could point to stuff like broken family units or loss of religions community but I’m not dog whistling here. Stable healthy nurturing familial units of any relation are obviously better but man in the house rules and other racist&#x2F;classist measures caused more harm. I’m also vehemently opposed to all major organized religions that are regularly used to justify war and protect child sex predators. Perhaps the collapse of American industry and slow erosion of social safety nets has hastened the social collapse. Perhaps the internet had instigated the collapse of communal organizations. Perhaps winner take all government enforced monopoly capitalism is the cause. Perhaps it was the theft of 50,000,000,000.00 from the bottom 99 by the 1% that lead to this. Regardless, the solution is not going to be found in rebuilding foster care when our social fabric is rotten.<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1002&#x2F;sop2.10" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1002&#x2F;sop2.10</a><p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crimlawpractitioner.org&#x2F;post&#x2F;the-foster-care-to-prison-pipeline-a-road-to-incarceration#:~:text=The%20foster%20care%2Dto%2Dprison%20pipeline%20refers%20to%20the%20funneling,through%20arrest%2C%20conviction%20or%20detention" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crimlawpractitioner.org&#x2F;post&#x2F;the-foster-care-to-...</a>.<p>3. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nlihc.org&#x2F;resource&#x2F;study-examines-man-house-rules-voucher-program" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nlihc.org&#x2F;resource&#x2F;study-examines-man-house-rules-vo...</a><p>4. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5888024&#x2F;50-trillion-income-inequality-america&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5888024&#x2F;50-trillion-income-inequality-ameri...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37667150" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37667150" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Justsignedup</span><span>|</span><a href="#37669629">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37667435">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37667150">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37667150">[42 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The worst part here is: He spent months researching 500 medical papers to even realize this was a problem.

Per the Hippocratic Oath, doctors need to understand the implications of making reports like this and only do so in cases where there isn&#x27;t reasonable doubt or plausible explanations other than abuse.

Those are markers of serious domestic violence and abuse, but since the doc knows the parent, and the parent has a sorta reasonable explanation, fine.<p>No. The doctor reports, then the parents get investigated. Sorry it sucks, but the point to fix is the people interacting with the family at the point of investigation, not the report by an MD, because unfortunately the MD is going to lean towards not reporting until it is too late.</div><br/><div id="37681395" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37681395" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">danenania</span><span>|</span><a href="#37667435">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37681064">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37683804">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37681395">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37681395">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That would be fine if the investigations were fair and followed basic principles of jurisprudence like &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot;, but it&#x27;s plain to see that kids are being separated based on very flimsy evidence.<p>In my book, a doctor doesn&#x27;t get to absolve themselves of responsibility by saying &quot;just following orders&quot; and that it&#x27;s the investigative system that needs to be fixed. If they know the system is broken, it&#x27;s both immoral and a deep betrayal of trust for them to report people without strong evidence.<p>Almost any injury can be framed as possible evidence of abuse. Parents shouldn&#x27;t have to be afraid that taking their kids to the hospital after an injury will get  them taken away. The vast majority of injuries are <i>not</i> from abuse, so a system with a low bar for evidence is going to end up with more false positives than cases of abuse. This is exacerbated by the fact that abusers, for obvious reasons, are often going to avoid getting medical care for the kids they abuse.<p>If your reasoning were applied more broadly, we&#x27;d put anyone accused of a crime, or of even planning a crime, in prison immediately, since otherwise crimes will occur (with people hurt&#x2F;killed) that could have been prevented.

Apologizes.<p>The biggest problems with Medical data is that 1) incredibly small scale data is collected to make assertions, 2) the data is horrendously de-normalized<p>In Radiology, a common validation approach is have radiologists review cases on the order of 250 studies to make assessments about a radiology product. This is considered the gold standard for FDA. Look into it more, vaccines, treatments. The sample sizes are fucking tiny.<p>The statistical assertion is that these relatively small samples capture the variation sufficiently to demonstrate efficacy across devices, treatments. These are then extrapolated to the US and wider populations. Do you believe that this is rigorously true?<p>The rationale underpinning this is simply practicality. You cannot get thousands (or hundreds of thousands) of patients&#x2F;doctors&#x2F;etc to get a strong signal and confidence. For drugs, it&#x27;s super hard, but for devices and software interventions, it way easier to get data.<p>That brings us to the second big problem: the data structure is completely highly varied and denormalized.<p>1) From a pure structure point of view, it&#x27;s basically free text fields that doctors sporadically fill.<p>2) From a underlying truth point of view, each hospital across the world has different protocols for care delivery. A histopathological FNA procedure might have a completely different meaning in CA, NY, or EU. This might simply be because of workflow, timeline, or just people using the words wrong.<p>What I mean with AI+Sensors:<p>AI doesn&#x27;t need to solve the problem of intuition around medical problems. The biggest impact will likely come from the relatively mundane task of simply structuring and normalizing the data. Sensors simply help to generate more data<p>To be more concrete, you don&#x27;t want (and shouldn&#x27;t trust) this:<p>Prompt: &quot;Please diagnose this person&quot;<p>You want this:<p>Prompt: &quot;Here is 100 TB of data from 100 different hospitals each with different workflows and patients for histopathology.

Both of those will make the kids much worse than normal and thus much harder to care for.<p>Kids that are close to normal but end up in foster care often end up adopted fairly quick - there are plenty of families who want a kid but not their own (I personally know several people with genetics they don&#x27;t want to pass on - there are other good reasons to not want someone else&#x27;s kids) - but they will try to select a kid who is going to be easy to raise thus kids who will end up normal don&#x27;t spend much time in foster care.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37676667" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37676667" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rightbyte</span><span>|</span><a href="#37670961">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37673013">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37674532">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37675004">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37676667">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37676667">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I meant that protesting the bad process, increasing risk of having your child taken away, is good for everyone else except you and your child.

After nearly 24 hours of horrific labor she spiked an extremely high fever and they had to do a c-section, making us feel like failures. They found that our daughter wouldn’t have made it otherwise.<p>We were castigated because my wife took medicines that entered her milk and were made to feel like failures for considering not breast feeding. She had to pump milk at five AM before she took any medicine to minimize the exposure to the extremely toxic medicine that would be present in her milk. She didn’t produce enough milk and we were at wits end. The nurses and doctors at the hospital were unhelpful and treated us like abusers. When we went to our local pediatrician he laughed and said entire generations were raised on formula and to stop killing ourselves. It was the best advice we were ever given.<p>Likewise my daughter couldn’t sleep on her back. She wailed every night. I read everything I could find on SIDS and I realized the correlation for back sleeping was very weak - almost statistically irrelevant - and even then the prevalence of SIDS was very low. Yet I knew for 100% my daughter wasn’t sleeping. I knew if I told anyone I would be lectured, and I worried might even be reported.  The after nearly a week of not sleeping I flipped her over one night with my heart pounding. She fell asleep immediately. She didn’t die.<p>She’s nine now and an incredible athlete and has a sharp and brilliant mind. None of the doomsday stuff occurred.  No autism, no weak immune system, no weight problems, intellectual deficiency, or all the other warnings we were given about c-section, formula, or belly sleeping.  Over the years I continued to read the research and there’s basically nothing compelling about any of this advice, at least not at the level of stridency parents experience.</div><br/><div id="37671629" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37671629" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Fire-Dragon-DoL</span><span>|</span><a href="#37671024">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37683012">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37671629">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37671629">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I didn&#x27;t know that about sids.

Further, dogs do not dispense reliable medical advice. The op is a press release for a textbook covering this topic in what looks like excruciating detail from a wide variety of angles. I doubt a superior citation exists.<p>B) Beyond that, my understanding is that once a child is past the infant phase where they cannot support their own head, they’re fine. Humans are not all that delicate. Bumps and falls are inevitable, I don’t see how we would have seen success as a species if the risk were outsized. And I guess we’ve been around for a while by now.<p>C) TFA does mention this a little but it is split across a wide gap and is not the focus. I pulled the two quotes I think are relevant below.<p>&gt; And yet, although subdural and retinal hemorrhage may be caused by non-accidental trauma, especially when impact is involved, they simply are not specific for it: indeed, it has been demonstrated that a wide range of accidental events and medical conditions are plausible alternative causes. Particularly fragile infants may sustain severe head injuries following minor household falls. Others may suffer from genetic conditions, metabolic disorders, blood clotting abnormalities, or infections.<p>&gt; On the other hand, there exist dozens of documented cases of witness reports of shaking, videotaped shakings, and spontaneous admissions of shaking, but without subdural and retinal hemorrhage. In fact, there is virtually no known case of a reliably-documented event of violent shaking without impact of a healthy baby resulting in isolated subdural and retinal hemorrhage (additional markers of trauma would be expected in such cases). In contrast, there have been numerous cases of videotaped or witnessed short falls resulting in these very medical findings, considered “impossible” by the shaking hypothesis.<p>So it’s like they say: it’s not the fall that gets you, it’s when you land.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37685881" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37685881" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">emodendroket</span><span>|</span><a href="#37670499">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37671276">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37671193">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37685881">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37685881">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It is pretty hard for such injuries to occur with the level of movement you&#x27;re taking about, especially with a child old enough to support their own head.

Particularly fragile infants may sustain severe head injuries following minor household falls. Others may suffer from genetic conditions, metabolic disorders, blood clotting abnormalities, or infections.<p>&gt; But in practice, extremely few medical conditions are checked for and “excluded” before concluding a diagnosis of abuse – the great majority are not checked for at all. Very often, abuse is diagnosed “by default”, because no known alternative explanation was found (or even actively sought). This is extremely dangerous, as it seems to indicate that no further medical discovery need ever be made in the future.<p>&gt; Overall, the clinical literature supporting the shaking hypothesis suffers from a number of severe methodological shortcomings. The main issue is circular reasoning. It is only in a small minority of “shaken baby” cases that actual shaking has been observed by independent witnesses, videotaped, or spontaneously confessed before police interrogation. Far more often, shaking is “inferred” after the observation of subdural and retinal hemorrhage in infants who are brought to the hospital by parents or caregivers. Physicians interpret these types of bleeding as markers of violent trauma. When asked about these findings, parents and caregivers generally do not provide “acceptable explanations” – but the only “acceptable explanations” today apart from shaking are multistory falls and high speed motor vehicle accidents. This being so, it is considered that parents and caregivers must be lying when they report non-traumatic events such as a sudden collapse, an unexplained respiratory arrest, or a minor fall – even though this happens in case after case</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37671369" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37671369" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">boxed</span><span>|</span><a href="#37672832">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37685400">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37671369">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37671369">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Here in Sweden I had to watch a video warning against baby shaking when my wife was pregnant with my first child.

Many parents in the US who opt for a home birth are likely unaware of how underqualified many American midwives are compared to their international counterparts to respond to an obstetric emergency.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37684953" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37684953" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Fire-Dragon-DoL</span><span>|</span><a href="#37671523">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37676527">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37680585">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37671982">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37684953">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37684953">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m glad we were given an option but only based on comfort level, not because of better safety.

Maybe that happens in a few cases. However, the reality in my experience is much more complex (and interesting). This is basically an instance of a coerced internalized false confession, according to the classification by Saul Kassin [1].<p>Let&#x27;s imagine a mother seeing her baby who suddenly stops breathing. Panicked, she gently takes her baby under the armpits: &quot;Please wake up!&quot;. The baby is brought to the hospital, doctors find subdural and retinal hemorrhage, she is accused of shaking her baby.<p>At the police station, investigators are told by doctors that SBS is 100% certain, that the baby was shaken just before collapsing. They keep pressuring the mother, who swears there was no shaking, no trauma, no accident, no short fall, absolutely nothing. The baby <i>just collapsed</i> with no triggering event. This is a story that is repeated again and again by most parents and caregivers who are living this situation.<p>This is such a dramatic and emotional situation for parents and caregivers that many will actually doubt their own memory (that actually happened to me, briefly, and yet I never went through a tough police interrogation in custody). Anyway, innocent and sincere persons will actually try to find rational explanations. They will retrospectively try to find any sort of mild movement of the baby&#x27;s head that could resemble shaking. Police officers will say what they&#x27;re told (which is actually true): mild shaking will not cause this, only extremely violent ones will.<p>At one point during the interrogation, the idea will be brought up that, perhaps, the mother accidentally shook the baby <i>after</i> the collapse as a resuscitation attempt. In the end, it may well be the only rational explanation? The mother may even end up believing that she involuntarily harmed her own child while trying to save him, and that will be the charge brought by the prosecution that leads the mother to trial.<p>In reality, this gesture was likely to be far too mild to do any serious injury to the child. However, in this particular context, it may well be the only explanation that could be accepted by both the investigators and the defendant. In these cases, it&#x27;s more likely that the child collapsed due to some undetected medical condition leading to a respiratory arrest (akin to what happens in SIDS).<p>I&#x27;ve seen this pattern over and over again. It has actually be well studied by psychologists in slightly more general contexts. The book contains 2 chapters (by Keith Findley, Richard Leo, Deborah Davis) on the extremely important issue of SBS confessions, as this is basically the main evidence of the diagnosis today.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;False_confession#Coerced_internalized_confessions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;False_confession#Coerced_inter...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37671217" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37671217" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pcblues</span><span>|</span><a href="#37675571">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37673549">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37671217">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37671217">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is a problem with responsibility.

He&#x27;s 2e -- gifted and learning disabled -- and has a serious medical condition associated with being very underweight.<p>I put him in preschool to get him to talk. He could use sentences but wasn&#x27;t.<p>At the start of kindergarten,  first, second and third grade, I spoke with the teacher, explained he was difficult, let them know I welcomed communication on any issue. They were thrilled and relieved. Parents are often part of the problem.<p>By fourth grade, my son was no longer obviously &quot;the weird kid.&quot; That teacher reported me to the social worker for letting him know up front my child was difficult and please don&#x27;t hesitate to discuss things with me.<p>The social worker called me, we talked for a bit. She knew both my kids. Laughed it off as a silly misunderstanding. Months later, his teacher let me know he did eventually get the memo that my child had quirky interpretations of social things.<p>After my son finally got a proper diagnosis for his medical issue, he gained twenty pounds in one year and this did wonders for his social skills. Then he lost five pounds.<p>He still felt better than he ever had and neither of us were concerned.  His medical team implied I was in danger of being reported to children&#x27;s services as an abusive mother.<p>Because his condition predisposes people to being very underweight, pediatric clinics for the condition routinely include a dietitian and yet the standard recommended diet is &quot;junk food&quot; because it&#x27;s high salt, high fat, high calorie and cheap.<p>I had not been feeding him junk food, but I dutifully put a big bowl of snacks in the middle of the coffee table. He regained 2.5 pounds, they decided that was adequate and didn&#x27;t need more follow up visits.<p>We got home and, with no longer being under threat of being turned in as a neglectful or abusive parent, the first thing he did was hand me the bowl and tell me &quot;We are <i>never</i> doing this again. I feel terrible!&quot;<p>We resumed feeding him a high quality diet in line with the high fat, high salt, high calorie recommendations.<p>It&#x27;s awful to be so protective of your children and be accused of abusing them based on no real evidence.

Humans are not all that delicate. Bumps and falls are inevitable, I don’t see how we would have seen success as a species if the risk were outsized. And I guess we’ve been around for a while by now.<p>C) TFA does mention this a little but it is split across a wide gap and is not the focus. I pulled the two quotes I think are relevant below.<p>&gt; And yet, although subdural and retinal hemorrhage may be caused by non-accidental trauma, especially when impact is involved, they simply are not specific for it: indeed, it has been demonstrated that a wide range of accidental events and medical conditions are plausible alternative causes. Particularly fragile infants may sustain severe head injuries following minor household falls.

After nearly 24 hours of horrific labor she spiked an extremely high fever and they had to do a c-section, making us feel like failures. They found that our daughter wouldn’t have made it otherwise.<p>We were castigated because my wife took medicines that entered her milk and were made to feel like failures for considering not breast feeding. She had to pump milk at five AM before she took any medicine to minimize the exposure to the extremely toxic medicine that would be present in her milk. She didn’t produce enough milk and we were at wits end. The nurses and doctors at the hospital were unhelpful and treated us like abusers. When we went to our local pediatrician he laughed and said entire generations were raised on formula and to stop killing ourselves. It was the best advice we were ever given.<p>Likewise my daughter couldn’t sleep on her back. She wailed every night. I read everything I could find on SIDS and I realized the correlation for back sleeping was very weak - almost statistically irrelevant - and even then the prevalence of SIDS was very low. Yet I knew for 100% my daughter wasn’t sleeping. I knew if I told anyone I would be lectured, and I worried might even be reported.  The after nearly a week of not sleeping I flipped her over one night with my heart pounding. She fell asleep immediately. She didn’t die.<p>She’s nine now and an incredible athlete and has a sharp and brilliant mind. None of the doomsday stuff occurred.  No autism, no weak immune system, no weight problems, intellectual deficiency, or all the other warnings we were given about c-section, formula, or belly sleeping.

Unfortunately, while this obviously protects some children, there are adverse effects such as an enormous waste of human and financial resources to unsubstantiated reports [2].<p>To quote Wikipedia (this is more generally about hotline calls but this also affects healthcare professionals):<p>&quot;There are approximately 3.6 million calls each year nationwide (..) affecting on average 1 out of 10 U.S. families with children under the age of 18 each year (there are 32.2 million such families). (...) Of those substantiated, over half are minor situations and many are situations where the worker thinks something may happen in the future.<p>Each year, approximately 85% of hotline calls either do not warrant investigation or are not substantiated. Approximately 78% of all investigations are unsubstantiated and approximately 22% are substantiated, with around 9% where &quot;alternative responses&quot; are offered in some states, which have a focus on working with the family to address issues rather than confirming maltreatment.&quot;<p>On this topic, I highly recommend &quot;Take Care of Maya&quot; on Netflix.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mandatory_reporting_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mandatory_reporting_in_the_Uni...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu&#x2F;issues&#x2F;50&#x2F;1&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;50-1_Eichner.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu&#x2F;issues&#x2F;50&#x2F;1&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;50-1_...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Factitious_disorder_imposed_on_another" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Factitious_disorder_imposed_on...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37670666" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37670666" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">switch007</span><span>|</span><a href="#37670573">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37671488">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37668702">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37670666">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37670666">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Definitely a UK thing too.

Gigantic medical institutions were moving at a glacial pace and were making proclamations literally months behind the state of the research.  In order to conserve masks, propaganda was put out that masks were only effective if you were a medical professional, and the most common way I saw this rationalised was that the general public was simply too stupid to wear a mask in a sanitary way.  So I proceeded to wear a mask in a sanitary way.  Then after a few months mask stocks started to pile up so propagandists THEN pronounced that more science was conducted and masks were actually effective for everybody!<p>That positive outcome aside, what other people saw was that the younger people got, the lower the risks of COVID, and the higher the risks of getting vaccinated.  In fact, it seemed from the numbers (This is for the earlier strains of COVID), that for certain populations (young people who lived like hermits, in other words, hacker news readers) it could be on a selfish individual basis, be irrational to get the COVID vaccine.  The risk from myocarditis could actually outweigh the risk of COVID itself.  It was however, always in the collective interest for as many people to get vaccinated as possible, to reduce the transmission of COVID, and reduce the consequent strain on medical resources and the direct&#x2F;indirect deaths this caused.  Public health institutions did not get into this nuance, because it wasn&#x27;t in the collective interest, so they just told everybody the vaccine was good for you.  I proceeded to get vaccinated, and the main person I held discussions with did not, after both drawing the exact same scientific conclusion.

The trauma was so intense that their family didn&#x27;t survive and they eventually divorced (that&#x27;s unfortunately the fate of many, if not most families).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37667821" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37667821" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hammock</span><span>|</span><a href="#37666958">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37667580">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37667821">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37667821">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">TLDR:<p>There are issues with the way&#x2F;how quickly we diagnose shaken baby syndrome without exploring other potential diagnoses, and with how severely&#x2F;quickly we take kids away from their parents once we &quot;think&quot; we have a shaken baby</div><br/><div id="37670769" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37670769" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pests</span><span>|</span><a href="#37667821">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37669873">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37670769">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37670769">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  we diagnose shaken baby syndrome without exploring other potential diagnoses<p>It&#x27;s more that &#x27;shaken baby syndrome&#x27; is caused by more things than just a shaken baby (and evidence that shaking does not cause it even.)<p>&gt; the more neutral and objective term of “retino-dural hemorrhage of infancy” (RDHI).</div><br/></div></div><div id="37669873" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37669873" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bluSCALE4</span><span>|</span><a href="#37667821">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37670769">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37671353">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37669873">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37669873">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This doesn&#x27;t do it justice.

It may affect 2-3% of all babies in the US and other developed countries, and the rate may be 10x or more higher in other countries.<p>I think it&#x27;s reasonable to say that billions of babies may have been shaken in the past, yet the vast majority (of the order of 99.9% or even much more? [2]) are not diagnosed with shaken baby syndrome, since this diagnosis has an incidence of ~1&#x2F;3,000 among children &lt; 12 months in developed countries. In the countries where the incidence of shaking appears to be &gt;50%, it is striking to note that the SBS diagnosis actually does not exist, i.e. doctors are not trained to diagnose it.<p>On the other hand, actual cases of severe inflicted head injuries probably affect &lt; 1&#x2F;10,000 children &lt; 12 months, and I think most of them involve external evidence of trauma. Those that do not probably involve extreme forms of shaking far beyond what most of the billions of &quot;shaken babies&quot; sustain.<p>In other words, I&#x27;ve come to the likely conclusion that the intersection of babies who are effectively shaken, and babies who are labelled with &quot;shaken baby syndrome&quot;, is an abysmal proportion of the first set, and a small proportion of the second.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0749379708000639" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S074937970...</a><p>[2] Excerpt from the paper above: &quot;the ratio of children hospitalized or dying from inflicted neurotrauma compared to the numbers of reported shaken children may be estimated at 1 to 152.&quot;</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37667580" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37667580" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ClumsyPilot</span><span>|</span><a href="#37667821">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37667038">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37667580">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37667580">[73 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">trully unbelievable, i lose faith in thr justice system day by day</div><br/><div id="37668348" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37668348" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Waterluvian</span><span>|</span><a href="#37667580">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37668000">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37668348">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37668348">[38 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Nothing shook my faith in the <i>medical</i> system more than having kids.<p>Holy cow is modern medicine still as smugly wrong as it’s always been.

Get that stuff out of the way - get to know some different people, different ways of being, different dynamics in sex &#x2F; friendship &#x2F; beliefs. Get to know yourself, mainly - figure out the person you are. Because you sure as shit don&#x27;t know when you&#x27;re 16, and you probably don&#x27;t really know until you&#x27;re 20 or probably even 25.<p>I&#x27;d say the same about getting out there and socialising - drink some drink, smoke some weed, take some mushrooms, travel the world. Don&#x27;t get stuck in one thing straight away - in any direction, whether that&#x27;s location or relationship or job or misc life situation.<p>Obviously everyone&#x27;s MMV and there may be some people who do find that person when they&#x27;re 16, but even then you&#x27;ve got to ask &quot;how do you actually <i>know</i> that&#x27;s the right person if you&#x27;ve never experienced any <i>other</i> kind of people?&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s like travelling - say you got on a plane to an island on your first day of your first expedition away from home and had such a great time that you just stopped there, cancelling your future travel plans. Seems foolish and small minded to me.<p>Obviously long and beautiful and balanced relationships are what most of us aim for - and that&#x27;s great and a brilliant thing if you find it (I&#x27;m ~25 years into the best possible relationship and marriage I could possibly have hoped for) - but I (and my wife) got here via a whole bunch of teen and early 20s relationships - some brilliant, some silly, some deeply hurtful, some short, some long, some with people that really suited us, some with complete howlers that were destined for disaster from day one. And that whole journey enabled us to discover who we were individually - and then when we met in our mid 20s we had a much better understanding of who and where we wanted to be, both individually and as a couple.<p>I&#x27;ve been immensely lucky in my journey but it&#x27;s because of that journey, and it&#x27;s because quite a lot of that journey was sometimes hard. Breakups and dating the wrong person and getting it wrong are part of that journey, and it sometimes hurts. So does life, and to expect otherwise is deeply unrealistic.<p>I&#x27;m already fascinated as my two kids (20&#x2F;17) do this themselves - but my strong advice to them and to anyone else is that getting to know who you are involves bashing into the world a whole bunch - it can be painful and difficult but that&#x27;s what a satisfying and realistic life looks like.</div><br/><div id="41877100" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41877100" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anal_reactor</span><span>|</span><a href="#41875858">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41876837">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41877191">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41877100">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41877100">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Honestly, I don&#x27;t get it how people find relationships in the first place.

But it doesn&#x27;t seem like an approach to life which results in anything permanent. This post literally says &quot;nothing is permanent, nothing lasts&quot; which is a nihilistic and self-defeating view of life - perhaps technically true but not useful. Contrast with &quot;play long term games&quot; which is the idea that good things compound over years and even decades and this compounding is how you can lead a truly extraordinary life.<p>So with Clear&#x27;s concept of minimum viable habits the focus is on building something permanent (the habit) but the expectations are removed, which makes it feel easy. If you want to be a runner, you start by setting an alarm and putting on your running shoes every day. That&#x27;s it, once the shoes are on, you declare victory and you may take them right back off again and go on with your day, running is strictly optional (and even discouraged at the start).<p>After doing this for a while it&#x27;s going to be second nature. It will become an unconscious habit to put on those shoes at the same time every day, and it will also feel a little ridiculous that you&#x27;re not even stepping out the door. It will then feel completely natural to take the next step and walk outside and enjoy the fresh air as part of the habit. Once you&#x27;re doing that regularly, it&#x27;s almost inevitable that you&#x27;ll start taking a small walk or something and one day boom you&#x27;ve made it a jog. Three years later if it&#x27;s really what you want you&#x27;ve become a serious runner and practicing for your first marathon.<p>It really works in my experience (it got me going to the gym, improved my work productivity and improved my diet). The key is your perspective: you want to build an extensive new, permanent habit that will improve your life for many years to come. But this is hard to do so you&#x27;re layering on one easy piece at a time, removing the friction.<p>It doesn&#x27;t require manning up and being superhuman. Just the desire for the change, some patience and the willingness to take the first step.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41876995" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41876995" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">trumpeta</span><span>|</span><a href="#41876072">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41876322">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41876315">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41876995">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41876995">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think it&#x27;s great advice, but the &quot;finish rarely&quot; part is maybe understated.

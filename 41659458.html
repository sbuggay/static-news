It&#x27;s certainly worth having the discussion about whether people should be able to run a train through their life and the lives of their families via app.<p>But a much easier argument against sports betting is that it ruins the sports. Players throw. They get good at subtly cheating. The gambling apparatus latches itself to the sport, to the teams and players, the umpires and judges, the sporting organizations. With this much money on the line, it&#x27;s not a matter of if but when games are thrown, cheated -- the bigger the game, the bigger the incentive. It&#x27;s even easier now because of the amount of side&#x2F;parlay betting that is available. It exhausts the spirit of competition.<p>Sports gambling is diametrically opposed to sport itself.</div><br/><div id="41667643" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41667643" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jdietrich</span><span>|</span><a href="#41666372">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41667854">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41667643">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41667643">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sports gambling has been legal in the UK since 1960. Gambling wasn&#x27;t seriously problematic in this country until 2005, when regulations were substantially liberalised. Pre-2005, sports betting was something that old men did in dingy backstreet shops; post-2005, it became a widespread social phenomenon, turbocharged by advertising and the growing influence and accessibility of the internet.<p>There&#x27;s a false dichotomy between prohibition and laissez-faire, which the US seems particularly prone to. You&#x27;ve seen similar issues with the decriminalisation of cannabis, where many states seem to have switched abruptly from criminalisation to a fully-fledged commercial market. There is a broad spectrum of other options in between those points that tend to be under-discussed.<p>You can ban gambling advertising, as Italy did in 2019. You can set limits on maximum stakes or impose regulations to make gambling products less attractive to new customers and less risky for problem gamblers. You can have a single state-controlled parimutuel operator. Gambling does cause harm - whether it&#x27;s legal or not - but it is within the purview of legislators to create a gambling market in which harm reduction is the main priority.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41667854" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41667854" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">qwertox</span><span>|</span><a href="#41666372">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41667643">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41666670">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41667854">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41667854">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I find it funny how in Germany the state lottery advertises itself on TV but needs to add the info that &quot;Gambling can be addictive.&quot;<p>For example, this ad <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=t0-pKS_zx5E" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=t0-pKS_zx5E</a> is made by &quot;LOTTO 6aus49&quot;, which is &quot;LOTTO.de&quot;, which is &quot;Toto-Lotto Niedersachsen GmbH&quot;, which is the lottery company of the state Lower Saxony.<p>To me this is as if the state would place TV ads for wine which a state-owned winery produces, like &quot;Landesbetrieb Hessische Staatsweingüter&quot; also known as &quot;Hessische Staatsweingüter GmbH Kloster Eberbach&quot;.<p>And the lottery numbers are then presented in the prime time news in the publicly funded television.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41666670" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41666670" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">FridgeSeal</span><span>|</span><a href="#41666372">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41667854">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41667098">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41666670">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41666670">[24 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In Australia gambling and poker machines have so deeply parasitised themselves into local sports clubs, that they can now _no longer operate without the poker machines_.

Most outcomes in life are the result of a combination of skill and chance - so there&#x27;s admittedly a gradient and a big gray area between the two.<p>But to use farming as an example, you undoubtedly apply skill in your trade to get a better outcome. Sure, your results depend heavily on things like the weather, but someone with zero experience and skill as a farmer will have less success at it than you do. This is a skill intensive game.<p>On the far other end of the spectrum is the slot machine - you pull a lever and wait. Labor is nonexistent, knowledge or skill is irrelevant. This is entirely a game of chance.<p>So one place where we run into problems and governments need to apply some regulation is when a game of chance gets misrepresented as a game of skill, or its odds are hidden or misrepresented. When any of those things happen it means we are actually looking at a form of fraud. The operator of the game is claiming you can do really great at his game but the matter is actually out of your hands, he&#x27;s lying about the probable outcome of your participation. That is fraudulent and most members of our society agree that committing fraud should be discouraged and even punished when it occurs.</div><br/><div id="41667035" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41667035" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">randomdata</span><span>|</span><a href="#41666372">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41666723">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41667085">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41667035">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41667035">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; On the far other end of the spectrum is the slot machine - you pull a lever and wait.</i><p>In the narrowest view, sure.

Let&#x27;s be more specific and say it is a professional arm wrestling competition. One where we find that the competitors are able to hold position for hours on end, which makes for really boring viewership. To combat that, the league starts allowing tickling in an effort to get a participant to fold sooner, and perhaps adding an additional comedic element that makes it more entertaining in general.<p>If you hold sport as some kind of purity that needs to be upheld (again, I maintain that is a nonsensical take, but bear with me) then the addition of tickling ruins it. Indeed, tickling is contrived, but professional sports are filled with all kinds of similar adjustments to make watching the sport more entertaining. The sports, from this &quot;purity&quot; point of view, were ruined from the get go as a necessity to get people interested in watching them – and thus a willingness to pay.<p><i>&gt; No one cares that WWE is rigged</i><p>Exactly. I mean, a lot of people were upset when it came out that the, then WWF, was choreographed, and I&#x27;m sure that they lost of a lot of viewers over it, but the league has still managed to entertain a wide audience. Like you suggest, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if a sport isn&#x27;t held to some kind of purity of sport standard.<p>And it is pretty clear that sports gambling has brought out a new audience of people who are entertained by the gambling aspect. <i>&quot;My entertainment is better than your entertainment&quot;</i> is not a logical position.

That is also why many &quot;buy my shit to win a prize&quot; promotions have a way to enter without buying something (getting around the consideration rule) and some of these have a short math test that you need to do to claim your prize (making it a game of not pure chance).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41661445" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41661445" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dole</span><span>|</span><a href="#41660081">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41660373">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41661175">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41660319">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41661445">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41661445">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">All the big sports betting companies are now dumping money into political television commercials with school teacher testimonials and happy classroom shots urging how passing Bill X will benefit state schools, yet years into legalized sports betting, teachers still have some of the lowest compensation rates.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41660319" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41660319" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pclmulqdq</span><span>|</span><a href="#41660081">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41660285">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41660373">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41660167">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41660319">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41660319">[14 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Taxing vices is how you control the amount of them while still allowing people to do them.

Progressive politics might only be as old as the Roosevelts but they have surprisingly deep historical roots[0].<p>The improvement in material conditions from, say, the 1500s to 2024 is a function of changes in the law that made it worthwhile to produce those improvements. Or, in other words, nobody is going to innovate in phone apps when they have to give 30% to Apple and Google. Back then, the &quot;30%&quot; would have been indentured servitude, debtors prisons, and so on. Innovation <i>increased</i> when serfdom ended and more people were able to innovate.<p>Innovation in an economy is a function of how many people have access to appropriate levels of capital. Which is itself a function of the distribution of wealth. An economy in which five people own everything is one where nobody can innovate outside of that system. An economy with redistributive effects - whether that be through government action or otherwise - is more productive <i>at the expense of the growth prospects of the ultra-wealthy</i>.

I&#x27;ve seen the full gamut of responses to gambling on the human brain. Gambling absolutely hijacks the neurocomputational circuitry of some people in a way that it doesn&#x27;t others. Infantilized? I managed my risk of ruin carefully and rationally, others didn&#x27;t. They invariably got ruined. Period. Those people should not be gambling. There was no safety net, which you falsely imagine exists. I wish there had been. The consequences to their lives outweighed, by far, the prosperity gained by permitting large-scale high-stakes gambling (which is at best a zero-sum game if the house is included). I do not think my former profession should be openly legal to everyone. Participating in it was an act of willful evil on my part. I am glad to have it regulated, for the sake of the families of the people whose lives I helped destroy.<p>There was absolutely nothing and nobody &quot;infantilizing&quot; me to induce &quot;anxiety&quot;. There was a largely unregulated free-for-all into a brutal, unforgiving world, in which you can lose a fortune in the blink of an eye if you elect to wager it and lose. Sure, I thrived in that environment, but it was at the expense of vulnerable individuals.<p>Seriously, what the actual fuck are you talking about. If you&#x27;d ever taken actual, life-altering financial risks in a society without a real financial safety net (the United States), you&#x27;d know that there is absolutely nothing between a foolish series of decisions while drunk (or much worse, in the thrall of a persistent gambling addiction) and complete financial ruin.<p>We can do better as a society, and we should.<p>While we&#x27;re at it, gosh, you know what would have improved the poker economy? Unregulated firearms at poker tables. Hell, let&#x27;s just make homicide legal if the other person bets their life. Or maybe even if they don&#x27;t! That would have really let us demonstrate our fully-enfranchised individual wills to power. No one would be confused as an anxious man baby! We could have thrived like real manly men! Letting people blow each other&#x27;s heads off at a whim during a gambling free-for-all (&quot;between consenting adults!&quot;) would surely improve prosperity. Great idea! Agreeing as a democratic society to regulate that behavior would only produce a society of emasculated degenerates incapable of expressing the full range of the human spirit!

Regardless of regulation, the business model is corrupt.<p>At conferences anyone I spoke to would say “you can’t leave the gaming industry, the money is just too good”. Which is why I promptly left.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41666567" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41666567" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">heisenbit</span><span>|</span><a href="#41667232">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41667606">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41666567">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41666567">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">While betting may be harmful the cash rich industry has helped many to escape poverty by enabling money laundering.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41667606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41667606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alephnan</span><span>|</span><a href="#41666567">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41667653">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41667606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41667606">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There are various comments about fixing matches.<p>There’s a meme&#x2F;“theory” in retail options trading about “max pain”.

That is such a far cry from not wanting people to gamble at all.

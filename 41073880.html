And that lack of self reliance and poor digital exposure leads to their development issues that carry into adulthood.<p>But at the same time, American cities are unpredictable and there is often a rational fear of crimes for parents. In some cities crime is due to a lack of law enforcement. In others it is due to poverty and lack of opportunity. In others it is due to uncontrolled immigration (for example poorly assimilated refugee groups). In others it is due to uncontrolled school environments, where your “good” kid may run into problems with the “bad” kids they share a classroom with. With all of this going on, parents can feel like they have to be controlling and in a constant alert state to avoid something unexpected happening to their precious children. And that fear leads them to this style of parenting, not just fear of consequences from police officers.<p>But if you go away from cities, to rural areas, you’ll see parenting is more comparable to European parenting.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41076302" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41076302" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chmod775</span><span>|</span><a href="#41076481">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41076611">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41076302">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41076302">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s accepted for parents to not be reasonable where it concerns their children.

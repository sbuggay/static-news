I generally believe that brief bouts of exercise can be very beneficial, especially because they&#x27;re easier to do consistently over the long-term vs. more time-consuming routines. For a decade now, I&#x27;ve just been running through my neighborhood most days for 20-30 minutes (with some sprints mixed in) and doing one or two maximal sets of pushups or pullups or barbell exercises at home on a weekly basis. I know a lot of people who got really into longer (e.g. 60-90 minute) gym routines but couldn&#x27;t sustain it for more than a few months, and then stopped doing anything.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.lww.com&#x2F;acsm-msse&#x2F;Fulltext&#x2F;1996&#x2F;10000&#x2F;Effects_of_moderate_intensity_endurance_and.18.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.lww.com&#x2F;acsm-msse&#x2F;Fulltext&#x2F;1996&#x2F;10000&#x2F;Effec...</a></div><br/><div id="42084232" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42084232" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">safety1st</span><span>|</span><a href="#42081932">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42083078">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42084232">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42084232">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think for the average person, looking too carefully at individual studies is failing to see the forest for the trees.<p>Basically any time we do a study which asks &quot;Is doing a bit more exercise better for you?&quot; the answer is yes. Like doing a single walk around the block every week is better than doing none. Even five minutes of exercise is better than zero. But obviously these have much less positive impact than several hours of moderate to intense exercise weekly. There are diminishing returns but they don&#x27;t really kick in until you&#x27;re already pretty fit, they are only really a concern that athletes need to think about.<p>So in terms of individual decision making things are really simple. Are you not fit? Do you feel bad? Are your basic markers for this looking bad (blood pressure, weight etc.)? Do more exercise. Do what you enjoy, do it safely, and do as much of it as you can as intensely as is reasonable, and the numbers will go in the right direction.

I once experimented with organizing my running workouts according to the original Tabata protocol, as closely as possible, for about six weeks[1]. I wasn&#x27;t an elite athlete by any means, but I was a 21 year-old Army cadet in the top quartile of cadets in terms of fitness. I found that it&#x27;s indeed difficult to strike a legitimate 100% effort, even when it&#x27;s only for 20 seconds and only 5-10 times. My point is not that people should adopt the protocol as a sustainable, long-term routine; it&#x27;s just that there&#x27;s been evidence for a long time that short workouts can have disproportionate benefits in addition to being easier to program into day-to-day life.<p>[1] The results on my running performance, specifically over two miles, weren&#x27;t clear, by the way. I wasn&#x27;t running my best times when I started the experiment, nor at the end of it. But at least I didn&#x27;t get worse despite averaging only six miles per week. I&#x27;ve done much better on 15-25 miles per week with a wider variety of speed work.</div><br/><div id="42083863" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42083863" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seadan83</span><span>|</span><a href="#42081932">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42083564">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42083953">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42083863">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42083863">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">HIIT or Tabata must not be done day-to-day, everyday. With no recovery days, there will be no gains. A 21 year old is able to recover like crazy, a good 9 hours of sleep might be enough to mostly recover. For others it would not work well and would lead to over-training. In overtraining, the 100% efforts will be 90% efforts, impact the immune system, generally just not good all round.<p>For disproportionate benefits, one needs to define which benefits exactly. A max effort will burn a lot of calories quite quickly and potentially increase V02 max (which is highly correlated to overall longevity). Zone 2 training has become popular and has other benefits, notably increases &#x27;fat max&#x27; threshold - which gives different benefits (specifically the ability to work harder for longer while still using fat as an energy source for the exercise).<p>&gt; I found that it&#x27;s indeed difficult to strike a legitimate 100% effort, even when it&#x27;s only for 20 seconds and only 5-10 times.<p>This is essentially the point. At the end of Tabata, the last interval should be the last bit of energy you have in the tank. It should be entirely draining. Doing this routine daily will not allow recovery to then properly do the training well.<p>FWIW, I heard it paraphrased as this: the body has essentially too modes, hard &amp; easy. When going hard, it only matters how hard you go, not how long. When going easy, it only matters how long you go for, not how hard. At the same time, zone 2 training and HIIT&#x2F;Tabata are not mutually exclusive in their benefits, but it&#x27;s more which systems receive the most benefit while other systems in the body receive benefits but to a lesser degree.</div><br/><div id="42084049" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42084049" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">warner25</span><span>|</span><a href="#42081932">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42083863">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42083953">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42084049">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42084049">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The original experiment was four days per week of the &quot;exhaustive intermittent training&quot; and a fifth day was 30 minutes of zone 2.

Even if it&#x27;s great conditioning.  So here&#x27;s the problem.<p>We go on about what&#x27;s optimal from a raw time perspective, but time slows subjectively when you suffer.  So people who don&#x27;t conceptualize themselves as athletic, they may have insecurities if not outright skepticism, aren&#x27;t going to last.<p>You can make a culty cultural glue to get habits to stick (because fitness is all about habits).  You can do CrossFit, the social and positive aspects.  That encouragement can bring habit and a change of self perception.<p>But if you&#x27;re just a self-driven type, and you&#x27;re dipping your toes in the water, my observations are that whatever is fun (an individual  experience) is what you&#x27;ll be creating a habit with, and time foes quickly.  So explore a brunch of things until you encounter fun.  Tennis, running club, weightlifting club. Etc.<p>So my point is that fitness is a problem around how people experience exercise and training, instead of what&#x27;s optimal in a paper or in terms what&#x27;s efficient in terms of time.<p>Was this prematurely dismissive?

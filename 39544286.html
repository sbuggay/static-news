Rode today. It&#x27;s not a kids thing any more. Most of the riders are not only adults, but older adults. Few kids take riding lessons. The old ponies are under-used.<p>Fifteen years ago, the ponies were usually being ridden or groomed by girls in their early 
teens.  We used to see groups of kids go out on the trails unsupervised. That was normal.
The kids would go out for an hour or so. Nobody does that any more.<p>Now, if there&#x27;s a kid around, it&#x27;s usually because the parent is a horse person. Barns that teach kids are very organized. Kids are never out of sight of an adult. Usually the parents sit there and watch.<p>It&#x27;s sad. Kids that grow up around horses tend not to have trouble with bullies. After you&#x27;re used to dealing with half-ton, somewhat pushy animals with huge teeth and steel-shod hooves, 
big guys just don&#x27;t look that big.</div><br/><div id="39547371" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39547371" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">achenet</span><span>|</span><a href="#39546775">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39547274">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39547371">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39547371">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I know a girl who did a lot of horse riding from a rather young age, even had her own horse, and she was bullied a lot as a kid.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39547274" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39547274" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">abyssin</span><span>|</span><a href="#39546775">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39547371">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39547047">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39547274">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39547274">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A cheaper and more environmental-friendly alternative is a bicycle.</div><br/><div id="39547435" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39547435" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Tade0</span><span>|</span><a href="#39546775">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39547274">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39547047">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39547435">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39547435">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Defeats the purpose of having a pony.<p>Riding is like 1&#x2F;4 of the whole time spent with the animal.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39547047" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39547047" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cultofmetatron</span><span>|</span><a href="#39546775">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39547274">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39547159">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39547047">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39547047">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Kids that grow up around horses tend not to have trouble with bullies.<p>adding this to my list of thing to look into if I ever have a daiughter.</div><br/><div id="39547213" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39547213" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CraigJPerry</span><span>|</span><a href="#39546775">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39547047">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39547159">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39547213">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39547213">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wouldn’t bother.

Attached to the cap were maybe 12 10’ chains attached, which linked to a giant octagon or decagon made out of 1-2” or so straight pipe sections which were fitted together in angle brackets.

Rearing young is pretty deep and ancient behavior in our species, yet when we think of examples of prior generations or suppose cases from the historical record, the trend always seemed to be free range parenting. Only within the last generation or two perhaps has childhood changed from one of exploration and freedom to one of restriction and days scheduled to the minute. Do the kids benefit from this unique way of being reared? Maybe, maybe not, we know mental health issues are on the rise among children. But, on the other hand, there is a profit to be made selling tools to monitor and restrict and activities and services to fill up an otherwise idle day, so there is some degree of incentive to keep this behavior around in our culture now that it has emerged for better or worse.</div><br/><div id="39547599" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39547599" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">The_Colonel</span><span>|</span><a href="#39546813">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39547044">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39547126">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39547599">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39547599">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">1.

And what they end up doing is just ramping up sense of danger about non dangerous behavior. If you frame reasonable and safe activities as risk taking, then well, people will conclude those activities are risky.<p>And second issue is that they do NOT engage with other host of issues that limit outside play. For example, unsupervised playing kids are annoying to many unrelated adults - and adults who strongly dislike kids and want to exclude them from everywhere are very common. Or, simple fact that just meeting friends often requires in advance agreed upon play date and a drive by car. Or, simple fact that before you was bored in your room and outside had things to do, nowdays you have fun stuff at home (computer, tablet, phone) and outside has not much to do above the age of 7.<p>Half of this feels like fighting fear by adding new dangers and threats to the equation. Hey, not only you need to add risk, if you dont your kid will have serious mental health issues. Hey, lets worry simultaneously about risk taking while doing safe activities while also worrying they dont take enough risk.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39546977" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39546977" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dclowd9901</span><span>|</span><a href="#39547110">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39546822">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39546977">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39546977">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Think back to your favorite childhood play memory. Where were you? What were you doing?  Was there an adult supervising you?<p>I have two memories<p>1) I was playing in my grandfather’s pipe yard with my cousins. Lots of heavy equipment and stuff that was precariously stacked. Very easily could have ended up in a situation were something fell on me and killed me. Instead, I just ran headlong into a rusty pipe and nearly broke my nose.<p>2) I was in my early teens riding a 3 wheeled ATV. I was going too fast and went into a wash and flipped the machine over me. I didn’t kill myself. Didn’t even get seriously hurt, but easily could have.<p>I was incredibly lucky to come out of both of those experiences relatively unscathed. It’s not really a tough calculus thinking “well, my daughter doesn’t have an eye anymore, but at least she was having fun!”<p>I instead encourage my kids to have fun in activities that _feel_ risky but where the chance of life altering injury is low. Like walking on a high brick fence or jumping from a high point into a big deep body of water.<p>Anyway, as a parent I’m so fucking tired of people trying to tell me how to raise a kid.</div><br/><div id="39547385" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39547385" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">calvinmorrison</span><span>|</span><a href="#39546977">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39547492">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39546822">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39547385">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39547385">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Climbing at the top of very tall trees.

That doesn’t happen much today.</div><br/><div id="39547143" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39547143" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">forgetfreeman</span><span>|</span><a href="#39546728">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39546911">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39546861">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39547143">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39547143">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not true?

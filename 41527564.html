People wanting to be cool because they use hype-train-tech ending up doing things of unbelievably bad quality because &quot;hey, we are not that many in the team&quot; but &quot;hey, we need infinite scalability&quot;. Teams immature to the point of not understanding what LTS means have decided that they needed Kubernetes because yes. I could go on.<p>I currently have distilled, compact Puppet code to create a hardened VM of any size on any provider that can run one more more Docker services or run directly a python backend, or serve static files. With this I create a service on a Hetzner VM in 5 minutes whether the VM has 2 cores or 48 cores and control the configuration in source controlled manifests while monitoring configuration compliance with a custom Naemon plugin. A perfectly reproducible process. The startups kids are meanwhile doing snowflakes in the cloud spending many KEUR per month to have something that is worse than what devops pioneers were able to do in 2017.

The same load balancer routes rest calls to two vms that run our monolith. Which talk to a managed DB and managed Elasticsearch and a managed Redis. The DB and Elasticsearch are expensive. But having those managed saves a lot of time and hassle. That just about sums up everything we have. Nice and simple. And not that expensive.<p>I could move the whole thing to something like Hetzner and cut our bills by 50% or so. Worth doing maybe but not super urgent for me. Losing those managed services would make my life harder. I might have to go back to AWS at some point because some of our customers seem to prefer that. So, there is that as well.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41528628" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41528628" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">imiric</span><span>|</span><a href="#41528596">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41527963">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41528628">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41528628">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a retreaded and often tiresome debate. I&#x27;ll still throw my 2c in...<p>Should you pick a complex framework from day one? Probably not, unless your team has extensive experience with it.<p>My objection is towards the idea that managing infrastructure with a bespoke process and custom tooling will always be less effort to maintain than established tooling. It&#x27;s the idea of stubbornly rejecting the &quot;complexity&quot; bogeyman, even when the process you built yourself is far from simple, and takes a lot of your time from your core product anyway.<p>Everyone loves the simplicity of copying over a binary to a VPS, and restarting a service. But then you want to solve configuration and secret management, have multiple servers for availability&#x2F;redundancy so then you want gradual deployments, load balancing, rollbacks, etc. You probably also want some staging environment, so need to easily replicate this workflow. Then your team eventually grows and they find that it&#x27;s impossible to run a prod-like environment locally. And then, and then...<p>You&#x27;re forced to solve each new requirement with your own special approach, instead of relying on standard solutions others have figured out for you. It eventually gets to a question of sunken cost: do you want to abandon all this custom tooling you know and understand, in favor of &quot;complexity&quot; you don&#x27;t? The difficult thing is that the more you invest in it, the harder it will be to migrate away from it.<p>My suggestion is: start by following practices that will make your transition to the standard tooling later easier. This means deploying with containers from day 1, adopting the 12 factors methodology, etc. And when you do start to struggle with some feature you need, switch to established tooling sooner later than later. You&#x27;re likely find that your fear of the unknown was unwarranted, and you&#x27;ll spend less time working on infra in the long run.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41527963" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41527963" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pnathan</span><span>|</span><a href="#41528628">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41527951">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41527963">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41527963">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">if you take the time to understand k8s and have a <i>straightforward</i> k8s deployment, these things aren&#x27;t really a problem - and you don&#x27;t have to do the custom sysadmin timesinks that need to go into the &quot;simple&quot; suggestion.

  - there is a separate web image, to not always couple front end deployments to back end
  - there are specialized data stores like Redis (or maybe RabbitMQ or MinIO in a different type of project)
  - Dozzle seems nice https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dozzle.dev&#x2F; (I use Portainer mostly, but seems useful)
</code></pre>
What I think works quite nicely in general:<p><pre><code>  - starting out with a monolithic back end but making it modular with feature flags (e.g. FEATURE_REPORTS, FEATURE_EMAILS, FEATURE_API), so that you can deploy vastly different types of workloads in separate containers BUT not duplicate your data model and don&#x27;t need to extract shared code libraries (yet) and if you ever need to split the codebase into multiple separate ones, then it won&#x27;t be *too* hard to do that
  - having a clear API (RESTful or otherwise) as the contract between a separate back end and front end deployment, so that even if your SPA technology gets deprecated (AngularJS, anyone?) then you can migrate to something, unlike when doing SSR and everything being coupled
  - the same applies to NOT having the same container build process have both the front end and back end build (I&#x27;ve seen a Java project install a specific Node version through Maven and then the build dragging on cause Maven ends up processing thousands of files as a part of the build)
  - using the right tool for the job: many might create full text search, key-value storage, message queues, JSON document storage, even blob storage all with PostgreSQL and that might be okay; others will go for separate instances of ElasticSearch, Redis, RabbitMQ, something S3 compatible and so on, probably a tradeoff between using well known libraries and tools vs building everything yourself against a single DB instance
  - in my experience, many projects out there are served perfectly fine by a single server so Docker Compose feels like the logical tool to start out with, if multiple instances indeed become necessary, there is always Docker Swarm (yes, still works, very simple), Hashicorp Nomad or K3s or one of the other more manageable Kubernetes distros
  - self-hosted (or self-hostable) software in general is pretty cool and gives you a bunch of freedom, though using managed cloud services will also be pleasant for many, more expensive upfront but less so in regards to your own time spent managing the stack; the former also lends itself nicely to being able to launch a local dev environment with the full stack, which feels like a superpower (being able to really test out breaking migrations, look at what happens with the whole stack etc.)
  - having some APM and tracing is nice, something like Apache Skywalking was pretty simple to setup, though there are more advanced options out there (e.g. cloud version of Sentry, because good luck running that locally)
  - having some uptime monitoring is also very nice, something like Uptime Kuma is just very pleasant to use
  - heck, if you really wanted to, you could even self-host a mail server: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;docker-mailserver&#x2F;docker-mailserver (though that can be viewed as a hobbyist thing), or have MailCatcher &#x2F; Inbucket or something for development locally</code></pre></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41528190" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41528190" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jedberg</span><span>|</span><a href="#41527565">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41527894">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41528190">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41528190">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you&#x27;ll allow me, I&#x27;d like to shill my company for a second.

Why you&#x27;d want this is entirely beyond me.</div><br/><div id="41528290" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41528290" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwawaythekey</span><span>|</span><a href="#41528127">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41528747">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41528290">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41528290">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree that cloudwatch <i>is</i> dogturds, but want to dive deeper for illustrative purposes:<p>Your dynamodb solution isn&#x27;t foolproof.

Once your logging is too much for a disk to handle (this will be later than you would&#x27;ve outgrown ddb, but before you would&#x27;ve outgrown cloudwatch) then you can bring something fancy in.</div><br/><div id="41528362" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41528362" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">akira2501</span><span>|</span><a href="#41528127">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41528290">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41528747">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41528362">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41528362">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; has throughput limited<p>The event volume is not particularly large as we tend to process things in batch and rarely on the edge of an event.  I also wouldn&#x27;t,  for example,  log API requests using this mechanism.  We&#x27;re nowhere near this being an issue as 20-30 lambdas is not a particular problem for us.  Choose a good naming convention and build your own deployment infrastructure and it&#x27;s no sweat.<p>&gt; relatively expensive<p>Large object compression and&#x2F;or offload to s3 is baked into our dynamodb interface library.

You&#x27;re not often looking back more than an hour.  There&#x27;s bulk export back onto campus servers if you wanted that anyways.  TTL is default 1 day.  Running a &quot;tail&quot; is absurdly cheap,  much cheaper than CloudWatch&#x27;s laughable rate for their similar feature,  a miss is 1&#x2F;2 a read unit,  and a hit is almost never more than 2.<p>&gt; slapping grafana<p>I didn&#x27;t need &quot;observability.&quot;  I need current state and recent deltas.  This is particularly true when any changes are made.  Otherwise my logs are pure annoyance and don&#x27;t generally provide value.

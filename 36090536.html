While we absolutely empathise with the challenges of funding open-source projects, we were unable to justify paying the very substantial recurring fees involved. We indicated that we would not be proceeding, and have subsequently made some investments elsewhere<p>What am I missing here? Is PlatformIO rejecting this contribution from a community member (not a Raspberry Pi employee AFAICT) unless the Raspberry Pi foundation agrees to pay them substantial recurring fees?<p>I understand PlatformIO is a business, but it’s bizarre to see them trying to extract fees from a company that doesn’t appear to be involved in this open source work.<p>Am I missing something?<p>The PlatformIO team’s responses all feel like they were written by a team of lawyers and PR people, or at least someone trying to pretend to be a team of lawyers and PR people. I don’t entirely understand what’s going on with this whole situation but from what I’ve seen I think I’ll steer clear of PlatformIO in the future.</div><br/><div id="36091916" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36091916" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">clnq</span><span>|</span><a href="#36090905">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36090929">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36091916">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36091916">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don’t know about the quality of this PR, it looks good at first glance. But sometimes “free” things have significant costs. For example, a project offering a RPi integration will probably have to maintain it and further develop it, or face significant pressure to do so. And if they don’t see that it will be worth it, maybe it won’t. They know their customers and business better than we do.<p>I have seen this plenty of times in my part of tech (AAA games). People often approach companies asking to integrate their code into games, like FPS unlockers or even entire multiplayer mods. But even if the code and the ideas are offered for free, it will cost significant resources to dedicate team members to porting the work, further developing it until it meets quality standards, certifying an update, pushing it out, and then maintaining it. There are a few dozen of these small costs that add up.<p>Integration is easier in open source. But not maintenance and further development until the feature meets reasonable expectations. And you can’t really ask anyone who does a PR to maintain the code forever either.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36091214" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36091214" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">helsinkiandrew</span><span>|</span><a href="#36090905">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36091252">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36091214">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36091214">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A better link to PlatformIo response: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;platformio&#x2F;platform-raspberrypi&#x2F;pull&#x2F;36#issuecomment-1501724359">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;platformio&#x2F;platform-raspberrypi&#x2F;pull&#x2F;36#i...</a><p>Whilst PlatformIO come across as the villains in this story, adding the RPi support to their core would indicate some kind of support&#x2F;work from them in future versions (beyond the ‘non production’ support they provide now).

Raspberry Pi provides Micropython and a C&#x2F;C++ SDK. My guess that professionals in the embedded space probably use the SDK directly (it&#x27;s nicely documented) and do things themselves, but hobbyists like me would like a package manager so we can install libraries easily. Enter Arduino.<p>This isn&#x27;t Arduino&#x27;s official support for the Pico either. Arduino made a port based on mbed. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be used much, based on my searches. Not much about it since 2021.<p>That&#x27;s because Earle Philhower&#x27;s &quot;community port,&quot; called arduino-pico [1] is nicer. I switched to it to get good USB-Midi support, because it has an option to use Adafruit&#x27;s fork of the TinyUSB library.<p>But, as a package manager, Arduino can be confusing and PlatformIO is supposed to be more sane. So, with the patch, you can do that, and the instructions are here [2]. It works fine. The patch isn&#x27;t merged, but it works.<p>Somehow this is the unofficial, alternate choice in multiple ways, so it probably looks pretty dubious. But it&#x27;s the one that seems best for me. Ideally I&#x27;d be using a language with a real package manager instead of Arduino or PlatformIO&#x27;s embedded-only implementations. (I don&#x27;t even particularly like C++.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;earlephilhower&#x2F;arduino-pico">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;earlephilhower&#x2F;arduino-pico</a>

It takes years to learn to fight the urge to over-engineer.<p>Once you learn to see it though, it&#x27;s hard to ignore. Now I can tell instantly if code is over-engineered. Unfortunately It seems like maybe 99% of code is over-engineered. The developer&#x27;s incentive to maximize their own lock-in factor and billable hours are powerful forces. Even developers who appear to be totally robotic and ego-less are often guilty of over-engineering. It works on the subconscious mind. Few are ever able to escape the mindset because they are not fully conscious. They are not thinking about every single line of code that they write. They decide on some goal and then churn out whatever code first pops into their heads to get incrementally closer to that goal... Not realising that, at each step, there were many alternative paths that which were superior.</div><br/><div id="38077729" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38077729" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Trasmatta</span><span>|</span><a href="#38077324">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38077453">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38077729">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38077729">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The developer&#x27;s incentive to maximize their own lock-in factor and billable hours are powerful forces.<p>In my experience these are rarely, if ever, the reasons for over engineering.</div><br/><div id="38080974" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38080974" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lawn</span><span>|</span><a href="#38077324">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38077729">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38079906">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38080974">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38080974">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My hobby projects are always over-engineered despite my best efforts.

You already had it 80% (in terms of feature complete) of the way there, why is that extra 20% as hard as the first 80%? So the engineers build up scar tissue.

Not to mention all the additional time trying to figure out &quot;canonical&quot; data models that will &quot;future-proof&quot; the applications interfaces. If you have to iterate quickly (which is not as common as agile folks wish), you need to build up a raport with leadership to help them understand that speed comes with trade offs: faster might mean &#x27;more work to change later&#x27;, while slower to market today might mean faster iteration down the line. These discussions ARE valuable for leadership, as sometimes they need a quick win because of a Q3 earnings hole or contract, and sometimes they are willing to make longer term investments.<p>You move too quickly, they call your solutions hacky, you move too slowly, they call it overengineered.

But we teach people to overthink and abstract things. So so think that itâs only natural that people are actually going to do exactly what theyâve been taught.<p>I have a side-gig as an external examiner for CS students, and well, a lot of the stuff we grade our students on are things that Iâve had to âunlearnâ myself throughout my career, because usually complexity and abstraction arenât going to work out over a long period of time for an IT system. This obviously isnât something thatâs universally true. I do tend to work in non-tech enterprise organisations (or startups transitioning into enterprise) and in this space a lot of what is considered good computer science just doesnât work. Itâs everything from AGILE, where you project processes will trip you over as you try to juggle developers who both need to build and maintain things at the same time. To how we try to handle complexity with abstractions, and how those abstractions sometimes lead to âgenericâ functions where you need to tell a function 9001 different things before it knows how to perform âbecause it just evolvedâ. Itâs in everything really, like, we teach students to decouple their architecture and itâs absolutely a good thing to teach CS students, but the result is that a lot of them âoverengineerâ their architecture so that you can easily swap which database your system is using (and similar) in a world where Iâve never actually seen anyone do that. Anecdotal, sure, but I did work in the public sector where we bought more than 300 different systems from basically every professional supplier in our country, and youâre frankly far more likely to simply replace the entire system than just parts of it.<p>But how are you going to know that when all youâve been taught is the âacademicâ approach to computer science by teachers who might have never experienced the real world? Being self-taught isnât really going to help you either. I canât imagine how you would even begin to learn good practices in the ocean of âhow toâ tutorials and books which are essentially little more than the official documentation on a language and maybe a couple of frameworks.<p>&gt; The developer&#x27;s incentive to maximize their own lock-in factor and billable hours are powerful forces<p>This part, however, I disagree with. Again this is very likely coloured by the fact that Iâve mainly worked in the space where developers both build and maintain multiple things, often at the same time. But Iâve never met developers who wanted to do this.

On the other hand, having worked with languages all over the spectrum of static typing- Iâve also seen first how how high the bar really is for benefiting from static types before you hit diminishing returns.<p>The best answer I can come up with is that people just seem to have differently wired brains. For me, static typing- even fairly sophisticated static typing, is simple. It makes the code simpler, easier to reason about, easier to refactor, and with a sufficiently expressive type system it lets you build things in a much more intuitive way than you could otherwise. Itâs not about solving puzzles for the sake of them- types remove a big part of the puzzle by letting me explicitly write things down- and letting the compiler keep track of the details.<p>Certainly plenty of people donât see it that way, and Iâve heard a lot of people make similar arguments about dynamic typing being simpler and more expressive. I donât think they are lying but I see a big pile of inscrutable pain when I work in large dynamically types codebases.<p>I know Iâm right about my experience, and I trust other people are right about theirs, so there must be some significant divide in how we conceptualize code that makes one persons elegant simplicity anotherâs intolerable complexity.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38081723" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38081723" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cjfd</span><span>|</span><a href="#38077324">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38079477">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38080709">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38079541">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38081723">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38081723">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a very simplistic approach to simplicity.

It&#x27;s not made by resolutely sticking to lo-fi paths &amp; mentalities.<p>We do need to be aware of the hazards at the other side, of ridiculous complexity &amp; absurd&#x2F;unnecessary systems engineering: yes! And I think grug offers some good almost-koans to reflect on, illuminates real hazards well. But I also think it&#x27;s actively harmful &amp; pernicious to put grug-brainedness on a pedestal, to go about actively disbelieving against any possibilities that might possibly be done simpler.<p>We seem to agree that simplicity takes iteration. Grug presents it as &quot;oh I&#x27;m just dumb grug brain, I dunno&quot; but in practice there is a lot of infighting in tech, and those who insist too loudly on aiming too high are not even IMHO as dangerous as those too loudly insisting on too low. We have to keep engaging possibility from all sides, &amp; keep finding out what balances do work.</div><br/><div id="38080831" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38080831" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pphysch</span><span>|</span><a href="#38077164">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38079922">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38077297">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38080831">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38080831">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; One example, I&#x27;ve had an incredibly hard time getting folks to switch from dirty cobbled-together-with-StackOverflow shell scripts to Ansible, which is a just more sight-readable consistent experience.<p>Ansible can be used quite elegantly&#x2F;simply, but the ecosystem as a whole is totally infested with &quot;big brains&quot; who insist on complicating things to make them more Reusableâ¢.<p>There are really guys out there who will argue that your 20 line shell script actually needs to be two Ansible Roles each consisting of 10 files spread out among 2 layers of directories, and can be published to the Galaxy.<p>(In reality you can turn that 20 line shell script into a 30 line idempotent, single-file Ansible playbook, which is SOMETIMES worth it)</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38077297" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38077297" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hotnfresh</span><span>|</span><a href="#38077164">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38077633">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38077683">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38077297">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38077297">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What I like so much about the Grug piece is that itâs full of nuance and humility.

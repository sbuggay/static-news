But the model is what it is.<p>Word Press is unhappy that WP Engine is using the software exactly as the license allows.<p>Drupal has created a parallel organisation which monitors and rewards participation. This doesn&#x27;t &quot;solve&quot; the problem, it just adds a commercial and administrative layer.<p>Proprietary software solved the problem by not being Open Source. Others have adopted a &quot;source available&quot; license, which may come with restrictions.<p>In other words, lots of people have solved the problem simply by not being &quot;open source&quot; (not necessarily by closing the source, but rather by restricting usage.)<p>Word Press are picking a fight with a user, who is using it exactly as they licensed it.<p>If Word Press don&#x27;t like the rules of the game then they can change the rules. That is 100% under their control.

I understand most core software was started long ago as a one-person project and given a FOSS license. Due to the license, it grew from the work of hundreds or thousands who contributed, but the license no longer serves the authors&#x27; worldview.
It seems to me all the contributors implicitly approve of this situation, as they contribute labor while knowing what the license is.</div><br/><div id="41728401" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41728401" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tgsovlerkhgsel</span><span>|</span><a href="#41727718">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41728341">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41728401">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41728401">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the article clearly states the problem: It encourages contributors to stop contributing and become &quot;takers&quot;, and once there are not enough makers, the product and entire ecosystem dies.

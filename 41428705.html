My projects span from math, to programming, to pinball repair, to amateur radio, to gardening, to mycology, to who knows what else. I personally enjoy the process of bike-shedding and endlessly exploring the solution space for a problem. That said, there is a point where you need to make hard decisions and button up projects.<p>As long as I don&#x27;t care what project gets completed at what time, I&#x27;ve found a little trick to broadly move the needle. I jokingly call it &quot;Sol&#x27;s fast five&quot; but the name is actually pretty on point.<p>I take a step back, look around me, and pick out the first five things I can reasonably achieve in less then a day prioritizing things where I have all the tools and materials at hand. These 5 things are never entire projects, the goal is to maximally decompose the projects until each action is as close to trivial as possible.<p>Once I have my list of 5 things I stop thinking about anything else and strictly work towards those 5 goals. There is a sense of relief in having reduced the scope and the tasks tend to be finished very quickly. Checking them off the list always feels good.<p>Once I have completed my 5 items I start a new list and pick out the next five items. This can feel like a huge reward.<p>I&#x27;ve used this system to great effect in the past few years.</div><br/><div id="41430355" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41430355" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ants_everywhere</span><span>|</span><a href="#41429127">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41429671">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41430355">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41430355">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; the goal is to maximally decompose the projects until each action is as close to trivial as possible<p>This is a big part of the GTD framework that is almost always dropped in the retelling but which I think is fundamental.

With this approach you can start side projects purely to have fun for an afternoon or to learn a thing or to see how a technology or approach feels. Then you can drop it and move on.

Something dawned on me today when mulling on another related idea &quot;systems vs goals&quot;, popularized by Scott Adams in &quot;How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big&quot;[0]. It was a widely popular book at the time, even here on HN, but the core idea never worked for me. Nor even resonated.<p>Quoting from the book[1]:<p>&quot;A goal is a specific objective that you either achieve or don&#x27;t sometime in the future. A system is something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of happiness in the long run. If you do something every day, its a system. If you&#x27;re waiting to achieve it someday in the future, it&#x27;s a goal.&quot;<p>Boring, ain&#x27;t it?<p>For me, the problem with project, systems, and enjoying journey over destination is that:<p>1) Projects don&#x27;t motivate me for long; past initial excitement, I&#x27;m rarely able to muster enough motivation from the dream of finishing something (and enjoying the spoil) to move me past static friction.<p>2) &quot;Journey over destination&quot; - I mean, if I&#x27;m doing a project, I care about benefits and (my imagined) experiences given by whatever it is that I&#x27;ve built or completed. Journey is just a distraction at best; typically, it&#x27;s a source of stress and many yaks to be shaved, most of them stinky and ugly. If anything, I get motivation from ways to <i>shorten the journey</i>.<p>3) Systems are even worse. If journey is just distracting me from the goal, systems are about putting the goal out of mind entirely, automating it away through habits, changes to environment, etc. While probably[2] effective, systems give me zero motivation - they&#x27;re too arbitrary, generic.<p>It&#x27;s a problem that, even in this formulation, I&#x27;ve been trying to solve for almost a decade now. Recently, I&#x27;ve started thinking about what <i>actually</i> motivates me about a project in an ongoing fashion; the insight I had today is that it&#x27;s a combination of the &quot;project&quot; and &quot;journey&quot; factors:<p>- The base &#x2F; fallback motivation is the goal - the benefit I&#x27;ll get when I reach it. Often, the major one is that someone will be satisfied or impressed. Even more often, it&#x27;s the relief of getting the consequences of not completing it of my mental threat board, and&#x2F;or shutting up people who pester me about it. However, that alone is only able to keep the project on my mind; it&#x27;s not enough to motivate sustained work.<p>- The immediate-term, ongoing motivation is the journey, or specifically the <i>experience of proficiency</i>, and all the interesting tangents I find along the way. It&#x27;s a necessary condition for me to stay on the task, but I can&#x27;t treat it as the main motivation itself - when I try, my mind evaluates the value of the activity as zero and pulls emergency brakes; after all, there are much easier ways to get immediate gratification, and there are more important things to do, so if I don&#x27;t care about reaching the goal, what&#x27;s the point of going for it in the first place?<p>Systems don&#x27;t even enter the motivational equation here[3].<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say here is that, in terms of motivation, the completion of a project and the journey to it are two different things entirely; treating them as alternatives is a category error.<p>Also my rambling here is saying that, at this moment, nothing for me has the right combination of &quot;project&quot; and &quot;journey&quot; factors - otherwise I&#x27;d be doing something else than writing HN comments.<p>(And yes, finishing projects completely is hard, because that last 20% of work contains the 80% of chores and annoying tangents that completely ruin the experience of the journey.)<p>--<p>- [0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;How_to_Fail_at_Almost_Everything_and_Still_Win_Big" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;How_to_Fail_at_Almost_Everythi...</a><p>- [1] - Via <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;quotes&#x2F;973029-a-goal-is-a-specific-objective-that-you-either-achieve" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;quotes&#x2F;973029-a-goal-is-a-specific...</a><p>- [2] - Hard to tell, I&#x27;m clinically unable to hold a simplest habit to save my life.

Iâm building a door right now for my patio, and let me tell you that itâs next to impossible to redo the design of a piece of wood once youâve milled it down to a certain size or shaped it, so you learn to think very clearly about the goals of a project and the design before you cut anything. In my off time, I donât want to endlessly struggle to finish things, so I donât do software. I also do simracing, which also has bite sized goals, like âimprove my safety rating to Xâ or âpost three clean laps on a new trackâ. Though, no matter the hobby, you have to be able to set a small goal and achieve it pretty quick, so Iâll tell myself âjust finish the tenons on these frame parts rough, then you can finish them tomorrow.â<p>Edit: To add, I donât expect perfection from my wood projects. There are gaps and cracks, I use the wrong wood or donât orient the grains properly, etc. That doesnât matter, though, because everyone who sees my projects are amazed at my skill, partly because they donât know where to look for the errors, but also because just finishing anything physical like a door represents a great feat that most wonât even try.

I like to say Iâm a framer and drywaller. Someone else needs to come in to mud, sand, paint, and trim. Iâve never worked well at that level of detail. Itâs another reason Iâm not very good with GUIs. Lots of detail. But, these are GUI projects.<p>But also, I shipped my â1.0â. I do not consider it an MVP. No, itâs done. I have no real plans to go back to it.<p>If I were to ship an MVP, thatâs just an excuse (for me) to not finish it. And I did not want to leave a lingering carcass. My drive is already filled with those.<p>So I continue to push my boulder in silence. Maybe I can release this thing next year. Waiting for the breeze to come up again.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41431717" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41431717" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">k2so</span><span>|</span><a href="#41431202">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41429729">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41431717">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41431717">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I very strongly relate to this, it&#x27;s been close to 3 months, since I have started working on a blog built on Quarto, and all I have so far is a elaborate design and a half complete blog on an LLM tool I had built.<p>But like the comments say, I had way too much fun on the journey of a side project, just doing other things like configuring the website and playing around with the design elements like font and how the overall website looks (I&#x27;m a data scientist and never usually get to play with design as much as I want to at work).

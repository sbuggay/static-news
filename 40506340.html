a current perspective, in the interest of making build output more 
robust against annotation processors unintentionally being placed on the 
class path, the policy should not be the default anymore.&quot;<p>This makes sense, especially in light of the growing number of supply chain attacks. However, given how many libraries a typical Java application has in the classpath, most of which are transitive dependencies of popular frameworks, I foresee many build jobs not producing working binaries anymore when JDK23 is adopted. Plus, I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong, but I could bet that most people will fix the issue by simply adding the &quot;all-on&quot; switch to the command line instead of carefully evaluating which annotation processors are really needed by their codebase. So I am afraid that in the long term this change will not improve security or reduce build times. Unless maybe JDK 23 comes with some tool to print a catalogue of the annotation processors found in the classpath, with their respective purpose and documentation, so that developers can make an educated guess about what they need or don&#x27;t need.</div><br/><div id="40509683" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40509683" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">usrusr</span><span>|</span><a href="#40509373">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40509411">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40509683">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40509683">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; but I could bet that most people will fix the issue by simply adding the &quot;all-on&quot; switch to the command line<p>Definitely this. This is a dev experience problem.<p>&gt; Unless maybe JDK 23 comes with some tool to print a catalogue of the annotation processors found in the classpath, with their respective purpose and documentation, so that developers can make an educated guess about what they need or don&#x27;t need.<p>My thoughts on as to how a solution to the dev-x problem might look like go in the same direction: have a way to provide a file with an accept list, another file with a deny list (vetoing accept list entries when matching both) and, this would be the key devx feature, a mode to automatically populate the accept list file from the full scan. Teams who&#x27;d be tempted to run the &quot;all-on&quot; mode could keep it running on auto-populate accept file, put the auto-populated accept file in versioning and see additions to the processor zoo in commits. And de-trusting a processor (or speeding up the build) would be as easy as copying a line to the deny file.<p>Minor improvement that would probably come up at some point: the auto-generated accept file should better <i>not</i> automatically exclude entries exluded by the deny file so that replacing the deny with a subset from accept remains a straight-forward option, but chances are you might encounter some situations where some dev environments have a processor that other build environments don&#x27;t have (this would not exist in a perfect world..) and that would cause undesirable changes to the auto-generated accept file. So you&#x27;d want a stronger deny option that forbids already during the scan, either with some special syntax in the deny file or (better I think) an optional file for &quot;even higher priority deny&quot;.<p>As to auto-generating documentation for the educated guess: clearly a trade-off between content and conciseness. My vote would be offering a way for processors that want to be helpful (or misleading, in the attack scenario!) to supply text for trailing line comments in the auto-generated accept file. For teams who do want to use the auto option. (trailing line comments are such an under-utilized magic compromise for conciseness&#x2F;volume conflicts, probably because they aren&#x27;t for readers running their editors with auto-wrap)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40509411" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40509411" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">twic</span><span>|</span><a href="#40509373">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40509550">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40509411">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40509411">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; As of the April 2024 JDK security updates, support for the &quot;-proc:full&quot; option has been backported to 17u (17.0.11) and 11u (11.0.23) for both Oracle JDK and OpenJDK distributions.<p>Someone tell me again how LTS isn&#x27;t a think for OpenJDK.</div><br/><div id="40509722" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40509722" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">usrusr</span><span>|</span><a href="#40509411">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40509550">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40509722">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40509722">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I read this as &quot;the updated versions can now tolerate the option that makes future versions behave the same without calling out an error: invalid flag&quot;<p>This is exactly how you want an LTS to be supported long term.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40509550" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40509550" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">foobarkey</span><span>|</span><a href="#40509411">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40506954">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40509550">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40509550">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Mixed feelings about this one, now every project has to start tweaking compiler options for lombok etc, I kind of like how it works out of the box.<p>I guess if you have a crazy project and a lot of transitive dependencies there is a small chance some processor lands on the classpath accidently and starts processing things, but I have not ran into this in practice</div><br/></div></div><div id="40506954" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40506954" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MarkSweep</span><span>|</span><a href="#40509550">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40509664">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40506954">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40506954">[31 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I assume this is to prevent a file-dropping attack, similar to DLL injection.<p>How hard is this to exploit in practice?

Very - this is a silly update in OpenJDK&#x27;s war against things like Project Lombok.<p>It _seems_ easy to exploit: Just.. get any jar file containing an annotation processor on the classpath and it will be executed as part of `javac` - and almost every java build tool calls javac under the hood.<p>However, this is misleading: _if_ somebody with malicious intent manages to either sneak a jar file into the build dependencies somehow, or manages to libxz-style take control of a commonly used dependency, the damage is done. That jar will also be on the classpath when running the app. So now we&#x27;re running compromised code. Java is not a sandboxed thing, running malicious code inside a JVM is a bit like an XSS web attack: The game is lost. Totally and utterly.<p>The fact that javac runs annotation processors by default until JDK23 does mean that a compromised build chain now runs _during the build_, whereas starting with JDK23 they&#x27;ll only run when you run the app.<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem impactful to me; I&#x27;m having a hard time figuring out scenarios where this is meaningfully less bad. Developers tend to run the app they are writing. The odds a developer will build a source tree and never actually run what they built, seems insufficient to consider this a meaningful contribution to security.<p>CI servers might be a useful place to look for &#x27;systems that will run the build but will not run the app&#x27;, except - no. Just about every CI tool will run some tests, thus, running the app, thus, running the malicious code.<p>Which gets us back to: OpenJDK&#x27;s backwards-compatibility breaking crusade.

You cannot break backward compatibility where it must not be expected. These are classes that carry a warning saying: these are internal classes that offer no kind of backward compatibility and can be changed at any time and without warning; by depending on them you are accepting upon yourself the responsibility to respond to any change. Nevertheless, in most situations we are offering plenty of advance warning.<p>Second, the &quot;crusade&quot; isn&#x27;t done to break anything or against anyone, but because these internal and not-backward-compatibility-breaking changes are necessary to offer Java users the features they&#x27;re asking for. We&#x27;re talking about changes to the very core assumptions of the platform, which could violate any invariant and have a global impact, that could have been made by any code in any transitive library. In order to offer certain features the platform must know which of its invariants it may trust (for example, the JIT compiler cannot perform certain optimisations that assume strings are immutable because even though it is an invariant of the platform, some third-level dependency could have decided that actually strings would be mutable in any application that consumes this library).<p>Because more people want the features that require integrity [1] than those who want the ability for any transitive dependency to secretly change the rules of the game, our &quot;crusade&quot; is to give our users what they&#x27;re asking for. Of course, when the user base is this large, different people have contradictory wishes, and so a minority of users may be disappointed that we&#x27;ve decided to give other users what they asked for.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s sort of like stating that security is improved by ensuring that it is no longer possible to open the front door from inside the house without a key. Seems nice - but, they&#x27;re... already inside the house.<p>Yeah, one, this is not about security but about integrity -- as explained in the motivation [1] -- which is, indeed, essential for security but for other important things as well, and two, your security analysis is just wrong. That is why for security is best to rely on security experts and not on people unfamiliar with the field who go by what seems to make sense to them or not.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openjdk.org&#x2F;jeps&#x2F;8305968" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openjdk.org&#x2F;jeps&#x2F;8305968</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40508888" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40508888" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pjmlp</span><span>|</span><a href="#40506954">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40507405">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40509854">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40507774">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40508888">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40508888">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Had some developers not starting to Monkey patch this wouldn&#x27;t be needed, Java isn&#x27;t Ruby.<p>Go is now going to do a similar approach, because internals and not being public symbols apparently isn&#x27;t clear enough.</div><br/><div id="40509698" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40509698" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">josefx</span><span>|</span><a href="#40506954">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40508888">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40507774">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40509698">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40509698">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Public&#x2F;private does nothing to change the problems a developer has to deal with.

Annotation processors canât modify classes, this is a fact. The primary purpose of Lombok is <i>adding</i> new methods like getX and setX to <i>the same class</i> based on fields.

This is a completely reasonable decision on the Java teamâs part (and quite narcissistic to conclude that it is due to your lib..), as many of the breaking changes between 8 and 9 were actually due to libraries doing exactly that.

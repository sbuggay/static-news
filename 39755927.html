It reminds me of something I&#x27;d get from just using some admin UI for a database.<p>I was a salesforce technical architect and consultant for a number of years (hated it.) and what I&#x27;ve seen is that some of the first things people look for are reports, dashboards, workflows, integration. A lot of people think their sales process is super unique and want to see a path of implementing it in a system and that includes integrating it with a bunch of other systems already in place.<p>For smaller companies, sourcing leads, creating and tracking email campaigns, is probably the first thing they look for.<p>Some feedback for your website:<p>* gifs&#x2F;videos take a while to load and stay blurred<p>* The linkedin example is great, show more like this<p>* Ability to add custom fields&#x2F;objects is expected, doubt anyone would be impressed by that<p>* Show some canned dashboards and reports on the data</div><br/><div id="39757388" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39757388" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ucarion</span><span>|</span><a href="#39757201">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39757609">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39757388">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39757388">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Totally agree we&#x27;re way too barebones to say we&#x27;re an SFDC alternative today.

Integrations is going to be a long list of work. Going to feel like working at Segment again. :)<p>For sourcing and campaigns, our initial plan is a two-way Apollo integration. Not sure if you have thoughts on the necessity of doing everything in-house (the Hubspot approach) or just focusing on integrating with the best tools (the Salesforce approach).<p>Your feedback on the website is well taken.

I&#x27;ve honestly never seen anyone in mid&#x2F;big companies consider Zapier, but it&#x27;s been a few years since I was in that space, so could have changed. Getting into those bigger companies, you&#x27;re basically going to need everything, or hope for a small team within the company to like your CRM.<p>Those small teams&#x2F;companies basically want a simple Hubspot, not salesforce, but a lot of times, they don&#x27;t really know the difference. Something that can take Apollo leads, build some &quot;simple&quot; email campaigns [1], some landing pages [2], track one-off emails and report on all that for cheaper than the $25k&#x2F;yr or whatever hubspot charges would be a great tool. I know, not exactly a CRM, but people call it that.<p>I don&#x27;t think it matters if you integrate other providers or build it in, but having an easy setup where users don&#x27;t have to go sign up, manage and integrate with a bunch of other services could help you get the small&#x2F;startup space.<p>[1] Lots of things to deal with if you&#x27;re taking on the email sending &amp; tracking part, automated clicks, safari privacy, etc.

I bet most companies in the space take a Quick Look at number of users that would benefit and easily decide that it’s not worth the effort.

Hotkeys would also be really nice at some point as you develop the app.  Probably just really early in your development to refine these things.<p>You mention your path to success being a &quot;modern UX&quot; and I think that is great, if by &quot;modern UX&quot; you mean (at least in part- a major part) &quot;much faster and more responsive than Salesforce&quot;.

Every sales or CS agent needs to know what is their next task: they shouldn’t go through the list of the deals or customers to figure that out. Ideally they get their tasks assigned in some round robin algorithm taking into account their availability and skills. If agents nevertheless work with lists, they are going to create several dozens of views filtering certain stages of journeys and build up arcane knowledge on how to look at them. Not great, but if they want it, it must work - they are stakeholders in CRM purchasing process. Overall CRM must be customizable on tasks and journeys level, not just on record field level.<p>Do you need Apex for that? God, please, no. Apex doubles or triples the cost of Salesforce, because you usually end up spending tens of thousands euro on some agency doing the customization. If you want to compete with SF, offer Java,  JavaScript or TypeScript as lambda or managed microservice hosting with fast links to your db&#x2F;api (and do it better than Heroku).

Salesforce was one of the options.<p>They were a sales organization, so CRM was a very central tool for them, and they needed lots of customization and applications build on top of the CRM. So CRM selection was more than selecting a tool, it was selecting a platform, an ecosystem, method of developing apps etc.<p>The reason they were considering the alternatives at all was that practically all of the MS Dynamics customization was built based on direct database access, and Microsoft no longer supports the versions that allow that. That, and all CRM development was behind one person, which was huge risk for a multi-billion dollar company.<p>Salesforce was one of the alternatives, not due to it being technically superior, or even having a better UI, but because this customer was not really a software house, so they wanted to avoid in-house software development as much as possible. One part of that was to outsource CRM-related development, to &quot;focus on their core competencies&quot;.<p>When people say &quot;network effects&quot;, this is what they talk about. What would have it taken for them to consider a startup like this as the CRM platform? They did not really consider HubSpot nor 100% custom frameworks as alternatives. You had to be in the Gartner magic quandrant to be considered a serious alternative.<p>I am not saying you should target customers like this, but I believe it may helpful to think if this is the kind of customer you want to win in the long run, and what would it take to win a customer like this.<p>In that company, sales wanted MS Dynamics, because that was what the sales people were used to. IT wanted Salesforce, because they believed they could just outsource the CRM-related development work to Salesforce consultants, and integration narrative is strong for Salesforce due to Mulesoft.<p>They ended up choosing MS Dynamics, because in a sales orgazation, sales brings in the money, so everything else supports sales, and sales calls the shots.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39762913" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39762913" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mvkel</span><span>|</span><a href="#39762548">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39757514">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39762913">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39762913">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; We think the way you win in CRM in 2024 is by keeping the flexibility of SObjects, and then tacking on modern UX.<p>What is driving that thinking?

This interface looks slick and I&#x27;m excited to see your product progress. Hopefully I can get beta access ;)<p>I have some QA feedback for some quirks I noticed and some potential feature ideas&#x2F;requests:<p>1) On the companies list, it would be nice if you automatically grabbed the favicon.ico from the domain. It would be nice if you could tether fields together so information can be automatically derived from other fields. This could include an area for custom scripts to do this automatically.<p>2) While using the demo I was automatically logged out. I&#x27;m wondering if someone else logged in and then my session was killed? Also, when I was logged out, I was given a white screen of death when I clicked back on the history, but was given no redirect. E.g. pressing back sent me to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.okapicrm.com&#x2F;objects&#x2F;companies">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.okapicrm.com&#x2F;objects&#x2F;companies</a> but I&#x27;m just stuck with a page with the title &quot;Title&quot; and an empty div[id=&quot;react-root&quot;] node.<p>3) Because you end the password with a period, if I double click on the password and copy that, it will put the wrong password in my clipboard. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this period was part of the password or not until I logged in and tried without the period<p>4) At first, it wasn&#x27;t obvious the search feature was only available for the current page you were on. E.g. I tried accessing search on the reminders page, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.okapicrm.com&#x2F;reminders">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.okapicrm.com&#x2F;reminders</a>, and I wasn&#x27;t sure what was suppose to happen after I typed something in. There was no visual feedback that a search query was being processed, or had been processed. Once I tried it on another page was it clear that the search feature was searching for records visible on the current page. Also, because it is so quick, I wonder if this is purely a client-side search. If I have a Records page with a paginated number of records, will the search be able to find records which are not visible on the current page? If not, I would find this super frustrating as a user.<p>5) If I look at the details page for a company record, the fields for the domain and icon url are not links. i.e. on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.okapicrm.com&#x2F;records&#x2F;e8e09b41-25ab-4889-92bb-987b78549cda">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.okapicrm.com&#x2F;records&#x2F;e8e09b41-25ab-4889-92bb-987...</a> I cannot click on QAComet.com or the icon url.<p>6) I&#x27;m not sure I understand why fields which point to an archived record must be cleared. Could you keep those fields and just use some kind of visual indicator (such as a red highlight or background) to show the record being pointed at is archived?<p>7) When I clicked the archive button, there was no visual feedback the website was loading. It would have been nice to at least change the cursor over the modal to a &quot;cursor: wait&quot; while it was making the archive request.<p>Hopefully you find these points useful!</div><br/><div id="39759187" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39759187" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ucarion</span><span>|</span><a href="#39759090">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39756605">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39759187">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39759187">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">These are all great points!<p>1.

I want to fix this, and I just haven&#x27;t because I haven&#x27;t made the UI for filtering what objects to search across. The backend is in place though. Glad it seems suspiciously fast!

This is a space I&#x27;ve thought about a lot in my 12 years as CTO of a consulting agency that centers around Salesforce.<p>Salesforce&#x27;s &quot;killer&quot; feature really is the Custom Object.  You can create a new data model, customize a UI and have a production API up and running immediately.  I&#x27;ve been wondering when someone would attempt a modern take on this, and this seems like a decent start (from what I can tell in the video, login doesn&#x27;t work).<p>Competitors like Hubspot do provide better functionality OOTB, but as soon as you want to automate or integrate, you quickly realize that they haven&#x27;t &quot;doggedfooded&quot; their API&#x27;s.  Most business&#x27;s of moderate size &amp; complexity will eventually outgrow the platform.<p>&gt; One thing we can’t decide if it’s a need-to-have is Apex<p>You might start with the just more serverless style event hooks that fire after the DB commits, but eventually you will need something that can be more &quot;transactional&quot;.<p>But please... for the love of god... do not roll your own language like apex.  Just pick something like typescript and sandbox it.<p>Same goes for UI components.  Don&#x27;t build your own crappy web component framework... Just figure out how to allow custom react&#x2F;svelte&#x2F;etc components to be embedded.<p>Other thoughts:<p>- Don&#x27;t wait to nail down your access control model.  One of the most daunting aspects for Salesforce Admin is designing the access control and entitlements model. For Custom Objects make sure to cover both FLS and RLS.  IMO, the Salesforce approach here is pretty good, but just the admin UX is an absolute fire full.<p>- IF you build a low code workflow tool, enable it to transpile to a simple text based language and back.  Salesforce Flow is a nightmare to maintain because the visual abstractions mask the details and make it impossible to construct a mental model.<p>- The SF metadata and deployment model has caused so much pain and they&#x27;ve still never been able to fix it.

Here are ten CRM systems known for their ability to support custom data objects:<p>Salesforce: Known for its high degree of customization, Salesforce allows users to create custom objects to store specific business data and relate to other records within the system.<p>Microsoft Dynamics 365: Offers extensive customization capabilities, including the creation of custom entities (data objects) that can be integrated seamlessly with the rest of the system.<p>Zoho CRM: Provides the ability to create custom modules that can be designed to capture and manage business-specific information.<p>HubSpot CRM: Allows the creation of custom objects to store and organize data that doesn’t necessarily fit into the standard objects like contacts or companies.<p>Oracle NetSuite: Features a flexible platform that includes the ability to create and manage custom records tailored to your business needs.<p>SAP CRM: Part of the SAP Business Suite, SAP CRM offers the flexibility to extend its core functionalities with custom objects to meet specific business requirements.<p>Pipedrive: Known for its user-friendly interface, Pipedrive also offers custom fields and, in some plans, the ability to create entirely custom data objects.<p>SugarCRM: Provides a highly customizable platform where users can create custom modules and fields to adapt the CRM to their business processes.<p>Insightly: Offers custom fields and records, allowing users to tailor the CRM system to better fit their specific business needs and workflows.<p>Freshsales (Freshworks CRM): Allows for the customization of the CRM with custom fields and modules, enabling businesses to track unique data points relevant to their operations.&quot;</div><br/><div id="39759619" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39759619" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ragnarok451</span><span>|</span><a href="#39758331">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39758514">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39758787">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39759619">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39759619">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Shame that this is downvoted, I assume for tone - this is the feedback the founders need to hear</div><br/><div id="39760181" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39760181" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xcdzvyn</span><span>|</span><a href="#39758331">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39759619">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39760125">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39760181">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39760181">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t have any skin in this game, but I personally think &quot;Your relatively long thoughtful reply is wrong; source: this paragraph a glorified Markov chain threw together&quot; is really offensive.

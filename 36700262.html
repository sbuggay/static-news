There is nothing more frustrating than a non-technical cofounder who underestimates what technical work requires. And honestly, the stereotype of &quot;non-technical founder needs technical co-founder&quot; is some asshat with no real clue who will make their partner miserable. Besides, there is a huge imbalance of supply and demand.<p>But potential technical co-founders are much more receptive to, &quot;Non-technical founder needs technical founder to help turn crappy prototype into product. The idea is good, but I know how much I need your help.&quot;<p>Why are technical people more receptive to that?<p>- The fact that there is a prototype makes it much more likely that the idea isn&#x27;t just vague handwaving.<p>- The non-technical co-founder is willing to put elbow grease in.<p>- The non-technical co-founder&#x27;s humility is going to limit unreasonable demands.<p>So willingness to begin the work yourself makes you MORE attractive.</div><br/><div id="36719288" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36719288" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dasil003</span><span>|</span><a href="#36718091">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36718374">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36719288">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36719288">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is great advice, and I&#x27;d generalize it the other way too.  Ideally you want both founders to be willing to do whatever the highest value work is regardless of how closely it matches their skills.  We often put technical skills on a pedestal because there&#x27;s a high bar just to get started, but often times building the next feature is not the most important thing you can do.  Most people rationalize doing what they feel competent at, versus sober thinking about what is really needed and figuring out a way to do it <i>well enough</i> to get to the next stage.  Eventually you can and should hire people do these things, but in the earliest stage having one or two brains fully dedicated to figuring out the repeatable business loop end-to-end gives you dramatically more agility and opportunity for insight than limiting yourself to well-defined roles and expertise.</div><br/><div id="36720469" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36720469" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xeonmc</span><span>|</span><a href="#36718091">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36719288">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36718374">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36720469">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36720469">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In short: founders should have T-shaped expertise.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36718374" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36718374" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xeonmc</span><span>|</span><a href="#36718091">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36719288">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36718462">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36718374">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36718374">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was told that the crux of being a founder is to be prepared to do <i>everything</i> yourself at least somewhat, and delegate because you don&#x27;t have time to do everything rather than because you can&#x27;t.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36718462" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36718462" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neilv</span><span>|</span><a href="#36718091">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36718374">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36717290">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36718462">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36718462">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>&quot;Non-technical founder needs technical founder to help turn crappy prototype into product.

I&#x27;m building two right now (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;turas.app" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;turas.app</a> is one).<p>Except for the rare cases where you have something that&#x27;s an instant hit, doing anything that&#x27;s B2B SaaS is incredibly difficult without warm intros.  Even getting calls to talk to potential customers in some spaces is difficult without the right network or know how to get connected to that network.<p>Having done this a few times now, it is more clear to me what I want from a non-technical co-founder:<p><pre><code>    - Be a domain subject matter expert.  Most interesting problems require understanding some process or flow of information, documents, money, etc.  
    - Already identified and quantified the price for removing some friction or cost from that process&#x2F;flow.
    - Have high level industry connections (C-level, VPs, IT decision makers).  If you&#x27;re building B2B SaaS, being connected to the people that will actually make the decisions will make your life a lot easier.
    - OR have proven track record of marketing. Consumer and e-commerce are really, really hard spaces.  You really need to know what you&#x27;re doing with marketing and social media.  Managing those is a full-time job and as a founding&#x2F;sole engineer, it&#x27;s a poor use of time.
    - Already have letter of intent to buy or other commitment to pay for a product that solves some problem if B2B.  One startup I joined, the co-founder had sold the product as a set of requirements.  The enterprise customer was so excited for the solution, they paid for a pilot based solely on the requirements.

Like an engineer on a larger team, the founding engineer needs to be able to execute and build product, quickly. They need to be aware of technical debt and when assuming it makes sense. They need to write code that works, is testable and performant. They need to evaluate whether to build or buy or download from Github. Theyâll be performing devops tasks as well, such as monitoring the application, troubleshooting performance issues, and making sure deployments and rollbacks happen cleanly.<p>In addition to all of that, the founding engineer must communicate with non technical folks, both within the organization (including the CEO) and outside of the company. The founding engineer may or may not be doing tier 1 customer support, but will be doing tier 2 support. They also have to be willing and able to drive decisions, especially around technical issues. They need to be able to understand and give feedback on the business strategy at some level, as that will determine technical decisions. The founding engineer also needs to able and willing to take market feedback. This may be filtered through others, and any response should be discussed with the other founders, but market feedback and quick iteration is a strength of a startup. The founding engineer may be doing some product management as well, depending on the other team membersâ strengths. Theyâll be the de-facto UX designer. They also will be interacting with vendors and contractors. They may review budgets and will hire technical team members. Itâs possible theyâll interact with investors if funding is sought.<p>For all the additional responsibilities, the founding engineer should be compensated, well, like a founder.

(Sure you want to use the racecar metaphor here?)<p>Before that bit, I was thinking maybe I was picking up on small oopses in the writing, and the writer actually did intend an equal partnership.  But this really does sound like the writer is speaking to someone who thinks of the company as only theirs, and the technical cofounder is an underling and a necessary evil.  And further, the technical cofounder is someone who could be discarded once they&#x27;ve served their funding bootstrapping purpose.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36717875" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36717875" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">catsarebetter</span><span>|</span><a href="#36718278">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36719408">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36717875">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36717875">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just to add, you have to like them.

I am serial startup CTO with a variety of outcomes. I never made a billion but I had enough successful exits and careful investments that after 20 years I am comfortable (still hoping for the lottery outcome though).<p>I was very naive for a long time about the realities of the world, as I currently see them. There is a wealthy and connected class that exists in the world. There is not some secret cabal that controls whoâs in and whoâs out, but rather relationships and reputation and references. Having a good family is a very strong signal - a parent who runs a company, a parent whoâs a billionaire, a background that can give you legitimacy. As a ânew manâ you can become part of this class through guile and wit and success, but you are operating on hard mode.<p>A lot of people in the money class by birth (which are most of them) are not inherently successful. But their connections open so many doors.<p>The entrepreneur I have hitched my horse to, which has assembled a trusted team of executives and VPs, is part of this class in addition to already being worth tens of millions from successful exits. He is hungry beyond all belief and desires to be a billionaire, and he is quite skilled and hard working despite being born into low-tier wealthy family. His ability to get calls with the rich and successful is absurd. He wanted to speak with Mark Cuban and he got him on the phone to pitch him within days - just one example where I am name dropping someone to illustrate the type of things he can do. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of who knows who, who owns this business and who made this thing, he also knows various people in entertainment and the arts and gets them to vouch and rep his various interests. A famous pop musician tweeted one of his ventures as a favor and drove a lot of users. He networks like you wonât believe and owns property in NYC, LA, Miami, and jet sets around the US &#x2F; Europe &#x2F; Dubai as needed for business.<p>I am pretty sure my children will be similar to how he started in terms of connections based upon my help and the school I send them to. However I started very low in society and used technology skills and hard work as the mechanism to elevate myself and hustle to get to the place I am now.<p>As tech people on HN we value ourselves so much. Yes we have a lot of skills and are necessary and provide value. But guys like my CEO are key to succeeding in business and without him I couldnât do my job and succeed in the way I want.<p>Who you know runs the world. As the technical cofounder we are not the deal makers nor the money people, who truly have the value and upper hand. Iâm not trying to depress you, nor say you canât do it without someone like this. But once you start really seeing how the 90% case works - how this company gets follow on money despite inferior product because some VC owes a favor, how this company gets acquired for more than itâs worth because of some friendly connection, why this company gets a seed easily and yours canât get anything despite traction. Itâs just how stuff works.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36719124" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36719124" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">1letterunixname</span><span>|</span><a href="#36719619">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36719124">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36719124">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Your unproven startup<p>Rather than feeding the ego of a solo founder who wants to play the big chief, I hope this implies forming a cofounder team with equal equity.<p>Nontechnical founders can&#x27;t be &quot;idea guys&quot;, robotic people managers, or too precious to whatever needs doing. They have to be hustlers first, connected, and making fat stacks with potential customers, partners, and the media. And then, with the other founders, responsible for everything that needs doing and prioritizing in the midst of ambiguity. Always be &quot;parkouring&quot; up the market from one meeting or customer to the next while building product just in time.<p>Technical cofounders need social skills, resourcefulness, and a hint of business acumen. It&#x27;s never enough to only be technical. UX, design, FE, BE, ops, budgeting, audit&#x2F;regulations&#x2F;compliance&#x2F;security, disaster recovery&#x2F;business continuity, technical mentoring, and long-term roadmapping are all important areas to address. Initially, there will be a great deal of dev pain due to a lack of common platform services and tooling. It&#x27;s important that a technical leader be able to eventually scale up a team that can establish (build or buy) standard practices and tools, divide responsibilities, and delegate.<p>When in doubt, work with someone you already know and trust because too many people don&#x27;t or can&#x27;t act cool when real money appears. There&#x27;s no magic formula, but there are other cool kids with that twinkle in their eye out there. Honesty and obsessive workaholism seem to help.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

Your work becomes traversal and mutation of this tree. Several benefits accrue: you begin to see gaps in the tree, and can fill them in. You begin to have confidence in your mental model, recovering the time you used to spend going over the same nodes again and again in a haphazard way. In distributed systems in particular, the work is often detailed, manual, error prone and high latency - with a solid mental model you can get through a checklist of steps with minimum difficulty and high confidence that you didn&#x27;t miss anything. This ability to take something abstract and make it more concrete on the fly is a critical skill.<p>Perhaps the greatest barrier to using it is akin to envy. We see others who apparently do this without written materials, in their head. I think we see this as evidence of intellectual superiority and harbor the doubt that using an aid like a journal means we are somehow lacking in skill or ability. This is wrong. Using an aid to map out complex problems isn&#x27;t a failure, it&#x27;s essential, especially for problems in systems you&#x27;ve never used before.

If you&#x27;re doing mundane work, keeping notes is just busywork and doesn&#x27;t really have a payoff.<p>But if you&#x27;re constantly trying to solve novel problems, and  have episodic ideas that are half-baked, writing notes -- without trying to organize them first -- can be really powerful. For me, I just write them in Logseq and tag them with a few hashtags like #topic1 #topic2 #topic3. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a perfect tag, just tag it with all the topics you think are relevant.<p>From time to timeI click a hashtag and revisit all my half-baked ideas  -- periodic revisits and curation is key --  I surprise myself when some peripherally connected notes coalesce into a real idea. (Logseq makes this easy because each note is bullet point that can be tagged, and clicking on a tag is like running a query)<p>This is called the Fieldstone method. (conceptualized by Gerard Weinberg). It&#x27;s a very useful approach for writers because it recognizes that the best ideas are episodic and don&#x27;t all come at once, you have to gather the &quot;stones&quot; over a long time before something gels.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Weinberg-Writing-Fieldstone-Gerald-M&#x2F;dp&#x2F;093263365X" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Weinberg-Writing-Fieldstone-Gerald-M&#x2F;...</a><p>I&#x27;ve used it with great success over the years (both at work and in my writing).</div><br/></div></div><div id="40951609" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40951609" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">simpaticoder</span><span>|</span><a href="#40951259">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40951481">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40951667">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40952029">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40951609">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40951609">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Keep trying. Try different methods. What works for me debugging and refactoring distributed systems may not work for you. The thing I tend to drive toward is a single page mind-map-like artifact that is monotonically increasing in density with a focus on system-of-record and data flow. I tend to keep notes about individual tech and important systems in whatever tools are handy, either locally or in a form that are accessible to the team. Often this takes the form of a JIRA page per topic, or an nvAlt note per topic. Tickets aren&#x27;t great for this because they are ephemeral. These notes are where code snippets, error messages, anything searchable, go. I have something like the Zettlekasten[1] method in the back of my mind when deciding on scope of these support notes. However I may also start from a simple local text file, not committed to the repository, or even attached as a note to a ticket or other ephemeral trigger. But the thing that ties it all together, for me, is that mind map.

Each day I create a new file for the day by copying the lists of the previous day&#x27;s file minus the DONE list. I don&#x27;t modify lists for previous days, so it&#x27;s kind of an append-only log so I can see what was the state for any particular day. 1 file per day is easy to see as a whole as it mostly fits in one screen (and inside my working memory).

Every morning, I create a new Markdown file with the day&#x27;s date, copy the previous day&#x27;s content into it, and edit it. Mine has (for now) the following sections: Morning checklist, Todo, Done, and Meeting Notes.<p>The morning checklist consists of things like checking email, checking Teams, skimming the team&#x27;s handover queue, logging into various things, etc.<p>Todo is a stack of things I can&#x2F;should tackle. Most important ones to the top. I limit it to 15 items, no matter what. But realistically, I typically only interact with about the top 5 99% of the time.<p>Done gets wiped every morning and I add things to it as I do them. Things like, &quot;emailed Joe Schmo for 3rd time to ask for ETA&quot;, or &quot;helped Fred troubleshoot the frobnitz.&quot; Little things that I would totally forget about but cumulatively end up taking a huge chunk of the day. I&#x27;ve never had a boss that expressed a concern, but I think of it as my primary defense if anyone accuses me of slacking off all day. (Maybe it&#x27;s just to convince myself...)<p>Each meeting I go to gets its own section for the day. If the content was important enough to save into my second brain[1], I clean it up and transfer it over there at the end of the day, or the beginning of the next day at worst.<p>Any complex investigation or rabbit hole gets its own section as well. It&#x27;s astonishingly difficult for me to actually reason about any complex system or design without writing it out and actually describing it to myself. I envy those who can just &quot;see&quot; it all at once in their mind&#x27;s eye. If ends up being important enough to save, I will clean it up and share it with the team and&#x2F;or dump it into my personal wiki.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cu&#x2F;silicon">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cu&#x2F;silicon</a></div><br/><div id="40952088" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40952088" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">phito</span><span>|</span><a href="#40950967">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40951646">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40952088">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40952088">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have the exact same workflow!

It is sort of a mix between GTD [1] and journalling.<p>I create a new file monthly (since that is the &quot;sprint&quot; duration at work) and for each project I am working on, I create a project heading and a list of tasks below each. The plugin doesn&#x27;t enforce any schema and is just a plain text file so I can iterate on the task list, record thoughts as free form notes anywhere (just below the project heading or below a particular task or just in the file anywhere.<p>If the notes grow too large for a particular project (they don&#x27;t usually for me), I pull them in a separate file dedicated to that project.<p>I iterate on the task list as things become more clear. For eg. I might start as &quot;Find out how to deploy new certificates on our cluster nodes&quot;. Once I have done some research or talked to my colleagues, I might mark this a done or delete it and replace it with a list of steps required to deploy the certificates.<p>I also mark things I am going to do today with &quot;@today&quot; every day in the morning. If something planned comes up urgently, it gets it own task with &quot;@critical&quot; tag. The plugin highlights these tags for me.<p>There are some more features but I only use creating and marking tasks as done with the 2 tags. The plugin is also semi-abandoned which is a big +1 for me as I don&#x27;t have to worry about flow breaking changes or sudden sponsorship messages or constant updates.<p>I don&#x27;t use sublime for anything else but tracking tasks and notes so it gives me a sort of dedicated workspace for collecting my tasks. Recall is just a plain text search away. I have been using this for many years and has been extremely effective for me. Whenever I feel lost of overwhelmed, I just look this file, find the @today tags and suddenly I am back in my flow.<p>Most of the other tools I have tried (Jira, Asana, Trello, Github&#x2F;Gitlab issues, Azure DevOps, company internal project management tooling etc.) are too opinionated, not flexible enough, sends unnecessary notifications to me or everyone on the team and are a chore to maintain (busywork).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aziz&#x2F;PlainTasks">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aziz&#x2F;PlainTasks</a>

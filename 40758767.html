This was my dad&#x27;s baby. He loved the engineering and the science of it and so the idea of retiring from it was difficult for him to conceive. Doing that also requires thinking about one&#x27;s mortality which I also believe was difficult for him.<p>2. This was a small market business in a tier 2 city in India. Attracting talent that could take it over was challenging. And myself and my siblings having been born and brought up in the States and being utterly clueless about the engineering&#x2F;science of the company made us a non-starter.<p>3. As others have pointed out, he was thinking about succession&#x2F;exit because he knew it was required for the biz to live on and grow. But life unfortunately had other plans and he was taken away from us unexpectedly.<p>There are definitely lots of could haves, should haves, would haves, etc I&#x27;ve thought about afterwards, but this was clearly one of those &quot;play the cards you&#x27;re dealt&quot; kind of situations.<p>Thanks for reading.</div><br/><div id="40759589" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40759589" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">999900000999</span><span>|</span><a href="#40758990">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40759208">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40760929">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40759589">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40759589">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for writing a great article.<p>I was honestly impressed with how much you cared for your employees.<p>The American way would be to just sell it to the highest bidder without any concern for anything else.<p>Does India have a different social contract?

I have a strange detachment to my own family because of this.<p>* Thus, they have serious attachment issues and zero succession plans.<p>* My mom later passed away too soon and missed out much of the life experience she could have had. Glad that she did travel around the world before death.<p>* Even after all that, my old man still doesn’t have succession plan. Dunno what’s gonna happen to all the people working for him. And the clock is ticking.<p>* Like OP, I spent most of my life in the US, so I too would be useless in dealing with the businesses. Even the real estate company (something I know a bit in the US) is far too different back there.<p>Also, blatant corruption is simply not my cup of tea.<p>I tried to help them multiple times. I offered to sponsor them green card, but they consistently refused. I offered if they need help finding private equity to liquidate and just retire.

He had no plan, because he thought he could beat cancer.  His wife had to get his passwords while he was on his deathbed.<p>The day of his funeral, his wife begged me to look at his work laptop and help her out.  She even mentioned us being partners in the company.  I was already running my own successful company at the time and had almost no time do this.<p>I found the time and saved her probably close to $150,000 in customers pissed off because my brother stopped handling support due to his illness, forgotten about purchase orders, and a website that he pre-paid for $20,000 and was never delivered because he died and never told them he was sick.  They sent over the entire amount within a few days of me explaining the situation.<p>I never expected any money for this work,  I was just trying to clean up the business and get it back to a functional level.  A few months later, when she had time to grieve and think about things, she wanted to talk partnership.  Her first offer was to pay me $15&#x2F;hour, which I rejected (and laughed about later with my wife).<p>Her second offer was to give me 10% of the company and when her kids turned 18 in 8 years, they would get full control over the company (including my 10%).  I was personally offended because she essentially wanted me to maintain and build up the entire company, take a very low percentage along the way, only to hand over the entire company to her kids (my nephews).<p>When I explained this to her and rejected the offer, she told me that I had no skills beyond &#x27;answering emails&#x27; and that I didn&#x27;t &#x27;understand how business worked&#x27;.<p>Shortly after this, she found an email from my brother&#x27;s old friend who was very religious.  She had also recently found god and as a result, convinced this person that he needed to help her for free.  For the last 6 or 7 years, the business has been in maintenance mode with this person answering emails, for free.  I know the technical capabilities of this person and most responses are basically re-installing the software or rebooting the computer.  I am also in the tech industry and the job this person has is about the level I was at when I was 15 (I&#x27;m 45 now).<p>The result was as I expected: Most of his clients stopped re-purchasing licenses because there is no more support or bug fixes and you also just can&#x27;t trust the security of software after it hasn&#x27;t been updated in 10 years.<p>She now has to work a minimum wage job making meals for the elderly (which isn&#x27;t a bad thing) and the company is close to bankruptcy.  It was good we were never partners, because I probably would not have been able to start my next business.<p>It took my brother over a decade to build his successful company, and a few years for his wife to destroy it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40761413" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40761413" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">prakhar897</span><span>|</span><a href="#40764525">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40761496">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40761413">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40761413">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great Story!

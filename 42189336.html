We switch at 11am and hold a hand-off meeting at that time, and invite the whole team.<p>Hand-off meetings with the whole team work really well (in my opinion!) when you have a relatively small team--we have 9 FT teammates. Often someone else may have been delegated the page or bug that arose and can discuss how they handled it, or someone who wasn&#x27;t involved may have insight for how to handle a situation better the next time. Since we&#x27;re all going to be on rotation at least once during a quarter, it&#x27;s great to know what happened in case a similar page pops up later.<p>Finally, we also fill out a running Doc before&#x2F;during the meeting with links to the pages&#x2F;bugs, along with short descriptions of how they were handled.

Friday-to-Friday does sound good.<p>One thing I really liked in a previous job was a split daytime-vs-nighttime rotation. It was well worth a little annoyance to set up in our tools. One week you&#x27;d be the &#x27;daytime&#x27; oncall for business hours (something like 9-5 Mon-Fri, though we might have tweaked those hours a bit; it might have been 10-6 or something). The next you&#x27;d be on call for the complementary time (5-9, weekends). You were on call for the same total amount of time, just smeared over two different weeks. It ended up being less of a burden to optimize your schedule for a reasonable response time, but operational work still got done. And in practice awareness of operational issues was not too hard to maintain between the two members of the split.<p>(I think the <i>best</i> thing, if you can swing it, is probably a follow-the-sun rotation where there are three teams distributed 8 hours apart around the globe, and they trade off 8-hour workday shifts. But a lot of uncommon things probably have to be true of your organization for that idea to even be on the radar.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="42219274" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42219274" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">taberiand</span><span>|</span><a href="#42219205">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42219390">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42219228">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42219274">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42219274">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That was exactly my reasoning too when I set up our on call roster as Friday to Friday, though for us Saturday is the busiest day in terms of customer activity,  so it was a no-brainer.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42219228" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42219228" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thuanao</span><span>|</span><a href="#42219205">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42219512">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42219228">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42219228">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is anyone getting compensated for being on-call?

- Sat&#x2F;Sun<p>Original reason for this schedule was that on-call was paid by days per quarter in a tiered system so this guaranteed that all members got the 5% on-call for 10 days&#x2F;quarter rather than one person hitting 9 days and dropping to 3%, but I stand by this as a better on-call rotation.<p>The number of people does need to be not wholly divisible so the days rotate so if you run into this you can combine Fri into Sat&#x2F;Sun or break Sat&#x2F;Sun apart. It’s a bit complex to set up but the mental impact of on-call is greatly reduced and if you need a week for vacation you can much more easily find someone to cover your shift for a couple days in a nearby week rather than ending up with 2 weeks back to back 6 weeks from now. And if you pull a weekend you get the week off rather than losing your weekend to on-call and going into a work week still on-call.</div><br/><div id="42219542" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42219542" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bigiain</span><span>|</span><a href="#42219512">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42219568">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42219542">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42219542">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Any company that makes it an employee&#x27;s responsibility to find &quot;someone to cover&quot; their on call time while they&#x27;re on vacation is a company worth quitting.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;d be illegal here in .au<p>On call coverage while an employee is on vacation is a management problem, not an employee problem.</div><br/><div id="42219792" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42219792" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">glitchcrab</span><span>|</span><a href="#42219512">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42219542">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42219568">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42219792">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42219792">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Could not agree more, any company I&#x27;ve worked at with an on-call rotation has always ensured that staff are not scheduled when they have holiday booked. The only time an employee needed to find their own cover is if something unexpected came up during their on-call period and they needed a few hours out (like an emergency visit to the doctor with a child etc).<p>At my current job we have an automated scheduler which uses our gcal to ensure that it never schedules if people have an AFK entry. It also schedules fairly based on how long since the person was last on-call, not putting them on on a weekend if they were on last weekend etc (we do 24hr shifts).</div><br/><div id="42219880" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42219880" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jeduardo</span><span>|</span><a href="#42219512">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42219792">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42219568">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42219880">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42219880">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are you using an in-house scheduler or is this a feature of a particular tool?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42219568" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42219568" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zeroonetwothree</span><span>|</span><a href="#42219512">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42219177">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42219568">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42219568">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In my 20ish years I’ve done every possible day for oncall schedules.

Part of the ordeal was a whole day - from bed to bed - in a wheelchair.<p>We were divided in groups of two, one guy played the wheelchair user, the  other the caretaker. We made a day trip by rail to the lovely town of Bamberg.<p>Our task was to observe how people react to us and write it down in a report from the perspective of the wheelchair user and the caregiver respectively. The day after we discussed our reports in the group.<p>One thing I remember is, how much physical strength it requires in your arms to drive up an incline and the fear of rolling backwards, maybe even toppling backwards and hitting the ground with your head. The other that trains and stations were completely unprepared for wheelchairs in the 90s.<p>We did the blind experiment as well, but only for under an hour within our building. Here the caretakers were split into two groups and half of them were secretly told to let the blind guy run into a wall or over a step just once. Afterwards we had to discuss how that affected trust in the caregiver.<p>[1] This was not really meant to prepare us for our duties on the frontlines at hospitals and homes for the elderly, though in my case it helped a bit. The real reason was to uphold the <i>Wehrgerechtigkeit</i> - the idea that consciousness objectors are subject to the very same conditions as conscripts. In practice this idea fell short, because places for training were few and people randomly selected for it.</div><br/><div id="39535148" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39535148" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">koliber</span><span>|</span><a href="#39534775">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39535498">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39535148">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39535148">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Everyone should spend an hour or two in a wheelchair. It gives so much perspective and builds empathy.<p>I am an able bodied adult. A couple of years ago I hurt my foot and went to the hospital. It was a minor fracture of a minor bone, but they ended up putting a cast on to make sure I would not put weight on it for some time.<p>It was the middle of the day and I was alone when they discharged me from the ER. This was in Poland. The plus side is that the ER bill was $0. The downside is that I had no crutches and no one to help me. There was a medical supply store across the street and a wheelchair I could use at the entrance to the hospital.<p>I hopped on over to the entrance and sat down in the wheelchair. Wheeling down the smooth floor was no problem. However, once I hit the pavement, things got tough. Every crack and uneven spot was a real obstacle. I got stuck all the time. Each pebble had the ability to stop me in my tracks. Conquering these minor challenges took more physical strength and tactical planning than I anticipated. Keep in mind, this is while rolling down some average pavement.<p>Eventually, things got harder. Curbs. A proper curb was an impossible challenge. I imagine that someone who has more experience and body strength might be able to somehow get a wheelchair on the curb. I needed to wheel over to a spot where the curb was lower, at a crossing. This added distance but it was necessary. Not that a lower curb was easy. It still required careful planning, strength, and tactical positioning.<p>Eventually I made it to the store. Walking on crutches was a blessing. Still needed to return the wheelchair to the hospital. This meant doing the same journey, but slightly uphill, while toting crutches.<p>This was a while back, but I think of this experience regularly. The world is much different for someone in a wheelchair.</div><br/><div id="39535340" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39535340" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">michaelt</span><span>|</span><a href="#39534775">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39535148">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39535498">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39535340">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39535340">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Once while volunteering in a hospital I was collecting up wheelchairs used to take patients to their cars, and I decided to try one out.<p>What I learned is that staff, patients and visitors in hospitals are really kind and helpful if you&#x27;re in a wheelchair, and hospitals are (obviously I guess) pretty well adapted to wheelchairs. I also learned it&#x27;s very difficult to open doors with spring closers - I suspect there&#x27;s a trick to doing it, but I didn&#x27;t have time to figure it out because any time someone saw me struggling with a door they&#x27;d help me with it.<p>I also learned you will never feel more self-conscious than when a nice elderly lady helps you with a door, then you reach the place you&#x27;re delivering the wheelchair, and you have to walk back past the nice lady, revealing you were faking being disabled for your own entertainment.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39535498" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39535498" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ozfive</span><span>|</span><a href="#39534775">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39535148">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39534770">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39535498">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39535498">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was born in Germany and was informed by my mother about conscientious objection but don&#x27;t fully understand how caring for disabled people equates to an alternative to violence and war.

A big company like Apple, there are always things that need taken care of.<p>I assumed with iOS, Swift, etc., maybe the guys on the Cocoa team were obsolete? Of course not. That code is still there, still needs maintaining, interoperability with the new languages, frameworks, etc.<p>I&#x27;m more surprised they <i>want</i> to stay on.<p>And that is in fact why I left Apple: the job had changed, the &quot;career&quot; had changed. The engineers were no longer steering the ship. It had been that way when I started in 1995 though. A &quot;team&quot;, let&#x27;s say the graphics team, would figure out what API to revisit, what new ones to add — perhaps how to refactor the entire underlying workflow. The &quot;tech lead&quot; (who would regularly attend Siggraph since we&#x27;re talking about the graphics team) would make the call as to what got priority. Marketing would come around after the fact to &quot;create a narrative&quot; around all the changes to the OS. I hate to say it, but many, those were the good ole&#x27; days.<p>(And let&#x27;s be clear, in the 90&#x27;s, Apple&#x27;s customers were more or less like the engineers, we also loved the machine for the same reasons they did — so we did right by them, made changes they would like because we wanted them too. You can&#x27;t say that as convincingly for the phone, being a mass consumer device.)<p>Marketing took the reins long ago though — especially as Apple began to succeed with the iPhone (which, someone can correct me if I am wrong, but I think was an engineer driven project initially — I mean most things were up to that point).<p>I stuck around nonetheless though because there was money to be made and kids still to raise.<p>When the last daughter flew the coop though, so did I.</div><br/><div id="40965001" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40965001" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zkirill</span><span>|</span><a href="#40964331">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40965745">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40965001">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40965001">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I want to create a company that is like Apple of the 90&#x27;s and resurrect the &quot;bicycle for the mind&quot;.

Not back to mono-repos, no no no, semantic versioning dude, it&#x27;s the hip new thing! When that was a bust and no one could get around to being convinced of using it &quot;the right way&quot;, they were forced to begrudgingly acknowledge the value of mono-repos.

I still enjoy coding; and I expect to be coding for another few decades.<p>One thing I figured out early on is that your choices in languages and tech really matter. There are only so many things you can learn and you have to make some educated bets on things getting traction or not. And if you make the right bets, it&#x27;s easier to keep your skills fresh and relevant.<p>Some things look fancy and nice and then five years later it&#x27;s all outdated and obsolete. And some other things go big. Java was one of those things and in 1995, when I was in university, they decided to use it for teaching programming to first year students. So I ended up being a teaching assistant and now have nearly thirty years of experience with the JVM ecosystem.<p>I recognized the signs of the platform and language (especially) going a bit stale about fifteen years ago. It&#x27;s becoming the Cobol of my generation (plenty of work but not the kind that gets me excited). I realized I needed to move on if I wanted to stay relevant. Since then I&#x27;ve touched a lot of languages. Right now, I do a lot of Kotlin but I keep an eye out for new things. Kotlin was a bit of a bet ten years ago. I fully committed to mastering it six years ago. And at this point it&#x27;s starting to feel like a good bet. The language is modern, has a lot of momentum and there&#x27;s lots of interesting stuff happening with the language, compiler, tools, etc. Particularly multi-platform is opening up a lot of possibilities.<p>I&#x27;ve dabbled with other things along the way but never really got the feeling that mastering that stuff was worth my time. E.g. Ruby was interesting but it&#x27;s now mainly used by people in their forties (i.e. my age). Younger generations seem to not be interested in it. Same with things like Scala. Lots of stuff still happening with both of course but it seems that they are both a bit past their peak.<p>Python on the other hand keeps surprising me by not getting replaced with something else. I kind of like the language and have done some things with it over the years. And I like that they are clearing out technical debt (like the GIL) and keeping the language fresh. I work with some twenty year old interns that know and love it. People will be doing Python long after I die. That&#x27;s a bet I didn&#x27;t make but it would have been a good one. And not too late obviously. I know enough python to be able to jump in a project and use it. I&#x27;ve done so on a few projects in recent years. It&#x27;s a very approachable language; kind of by design.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40963211" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40963211" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cmrdporcupine</span><span>|</span><a href="#40963187">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40965394">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40962875">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40963211">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40963211">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s two things going on.

I moved on, and lost my taste for dynamically typed languages, and then all the sudden Python was huge, and if I&#x27;d stuck with that, it would have been a big thing for me, I guess.

I did my stint in both architecture and management because I thought what you were supposed to do, but I went back to programming because I like programming. I’ve worked on so many different technologies that I’ve probably forgotten more than some people even learn yet I’ve always liked it.<p>I do get how you can burn out, especially on the business side of things. A lot of jobs just aren’t important. The trick is to avoid them if you can and leave them as soon as possible if you can’t. Every non-startup &#x2F; non-economic boom job comes with some degree of Kafka, and you’re either going to learn to not care about it or go crazy. I’m not sure that is especially unique for programmers though, this seems to be most things. Unless you’re extremely talented at the HR part of organisational politics (which most programmers aren’t) you’re also going to have to build some really stupid stuff during your career because change management is hard. So hard that it’s virtually impossible for talented HR staff to do when the direction is upwards, which it’ll always be for programmers. Again, it’s something you either learn to laugh about or burn out on.<p>The change in technology, however? Isn’t that part of the fun? If it isn’t, is that because you don’t have the time for it? Because if don’t (and a lot of jobs won’t give you this) then you’re frankly in one of those “leave as soon as possible” positions. Even so, niche work rarely dies. The author mentions mainframe work, but mainframe work is still some of the highest paid work in the world because those grey beards who actually know and want to do it are so retired that a lot of them are frankly dead. I’m not sure how you could ever work on mainframes for 40+ years and then not be able to get paid handsomely by banks.<p>Anyway to each their own. It’s a nice perspective, and it offers you a few insights into just how much of a cog in the machine you’re going to be in virtually any job. Even one where you’re extremely well liked and rewarded. I think the best thing I learned from my stint in management is how everyone, and I do mean everyone, is replaceable. It’s just a matter of cost. Which can sound depressing, but it’s also very liberating because it teaches you to not get overly attached to jobs or employers.</div><br/><div id="40964333" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40964333" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">saulpw</span><span>|</span><a href="#40963056">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40965736">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40964333">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40964333">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Two decades is only half a software career.

The inability of IT management to imagine an approach to software other than  &quot;one size fits all&quot; has left me increasingly disengaged in work that used to be fun every day.<p>Of course, the shift in the past few decades from coding-from-scratch to cut-and-paste has also pushed me out of the &#x27;flow&#x27; of slinging code that I long enjoyed.  So maybe the insistent adoption by management of agile-oriented groupthink and processes should be a clear message to me that resistance is futile, and it&#x27;s time for me to make way for devs who are happy to play a game whose rules have changed, one that I no longer enjoy as I once did.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40965736" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40965736" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">begueradj</span><span>|</span><a href="#40963056">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40963195">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40965736">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40965736">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Interesting insights.

Our school district in North Texas had access to an HP mainframe (HP-2000?) to teach advanced kids BASIC.  Part of my early education involved tearing apart the text-oriented BASIC versions of Hammurabi, Hunt the Wumpus and Star Trek.  They would hardly be called &quot;games&quot; today.  My dad had business contacts at UIUC and they were infamous for giving ANYONE a PLATO account, so I learned about the friendly orange glow and social computing in &quot;the data center in the corn field.&quot;  Anyone who played rogue or PLATO&#x2F;EMPIRE could see where the industry was going by 1980.<p>And the sad bit is we&#x27;ve lost most of the people who developed these games in the 60s and 70s.  I think I&#x27;ll pitch the idea of a small collection of David Ahl books, DECUS games tapes and an interview or two with a few of the remaining coders.<p>Give me a +1 if you&#x27;re hip to the old text based games, often coded in BASIC and played on microcomputers.</div><br/><div id="42929630" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42929630" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eleveriven</span><span>|</span><a href="#42928493">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42929935">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42929630">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42929630">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">PLATO, Rogue, Hammurabi, Star Trek, Wumpus - these games weren’t just early experiments, they set the groundwork for so much of what came after</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42929935" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42929935" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pindab0ter</span><span>|</span><a href="#42928493">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42929623">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42929935">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42929935">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think it’s both funny and fitting that a video game library opens in ‘early access’.

Phil Salvador and Travis Brown, who were working on this, and founder Frank Cifaldi, are all great people. They have a podcast, the Video Game History Hour, where they discuss topics related to video game preservation (recently back after a roughly year long hiatus), if you want to here the people who work there talk about what they do and some of the challenges they face. This has been a long time coming, and the work they did with Cyan on the Myst collection in particular is nothing short of incredible. They had access to basically everything, and it was a huge effort to digitize all of the documents and VHS recordings to (hopefully) archive them long-term.

Thanks to a reader on Ars Technica and an anonymous chemical engineer, a working copy of SimRefinery has been successfully recovered.<p>&gt;Two weeks ago, I published my long-in-the-works article about Maxis Business Simulations, a division of SimCity developer Maxis that made simulation games for businesses. It was the culmination of four years of research, and I’m very proud to share their story.<p>&gt;One of the games they produced was SimRefinery, an oil refinery simulation for Chevron. Very little was widely known about the game until now, and the article kicked off a wave of interest in SimRefinery that seems to have reached beyond gaming circles. Shortly after the article was published, it was picked up by the tech news site Ars Technica, where one reader, postbebop, reported that they knew a retired chemical engineer who worked at Chevron, who confirmed that he owned a copy of the game. postbebop walked the engineer through the process of reading the data from the original floppy disk, and he was able to create a digital copy.</div><br/><div id="42929657" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42929657" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eleveriven</span><span>|</span><a href="#42927323">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42926962">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42929657">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42929657">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">These kinds of niche, often forgotten pieces of game history tell such cool stories.

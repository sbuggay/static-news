The core product for that site is a daily newsletter. On ghost it gets higher opens rates and more engagement than via the previous email backend. Build is far simpler too.<p>The clincher for me for Ghost(Pro) is that if you use your own hosted version of Ghost you need to plug into something else for sending email newsletters - which for the number of subscribers in this instance for a daily newsletter plus weekly wrap-up would cost a fortune. With Ghost(Pro) it’s all wrapped in.

As Wordpress.com shows, there&#x27;s no serious moat for open source hosting. Either Ghost devotes resources away from their open core and towards their hosting platform, or they lose the competition for marketshare to a company that <i>does</i> devote those resources and then they have no funding stream, aside from what G Engine deigns to give them out of the grace of their own heart. And all of the platitudes about voting or board seats and everything else don&#x27;t really make one lick of difference if you don&#x27;t have any funding to make that happen, and you have to rely on pay-to-play funding from the people who are <i>actually</i> making money in the space, and let them set your agenda.<p>So, Matt&#x27;s behavior aside, I do think these issues are pretty endemic to the idea of &quot;open core&quot; funding as a company (or market) grows beyond a certain size. Unified non-profit or dual-corporation structure (Mozilla Corporation vs Mozilla Foundation) doesn&#x27;t change the fundamental logic of &quot;where does the money come from?&quot;. I don&#x27;t think Ghost is providing any new solutions here—they&#x27;ve just gotten lucky &#x2F; been small enough to not be out-competed in their hosting niche yet.</div><br/><div id="42011895" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42011895" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zokier</span><span>|</span><a href="#42011601">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42011818">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42011895">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42011895">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I don&#x27;t think Ghost is providing any new solutions here—they&#x27;ve just gotten lucky &#x2F; been small enough to not be out-competed in their hosting niche yet.<p>While I agree with most of your comment, I do want to point out that intentionally targeting to be small&#x2F;niche is a kinda solution in itself.

But a lot of my comment comes from watching the Redis &#x2F; AWS Valkey split as well—even if Redis stayed as a smaller team instead of trying to compete with the hyperscalers, they&#x27;d still be stuck in the same catch-22—watching their revenue dwindle to zero while AWS and GCP competed on proprietary platform features.</div><br/><div id="42013955" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42013955" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">theamk</span><span>|</span><a href="#42011601">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42012012">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42011818">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42013955">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42013955">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Would they?

I&#x27;ve seen a lot of non-technical people in that bucket turned away recently by Ghost (Pro)&#x27;s opaque and confusing member-based hosting costs. It makes it completely impractical to run a free email newsletter, and plenty of other Ghost providers seem to have this worked out. So all it takes is one of those competitors breaking through to achieve name recognition and get a lucky roll of the marketing dice to overtake Ghost in revenue. And then they can fund their own fork and the Ghost community is forced to agree to their development wishes or become outpaced by their proprietary features.

In the early history of the prize, Nobel&#x27;s &quot;idealism&quot; was read as &quot;a lofty and sound idealism.&quot; The set of criteria, characterised by its conservative idealism, holding church, state, and family sacred, resulted in prizes for Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Rudyard Kipling, and Paul Heyse. During World War I, there was a policy of neutrality, which partly explains the number of awards to Scandinavian writers. In the 1920s, &quot;idealistic direction&quot; was interpreted more generously as &quot;wide-hearted humanity,&quot; leading to awards for writers like Anatole France, George Bernard Shaw, and Thomas Mann. In the 1930s, &quot;the greatest benefit on mankind&quot; was interpreted as writers within everybody&#x27;s reach, with authors like Sinclair Lewis and Pearl Buck receiving recognition. From 1946, a renewed Academy changed focus and began to award literary pioneers like Hermann Hesse, André Gide, T. S. Eliot, and William Faulkner. During this era, &quot;the greatest benefit on mankind&quot; was interpreted in a more exclusive and generous way than before. Since the 1970s, the Academy has often given attention to important but internationally unnoticed writers, awarding writers like Isaac Bashevis Singer, Odysseus Elytis, Elias Canetti, and Jaroslav Seifert.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40952598" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40952598" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lostlogin</span><span>|</span><a href="#40952308">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40952542">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40952573">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40953504">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40952598">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40952598">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a good point.

There&#x27;s no indication that he was anything but a <i>reflection</i> of the political turmoil at the time. He was just a poet with some banger turns of phrase. I also found his emotional distance to the actual politics to be rather distasteful (compared to, say, 2pac&#x27;s first album, Joey Bada$$&#x27;s &quot;all amerikkkan badass&quot;, and like half of Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s work, many varied feminist artists now like Mitski &amp; Laufey, the anti-war influence on the then Dixie Chicks, now the Chicks... i&#x27;m sure you could come up with thousands of artists with more to say than bob dylan).<p>C&amp;H&#x27;s political expression speaks much more to the absurdity of the values and habits that entrench themselves by adulthood, and help us question which of these are meaningful, rational, and necessary. A different sort of politics for sure, but one that is certainly relevant to most households across the country. Most of the political angst that comes through the adults in the form of disgust with cultures of consumption and commodification, the absurdity of a biker pitted against car, the joy of giving an F-15 to a trex rather than a modern state, are no less salient today.</div><br/><div id="40955071" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40955071" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">slater-</span><span>|</span><a href="#40952308">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40953504">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40954061">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40952364">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40955071">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40955071">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">incorrect to compare Dylan to 2pac and Mitski (a “varied feminist artist?”)<p>I understand the impulse of trying to tear down the establishment guy, but your take is absurd.</div><br/><div id="40958704" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40958704" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">darby_nine</span><span>|</span><a href="#40952308">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40955071">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40952364">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40958704">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40958704">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How would you characterize his impact? 2pac deserves comparison.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40952364" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40952364" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mdp2021</span><span>|</span><a href="#40952308">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40952374">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40952646">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40952364">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40952364">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Berkeley Breathed could feel left out - and one of his collections was named &quot;Classics of Western Literature&quot;.</div><br/><div id="40957514" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40957514" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JasonFruit</span><span>|</span><a href="#40952308">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40952364">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40953264">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40957514">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40957514">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">He should.

It felt overtly clear to me, as a student, that schools failed to effectively foster learning and growth. However, my perspective has evolved over time. I&#x27;ve come to understand that the issues I observed are not unique to the school system but rather characteristic of large institutions as a whole.<p>The pervasive failure of these institutions to meet their stated objectives isn&#x27;t an isolated phenomenon. It&#x27;s symptomatic of a larger, systemic problem – the widespread presence of perverse and misaligned incentives at all levels within large organizations.<p>Unless we find a way to counteract this, attempts at reform will merely catalyze further expansion and complexity. The uncomfortable truth is, once an organization surpasses a certain size, it seems to take on a &#x27;life of its own&#x27;, gradually sacrificing its original mission to prioritize self-preservation and expansion. Who has ever seen an organization like this voluntarily reform itself? I certainly haven&#x27;t.</div><br/><div id="36651083" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36651083" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">another_story</span><span>|</span><a href="#36650682">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36650884">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36651083">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36651083">[58 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s also an increased distance between those doing the actual work and those making decisions about how it should be done. Bureaucratic depth keeps any real change from taking place, instead leaving those  on the ground level to try and work within a set growing rules. Any attempt to affect change has to be filtered through so many levels and takes so long.<p>As a longtime teacher, I don&#x27;t think there are any solutions that can effectively reform existing educational institutions. I also don&#x27;t think there are any solutions which can affect change which won&#x27;t leave some group(s) disadvantaged.<p>One thing I&#x27;d like to see is a return to schools and districts which are allowed to operate with more autonomy and with budgets not tied to a local tax base, or federal money tied to test scores. I&#x27;d also like to see ways teachers and administrators can effectively remove repeat offenders from classes. Teachers are unable to create effective learning environments when they have no way maintain order, which seems to be the case in many schools. Let poor parenting blowback on the parents and maybe you&#x27;ll get parents to take some responsibility.<p>All that said, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll change much. The culture in America doesn&#x27;t respect the value of education, nor educators in the way it used to. Teach in Asia, Africa and even Europe and you&#x27;ll see a palpable difference in the way people view education. As a teacher you&#x27;re able to improve your craft as opposed to surviving day to day.</div><br/><div id="36651299" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36651299" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ecshafer</span><span>|</span><a href="#36650682">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36651083">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36651374">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36651299">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36651299">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My solution to the education attitude issue in the us, which is very real: pay the families that perform best in school districts.

Basically, the students with the highest grades get discounts from different colleges. It&#x27;s not exactly the same, but the effect is similar, and this system has been running for generations.<p>I think one big problem is that low test scores are highly correlated to poverty. Parents who earn less usually don&#x27;t have time to help kids with their school work, or don&#x27;t understand the school work, or don&#x27;t know how to study or teach children. Sure, there&#x27;s exceptions to this everywhere, but that&#x27;s the general pattern.<p>Incidentally, Louisiana has&#x2F;had a program called TOPs that covers in-state tuition for students that get over a 3.something GPA. Who benefits the most from it? Kids whose families make above the median income in the state.<p>I don&#x27;t think giving X dollars to the families with the top ranking students would change society overnight.</div><br/><div id="36652630" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36652630" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xvedejas</span><span>|</span><a href="#36650682">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36651746">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36651483">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36652630">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36652630">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Merit scholarships were already out of fashion by the time I was applying for colleges (circa 2010).

You already have a bunch of people who know how to do a job, so you pay them to do it quickly. Basically you are giving them money to go and tell their families they are going to be working late for a while and they have to postpone their holidays. These are both examples of a simple task with a definable, specific goal. Everyone can tell when the junction is built.<p>With this teaching math thing, there is no finish line. The people who decide if the kids pass are... teachers. Grading your own work is not going to lead to healthy outcomes. You want to adjust for how easy the task is because you don&#x27;t want easy classes to get paid and difficult classes to be excluded from getting the bonus. But then who defines the baseline? Teachers again. Maybe not the exact same teachers but they are all part of the same system.<p>Finally there&#x27;s the problem of feedback. Incentives work when the person who is incentivized knows how things are going and knows how to change the outcome. It is not clear at all that teachers know that if they just show Billy Bob the times tables as a rhyme then he will pass his test. It is not clear at all that teachers even know whether Billy Bob understands the times tables, or is just repeating what is being said.<p>This is the problem with all incentive engineering schemes.

* Serve as an amateur sports league.

I have a child in the US and have family close in age and demographics in non-US countries. The pressure of school-as-childcare is unique to me in the US because of the amount of paid time off I get, which is substantially less than my peers in Europe. In addition, the financial pressures of childcare and education in the US are quite different than Europe. I certainly earn more money in the US than I would in Europe in the same job, but the logistics of arranging childcare and the pressure of teaching my child both math and English outside of school, despite 7+ hours of school a day, are not insubstantial. As has come up elsewhere in these discussions (on HN and in the article), 15 minutes a day of worksheets has done wonders. While I appreciate what Kid has learned in school, and very much appreciate that Kid&#x27;s classmates get a nutritional baseline no matter what, it is striking that I must provide this additional instruction and practice. It&#x27;s this very out-of-school intervention that leads to the inequality of outcomes I so clearly see at the school my child is departing -- one in which the kids with college prof parents score top in the state and kids whose parents are English-language learners or work several (non-adjunct-instructor) jobs score in the 30th percentile. (The kids of all the PhDs, whether well-compensated or not, do fine academically.)<p>Dumbing down the standards doesn&#x27;t help anyone. I actually like the idea of a data science class, seems like a great motivation&#x2F;way to teach algebra, but the way it&#x27;s being operationally proposed in the CMF does not help. And back to my observation about the worksheets above, “This pathway leaves students unprepared for quantitative four-year college degrees via a newly proposed pathway for teaching mathematics that lacks essential content.&quot; “Instead of reducing the gap, the CMF proposal will worsen disparities as students from affluent families will access private instruction and tutors while under-resourced students will be left behind.” -- Dr. Jelani Nelson, absolutely correct.<p>For interesting discussion of the shoddy research underlying many of the citations in the CMF, see Mike Lawler&#x27;s Twitter threads (username mikeandallie).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36652643" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36652643" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">solatic</span><span>|</span><a href="#36650682">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36650884">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36651598">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36652643">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36652643">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; once an organization surpasses a certain size<p>This is precisely why the solution is to keep size small and allow consumers (in the education market, these are parents) to have a choice between many small providers who are forced to compete with each other.

I never expect such a similarity. I&#x27;ve always thought that education in the US must be much better.<p>After graduating from college, I realized that the problem I was facing was a systematic one of the whole society, rather than one limited to particular teachers, middle schools, or even the entire education system.<p>Many people say Chinese maths education is better than the US but I can hardly agree. But based on what I have seen, there are problems on both sides. Chinese education is focusing too much on memorizing existing pieces of knowledge, but too less on teaching the young how to create new ones. The knowledge which our ancestors had struggled for thousands of years to find was taught to us in a spendthrift manner. Aside from lacking training on how to find&#x2F;create new knowledge, Chinese education does not encourage students to learn advanced topics since it could have negative effects on the students&#x27; grades. But there is nothing you can do to change it, because too many things are correlated: fair distribution of teaching resources, less demand for highly educated people in the job market, and the overall not-so-innovation-appealing social vibe. I cannot foresee any possibility of a true, self-driven, systematic reform.<p>Education in the US, especially math education, on the other hand, is somehow too frivolous. I have no learning experience in any US middle school, so my opinions can be biased. But it seems that US education is more like elite education. The average&#x2F;universal maths education level should be a little higher in such a highly modernized society.<p>These different (or even opposite) problems surprisingly show some similarity. Shall I say the problems actually reflect some real problems in the two societies?</div><br/><div id="36652589" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36652589" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">syntheweave</span><span>|</span><a href="#36650682">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36651598">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36650774">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36652589">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36652589">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had the experience of going to US schools among competitive immigrants from Taiwan and HK(in the late 90&#x27;s, i.e. they left while it was still under the British), and a little bit of mainland China as well.<p>Reflecting on it, it produced an odd dichotomy in classroom expectations where nobody was really on the same page: I&#x27;m fourth-generation American to a mixed European background - my mom insisted on me attempting advanced math, but in a distinctly Eastern European sense, with emphasis on learning theory, which wasn&#x27;t anything like what I was confronted with at school, which was primarily computational drills that I didn&#x27;t know how to prepare for and which my parents tried to pretend I could just power through, as my older brother did(he had more of a direct interest, and later confessed that he probably got through it all just with short-term memory, because he was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult and started medicating, and thought I should too). My classmates, meanwhile, had clearly normalized strict study habits but could not usefully communicate what they were to me, or maybe did not want to give up their secrets. And the teachers were just pleased that the class behaved so well and could withstand being assigned piles of homework, but they didn&#x27;t have particularly advanced backgrounds themselves and often couldn&#x27;t hold their own when challenged by the best students in the city.<p>And then I went off to college and the student body was now mostly white. I realized that this was a completely different vibe and I didn&#x27;t understand <i>that</i>, either.<p>I think the places in which the US system manages to work are because sometimes the collision of varied cultures against the institutions produces useful sparks. The institution itself tracks political winds, which vary at the state and local level. Struggling schools have the usual issues of domestic insecurity spilling into the classroom, and being in the public school system, occasionally I would cross paths with those students instead of the &quot;gifted and talented&quot; track that I was on. But &quot;good schools&quot; tend to be &quot;home owners association&quot; schools, whipped into doing whatever the parents ask for, which usually amounts to fairy tale fantasies. When my mom started pressuring the faculty for me to stay in the advanced math track despite my not fitting there, it was, I now see, in this latter mode. Eventually, not getting the desired result, she insisted that I argue my own case, which of course I was terrible at, and left me confused, ashamed and other feelings which took years to work through. I just wanted to withdraw from everything at that point, but I was being hurried along. That is the one quality I would say tends to always be the case throughout, at least in the large schools I went to - nobody has time for anything, because everyone has a deadline to meet. It&#x27;s mostly an illusion and busywork, but it nevertheless sucks out societal energy.<p>The elite students, some of whom I ran into in college, tend to have a path carefully paved for them through subtle signalling and tracking - opportunities and experiences that are just not the norm for anyone less wealthy. They aren&#x27;t getting well-rounded educations either, rather, they are normalized to self-identify as strivers, which when combined with some early connections, is enough for most of the cohort to advance. I had a housemate who was an heir to an major beer company executive. He was an alcoholic and his dad was, too, and he bemoaned the idea that his summer job was being the boss to people ten decades older than him. His goal in getting a CS degree was to prove that he could do something for himself, essentially.<p>In the end, looking at it, the way the US system is set up is to not know you are in a rat race until it&#x27;s too late and you&#x27;re tracked at the bottom for reasons beyond your control.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36650774" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36650774" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smilekzs</span><span>|</span><a href="#36650682">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36651598">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36650725">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36650774">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36650774">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">a.k.a.

Without some YouTube professors I probably would have failed several classes.<p>My gripes: Most teachers suck, no one teaches you how to actually study math along the way, the word problems&#x2F;applications need to stop being almost always about physics ffs, too many classes have inadequate or poor technology, the big picture concepts&#x2F;threads are lost by most math teachers, and some textbooks are AWFUL, the eTextbook push has made some even worse (too many examples of why to list), and finally there needs to be sometime in those 16 years where foundations and philosophical issues are broached at least passingly.<p>The good math classes are amazing, and that&#x27;s what kept me interested. But I just had to vent about the wasted potential. I&#x27;m not giving a nuanced opinion, I&#x27;m pointing out some glaring issues. Also if you get a teacher who says they regularly attend some national conference for math educators to structure their class, transfer out.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36651012" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36651012" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jncfhnb</span><span>|</span><a href="#36651159">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36651278">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36651012">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36651012">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For my school, kids taking algebra 1 in 9th grade were the remedial students.

It&#x27;s used by everyone everywhere all the time. Algebra is a core skill we can&#x27;t be skipping.<p>IMO if you don&#x27;t teach stats, people are okay, they have an intuition about fractions and can reason from there.

That&#x27;s when it all hit me, then I went back and had to relearn what the hell they were talking about during my middle school years.<p>Also, once I got to Highschool math, Algebra 2 and PreCalc, it was very easy to simply memorize formulas and plug and chug.<p>You don&#x27;t need to know Algebra to know what profit and loss is. If you want to calculate a break-even point, you look up the break-even point formula and plug in the numbers, or more commonly today, find the menu in your analysis program. None of my business classmates had any idea how to manipulate the formulas. You get a &quot;quant&quot; to do that for you. Yes, there are bad consequences because of this, but this is the reality of most modern businesses. People are already skipping Algebra, we just kinda let people move forward anyway.<p>To test it, give a highschool Algebra test randomly sampled modern workers. Don&#x27;t let them study for it, pop quiz. I believe almost everyone would fail horribly if you could control for cheating.<p>Same story for trig, I didn&#x27;t really appreciate or &quot;get it&quot; until I got really interested in ballistics and digital signal processing many years later.<p>Kids like me find Algebra, by itself, too far removed and too abstract to even begin to find value in it. I really had no idea what we were talking about most of the time. Sure you can learn some patterns and &quot;trust&quot; that the teachers know best, but then I go home and ask my parents, one who has a Doctoral degree in medicine, and the other a Master&#x27;s in finance, when the last time they calculated an integral, or used the quadratic formula, and they say freshman year of college 40 years ago... A lot of my teachers were also full of shit and power tripping a significant amount of the time, so that didn&#x27;t help build any trust either.<p>Thankfully, I figured out the deep beauty and power of math, but I have quite a lot of catching up to do, but my mental framework now is far more organized at mapping how all the concepts relate, and why they&#x27;re valuable. I can learn more now in a few months than years of study when I was in Highschool. All because I can plug the concepts into a nice modular framework, and I can experiment with ideas in code.<p>Almost nobody that I knew did the same though, most of my coworkers over my 15 year career don&#x27;t have the patience or curiosity to dive into this stuff. It&#x27;s actually really hard to find friends who geek out about math and functional programming (expect for a few corners of the Internet, including here).<p>Hopefully that clarifies things, if not, I&#x27;d need to know more about your confusion.</div><br/><div id="36652585" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36652585" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">extr</span><span>|</span><a href="#36650510">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36651895">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36652262">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36652585">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36652585">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for the detailed thoughts. It sounds like you had a uniquely poor experience with your math education which is too bad. Obviously you are plenty smart to handle the concepts themselves and once you had reason to apply them, you immediately &quot;got it&quot;. I definitely don&#x27;t disagree that the way the subjects are taught without context is part of the problem. I didn&#x27;t really &quot;get&quot; calculus until I was forced to apply it to physics.<p>That said, specifically with respect to the content in Algebra, I wasn&#x27;t really sure what we were talking about here, so I looked up the CA Common Core Algebra 1 concepts. [0]<p>&gt; (1) deepen and extend understanding of linear and exponential relationships<p>&gt; (2) contrast linear and exponential relationships with each other and engage in methods for analyzing, solving, and using quadratic functions<p>&gt; (3) extend the laws of exponents to square and cube roots<p>&gt; (4) apply linear models to data that exhibit a linear trend<p>This strikes me as a pretty reasonable terminal point for the general population, and I don&#x27;t see how you are going to talk about anything but the most shallow statistical concepts without being comfortable with the machinery involved in the above. Perhaps you could use stats to make the content more relatable and teach both at the same time (over 2 years?), that would seem reasonable to me. But I think I would resist dropping the above concepts from the curriculum entirely in favor of a &quot;stats light&quot; course that literally only went into charts and basic descriptive stats.<p>Also, it&#x27;s a bit of a cliche, but I do think it&#x27;s worthwhile to teach some concepts for the sake of imparting a lesson on &quot;how to think&quot; and not just for the content itself. The quadratic formula feels like a good example of this. Literally nobody has reason to apply it, but the abstract reasoning skills involved in mastering it are foundational. Even if we cannot get 100% of everyone there, it&#x27;s a laudable goal to me and one we should stick with.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cde.ca.gov&#x2F;be&#x2F;st&#x2F;ss&#x2F;documents&#x2F;ccssmathstandardaug2013.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cde.ca.gov&#x2F;be&#x2F;st&#x2F;ss&#x2F;documents&#x2F;ccssmathstandardau...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36652262" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36652262" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">morpheuskafka</span><span>|</span><a href="#36650510">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36651895">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36652585">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36650803">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36652262">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36652262">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a counterpoint, a lot of business majors seemed to think that Econ 101, let alone calc-based 410, was the hardest thing in the world.<p>The class is all graphs but there usually no numbers—it’s all about the intersections and regions under different curves.

Learning math is the process of internalizing these rules.<p>The common core stuff seems to be the opposite of this. I want to build with my daughter a set of skills (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, exponents etc, eventually moving on to trig, linear algebra and calc) she can build on. But common core hopelessly confuses even simple things like adition.</div><br/><div id="36652043" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36652043" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">electriclove</span><span>|</span><a href="#36651665">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36651160">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36652043">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36652043">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Please look into Beast Academy (online without books) and work through it with your daughter.

Reading is taught incorrectly and has been for decades as shown by dropping phonics based education and using &quot;whole word association&quot;.

The standards here in NC for middle school science seem to only require knowing that circuits must be closed and insulators&#x2F;conductors. That would be an (elective) HS or AP physics class. Also, there seems to be one set of standards and one test for all students in middle school and pre-university students. Instead of &quot;detracking&quot; by going down to the lowest common denominator, there are high expectations for all students.<p>In the UK and many other countries, what we call &quot;advanced&quot; AP Calculus BC is just &quot;A-Level Math&quot; and is the expected minimum for studying STEM fields in university. In America you can get into university (even a prestigious one) and start off at &quot;College Algebra.&quot; People from other countries are shocked that law, medicine, etc. are graduate degrees requiring a different-field undergrad, because of how little a high school diploma actually means in America.<p>There is a massive state of under-education in America, and shockingly, it&#x27;s become more and more popular to call education and degrees worthless. There&#x27;s a lot to criticize about the out-of-pocket costs of college, but the education itself is invaluable.

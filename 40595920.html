I distinctly recall speaking to him in around 1995 regarding Linux. He, along with I believe a large number of commercial Unix vendors, snubbed his nose at Linux suggesting it was a passing fad and would never challenge their &quot;serious&quot; Unix. This is interesting because Jon &#x27;Maddog&#x27; Hall[1], then CTO of  Digital (before it was acquired by Compaq in 1998, acquired in turn by HP in 2002) certainly did get it... I interviewed him once in Sydney circa &#x27;99 and had a good long chat once in Taiwan circa &#x27;01 after crossing paths by chance. He was traveling the world proselytizing Linux in shorts and flip-flops, had a firm belief in embedded Linux changing the world (Android[2] wasn&#x27;t released until nearly a decade later in 2008), but was yet to announce he was gay (took another decade). Fast forward 30 years: nobody younger than 40 has practically even heard of the company, Linux is in every household, and the very idea of a commercial Unix a joke.<p>Furthermore, in perfectly delicious irony, IBM&#x27;s own modifications to Linux[3] to support the allocation of workloads to its giant server hardware have enabled the popularization of containers, further reducing demands for server equipment, increasing portability between desktop and server environments, and substantially drawing down the cost of provisioning for cloud services - the arch rival to traditional mainframe mentality. Today, in a world awash with dirt cheap and ever-present processing power and storage, as well as recently unimaginable levels of connectivity, we stand almost at the point where the term &quot;server&quot; itself has become an anachronism and consumption-oriented devices draw consumers toward &quot;services&quot; (often as paid for subscriptions).<p>IMHO some industries which will look nothing like today&#x27;s version in 30 years&#x27; time: food, oil, transport, construction, clothing, health, and education. <i>Carpe diem</i>.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Digital_Equipment_Corporation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Digital_Equipment_Corporation</a> [1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jon_Hall_(programmer)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jon_Hall_(programmer)</a> [2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Android_(operating_system)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Android_(operating_system)</a>

 if you want a place to stay, you go on airbnb because that&#x27;s where the listings are, and if you want to rent out a place to travelers, you list it on airbnb because that&#x27;s where the travelers are?  the ibm pc owned a three-sided market: users, software vendors, and peripheral vendors.  not at first, of course, but pretty soon; the s-100 systems weren&#x27;t that dominant in a market fragmented between apple, commodore, atari, osborne, kaypro, etc.<p>then, once compaq came out with their ibm-compatible portable computer in 01983, ibm didn&#x27;t own the market anymore.  even less once phoenix started selling their bios in 01984.  and <i>that</i> was what <i>really</i> made the ibm pc catch on: no single company&#x27;s missteps could sink the platform the way commodore did with the amiga and the way apple did with the iigs&#x27;s successors.  ibm did in fact try to avoid introducing an 80386-based ibm compatible in order to avoid cannibalizing their minicomputer and mainframe lines, just as apple did with the iigs, so compaq beat ibm to market in 01986. by like a year!<p>there are also technical questions.  the 8088 is a <i>lot</i> faster than the 6502 <i>at running compiled c</i>, especially with the crappy compilers of the time.  it&#x27;s also noticeably faster at numerical code.  and the apple ][+ was running its 6502 at 1 megahertz, not 2.  the beeb not having slots was a fatal flaw for much of the market; it turns out there are really a lot of peripherals that work badly over a serial port<p>and once ram prices came down a bit, 640k of ram became standard; the macintosh shipped with 128k in 01984 and quickly changed that to 512k.  using 640k of ram on the 8088 was a <i>lot</i> easier than using it on a 6502, although intel&#x27;s braindamaged segmentation scheme (avoided on the iigs&#x27;s 65816) forced you to use &#x27;garbage kludges&#x27; like lim ems (01985) to use more than a megabyte at all.  that there was so much pressure to be able to use more than a megabyte as early as 01985 should tell you something about how far memory prices had come down and how important it was that the 6502 and 8085 couldn&#x27;t handle more ram</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40600865" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40600865" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">garius</span><span>|</span><a href="#40600409">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40600906">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40598711">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40600865">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40600865">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">keyboard wasn&#x27;t great either, to begin with!</div><br/><div id="40602802" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40602802" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nabla9</span><span>|</span><a href="#40600409">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40600865">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40598711">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40602802">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40602802">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Model M keyboards are ridiculously good.

I was familiar with the IBM office in Boca Raton, nicknamed T-Rex, and had a few school friends who worked at IBM on the IBM PC. From what I can remember, the Boca campus was like garden leave. IBM sent you there when they didn&#x27;t want you but couldn&#x27;t fire you. So it was full of IBM misfits who were thrown out of HQ. I never made the connection to Flight 191, and assumed it was because of Hurricane Andrew. But once the PC market took off IBM wanted that team brought back into the veil. A lot of my friends moved to Cary, NC, more famously known as Research Triangle.<p>Miami, and South Florida overall, is kind of a crazy place to be. Every couple of decades people out west or from up north rediscover we actually exist. There are good engineers here but the West and Northeast have loads of money. So once CS&#x2F;SWE really took off as a career the companies down here couldn&#x27;t&#x2F;wouldn&#x27;t compete. Trust me, if you were an Asian&#x2F;Indian kid in Florida in the 90s and told your parents you wanted to work in software they were going to beat some sense into you.<p>I&#x27;ve watched money flood into the area and then get carried back out when the financial tides changed.

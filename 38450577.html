Without knowing the expression, “camel through a needle’s eye” sounds a bit fanciful, like there must be some sort of fairy-tale exception or trick to make it work. Edit: for example maybe camel fur can be made into thread? I don’t know.<p>“Rope through a needle’s eye” would just be a mundanely impossible task, which, if anything, makes the analogy more concrete, in my opinion. The fact a rope is pretty similar to a thread, except in the very way that matters for fitting it through a needle’s eye, makes it more obvious.<p>It seems like the theory is pretty throughly debunked anyway.

Here Jesus clearly uses *hyperbole. His words reflect an ancient Jewish figure of speech for the impossible: a very large animal passing through a needle’s eye. On regular journeys at twenty-eight miles per day, a fully loaded camel could carry four hundred pounds in addition to its rider; such a camel would require a gate at least ten feet high and twelve feet wide. (A needle’s eye in Jesus’ day meant what it means today; the idea that it was simply a name for a small gate in Jerusalem is based on a gate from the medieval period and sheds no light on Jesus’ teaching in the first century.)<p>Craig S.

But to answer your question, you know the commandments: &#x27;You must not murder. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. You must not testify falsely. You must not cheat anyone. Honor your father and mother.&#x27;&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;Teacher,&quot; the man replied, &quot;I&#x27;ve obeyed all these commandments since I was young.&quot;<p>&gt; Looking at the man, Jesus felt genuine love for him. &quot;There is still one thing you haven&#x27;t done,&quot; he told him. &quot;Go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.&quot;<p>&gt; At this the man&#x27;s face fell, and he went away sad, for he had many possessions.<p>&gt; Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, &quot;How hard it is for the rich to enter the Kingdom of God!&quot; This amazed them. But Jesus said again, &quot;Dear children, it is very hard to enter the Kingdom of God. In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!&quot;<p>&gt; The disciples were astounded. &quot;Then who in the world can be saved?&quot; they asked.<p>&gt; Jesus looked at them intently and said, &quot;Humanly speaking, it is impossible. But not with God. Everything is possible with God.&quot;<p>Jesus&#x27;s analogy about a camel going through the eye of a needle is commentary on the situation that he and his disciples just witnessed. The rich man thinks that he can earn his way into heaven through good deeds: he&#x27;s asking &quot;what must I do to inherit eternal life&quot;, and probably hoping for a pat on the back from Jesus for all the good things he&#x27;s done. But instead Jesus identifies a much deeper issue in his life: his earthly wealth is more important to him than anything else, even his eternal destiny! The point of the camel analogy is that riches are a distraction that make it impossible to &quot;love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind, and all your strength.&quot;<p>&gt; Surely from what he&#x27;s said it&#x27;s obvious that poor people can be saved. And when Jesus says &#x27;for God all things are possible&#x27;, isn&#x27;t he implying that some rich people might get into heaven? So why do people interpret the passage as Jesus saying this is impossible?<p>The central point of the Bible is that there are no &quot;good people&quot;. <i>Everyone</i> is morally corrupt in one way or another, and cannot be saved through their own effort, only through Jesus&#x27;s sacrifice on the cross. &quot;God saved you by his grace when you believed. And you can’t take credit for this; it is a gift from God. Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it.&quot; (Ephesians 2:8-9, cf. Romans 3, Psalm 14, John 14). A lot (most?) of Jesus&#x27;s teachings, including the passage in the OP, are addressed to people who think they are &quot;good enough&quot; and showing them to be self-righteous, hypocritical, and in need of salvation just as badly as everybody else.</div><br/><div id="38453679" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38453679" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">amanaplanacanal</span><span>|</span><a href="#38451460">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38452825">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38451786">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38453679">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38453679">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would say that you are correct about the New Testament.

These include various threesomes of male deities, of female deities, of Father-Mother-Son groups, or of one body with three heads, or three faces on one head (Griffiths 1996). However, similarity alone doesn’t prove Christian copying or even indirect influence, and many of these examples are, because of their time and place, unlikely to have influenced the development of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity.<p>A direct influence on second century Christian theology is the Jewish philosopher and theologian Philo of Alexandria (a.k.a. Philo Judaeus) (ca. 20 BCE–ca. 50 CE), the product of Alexandrian Middle Platonism (with elements of Stoicism and Pythagoreanism). Inspired by the Timaeus of Plato, Philo read the Jewish Bible as teaching that God created the cosmos by his Word (logos), the first-born son of God. Alternately, or via further emanation from this Word, God creates by means of his creative power and his royal power, conceived of both as his powers, and yet as agents distinct from him, giving him, as it were, metaphysical distance from the material world (Philo Works; Dillon 1996, 139–83; Morgan 1853, 63–148; Norton 1859, 332–74; Wolfson 1973, 60–97).<p>Another influence may have been the Neopythagorean Middle Platonist Numenius (fl. 150), who posited a triad of gods, calling them, alternately, “Father, creator and creature; fore-father, offspring and descendant; and Father, maker and made” (Guthrie 1917, 125), or on one ancient report, Grandfather, Father, and Son (Dillon 1996, 367). Moderatus taught a similar triad somewhat earlier (Stead 1985, 583).</i></div><br/><div id="38454445" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38454445" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Zancarius</span><span>|</span><a href="#38451519">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38453623">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38452361">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38454445">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38454445">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think I tend to agree with the conclusion—namely that it was predominantly a Jewish influence on Christology. Part of my opinion is shaped by changes in and around the First Century in Judaism which, ultimately, culminated in the Masoretic Text evicting certain parts of the text that could <i>remotely</i> suggest anything akin to polytheism. Deuteronomy 32 is particularly one of the most affected chapters, but curiously &quot;two powers&quot; theology was largely left intact.<p>This is a particularly interesting period in Christianity, because you had numerous influences (including what would later become gnosticism around the same time), the term &quot;trinity&quot; wouldn&#x27;t appear in extant works until sometime in the Second Century, then the Council of Nicaea in or around the latter half of the Fourth Century establishing it as doctrine.<p>So, I think the evidence of a decidedly Jewish influence is quite strong and would date at least to the Babylonian captivity.<p>I believe Dr. Robert Alter leans toward an evolution from polytheism -&gt; monotheism in Jewish thinking (I highly recommend his <i>The Hebrew Bible: A Translation with Commentary</i>); but I think the evidence for a sort of henotheism is a bit stronger and more sensible, which would better fit the sources you shared here, alongside the biblical texts.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38452361" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38452361" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">djur</span><span>|</span><a href="#38451519">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38452245">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38452679">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38452869">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38452361">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38452361">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Sect&quot; isn&#x27;t a pejorative term, at least not in this context.</div><br/><div id="38453177" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38453177" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kragen</span><span>|</span><a href="#38451519">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38452361">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38452869">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38453177">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38453177">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">in english the pejorative term is &#x27;cult&#x27;, which often trips up second-language speakers from languages where it&#x27;s the other way around</div><br/><div id="38454682" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38454682" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">autoexec</span><span>|</span><a href="#38451519">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38453177">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38452869">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38454682">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38454682">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To help avoid future misunderstandings, which modern languages use &quot;cult&quot; without the usual negative implications?</div><br/><div id="38456286" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38456286" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tsimionescu</span><span>|</span><a href="#38451519">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38454682">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38455006">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38456286">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38456286">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I believe English is actually one of the only ones where cult has a negative connotation, and where sect does not.

The overlap is not accidental, but rather intentional in order to provide a sense of credibility in their teachings.<p>In that sense, both Christianity and Islam view themselves as supersessionist to the respective religion that predated them, with Judaism being more or less the root of the Abrahamic tree (though you could argue that Zoroastrianism may have been the precursor for monotheism as a concept, predating them all).</div><br/><div id="38453968" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38453968" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">monlockandkey</span><span>|</span><a href="#38451519">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38453512">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38456313">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38453968">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38453968">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Qur&#x27;an didn&#x27;t borrow anything, nor was it influenced by the previous religions.

Where I agree with you is that it&#x27;s simplistic to say that Islam was simply a distant branch of another religion -- it&#x27;s clearly it&#x27;s own tradition, but my understanding is that most Muslims would agree that it both shares common roots (i.e. a foundational understanding) with Christianity and Islam while also superseding them.<p>In my mind at least, that indicates that there is some narrative progression, of which Islam would see itself as the most recent, or most complete, revelation; building on what came before while also correcting it (where it is seen as erring from Allah&#x27;s&#x2F;God&#x27;s intended message).

But if we diminish the camel to his smallest, or open the eye of the needle to its largest—if, in short, we assume the words of Christ to have meant the very least that they could mean, His words must at the very least mean this— that rich men are not very likely to be morally trustworthy. Christianity even when watered down is hot enough to boil all modern society to rags.<p>The mere minimum of the Church would be a deadly ultimatum to the world. For the whole modern world is absolutely based on the assumption, not that the rich are necessary (which is tenable), but that the rich are trustworthy, which (for a Christian) is not tenable. You will hear everlastingly, in all discussions about newspapers, companies, aristocracies, or party politics, this argument that the rich man cannot be bribed. The fact is, of course, that the rich man is bribed; he has been bribed already. That is why he is a rich man. The whole case for Christianity is that a man who is dependent upon the luxuries of this life is a corrupt man, spiritually corrupt, politically corrupt, financially corrupt. There is one thing that Christ and all the Christian saints have said with a sort of savage monotony. They have said simply that to be rich is to be in peculiar danger of moral wreck.</i><p>Chesterton, 1908 (&quot;Orthodoxy&quot;)</div><br/><div id="38452347" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38452347" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lynguist</span><span>|</span><a href="#38451296">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38451416">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38452347">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38452347">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for sharing.

It&#x27;s always a temptation.<p>I&#x27;ve been tossing around the idea of doing a topical Bible study night&#x2F;meal once a month with some neighbors who are interested (or at least tangentially so) along with some folks from Sunday school. A friend of mine who has been struggling with sin and faith suggested it. I feel a sense that your comment is being used to prod me a bit further.<p>One of the fears I&#x27;ve had (just tossing this out there for advice I probably already know but need to hear&#x2F;read from someone else) is stepping on toes. I KNOW that if I just teach from the word it isn&#x27;t a problem—or rather it isn&#x27;t a problem unrelated to conviction, but going back to your earlier recommendation we all have difficulty with the idol of self-perception. I probably need to re-read 1 and 2 Timothy, because I&#x27;ve sometimes had issues with timidity in the face of those who are older and dealing with scripture.<p>An example: Explaining the nature of the word &quot;elohim&quot; as an <i>ontological</i> term (I&#x27;m a Southern Baptist) to a church elder who was convinced it&#x27;s <i>strictly</i> another name for God was a good exercise but somewhat difficult, even with a Hebrew-English interlinear in hand to show him precisely how it is used <i>in situ</i> throughout the text. I managed, but my comparative youth against an elder and his obstinate refusal to see the word for what it was set me back somewhat in deciding whether to go forward with, shall we say, giving bread to the spiritually hungry.<p>I guess the only way to feed anyone is to start by making a meal.

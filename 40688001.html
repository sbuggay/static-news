I&#x27;d like to see FSD navigating an old Italian city, there&#x27;s just no way. Even in car-friendly Germany you very often have streets with side-parking, which are too narrow to fit two cars, you need to communicate with oncoming cars, for instance by waving or flashing your headlights, swerve into free spaces on the side to let other cars go through, watch out for cyclists overtaking you from both sides, etc. And this is not even mentioning the weather... So this robotaxi thing might eventually work in some US cities, but pretty much nowhere else.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40688211" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40688211" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Shank</span><span>|</span><a href="#40688354">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40688280">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40688211">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40688211">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This pretty much jibes with my experience. Autopilot has phantom breaking still, but navigate-on-autopilot feels more predictable on the freeway and more useful than FSD. The fact that v12 has “exited beta” and is now the “Supervised” mode doesn’t give me confidence right now. The iterative progress it went through during the beta was really good — I felt that each point release was getting closer to a polished system that could be trusted. The v12 stack supposedly replaced all of the prior work with “photons in, photons out” straight neural networks, but I think this simply didn’t result in the stability the system needs. The v12 software behaves pathologically in situations where autopilot is excellent.<p>As a concrete example, it routinely switches out of the current lane to “follow route” and then immediately slams on the brakes to slow down, when no turn or exit is present. Then it turns on the signal and dutifully tries to get back into the previous lane. On screen, it says it’s wanting to change into a faster lane. This will happen multiple times on the same road. This is on CA-57 northbound in SoCal —- an area where I would expect there to be pretty good testing.<p>Personally, AP &#x2F; navigate-on-autopilot is still superior. On city streets, sure, FSD can sort-of manage. But it isn’t trustworthy enough for me to use it.</div><br/><div id="40688220" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40688220" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">iknowstuff</span><span>|</span><a href="#40688211">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40688280">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40688220">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40688220">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">FSD 12 is not used on freeways.

It still feels _very_ far off from being able to safely navigate and negotiate only medium-complexity environments, but maybe the vaunted 12.4&#x2F;12.5 update will change all of that.<p>For example:<p>* It still won&#x27;t change in or out of a solid line HOV lane here in Arizona. Feels like an easy fix, but there it is<p>* I have concerns about its ability to check oncoming traffic when coming out of an occluded side street or alley. For example, my alley (where my garage leads) connects to a MAJOR road that is extremely fast. It is also fairly occluded in the side view by bushes and a light post. A human will move their head forward, crane their neck, and also be able to detect subtle changes in the light and shadows through the bush itself to determine if there&#x27;s _any_ movement and interpret that movement as a potential car, even if they can&#x27;t positively see a car. They can inch forward until they can see that the path is clear. The Tesla&#x27;s side-facing camera is in the b-pillar, behind the driver&#x27;s head, and at best, it can inch forward (and does) but gaining a high-confidence positive reading that the path is clear is... well, nearly impossible in certain cases that aren&#x27;t impossible for humans, and that&#x27;s concerning.<p>* Parking still takes one too many adjustments, and impatient drivers around you definitely notice it<p>* At one point, the FSD&#x2F;AP engine itself crashed on me while fully engaged. Unfortunately, this happened on a freeway connector ramp with a pretty steep curve, and when it crashed, it disengaged the steering wheel and sent us careening towards the barrier: it was a single lane HOV ramp, and we were going about 70 mph, so if I hadn&#x27;t been hover-handing, it would&#x27;ve easily resulted in a bad accident. This wasn&#x27;t a case of disengagement or AP getting scared or losing confidence. The engine itself suddenly, without warning, and for no discernible reason, crashed entirely. (It immediately threw an error and said AP System Error&#x2F;Take Control Immediately.) It then showed the car in a sea of black, as the visualization&#x2F;FSD engine rebooted. This sort of crash is kryptonite. It&#x27;s terrifying and its randomness and senselessness and opacity towards what caused it if anything is haunting. Again, a disengagement like this with no driver would result in catastrophe.<p>On the flip side, I was fairly surprised at how well it handled a lot of basic driving tasks. Visual-only parking still freaks me out (especially since my model HAS ultrasonics, but you disable them when you go visual-only, which is absurd), and a couple turns felt close to the curb, but overall, driving was fairly smooth and decent.<p>I have the added benefit of living in Phoenix, which is Waymo country. Waymos drive more confidently, and more importantly, are already fully autonomous. They navigate complex environents fairly decently (though, for example, my dad got stuck in one doing loops of a dealership parking lot that confused it a few weeks ago) and they&#x27;re comfortable to ride in. They&#x27;re not yet on freeways, but apparently that&#x27;ll change soon, but they also only go the speed limit, which is Phoenix is... a choice.<p>Elon keeps pushing this dream of a robotaxi fleet of Teslas, but I agree with the OP that it feels a far way off before I&#x27;d be comfortable with the idea of these things fully autonomously driving, and I say this as someone who sees a half dozen Waymos every single day. I also wonder more broadly about the core conceit here: not that fractional car ownership doesn&#x27;t make sense; it absolutely does, but in the idea that Tesla owners are going to be comfortable with their ~$50k-$150k vehicles roaming around and picking up strangers who... hopefully don&#x27;t do things to their car, all while hoping the car comes back home. I don&#x27;t believe Elon was pitching the robotaxi as being wholly Tesla owned vehicles, but it seems like a big societal shift to get people comfortable with their cars having minds of their own, and taking in randos.</div><br/><div id="40688267" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40688267" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Onavo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40688232">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40688418">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40688267">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40688267">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The pre 12.5 stack uses traditional C++ conditionals together with computer vision for highway driving. 12.5 and after is the a single stack setup (at least that&#x27;s what Musk claims).<p>The 12.3.6 (or the 12.4.1 that&#x27;s being trialed right now) is pretty much the current production state of the art for Tesla street level (not highway) single stack self driving where the steering commands are directly issued by the neural network.</div><br/><div id="40688349" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40688349" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stefanve</span><span>|</span><a href="#40688232">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40688267">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40688418">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40688349">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40688349">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">While it sounds impressive from a technical point of view it doesn’t say anything about how much better it is or if it is now truly full self driving.</div><br/><div id="40688407" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40688407" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">what-the-grump</span><span>|</span><a href="#40688232">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40688349">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40688418">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40688407">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40688407">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It’s about as shit as the 300k lines of c code.

I studied at a top 5 university for CS and specialised in deep learning. Three years ago I finished, rejected a (some would call &quot;prestigious&quot;) PhD offer and was thoroughly let down by how &quot;stupid&quot; AI is.<p>For the last 2-ish years, companies found a way to throw supercomputers on a preprocessed internet dictionary dataset and the media gulped it up like nothing, because on the surface it looks shiny and fancy, but when you peek it open, it&#x27;s utterly stupid and flawed, with very limited uses for actual products.<p>Anything that requires any amount of precision, accountability, reproducibility?<p>Yeah, good luck trusting a system that inherently just learns statistics out of data and will thus fundamentally always have an unacceptable margin of error. Imagine using a function that gives you several different answers for the same input, in analytical applications that need a single correct answer. I don&#x27;t know anyone in SWE that uses AI for more than a glorified autocomplete which needs to be proof-read and corrected more often than not.<p>Can&#x27;t wait until the bubble bursts into the next AI Winter, most likely this is directly correlated with the high interest rates. So, give it a couple years and the whole &quot;AI&quot; stuff will go right back to the fundamental drawing board, because deep learning, while it has some applications, is just not a trustworthy tool at all. Statistics doesn&#x27;t reason.<p>Tldr; it is exactly zero surprising that FSD doesn&#x27;t work, and it will not work with the current underlying basis (deep learning).

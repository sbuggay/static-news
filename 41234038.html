I believe that it is absolutely necessary for each to have their own &quot;framework&quot; for this kind of things, but it also falls into the category of things somewhat missing from our education. I wish someone had explained to me, earlier in my life, some basic psychological principles and some practices that are tried many times by different people in this domain. The works that filled it in for me were: The 7 Habits (I cringe at the writing style, but the ideas are real good), GTD (the concepts, not to the letter), Atomic Habits, and Thinking Fast and Slow (the core idea). I highly recommend these.<p>--<p>P.S. On that &quot;missing from our education&quot; bit. My kids are in school now and I can make my adult conclusions. To be just, the school emphasizes and teaches autonomy, self-organization, etc. It does that, however, for the school&#x27;s own needs and prepares the kids for one very specific way of working, which just cannot be applied in every situation.</div><br/><div id="41272858" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41272858" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cl3misch</span><span>|</span><a href="#41272691">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41270566">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41272858">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41272858">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think German school system tried to teach me these systems, or at least offered optional courses to learn about them.

I learned it while working as a stock broker, where every day I needed to check specific economic indicators that would be published or company disclosures, call client X, Y or Z, and in days where options, swaps or forwards would expire I needed to check a few things.

    cross things off
</code></pre>
Well, now that I wrote things down, I can cross that off. And now that I crossed something off, I can cross that one off too.<p>A fully achieved list! Success!!<p>Truthfully, I&#x27;ve been doing forms of this more recently, writing things down that I know I can accomplish, and checking them off. It gives me a good motivation boost. Especially very simple first steps for a project, it helps me get started and then once I get over that hump I can keep going without the list. Then it&#x27;s very rewarding to come back and check all kinds of things off!</div><br/></div></div><div id="41268965" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41268965" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jmbwell</span><span>|</span><a href="#41271737">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41271820">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41268965">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41268965">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One of my early frustrations with Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;To-do&quot; app was that it discarded my &quot;today&quot; tasks every day. But now I love that it does this, for the reasons the author describes.<p>I was used to apps like Asana that would just let things sit there and accumulate and fester. It made me hate how much I wasn&#x27;t getting done every day. One or two tasks a day piling up over the course of many days just grows into a mountain of shame, and as the author says, it builds this &quot;UGH field&quot; around it that makes me not want to look at it at all, much less try to wade through it. The system was hurting more than helping, really.<p>I started using To-Do because we recently switched to Microsoft at work, and I&#x27;m trying to embrace the ecosystem or whatever. And what was an annoying deficiency (why can&#x27;t this crappy MS app do what I want) has become a huge relief.<p>Automatically having my day reset every day has helped me feel more like I can actually get through most of what I realistically intend to do in a day. I take a minute in the morning to throw stuff on the list, MS does helpfully suggest some things (presumably using something they now call &quot;AI&quot;), and then I start working down it. At the end of the day, anything I didn&#x27;t get to -- honestly, anything that wasn&#x27;t as important as I thought it would be that day -- is gone. The next day, I start fresh. Re-focus, re-prioritize, and start executing. Everything still gets done, but my focus is on the day ahead rather than days past. And no &quot;ugh field.&quot;<p>I would note that my approach to projects with teams is different, of course. All of those tasks will eventually need to get done, so it&#x27;s not helpful to let things disappear. But where this does apply is in how much a given contributor wants to bite off in a day. The backlog on a project is the backlog, no getting around it, but a tighter focus each day on whatever&#x27;s realistic, 3-5 tasks probably, relieves a lot of tension that helps work be more effective, I find.<p>Last comment, I love that the author also puts things on the list just to scratch them off. I picked up this habit somewhere long ago. It seems silly to do something, then put it on the list, then just scratch it right off, but it has the real effect of notching another task done. Helps limit the days where you feel like you didn&#x27;t actually do anything, those yak-shaving days. You can look at the &quot;completed&quot; tab and see that no, you did actually do stuff. Another source of shame neutralized.</div><br/><div id="41269270" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41269270" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Tomte</span><span>|</span><a href="#41268965">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41269296">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41269270">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41269270">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; One of my early frustrations with Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;To-do&quot; app was that it discarded my &quot;today&quot; tasks every day.

It&#x27;s my GTD tool of choice at the moment.<p>They change things, though, and you can&#x27;t switch a setting. For some time they stopped adding tasks with due date on the current day to the &quot;My day&quot; smart list.<p>It makes sense if you think about it in terms of what they wanted &quot;My day&quot; to be. Adding things to &quot;My day&quot; should be a conscious choice.<p>But it was a change, and it&#x27;s very nice to have due tasks automatically added. They changed it back after a few weeks, thankfully.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41269296" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41269296" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MengerSponge</span><span>|</span><a href="#41268965">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41269270">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41271820">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41269296">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41269296">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I really like &quot;To-do&quot; and am so glad it&#x27;s integrated into Outlook&#x27;s Mac client now.

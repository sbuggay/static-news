Here in Michigan there are some large dairy farms producing electricity from their manure.  But the only reason they can do it profitably is because the cost of the installation was subsidized by both the government and the manufacturer.<p>When I was an agronomist I worked with several large dairy&#x27;s in West Michigan on composting their manure.  It eliminated most of the odor and had the additional advantage of greatly reducing the volume so they could use an ordinary fertilizer spreader and transport it to fields that could actually benefit from the nutrients.  That was 25 years ago and they&#x27;re still doing it so I guess they found it beneficial.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38617771" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38617771" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nickpinkston</span><span>|</span><a href="#38624286">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38617064">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38617771">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38617771">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve wondered if it&#x27;s a good&#x2F;awful idea to use the widely used food irradiation tech [1] on manure to kill the microorganisms that can cause disease, while keeping the bioavailable nutrients intact, just like how radiation kills bacteria in food without affecting its taste.<p>It&#x27;s also very low energy as, unlike electro-shocking, the radiation sources are &quot;always on&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;foodsafety&#x2F;communication&#x2F;food-irradiation.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;foodsafety&#x2F;communication&#x2F;food-irradiatio...</a></div><br/><div id="38620857" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38620857" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">NL807</span><span>|</span><a href="#38617771">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38618753">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38620857">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38620857">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s a bad idea in general, because a healthy sustainable soil is more than just available nutrients.

Growers have to be careful not to accidentally salt their ground with manure.<p>Manure is also very heavy, and therefore expensive to transport, and that’s without going into restrictions that kick in when moving animal waste long distances.<p>Pathogens, weeds and even pesticide residue are also a concern. The dairy I work with makes use of large digester tanks that help reduce these.<p>Basically manure is great when you are close to a source (like a dairy), but you can’t put on too much or move it around too far without issues.

IMHO modern science is learning, but still knows so little about natural systems, particularly relationships within insect, fungi and angiosperm communities which are the objective core of botanical systems.

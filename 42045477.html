This process has been incredibly valuable to me, and even in the LLM era of 2024, I still enjoy blogging. Often, the primary user of my blog is myself; I go back to my past entries to help guide further research and exploration.<p>I once heard a senior developer say, &#x27;I’m not shy to admit that after I finish a blog post, I’m at ease to forget about it—because I know I can always look it up again.</div><br/><div id="42049253" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42049253" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jffhn</span><span>|</span><a href="#42048594">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42045880">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42049253">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42049253">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;each blog post helps me think more deeply<p>The most on point quote I know about this idea: &quot;I don&#x27;t write to say what I think, but to know what I think.&quot; (E.

It’s one thing to hand-wave one’s way through a presentation. It’s another to commit pen to paper (well, bytes to disk) and explain something. Quite often I’ll realise that there’s a gap—or gaps—in my knowledge that I need to explore first before I can properly write about something, and that’s the very reason that I do it.</i><p>This is a very good reason to write - I&#x27;ve learned about a ton of topics over the years at depths I wouldn&#x27;t have bothered with if I weren&#x27;t going to write blogposts about it.  I really didn&#x27;t <i>need</i> to spend a year chewing through other people&#x27;s PhD work to understand some of the quirks of lead acid battery behavior I was seeing years back (Steve on IRC&#x27;s description covered the details well enough to work around it), but if I was going to write it up[0], I wanted to actually <i>understand</i> it.  And that took time.<p>But it misses one of the most important reasons I write: To force myself to finish projects and document things, so I can fully offload it from my brain.<p>I&#x27;m very prone to &quot;90% done, eh, good enough, I&#x27;ll finish it later...&quot; sort of projects, and they take up a lot of mental space because I still have to (or, at least, <i>try</i> to...) remember state on the project.  Before I write about something, I want it fully done, and then as part of writing it up, I trust myself to document anything weird, any odd findings, etc.  Once I&#x27;ve done <i>that,</i> then I can entirely forget the details of the project, teardown, or whatever, knowing that if I need to do it again, I can go reference my old writeup and I&#x27;ll know what I need to do!<p>Once written, I can just clear the brain-space out, and not worry about forgetting about it, because it&#x27;s been written up, by me, in my style.<p>Also, copy editors and reviewers start to sound more like professional writing than &quot;blogging,&quot; at least to me.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sevarg.net&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;08&#x2F;off-grid-rv-lead-acid-maintenance-charging-failure-modes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sevarg.net&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;08&#x2F;off-grid-rv-lead-acid-main...</a></div><br/><div id="42046532" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42046532" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">richardwhiuk</span><span>|</span><a href="#42045880">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42047606">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42046532">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42046532">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a reader, people writing to learn about something irritates me when it&#x27;s not clearly flagged that the writer has almost zero experience using the thing they are writing about.<p>There&#x27;s so many articles in tech where the writer probably has less experience with something than literally anyone who will read their post, and it means there&#x27;s effectively a content farm of what a new software engineer will learn in their first few months (if not years) on the job, written by software engineers in their first few months, with effectively no net information.</div><br/><div id="42047489" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42047489" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">simonw</span><span>|</span><a href="#42045880">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42046532">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42049032">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42047489">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42047489">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ll offer the opposite perspective.

They show sustained ability to dominate fields. Yes, I&#x27;m sure this is cultural, but it&#x27;s still a difference. And there are frankly different behavioral patterns, some of which I did pick up and I think led to major differences in how I view the world, despite still firmly identifying with my more modest upbringing.<p>As a simple example, my parents and family have a much more fatalistic &#x27;fate-guided&#x27; view of the world, whereas the people I met in university were extremely motivated to just change what they saw as wrong.

I think you&#x27;d be surprised at the educational backgrounds of the people that actually make the memes (vs the ones just spreading them).<p>I think my basic thesis is that, if you come from a normal background, and go through these institutions, this is a major selection factor for some level of charisma. You understand the game and you understand the normal person. This is why the first &#x27;round&#x27; of purely meritocratic admits worked. The graduates were inevitably going to be so irresistibly charming, they&#x27;d have no problem dealing with the world.<p>However, as time went on and they had their own children, who did not experience the normal childhood, they are at a disadvantage. They have the educational background, but not the ability to connect with people.<p>For example, since it&#x27;s all fresh in our minds. I remember people saying that Vance was going to appear weird at the debate and Walz normal. As evidence, they used the fact that Vance was rich and thus out of touch. At the time I thought differently, simple because Vance had been to Yale and then through the Silicon Valley VC landscape and -- from what I understand -- came out successful. Thus, in my mind, he was the perfect test to my thesis.<p>And I think that&#x27;s what we saw, not only did he come across as amazingly likeable, he even seemed to make Tim Walz like him at times. And the general consensus was that he won [1]. Normal people don&#x27;t make it through these institutions without the ability to -- at least temporarily, maybe even disingenuously depending on your politics -- come across as irresistibly charming.<p>&gt; How do you convince someone that there are people out there so gifted at everything that they make MIT and Stanford alums look like village idiots? You likely can&#x27;t.<p>That&#x27;s correct, as demonstrated by the people that accuse them of cheating to get where they are. Or of cheating because they worked less hard than someone else who worked very hard at the wrong thing.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2024&#x2F;10&#x2F;02&#x2F;vance-walz-who-won-vp-debate-roundtable-00181905" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2024&#x2F;10&#x2F;02&#x2F;vance-walz-who-won-...</a> .

Humans have an innate draw to beauty, and one thing that is beautiful to basically everyone is a rich culture with traditions, institutions, and members [1]. One way to signal that is by learning the social niceties inside and out. This is no less academic since it doesn&#x27;t come from a book.<p>The &#x27;grinds&#x27;, as the article says, didn&#x27;t get that, and they were shunned not because they focused on books, but because they were unable to have a more expansive view of academics.<p>It is shocking to me when I see pundits today seemingly confused why the masses find appeal in particular candidates despite the pundits being able to list ten technical reasons why he should be disqualified. They don&#x27;t understand how people perceive things, and it&#x27;s so painful to watch.<p>I feel as someone who occupies a sort of &#x27;third space&#x27; here [2], I am really truly able to see both viewpoints. But it&#x27;s so difficult to explain to a technocrat the full range of human emotion, and it sometimes appears as if they&#x27;ve been handicapped in their ability to feel it.<p>As an example (and I would recommend Camille Paglia&#x27;s works), it&#x27;s fascinating to me how, despite our ever growing technical ability to produce great film, the actual emotional content of the film is ever worse. We have the most scantily clad females of all time but the fully clothed actors and actresses of the past were actually more sexually enticing. We&#x27;ve lost the sense of awe that CS Lewis talks about in the Abolition of Man. We have the greatest visual effects, but the emotional content of the film is so thin that you just don&#x27;t feel anything.<p>Where these feelings do exist, it&#x27;s in independent (read: not produced by the Ivy type) films and media, which is why &#x27;alternate&#x27; media has suddenly become so popular.<p>I&#x27;ll also just leave that Donald Trump has an innate understanding of people. People are shocked that he&#x27;s able to get so many seemingly random, seemingly opposed people behind him. They classify it as a trick. But it&#x27;s not. People vote and support who they like, not who has the best technocratic solutions. That is neither good nor bad. It just is. It&#x27;s a tale as old as time, and would be apparent if you studied the <i>actual</i> humanities.<p>Just so no one thinks I think Trump is some singular. Barack Obama is also one of these figures. And even Joe Biden is to some extent [3]<p>I can write a dissertation on this topic.<p>[1] It doesn&#x27;t matter the culture. All traditional cultures are enthralling<p>[2] I was raised in the &#x27;normal&#x27; way, but ended up at a second-tier &#x27;elite&#x27; school, and then -- adopting some of the stuff I learned -- moved into strategy consulting at one of the Big 3 where I learned even more about this type. I eventually moved back into tech (and do feel my career is better for having been through these experiences).<p>[3] Completely off-topic, but I also think that if you go to spaces inhabited by the technocrats, you&#x27;ll notice that &#x27;detachment&#x27; philosophies like Stoicism and Buddhism are very popular, whereas the masses go for attachment. It&#x27;s not a surprise to me that the Kennedy family, being Catholic, the exact opposite of Buddhism in that sense, was always seen as particularly charismatic and alluring amongst political dynasties</div><br/><div id="42234403" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42234403" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">watwut</span><span>|</span><a href="#42234277">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42233851">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42234403">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42234403">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">People are surprised over Trump, because of what it applies about conservative peoples hypocrisy.

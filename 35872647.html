We spent that class doing things like gardening, constructing adobe stuff like ovens and a gathering space shaped like a turtle (the head formed a pizza oven too - it was really cool), collecting eggs from a chicken coop, recycling fibers and scrap paper into (very brittle) paper, and making tea out of the herbs we grew - mint, chamomile, lavender, etc.<p>One of the most profound memories I have from that school is of Ms. Susan teaching us to say &quot;thank you&quot; to the plants when we took a few of their leaves for the tea. We&#x27;d look at the plant, find some good leaves, pluck &#x27;em off, and then say &quot;thank you&quot; and move to the next one. It was kind of an intimate moment to share with a mint plant haha. It was probably also very cute for the teachers to watch a flock of kids roam around a garden and stare intently at some herbs for an hour.<p>It was the kind of thing that really sinks in when you&#x27;re a kid. I didn&#x27;t know it wasn&#x27;t a &quot;normal&quot; kind of education, and I just figured, &quot;we take our time and say thank you to the plants when take something from them&quot; was a general rule of life that the adults follow too. I really cherish those memories now! Sometimes I thought they were boring af at the time - learning about compositing toilets isn&#x27;t really priority #1 for a 9 year-old - but I hope other kids growing up are taught a similar connection to nature today. We&#x27;ve gotta say thank you to the plants!</div><br/><div id="35880675" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35880675" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ecnahc515</span><span>|</span><a href="#35878227">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35881471">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35880675">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35880675">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This reminds me of the lessons from the book &quot;Ishmael&quot; by Daniel Quinn.

There is a faction among the Hopi that never signed anything with the US government. Their view is that ownership is granted to those that take care of it. It isn’t about the means of production, but rather, your ability to participate in the land’s wel-being. A further implication is that, within this world view, you cannot accumulate capital beyond your personal ability to take care of it. Instead of gaining property rights, and having social expectations for taking care of it, you don’t get those rights until you demonstrate ongoing care.<p>It goes even further. Can you own a person because you “take care” of that person? If you reject that idea, what about any living being? Do you really own the trees, the birds, the bees? Instead, you view this as being in <i>relation</i> within a community that take care of the land. You obtain an yield (one of the permaculture design principles), but you don’t exclusively do so. Other living beings within the land can also obtain a yield, whether it is also the food, water or habitat.</div><br/><div id="35884845" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35884845" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RGamma</span><span>|</span><a href="#35878227">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35884428">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35879910">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35884845">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35884845">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Random fun fact that I learned yesterday: Only 0.6% of Germany&#x27;s land area is covered in wilderness.

Having visited locations in N California, UK, Spain &amp; South Africa there is clearly a strong appeal of natural systems design for technological systems designers.<p>In a sense, designing a living environment is like coding. Maybe you&#x27;re a full-stack developer and you want to terraform your land - run the digger routine to build some swales and ponds. Sprinkle in some pioneer species functions to structure the sub-soil and add nitrogen and provide shade. Run the groundcover script to stop evaporation and erosion and plant a few fruit trees.<p>Then add whatever framework of your choosing for creepers, vines and berries.<p>Start some background processes of mulching and compost turning (this is a sweaty function), maybe add a worm bin for your kitchen and food waste.<p>Then just watch your biological programme running, the plants, birds &amp; bugs and it is good.<p>..................<p>Maybe permaculture isn&#x27;t going to feed the world, but there are some important takeaways:<p>1. Focus on perennial plants. If you have a garden or land and you don&#x27;t have lots of time or energy, don&#x27;t waste your time with annual vegetables instead plant perennial food plants and trees...too many to mention but good, hardy, high producing options are granadilla (passion fruit), mulberry, pecan (and other nuts depending on your location), rhubarb, kale, spinach, ginger, figs, lemons and other citrus.<p>2. Never leave soil bare. &quot;Nature abhors a vacuum&quot; so weeds will grow, mulch any exposed dirt or plant a groundcover.<p>3. Observe the edges between everything, that&#x27;s where the magic happens. Create more &#x27;edge&#x27;, in other words instead of a perfectly round pond, make an irregular pond with protected areas for critters to breed in. Instead of a straight path, have some curves.<p>4. &quot;The problem is the solution&quot; probably the most popular permaculture saying there is, but a useful concept. If you have slugs and snails in your garden you don&#x27;t have a snail problem, you have a duck deficiency. Got ducks to eat the snails? but pong their pond smells...this is a problem, but its also the best fertiliser water you can get to put on fast growing plants so its the solution to your fertiliser needs.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35878104" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35878104" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">roboben</span><span>|</span><a href="#35884957">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35877728">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35878104">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35878104">[46 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Most fun thing about permaculture is the fact that no one is making money from actually applying it but rather just selling courses, books and other media.

I think most could with a lot of work, some stingyness.<p>I had shit soil when I started too (long story but I overpayed for it to prevent cracks due to a shit foundation)<p>I ended up getting great soil from a tomato &amp; peppers nursery&#x2F;seed selling business i had helped out before. They were moving and i helped em out with that again and they have to refresh their mix once every few years anyway or they can harbor diseases that can fuck up their year.
I also got a bit of forest soil which was probably not allowed (it&#x27;s within close distance and i hauled 3 baskets for every new plant i put down) and then a bit of additional soil from a nearby cellar being dug which was shit but i had to raise an additional bit of garden regardless of whether it held veg or lawn.
Additionally I got a few trailers of free horse manure that I scouted local 2ndhand sites for because there&#x27;s too much manure in this country I&#x27;m in.
I used my dad&#x27;s trailer who needs it regardless for a lot of other stuff he does.
I got some free seconhand fencing mesh for peas to grow on. Cut bamboo my neighbour couldn&#x27;t get rid of to support it all and some other plants. 
I now have a secondhand plastic greenhouse. I still don&#x27;t have plastic for low tunnels yet but anticipated late frost by simply putting cut plastic bottles over my plants.<p>The only thing I actually spent on was a few cheap tools, seeds and a few rare herbs&#x2F;berry bushes &amp; 2 small fruit trees. Oh and last year I had to spent on water due to persistent draught but this year I catch water from the shed and wood storage into some free secondhand IBC vats.<p>Since then I think I&#x27;ve more than paid back for the help I&#x27;ve been given with the amount of veg I&#x27;ve given away.

We crossed that line twelve thousand years ago when we started large-scale farming. That alone was a transformation of nature which immensely upset the previous natural order and caused human population to rise immensely. But I wouldn&#x27;t really consider that artificial in a major way, and on some level we&#x27;re also part of nature. I don&#x27;t think we are any more artificial in building cities than bees are in building their hives. There is a difference, but not one which matters for this conversation, though I will mention that that difference has to do with the fact that we picture an idea in our heads before projecting it into reality through labour.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s healthy to see the world as a struggle between the natural and artificial, because it&#x27;s so hard to properly define. Humans are natural, making tools is in our nature, so is constructing shelter. I think the proper way to see the world is as this unity, humans exist within nature and act to transform it, as does every other animal species on this planet. The ecosystem would look wildly different did termites and bees not transform it for their own benefit, and similarly it is humans who transform nature in their own ways for their own benefit.<p>This does not mean unconditional support for human activity. Glass, concrete, and steel towers and spreading suburbs are terrible transformations of nature. They are terrible because of their destructive potential for no gain, they are unsustainable by nature, they upset the balance in a way which makes the land less fertile, less capable of supporting life in general let alone humans, and in the long term are a loss not only for natural diversity but for the human species as well. There exists a rift due to industrial agriculture where humans take from the earth and give back to it from the mountains and the bedrock while pushing waste into the oceans, which is unsustainable and which has and will lead to ecological collapses. This is but one part, industry in general, pollution, the carbon cycle, land use change and associated environmental effects, it all acts to lower the carrying capacity of this Earth in the long term. This is how I believe it is best to critique transformations of nature in this manner, because terms are easy to define, the unsustainability is scientifically provable, you have no such ambiguities as when you talk about artificial and natural as two entirely separate concepts.<p>This also gets you out of very bad ways of thinking. There is no &quot;natural carrying capacity&quot; for this planet except what it currently has. There is likely a theoretical maximum and some day we might hit it. What&#x27;s clear is that we haven&#x27;t hit it yet, we just
fail to push the current carrying capacity by transforming nature in an unsustainable fashion for short-term benefit. You can no longer say things like &quot;There really should not be this many humans in the world&quot;, since it&#x27;s plainly not true. There are supposed to be exactly as many humans as there are, because humans naturally transform nature to support themselves. It is our own nature, our species being, to take those gifts of nature and use them to transform them, through our own labour, into products which are use-values to ourselves. This is just as it is the nature of bees to pollinate and build hives, the nature of woodland animals to eat their hives and the flowers they pollinate, and the nature of elephants to topple trees to create for themselves a grassland instead of a forest.<p>It is not that there are too many humans, even with our unsustainable practices this planet easily currently produces enough food for ten billion to live well-off. It is not that there is artificial and natural, to make natural artificial is natural, because to transform nature is human nature. It is our current, wasteful and unsustainable transformation of nature, no different to those transformations that took place twelve thousand years ago except in its unsustainability, which has been been sucking the life out of this planet. But as humans, we have the unique ability to both imagine and then through labour project that ideal into reality, to once again transform what was natural to something which suits our needs. Our needs are, in the long term, sustainably keeping at the very least ten billion people alive, and permaculture is one of the ways in which we can both imagine that and start to bring it into fruition. However, our own relations and structures might prevent a total change in our transformation of nature in its present state, which is why political action is as important, if not more so, than homesteading or community gardens.<p>Idk man, I don&#x27;t think overpopulation is an issue and I despise imagining that there is something uniquely bad about artificial things and that they are somehow different from nature. They are nature, their creation is our nature, and we ourselves are creations of nature. It&#x27;s only how we have in the last few millenia, really even few centuries, been doing those transformations which is the true issue.<p>End of insane HN rant I guess. There&#x27;s obviously no infinite growth, but we&#x27;re also far from overpopulation. The world is not a Malthusian nightmare, it&#x27;s not that resources cause population to explode and conditions to worsen, we can see that in the richer nations of the Earth where instead resources cause population to drop after a point. We&#x27;ll naturally reach our peak well within the theoretical maximum carrying capacity of the Earth, that&#x27;s my point. Permaculture is one important step on that path. Neo-Malthusians and genocidal maniacs and eco-fascists disgust me to no end.</div><br/><div id="35881474" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35881474" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwawaaarrgh</span><span>|</span><a href="#35878262">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35881155">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35883385">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35881474">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35881474">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The big difference between cities and honey bee hives is that bee hives have to work within the ecology, whereas cities don&#x27;t.<p>Literally, honey bees can&#x27;t exist unless their environment supports them. Their way of life has to adapt to the environment around them, not the other way around. This is made obvious in a number of ways: they literally biologically are adapted to make their particular type of home, their social structure is required to support said biology, they hibernate, they&#x27;re susceptible to environmental damage and pests, they depend on a symbiotic relationship with flowering plants for pollen, etc.<p>Humans simply don&#x27;t have any such limitations. If an environment isn&#x27;t suitable to them, they just change the environment (a fairly novel thing in human history), or build something to support themselves and their lifestyle, rather than adapt a symbiotic relationship with their environment. Humans can pretty much do whatever they want regardless of the environment. This makes them highly adaptable, but also means they can parasitize the entire ecosystem until there&#x27;s no resources left to adapt. The further they move towards collapsing ecology, the more dependent they grow on an ecology they create artificially to sustain themselves.<p>Therefore while bees can continue to thrive as long as the environment supports them, the environment can only thrive as long as humans support it.<p>There&#x27;s no reason to suggest we will hit some peak only for it to drop off. We&#x27;re not like parasites that are subject to an environment; we transcend the environment. We aren&#x27;t limited by it. It&#x27;s possible we will simply extinguish all natural resources (intentionally or not), and then either leave the planet or die off. There are no guarantees.

When nature doesn&#x27;t suit us, we have the capacity for transformation, just as bees have. However, we can choose any scale, even planetary. But that freedom is an illusion. There is no transformation of nature which happens without interference from the system around us. If we decided that the planet should be a couple degrees warmer for agricultural output to increase, we would inevitably find ourselves in an ecological collapse and a resulting collapse of agricultural output. It&#x27;s just not something we can do. Nature itself is the limit, pushing beyond that means inevitable ecological collapse and resulting human collapse – we cannot eat without nature. Not that some chemicals can&#x27;t be produced synthetically, but not nearly all. The massive expense we would incur over feeding just a couple of people with massive bioreactors to avoid interacting with nature at all would be prohibiting. We are, as are all other species, trapped within nature despite our capacity to transform it. This is because we are nature, not something that transcends it. We are the Lorax, we speak for the trees, we uniquely have both an imagination and the capacity to labour. There is evidence to suggest we will hit a peak - humans simply don&#x27;t want that many children at some point after the elimination of scarcity. We know this, you can look outside and see it if you live in what they call the &quot;global north&quot; or &quot;imperialist core&quot; or however you want to refer to it. We don&#x27;t know why, but it happens. Humans and nature are very much compatible, although it is true, that unchecked human activity could kill everything. Not even growth, just activity, and at a fraction of the current population could have already  killed everything. It&#x27;s not inherently human to take and destroy, that&#x27;s just a necessity places upon us all by our current societal structure. We do it or someone else does it and we starve. But it does not have to be like this. The world is, again, not a neo-Malthusian nightmare which requires genocide to overpower for the sake of plants and animals which could less understand what is happening. We must, as we are limited, live within nature as part of it, transforming it, but our current transformation, necessitated by society as it is, is simply idiotic. There is no evidence to suggest that we are anywhere close to a &quot;carrying capacity&quot; or we will ever suck life out of the system and leave rather than simply glassing it and ourselves or learning to live with it. We cannot leave, this life would not grow anywhere else without immense struggles, it can only exist within complex ecosystems and taking them out of that context will destroy them. We cannot suck it out, for it is our own death as well.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35883385" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35883385" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">unmole</span><span>|</span><a href="#35878262">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35879046">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35881155">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35880165">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35883385">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35883385">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Misanthropic hippie claptrap.</div><br/><div id="35883643" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35883643" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mcbishop</span><span>|</span><a href="#35878262">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35883385">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35880165">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35883643">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35883643">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Please substantiate.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35880165" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35880165" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CapstanRoller</span><span>|</span><a href="#35878262">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35878973">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35879046">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35880728">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35880165">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35880165">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The thing people don&#x27;t realize is that we waste so much space and resources on useless crap.<p>1 hectate per person is easy to get in any suburban neighborhood if everyone can agree that a stable healthy food supply is more important than endless lawns or empty lots.<p>The resources are all there, we just grossly misallocate and squander them.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35880728" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35880728" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">KaiserPro</span><span>|</span><a href="#35878262">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35878973">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35878947">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35880728">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35880728">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">a whole town, depending on how things are done would look a bit different, but would handle different too.<p>First, assuming that people are growing all sorts of things, and not trying to monoculture, you will get an explosion in different kinds of insects and their predators.<p>Second, you should get an explosion of colour<p>thirdly, assuming the growth of trees, creepers and other vines, coolers daytime temperatures, and reduced winds<p>fourthly, and possibly more importantly, much higher water retention.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35878947" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35878947" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tspike</span><span>|</span><a href="#35878262">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35880728">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35878084">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35878947">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35878947">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’d have a hard time thinking of a more wonderful experiment to run.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35878084" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35878084" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kubb</span><span>|</span><a href="#35878262">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35879814">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35878084">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35878084">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Getting into permaculture is great, you just need a piece of land.

Industrial agriculture is large-scale enough to be able to use everything with extreme efficiency. Secondly, modern industrial agricultural practices result in the transformation of nature into an unsustainable hell-scape which will collapse in on itself within a few centuries at the latest.<p>But I don&#x27;t think you should consider humans as separate from nature, there is evil to being artificial and there is no evil to sometimes going against nature. Humans are, by their nature, a species who take natural fruits and labour upon them to transform them, to give them a new use-value. That is a, if not even the, universal constant which has held through every age of human (pre)history. Humans, just as bees or termites or elephants or trees, transform nature by our nature. Everything natural is artificial and everything artificial is natural. To transform nature, to bend it and to change it is our species being, it is part of our role in nature to transform it as do countless other species. However, unlike those guided by pure instinct, we have both the ability to imagine and project through labour that ideal into reality. Importantly, that&#x27;s not really any more artificial than a beehive is, artificial is not a very well defined concept or in any way scientifically useful. Once again, it is part of our natural role, our nature, to transform nature around us. When we do transform nature in major ways, we speak for the trees, as much as destroy them. However, our societal development has led us into a transformation of nature which is wasteful and unsustainable. These are very scientifically useful concepts and things like sustainability can be experimented upon and proven. Imagining alternative transformations is the first step to projecting them into reality, to transforming nature once again in a way which has a long-term benefit for us all. There do however exist major economic barriers which can never be broken which prohibit permaculture on any real scale, though that&#x27;s only true as long as the economy is as it is now. Beside the point for now. My point is that it is not useful to consider ideal and badly defined concepts like artificial and natural and a struggle between the two.

A lot of things that people living a simpler life found out a long time ago presented as a &quot;system&quot;.<p>My takeaway though is that (as practiced anyway) it&#x27;s a bit of an culty scam, but there are worse ones and people being outside and around nature and growing things is in sum a good thing in my opinion so maybe I&#x27;m being a bit harsh.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t know everything, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem practical at any scale to provide calories. I&#x27;d probably feel better about it had I not heard this guy&#x27;s impractical cultish preaching for months. I hope he is doing fine wherever he is and got his land in the end.</div><br/><div id="35881962" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35881962" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mercutio2</span><span>|</span><a href="#35881290">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35880706">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35881962">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35881962">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I lived for many years on a commune where we strived to grow most of our own vegetables, and <i>I</i> always got a very culty vibe from permaculture folks, too (pot, kettle, some might say, but I distinguish cults and communes based on how welcome differing ideas are).<p>Mostly because they seemed so didactic about it: oh yes, sure you&#x27;re growing vegetables for yourself, but you&#x27;re doing it wrong, not observing principle X or Y.<p>Christopher Alexander adherents were always my favorite visitors, they&#x27;d talk about patterns as they understood them and ask questions about whether they applied.

Somebody else&#x27;s problem.<p>An old man asks if the bus will allow to catch the train connection at its destination. The bus driver bitches at him for asking that question -- not his job. Somebody else&#x27;s problem.<p>Training the bus driver that, being an official replacement of a train, he needs to know that, clearly also somebody else&#x27;s problem than that of the German Railways.<p>It&#x27;s pitch black outside, the windows are opaque due to moisture, so I can&#x27;t tell where we are even though I was born the area and lived here for 18 years. The bus driver makes no announcements about the stops, there is no display. Knowing when to request a stop to get off? Somebody else&#x27;s problem.<p>The bus is ice cold for an hour. When am old lady gets off and tells the bus driver that it was freezing all journey, he asks &quot;well what can you do&quot;. Bewildered she answers &quot;turn on the heating&quot;?

It&#x27;s implied that your program will encounter bugs or strange data and parts WILL be restarted, better account for that and plan on what to do on restart of each small part at the start of writing your program.<p>&gt; So, basically there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any phone technical support (with a human), at all.<p>Because it&#x27;s cheaper. Those who don&#x27;t have support can offer lower prices. When people search for trinkets, they only have information about what is supported, there is no good information about quality of device and support, high price also not always means better support. SO they just go for lower price and hope not to suffer too much.</div><br/><div id="41893837" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41893837" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eru</span><span>|</span><a href="#41893123">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41893667">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41893655">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41893837">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41893837">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, see also <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40212967">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40212967</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41893655" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41893655" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">auggierose</span><span>|</span><a href="#41893123">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41893383">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41893667">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41893836">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41893655">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41893655">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why did you switch?

The software layer has &quot;interfaces&quot; in the shape of specialized apps or devices that monitor and control the people in the &quot;worker&#x27;s layer&quot;.<p>- a &quot;worker&#x27;s layer&quot;: This group is fully human again. It consists of low-paid, frequently changing staff who perform most of the actual physical work that the business requires (and that can&#x27;t be automated away yet) - think Uber drivers, delivery drivers, Amazon warehouse workers, etc.<p>They have no contact at all with the management layer and little contact, if any, with human higher-ups. They get almost all their instructions through the apps and other interfaces of the software layer. Companies frequently dispute that those people technically belong to the company at all.<p>Whether or not those people are classified as employees, the important point (from the management&#x27;s POV) is that the software layer serves as a sort of &quot;accountability firewall&quot; between the other two layers.<p>Management only gives the high-level goal of how the software should perform, but the actual day-to-day interaction with the workers is exclusively done by the software itself.<p>The result is that any complaints from the worker&#x27;s layer cannot go up past the software - and any exploitative behavior towards the workers can be chalked up as an unfortunate software error.</div><br/><div id="41893751" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41893751" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tomaskafka</span><span>|</span><a href="#41893729">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41893152">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41893751">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41893751">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That’s what @vgr observed some time ago - people split into “above AI” and “below AI”, and the AI slowly moves up in the stack.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41893152" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41893152" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">solatic</span><span>|</span><a href="#41893729">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41892326">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41893152">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41893152">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Too focused on the bottom level.

As more and more employees are involved, and the processes get more and more hierarchical (rather than &quot;employee A&quot;, you have &quot;middle-manager M&quot;), then the person with accountability is higher and higher up the hierarchy, who also has more and more power and responsibility to fix it.<p>The idea of &quot;unaccountable&quot; failures only makes sense if both (a) the problem is so systemic that actually an executive is accountable, (b) the executive is so far removed in the hierarchy from the line employees doing the work that nobody knows each other or sometimes even sits on the same campus, (c) the levers available to the executive to fix the problem are insufficient for fixing the problem, e.g. the underlying root cause is a culture problem, but culture is determined by who you hire, fire, and promote, while hiring and firing are handled by &quot;outside&quot; HR who are unaccountable to the executive who is supposedly accountable.

You will also <i>fail hard</i> because you will be constantly blindsided by people either fucking up (at best) or gaming (at worst) the processes for which you are responsible. Small example litmus test: in organizations that use Jira, whether the executives are comfortable with JQL and building their own dashboards to tell them what they need to know, or whether they expect their direct reports to present their work.

We start cleaning early, so chances are we can accommodate early checkin where necessary.<p>Where there&#x27;s no room available before 4pm, some % will complain. Most of those will be placated with a voucher [1] which cost us nothing.<p>Some small fraction will declare &quot;they&#x27;ll never use us again&quot;. Some will (for reasons) but we&#x27;ll lose a few.<p>But the savings outweigh the lost business. Put some of the savings into marketing and sales will go up. Costs remain lower. More profit.<p>There is perfect accountability of this plan - the board watches to see if profits go up. They don&#x27;t care about an individual guest with individual problems. The goal of the business is not to &quot;make everyone happy&quot;. It&#x27;s to &quot;make enough people happy&quot; to keep profits.<p>[1] the <i>existance</i> of the voucher proves this possibility was accounted for.<p>So accountability in this case is working - except for the customer who didn&#x27;t get what they want. The customer feels frustrated, so from their perspective there&#x27;s a failure. But there are other perspectives in play. And they are working as designed.</div><br/><div id="41893259" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41893259" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">praptak</span><span>|</span><a href="#41892916">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41893001">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41893259">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41893259">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The economic calculation is often an accountability sink too.

Without any consequence there is no accountability. So why call it accountability in the first place?<p>This article is describing something along the lines of &quot;shared accountability&quot; which, in project management, is a well known phenomenon:  if multiple people are accountable for something, then no one is accountable.<p>If someone is accountable for something that they can&#x27;t do fully themselves, they are still accountable for setting up systems (maybe even people to help) to scale their ability to remain accountable for the thing.</div><br/><div id="41892375" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41892375" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">travisjungroth</span><span>|</span><a href="#41892290">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41892596">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41892375">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41892375">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think it’s that the accountability falls into the sink and doesn’t reach the decision maker.

Firing Squad
Limited Liability Organisation<p>Humans like to sleep at night. An emergent property of our rule of law is that it exists in a way to reduce the moral culpability of any individual. A police man, a jury member, a judge, a inspector, an executioner, a jailer, they all exist in very neat boxes. These boxes allow them to sleep at night. Surely the Judge has few qualms going by the recommended mandatory minimum, after the jury, who is assured the judge will provide a fair sentence, and the executioner doubly so, with double the potential moral hazard, is certain at least two other parties have done their due diligence.<p>these systems prevent a single actor from acting. More like they allow a series of hand offs, so by the time the jailer is slamming the doors shut, they are bereft of any investment in the morality of the outcome<p>The firing squad, with seven guns, all line up, with just one loaded.

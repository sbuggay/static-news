A several metres deep underground bunker, containing several 19&quot; racks full of electrical&#x2F;electronic gear, filled to ground level with a combination of mineralised surface water and mud during a storm.<p>What we wanted to do was cut the power, pump the water out of the bunker ASAP and immediately clean the whole lot with pure water.<p>What the (arse-covering) site manager did was nothing, not even cut the power, until a &quot;risk-assessment&quot; had been done.  For the first few days we were able to peer into the bunker&#x27;s hatch and watch der blinkenlights happily operating in the gloom underwater.  That stopped after a few days.  About a week later the risk had been assessed and a path of action determined: the power was turned off, the water was pumped out and everything was washed with pure water.  By then electrolysis had dissolved just about every conductor in the system.<p>Electrical systems will happily cope with water in the short term, but the longer the exposure the less likely they are to survive.

I loved it and when I heard about how sclerotic it had gotten was pretty surprised.<p>Looking back, IMO the seeds of its downfall had already been planted by the time I was there, including the culture of blameless postmortems.<p>There was this idea that any problem—any outage or whatever —reflected not stupidity on the part of the perpetrator (Google hires the smartest people after all) but a process failure. Blameless postmortems avoided blame by ending with a process recommendation.<p>I’ve worked at startups since, and I do think that creating an environment where people are comfortable taking risks is just a fundamentally hard culture problem, and you don’t even have to be big to have it (though it doesn’t help). I’ve seen 15-person startups where engineers wouldn’t fix something because “I’m just an engineer and this is really a product decision” while the PM says “we need to get the engineers together in a meeting and come to a consensus on this.”<p>IMO Google’s hack of giving people space to take risks by letting them pass off failure as a process problem did sort of work, to their credit, until they got to where it sounds like they are now, where you can’t do anything without being accused of bypassing “good process,” which means going to endless lengths to get everyone’s opinions and placating everyone who disagrees with you.<p>It seems like at Meta they solved the problem by regarding failure as good and just. At my current company, to do something risky, you have to write a design doc and have a comment period, and then you’re free to do whatever the doc proposes.

Instead of doing complicated engineering reasoning all the time to ensure their safety they learn simple “rules of thumb”.

Is everybody wrong? Of course not. It is just that the statement “don’t put metal in a microwave” is a simplified form of the true statement which would go something like this “don’t put metal in a microwave, unless you follow these safety precautions, and wear these safety gear, and your crucible is made of the appropriate materials, and your moulds are bone dry and …”. Aint nobody has the time to think about all the caveats and dangers when all they want is to warm their meals.

This switch was in a plastic NEMA box mounted on the outside of a ski lift. When I went to imvestigate, I found that a small glacier had formed over the NEMA box, and had ripped the door off the box. When I got there, the box was full of ice, which was in the process of melting. The switch was still running, but the ice had ripped the trunk patch cable out - apparently the root cause of the switch going down.

I bought a bunch of vinyl 45&#x27;s off of eBay several years ago and they were pretty gross. I stumbled across a forum where someone recommended washing them with water and a little bit of dish soap. As you can probably imagine, a lot of people freaked out in the responses and said it was a terrible idea. I gave it a whirl because the records were cheap and they sounded <i>perfect</i> after they dried. There was no warping or damage, although a few of the labels got a little messed up (but the needle doesn&#x27;t go there anyways, so I didn&#x27;t mind).

There&#x27;s usually a motor that slowly spins the record so that the label never gets submerged, and there are label protectors with o-ring seals that you can use while rinsing to protect the label.<p>The distilled water is mostly needed to avoid deposits from water spots after the rinse water evaporates.

I have to do this sort of thing <i>all the time</i> and can confidently tell you it&#x27;s pretty normal.<p>The real risk isn&#x27;t really to the toaster (who cares, it&#x27;s just a toaster, and even if it starts on fire when you plug it in, you&#x27;re probably watching it pretty closely).<p>No, it&#x27;s that you leach lead or other such nasties (sealing rubbers, PCB epoxies, what-have-you) into your dishwasher and start eating them when they get redeposited onto your dishes. Lead isn&#x27;t that harmful... except when you eat it. Don&#x27;t eat lead.<p>In fact, if you have a dedicated dishwasher for this (or ultrasonic cleaner! those are pretty awesome, most of the time, for most things!), I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to do this! You know what we call those kinds of things where I work? Parts washers. You know what we wash in them... circuit boards! It&#x27;s fine! Circuit boards are cleaned with aqueous solutions all the time as part of normal manufacturing! If you don&#x27;t have a dedicated dishwasher... well, I wouldn&#x27;t do it then, but if you <i>must</i>, you&#x27;ll want to run the dishwasher a few more times, empty, with a strong detergent, preferably a lead-chelating one. (You might also make one of those runs with dishwasher cleaner, and strike the whole &quot;yearly dishwasher cleaning&quot; task off your to-do list for the first time this... uh, decade?)<p>You will, of course, want to dry things well. This is both easier and harder with a toaster. Easier because, well, toasters get hot, and this will get any nooks and crannies dry. Harder because one of the tricks to get things dry faster after they come out of a parts washer is to rinse them in alcohol, because alcohol dries very fast. You, uh, don&#x27;t want to do that with a toaster.

Yet the breaker no trip, so either it wasn&#x27;t a protected circuit or they drew another wrong conclusion based on that aquarium observation which they expected to go differently based on a previously wrong conclusion.<p>If you can assume the water has a similar conductivity as the tap water in the aquarium (not sure that&#x27;s a safe assumption after it flooded a room with all sorts of dust and objects in it), and you can assume that your body can handle more electricity than the breaker needs to trip, then a fairly short distance ought to indeed insulate you well enough, but the objective was to get close and turn it off.

To me, the situations &quot;hairdryer runs by itself in water&quot; and &quot;I, standing on a ground, stick my hand near the device&#x27;s off switch in the water&quot; are two very different things.

Also electricity, I&#x27;ve noticed before a lot of mysticism and fear goes around unnecessarily. So I like the part where experimenting, when done carefully (letting it dry, using a protected circuit, being aware that it might fail and you should observe it first), is encouraged.

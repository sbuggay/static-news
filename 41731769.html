Against Threats(TM)!  Buy me if you&#x27;re scared of Threats(TM)!<p>Threat modeling (&quot;Secure from who?  Under what conditions?&quot;) sort of stuff just doesn&#x27;t seem to be a thing that&#x27;s taught these days outside certain weird circles.  And certainly something this project hasn&#x27;t touched on in the slightest.  But, yes, I was having to keep my eyeballs constrained too.<p>As much as it pains me, I think the most &quot;generally secure phone&quot; out there, for at least the sort of threat models this phone handwaves at (journalists, human rights activists) is a recent (last generation or two) iPhone with Lockdown enabled - and then shut down nightly, and carried shut down through any sort of sensitive environments.  I would be inclined to go with an iPhone SE3, moreso than one of the mainline devices, simply for fingerprint scanning versus the FaceID stuff.  You can&#x27;t &quot;point a phone at me&quot; and unlock it with my fingerprint, but you can with FaceID in a wide enough range of situations to be concerning.  Set a longer than usual PIN&#x2F;passphrase, and be careful where you enter it.<p>As far as I understand the boot process, Apple has largely fixed a lot of the &quot;before first unlock&quot; type attacks with their secure enclave.  They fixed that rather well after the battle with the FBI, and seem to have continued hardening and improving that process (hence my recommendation for the latest generation or two of device - there <i>are</i> changes in the boot security flows every now and then, and I assume they matter, at some point).<p>Then Lockdown, as near as I can tell, does a very fine job of simply closing the common attack points used.  Most of the &quot;good&quot; attacks on iPhone users (at least the ones I know of...) are through the various &quot;texting-esque&quot; endpoints with weird image formats, or a browser based Javascript&#x2F;JIT exploit, and Lockdown does a fine job of simply refusing most of the paths these use.  Weird image formats simply aren&#x27;t rendered.  URLs in text messages aren&#x27;t accessed and previewed.  The Javascript engine removes all JIT capabilities, WebRTC, WebGL, and other &quot;suitably complex that it&#x27;s probably exploitable&quot; sort of features.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect, but were I an individual who believed I was under actual threat for this sort of stuff, I&#x27;d 100% use a secured iPhone (possibly with some of the Mobile Device Management features configured by a trusted person to disable the USB port and such things) over a random device like this.  Sorry, open JTAG ports means it&#x27;s &quot;comically insecure&quot; against anyone with local access and the time to bother doing anything with it.<p>And of course, don&#x27;t keep location services on, don&#x27;t install a ton of apps, etc.  The usual if you&#x27;re concerned about any of this.<p>I don&#x27;t <i>like</i> that this is the state of the world of secure computing, but it certainly seems to be it, to me.</div><br/><div id="41736578" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41736578" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kotaKat</span><span>|</span><a href="#41735434">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41735799">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41737848">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41736578">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41736578">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One of the amusing things I thought about with acquiring a &quot;secure&quot; iPhone was that you should just buy it from a random Walmart in the middle of nowhere in America.<p>The supply chain is so wide and vast, and even if they <i>did</i> tamper with it, the iPhone is basically the only phone out there that multiple third parties have ran through CT scanners, X-ray machines, and silicon R&#x2F;E just to show off the tech inside the phone like a bunch of nerds for clicks, meaning you have lots of good reference material to check against for any potential tampering of your own acquisition.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41737848" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41737848" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">umbra07</span><span>|</span><a href="#41735434">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41735799">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41736578">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41736531">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41737848">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41737848">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Er, no, that would be locked-down GrapheneOS, on a Pixel.<p>There&#x27;s a multitude of reasons - but here&#x27;s the biggest one: Apple&#x27;s Lockdown mode is all or nothing.

half-baked ideas of &quot;secure&quot; and &quot;threat&quot;, but then you start talking
about cameras, fingerprint readers and boot processes...<p>These have nothing to do with <i>phones</i> as I see them. For me a secure
phone is the minimum viable device to make a voice communication (and
perhaps short text messages at a stretch).<p>So what&#x27;s going on here is woolly ideas about <i>function</i>. If we define
a &quot;phone&quot; as a multi-purpose personal computer, address book, secure
storage device, video player, film camera etc, then it&#x27;s going to have
very different security parameters than a simple &quot;telephone&quot;.<p>So we can&#x27;t talk about threats and security until we have talked about
function. As we define (or rather fail to define) a &#x27;phone&#x27; today it
has almost no functional boundaries, and so there&#x27;s no model around
which to define security.<p>The minimal RISC-V device outlined in the article looks like the kind
of thing that could be customised to constrain functionality in such a
way as to add security. It obtains that possibility by giving control
to the end user around what <i>not</i> to include.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41735992" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41735992" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">numpad0</span><span>|</span><a href="#41735434">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41738939">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41735992">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41735992">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My pet peeve on open-source, *-focused hardware: it should start with an artistic sketch and a mockup, not the final board and a shell wrapped around as an afterthought.<p>Valve[1] reportedly made over 100 mockups before settling on the final shape, most of them representing shapes only.

That&#x27;s hard.  If you want a simple phone, your best bet is to carry a tablet or laptop for that sort of thing, and just hotspot off the phone if&#x2F;when needed.  Most current featurephones have a thing called a web browser, and it ranges from &quot;almost useless&quot; to &quot;literally can&#x27;t render the modern web.&quot;  That&#x27;s before you sort out using it on what is typically a 320x240 pixel display.

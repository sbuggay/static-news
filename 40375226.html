I think the main reason why R is fading is simply why some other languages fade: fashion, and prestige of the new masters (read: professor X in field Y likes esoteric language Z, so his grad students write out libraries A&#x2F;B&#x2F;C to corner the Z library space, and professor X gets more clout than he ever would in a default language).</div><br/><div id="40376373" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40376373" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wodenokoto</span><span>|</span><a href="#40375953">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40376394">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40376373">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40376373">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; All the main packages that have to do any heavy lifting have had their functions outsourced to fortran or C decades ago.<p>And apparently that&#x27;s the problem, FTA:<p>&gt; Fortran isn’t as popular as it used to be, and we encounter issues when compiling it with modern compilers like LLVM.

It’s equally valid to say the reason for building any of the (numerous) libraries for R is to “prolong R’s usefulness”.<p>I think you’ve proposed a real reason a language’s popularity changes. But let’s add a few more: First, as languages grow in use that in itself leads to more use (and vice versa). Second, users of languages use said languages as protection of their jobs, livelihoods, culture, and so on by simply not learning less popular languages or allowing the use of less commonly used languages. There is power in numbers.<p>IMO R’s problem has nothing to do with R’s limitations (which when limited are easily expanded). To the contrary, if anything, R’s ability to enable users to do so much is more of a problem than its limitations. The norms (culture) of a company say using many different languages for different organizational roles can clash with an R user who can succinctly work cross-functionally. Employees could be interested in preserving siloed roles and employers could prefer limited scope for employees. Instead of one person building something and presenting to users, you could have many employees serving in many roles using standard languages for each role. R is basically a wrapper language, and the ease at which third-party libraries can be built and installed for R, and R’s flexibility is inherently “useful” but less dogmatic. Less dogmatic but also less standard and less common.<p>… So I just don’t think the problem for R is that “it’s not deemed useful” and I actually think such an argument is disingenuous on the part of people who want to limit the power of R users. Granted, I think, particularly in large organizations, using the most popular languages in itself has valid justification. But the reason is to attract employees and to build siloed expertise; not to enhance “usefulness”. Finally, I think promoting your own project by saying it will help a useless language is self serving and saying that will not help the stated goal of raising use of said language.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40376134" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40376134" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">_Wintermute</span><span>|</span><a href="#40375953">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40376394">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40375882">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40376134">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40376134">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; R is also thriving in bioinformatics with Python trailing behind as an afterthought.<p>Maybe this is sub-field dependent, I&#x27;m a bioinformatician who hasn&#x27;t touched R in about 5 years, and everything is now in python.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40375882" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40375882" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dash2</span><span>|</span><a href="#40375953">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40375882">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40375882">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think one problem R might have is that the core language is developed in a fairly tight-knit and informal way. There&#x27;s no equivalent to Python&#x27;s PEP process, say. For a young language the informality might be an advantage, but for an older one the risk is that the core developers become a bit insulated from the community of users.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

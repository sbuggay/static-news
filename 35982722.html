To wit, the clarity and focus of &quot;what and why&quot; for an effort determines the &quot;how and when.&quot;  Which makes the answer to &quot;knowing how to measure or even define developer productivity&quot; no longer elusive, but instead quantifiable.<p>Few, if any, qualified developers I have worked with have a poor DevEx when the work needed to be done is well-defined (what) and can be explained such that a solution is identifiable (why).

This is usually an iterative process engaged before any significant implementation is undertaken.<p>Essentially, the upstream-processes I reference regard establishing a shared understanding.  As such, most delivery metrics are not relevant at this point.  However, an important benefit is that unneeded effort is often identified and not engaged.<p>&gt; Some kind of diff between the planned architecture or requirements on day 0 and the final codebase?<p>In general, system architecture and code bases exist in the &quot;how&quot;, not in the &quot;what and why.&quot;  At a macro (business) level, sometimes architecture decisions such as whether or not to use a cloud provider or data centers do influence the &quot;what.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s kind of like branching in a programming language.

(one of the examples in the article)  When I was there (up to 2017) the team that made the internal web framework, Raptor, refused to let anyone see the source code.  I mean people that worked at the company, they wouldn&#x27;t let people sitting 15 feet from them see the source code to the web framework that they used all day to work.  Of course you could easily see it in any Java IDE, but they didn&#x27;t seem to know that.  Another team was merging branches by copying the entire source tree and going through the files one by one and manually merging changes in.  eBay had been 100% on git&#x2F;github for over 5 years at that point, nobody on the team had ever learned how branches work, and they had managed to never have anyone tell them either.  There had been about 17 large initiatives to fix the MyEbay pages, since every tab was implemented on a different generation of web framework, going all the way back to one that worked entirely via XSLT and merging xml documents which had been retired for well over a decade at that point.  All of the efforts failed, and I just checked and my eBay is still using multiple generations of web framework spanning decades.  This wouldn&#x27;t be such a big deal except they don&#x27;t have the competence left in the company to update the styling so as you click through tabs the page changes from reactive to fixed width to %width depending on what you are looking at.  (try it, go to myEbay and click eBay Bucks, or click Messages)  They can&#x27;t even get the color scheme aligned.  Again, if they said &#x27;nobody cares&#x27; that&#x27;s just prioritization, but I know that this has been attempted at least 5 times with teams of a dozen people spending up to a year on it.  There isn&#x27;t some secret complexity that thwarts them, it&#x27;s just an organization that is politically driven and leadership that is more interested in harassing journalists than the business of the company.  eBay&#x27;s DevEx was bad, but their DevCompetence was shocking.</div><br/><div id="36018764" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36018764" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sokoloff</span><span>|</span><a href="#36018065">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36018764">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36018764">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; They can&#x27;t even get the color scheme aligned.

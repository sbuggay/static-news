When I was 10 years younger I read the same thing on HN, was thoroughly convinced and quit social media. I even followed the advice of trying to stay in touch by email. Sure.<p>Turns out that a lot of people I knew posted huge life updates that I completely missed out on. I asked them why they didn’t tell me and they were confused. They said the posted it on social media. I can’t speak for everyone, but I know a lack of social media meant that I have lost touch with old acquaintances completely.

Some of this is natural (though I don&#x27;t believe healthy) but I think some of this is due to social media where people expect others to be aware of all their major events. Ironically I find this aspect of social media fairly dehumanizing. It disincentivizes direct communication. Why tell someone about things they already know?  Getting the first account always coveys so much more than a facebook post. Sometimes I think we&#x27;ve forgotten how to talk to one another and read all the communication besides that in text. Text is at such a higher compression rate and it certainly isn&#x27;t lossless. No matter how many emojis, memes, or images you include.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42678437" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42678437" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bluGill</span><span>|</span><a href="#42678031">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42678241">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42680581">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42678441">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42678437">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42678437">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Problem is facebook decides what you want to see unless you go to the feed which they make hard.

Happily most reasonable tech stuff lists on HN, some interesting stuff on MR, both being more-or-less a social network (of sorts) in a 90s disguise.<p>Conventional media can be ok for casual reading&#x2F;scrolling, but feels  increasingly out-of-touch. Interestingly these days cnn, bbc, dw, en, and aj list different headlines, which is not what it was 15 y.ago.<p>Still I&#x27;d strongly advise against all push media, and in particular Meta&#x27;s products which pose a very high-risk of (screen) addiction thanks to hundreds of hidden retention mechanisms.</div><br/><div id="42680960" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42680960" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">joostdecock</span><span>|</span><a href="#42678031">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42680834">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42678220">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42680960">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42680960">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; some interesting stuff on MR<p>I&#x27;m drawing a blank for MR.

I still keep it around to follow sports pundits during games, and I usually only follow my sports list. But I do check in on my main feed during major events, and then inevitably end up doomscrolling. For example, the LA fires hashtags are so far beyond toxic - nothing but engagement farming, malicious misinfo, political nonsense, etc. Amidst all that crap, maybe 1 in 10 tweets has good info, but I have to destroy my psyche to find it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42681184" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42681184" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kelnos</span><span>|</span><a href="#42678031">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42678220">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42681238">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42681184">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42681184">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>Maybe that’s an ok tradeoff to make, but it’s worth knowing that before getting into it.</i><p>I think that&#x27;s the key point.  I realized that ultimately I didn&#x27;t actually care about those huge life updates if they concerned people who I&#x27;m not in somewhat-regular contact with.  Like, if my Facebook friend John Smith (let&#x27;s say he&#x27;s an old high-school friend I haven&#x27;t seen since high school) posts about his marriage, or new job, or new child, and I don&#x27;t actually chat with John anymore and don&#x27;t know anything about his life outside of what I read on Facebook, why do I even care to know this stuff at all?  And it turns out the answer is that... I don&#x27;t!  And there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.  It&#x27;s not rude or mean; some people are the closest of friends, and some people barely even warrant the &quot;acquaintance&quot; tag -- and everything in between -- and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with any of that.<p>And yes, I&#x27;ve missed social media posts about big-life stuff from closer friends who I <i>do</i> care about, but that&#x27;s fine!  I chat with those people via some avenue (email, text, messaging group, real-life, whatever) often enough that I still get those big-life updates, and usually it&#x27;s in a more personalized manner, that gets me details that are tailored to the level of closeness of our friendship.<p>For people who I&#x27;m not super close with, but still maintain a relationship with, maybe I get that update about their life 6 months later, when we are next in contact.  That&#x27;s also fine!  If we were closer friends, we&#x27;d chat more often, and I&#x27;d hear about it earlier.  But we&#x27;re not, and I don&#x27;t, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.<p>&gt; <i>a lack of social media meant that I have lost touch with old acquaintances completely. I have a few close friends and that’s it.</i><p>That&#x27;s more your choice than anything else.  You always have the option to text or email someone directly to say hello and see how they&#x27;re doing, or to set up a time to meet in person to catch up.  Even if they&#x27;re perhaps not the one-on-one type of friends, you can start a group chat with that person and other mutual friends who might enjoy keeping in touch that way.  There are so so so many options for communication these days that it&#x27;s almost overwhelming!  But it certainly need not be a binary between &quot;social media firehose of every person I&#x27;ve ever met&quot; and &quot;I only hear about the lives of few people&quot;.<p>Is it important to you to be in touch with those old acquaintances?  If so, reach out to them!  If not, then it sounds like quitting social media was fine for you.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42681238" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42681238" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">openrisk</span><span>|</span><a href="#42678031">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42681381">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42681238">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42681238">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When something is used by billions of people its kinda futile to argue about its utility.

The problems and much of the anger stems from feeling almost forced to use the products of a company I think manipulates and exploit it&#x27;s users. It&#x27;s almost impossible for my kid to have a social life and for me to be involved without a Facebook account and I can&#x27;t even offer an alternative form of communication because pretty much anything else would be more work for everyone else.<p>Agree on you with Linkedin.

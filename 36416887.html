I thought I&#x27;d learn some new tricks in refurbishing old computer equipment. I am an old computer hoarder and I spend way too much time refurbishing old components(replacing caps, complete disassembly and cleaning of case and hardware, replacement with SSDs, maxxing out ram, etc.)<p>I have had a lot of trouble finding a way to do deep cleaning of plastics and refurbishing a case to like new status. I wanna learn how the pros do it. These plastics become yellowed, become brittle but the worst thing I am finding is just gouges in the plastic that I cannot smooth out or things such as stains that can&#x27;t seem to get removed.<p>In terms of cleaning components, I first tried deoxit but it leaves a film that I don&#x27;t like. Now I am resorting to soaking a board in 99% alcohol and using a brush to remove all the gunk off it and then using an air gun to blow away all the alcohol. Its the best way to leave boards looking like new but I am concerned with introducing liquids to solder joints and connectors and increasing their corrosion levels.<p>Anyone got any advice or resources I could use to improve my skills?</div><br/><div id="36427584" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36427584" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PaulBGD_</span><span>|</span><a href="#36427325">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36427169">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36427584">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36427584">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I also do refurbishing, I’ve never found IPA to damage boards (evaporates fast without any residue.)<p>You can deyellow with retrobright, but the downside is that it makes plastic more brittle.

If I dont use a brush with the IPA, it leaves behind the dust residue in clumps. Also more worryingly, it seems to leave contacts less shiny than before which is what concerns me.<p>&gt;You can deyellow with retrobright, but the downside is that it makes plastic more brittle.<p>Yeah I have a pile of plastics I&#x27;ve been collecting that I wish to try with retrobrite but I haven&#x27;t made the jump yet. I plan to try the &#x27;vapor&#x27; method to be as gentle as possible on the plastic.<p>&gt;For some stains you can get them out with a magic eraser, it’s essentially a high grit sponge.<p>In my experience magic eraser does remove stains but also smooths the plastic and removes the small bumps and bruises you naturally have on a lot of plastic pieces from the 90s. That roughness I am talking about is from the metal mold. Also magic eraser is terrible for clear plastics. How do you deal with that?<p>&gt;Agreed about deoxit, it’s still good for contacts though (cartridges and such.)<p>Yes but the spray version gets everywhere. There are different versions of deoxit. I tired D-series and this stuff just does not fully evaporate from the board.

I use it sometimes, but submersing in a UV box works pretty well without being too rough.<p>I honestly don’t run into that with magic eraser, you’re keeping the eraser wet right? I might just be pretty gentle with it, but I’m pretty sensitive to this stuff and haven’t noticed any damage.<p>Yep go for the direct application stuff, I forget exactly which series it is but is easier to apply. One thing I’ve copied from the YouTuber TronicsFix is applying the deoxit to a small square of magic eraser and using that to clean the contacts.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36427169" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36427169" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xp84</span><span>|</span><a href="#36427325">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36428374">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36427169">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36427169">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Doing just this, around 2001 or so, provided a teenaged me with my first skills in IT.<p>I would take castoffs being thrown out by the school, or stuff other kids had gotten from family members who upgraded, fix them up, upgrade them if I could, and put on a suitable OS with any customizations and streamlining I could do to make them run the best they could.

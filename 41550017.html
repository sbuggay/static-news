It&#x27;s cosplay.<p>Real wartime footing:<p>1. Direction and technical decisions are driven by priorities of board-level members and often arrive in email form late on Friday evening.  The entire organisation is expected to pivot immediately. A new senior leadership team member starts scheduling daily read-outs on project progress, and half the organisation spends the weekend frantically hallucinating project plans into Google Sheets.<p>2. Engineering staff react with dull-eyed disbelief on Monday; they knew this was coming, because the same thing happened a month ago, and six weeks before that.<p>3. Emails come from HR that there are are new, even-more-labyrinthine approval processes for expenses, and shrinking budgets for anything not directly related to whatever the <i>projet du jour</i>, which will be fed enough to make it look like it&#x27;s succeeding until the next Friday evening email kills it.<p>4. There is wide-spread burn-out across Engineering teams, and people are reduced to reactive, sarcastic automatons.<p>5. A creeping understanding seizes the better engineers that things cannot improve; they sign articles of  Armistice, pretend to comply, and start interviewing elsewhere.<p>6. An email arrives on Friday night...<p>&gt; Focus on the positive aspects of the job that can be taken for granted, like the opportunity to work on cutting-edge challenges, the company&#x27;s still existing perks and benefits, the amazing team you have, the chance to work with a modern tech stack, or how your product is helping its users. Showing your team how you appreciate what&#x27;s still good can help with morale.<p>If HN supported gifs, there&#x27;d be several in this spot.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41550937" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41550937" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dakiol</span><span>|</span><a href="#41553929">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41550657">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41550937">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41550937">[27 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It all feels like theatre.

(As something of a bonus: I&#x27;ll bring in the military given the whole &quot;wartime&quot; trope.)<p>In particular, Scrum is only there to establish rituals that enable empiricism in decision making. A sprint is a reporting period to keep the team from spending too much time in the weeds. A standup is there to keep the team working together. The andon cord (which is often missing I find) is there when the facts have changed so utterly profoundly that everyone needs to regroup.<p>Anyone who&#x27;s been through RTC (&quot;boot camp&quot;), and even some who haven&#x27;t but have lived vicariously through others, understand that being constantly yelled at by RDCs (&quot;drill instructors&quot;) on how you make your racks and fold your clothes is all about building certain habits and only tenuously related to what you&#x27;ll be doing after A-school. It all has more to do with building trust that the rest of the folks in your ship will help carry you when the going gets tough. Scrum, at its core, is kinda like that.<p>I really dislike the term &quot;Scrum Master.&quot; They&#x27;re a team captain. The more military-minded might be keener to use &quot;gunnery sergeant&quot; or &quot;chief petty officer:&quot; they&#x27;re just the most senior person in the rating group^W^W^W^Won the team. (Though, I&#x27;d probably take more inspiration from the Marines than the Navy here: a culture of servant leadership seems to bring out the best in people.)<p>The most popular implementations of Scrum tend to come with a ridiculous amount of meeting and tool baggage, and it&#x27;s so unnecessary.<p>Use Excel. Hold your standups at the close of the day so people can go home. Write your product backlog items in delivery order so that sprint planning is less about sitting in one room playing poker and more about just getting valuable shit done.<p>That said, what isn&#x27;t unnecessary, however, is kneecapping command a little: the engineering officer of the watch has comparatively little understanding of the actual operation of the machine. They just know that they want operational excellence. However, that excellence also sometimes comes with the watch supervisor—a subordinate—publicly calling out mistakes that the watch officer makes.</div><br/><div id="41551619" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41551619" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tbrownaw</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550937">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551326">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41552379">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41551619">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41551619">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>I really dislike the term &quot;Scrum Master.&quot; They&#x27;re a team captain.</i><p>Originally that term was supposed to be a temporary role that someone (rotated each time) would take on during a scrum meeting, and referred to them being charged with keeping the meeting on track.</div><br/><div id="41552131" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41552131" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mgkimsal</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550937">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551619">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551746">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41552131">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41552131">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">and... it would keep everyone on their toes a bit more, vs just having a group of folks that nod and say &#x27;yes&#x27;, &#x27;no&#x27; or &#x27;3 points&#x27; a few times at the same time every day.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41551746" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41551746" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nrr</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550937">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551619">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41552131">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41552379">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41551746">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41551746">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It was!

I wasn&#x27;t aware of his other book, so very much looking forward to reading this.<p>I first read this book when I was starting out as a Dev some 20 years ago. It made a huge impression and is still relevant. Some things I remember off the top of my head.<p>- It was the first time I came across Occams Razor. This really helped me understand how to approach debugging issues and generally dealing with problems.<p>- It discusses the dangers of people who don&#x27;t understand areas at a technical level being in charge of programs that depend on those technical things. Even more so when they have an inflated ego. Apparently Churchill was very good at seeing through this.<p>- If I&#x27;m remembering correctly, there was a section about a practical joke someone played on their apartment neighbour that involved swapping out their pet tortoise for gradually larger versions. I very recently read a Roald Dahl childrens book to my kid which had this exact story.

The team is a lot smaller these days than we were before. But we&#x27;re not dead yet and I still enjoy working on our product. Things are actually looking pretty good at this point and we have some perspective on revenue growth and even team growth. Being bootstrapped means we can set our own pace.<p>The thing with fire fighting is that you 1) need to recognize that you are doing it. 2) put a stop to it.<p>Firefighting simply doesn&#x27;t work. You have a 100 fires to put out and you put out 1 or 2. The house will still burn down. And you will be too stressed to do a good job at what little you are still actually doing. So you&#x27;ll cause a few more fires in the process. Firefighting leads to more fire fighting. Also the constant context switching actually means you are less productive.<p>In terms of people management (including yourself), fire fighting is not sustainable for very long. It just makes people miserable, stresses them out, and eventually they leave, get burned out, etc. And that includes yourself. You have a breaking point and you want to stay on the right side of it. In my case, if I step out the company dies. It&#x27;s that simple. So, I use my weekends to recover, not to work my ass off. Coming in well rested on Monday is more important than getting whatever done on a Sunday.<p>So, take the tough decisions you need to make (who gets to stay, which things to cut, etc.) and then stabilize at whatever level is sustainable. De-prioritize the things that won&#x27;t get done anyway. Stop pretending that you are even doing them. Ruthlessly prioritize what needs doing and filter that list by do-ability and then by available resources and then by short term priority.<p>Smaller teams mean things actually get easier. Less need for meetings, less conflicts, etc. I&#x27;d run this thing differently if I had a ten person team. But I just don&#x27;t. So a lot of management is just me freeing up time so I can actually do things myself.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41551963" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41551963" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hitekker</span><span>|</span><a href="#41554064">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41554079">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41551963">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41551963">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Speaking as an engineering manager, this is wish-fulfillment.

These particular ones are troublesome because they fall closer on the spectrum to &quot;reduce executives&quot;. If you&#x27;re pushing decision-making downstream, it should also be reduced upstream. If you reduce it upstream, you have less (not zero) need for leadership there. That has to manifest either in fewer leaders or leaders doing a better job at their other duties. In particular, they need to be producing much clearer stronger vision for the downstream folks to align their decisions to. Vision is perhaps the hardest task in the org and when it&#x27;s hard it&#x27;s easy to shirk on. Often, when leaders talk about trying to move to a bottom up culture, they are (unconsciously?) trying to absolve themselves of the vision work. And they&#x27;re usually doing it while still gatekeeping information and resources they were meant to have because they were decision makers.<p>This is going too far, but directionally:

You can only operate in this mode for at best 2-3 months before your entire SDLC grinds to a halt because it&#x27;s been the wild west in github.<p>If that happens, you decentralised more than was possible (&quot;as much as possible&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;completely&quot;). You removed too many important barriers. A bit more concretely, you gave authority to those that weren&#x27;t capable of handling it, or weren&#x27;t supported properly. You removed an approval layer without supporting your team to check these things for themselves.</div><br/><div id="41551674" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41551674" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lubujackson</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550767">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551009">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551130">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41551674">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41551674">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Makes sense, but at some point this advice boils down to &quot;have the perfect amount of centralized control&quot; which doesn&#x27;t say anything useful at all.</div><br/><div id="41551764" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41551764" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">afro88</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550767">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551674">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551130">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41551764">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41551764">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the advice is based on &quot;peace time&quot; management, during more comfortable profitable times, leaning towards more centralised control.

For example, why does a list of managers and an exec need to approve a $10 per month subscription that saves a bunch of engineering time by managing cascading PR merges?<p>And identify safe ways to delegate. For example, if we move container image vuln scanning into CI&#x2F;CD pipelines, the dev team can update dependencies themselves without a security team being involved to do it for them and approve.<p>These might seem like silly examples to someone working at a half decent start up or tech first org.

Here’s the story…
I was working from home with my girlfriend (at the time), when suddenly I get an urgent ping from my coworker: “Our service is experiencing a SEV 2! We need all hands on deck!” Uh oh, our team’s application has gone down!
However, as I scrambled to figure out how to fix the issue, I smelled something burning from another room and heard a fire alarm go off. “Will! There’s a fire! Help!” I heard my girlfriend shout. Now I was stuck in a conundrum — restore a critical Amazon service, or put out the fire in my apartment?
It was at that time I remembered Amazon’s famous leadership principle “Customer Obsession”. There are customers who depend on my team’s application — I can’t let them down! So I ignored the fire and my girlfriend’s pleas, and started debugging the production issue.
But all of a sudden, the smoke in my apartment cleared and the fire alarm fell silent. My girlfriend walked into the room, and to my astonishment, peeled off a wig and revealed herself to be Jeff Bezos himself! “I’m proud of you for being obsessed with our customers,” he said, and gave me a $5 Amazon gift card. He then leaped out of my window and hopped into a waiting Amazon Prime delivery van that quickly peeled away.
Even though I no longer work at Amazon, I’m so grateful for these experiences that taught me lessons I’ll never forget.

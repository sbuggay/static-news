Relatively many people are familiar with linear mode (64K of usable memory, fast blitting but no double buffering) and mode X (256K memory, complicated or slow blitting, and double buffering at 320x240).<p>Jazz was as far as I know the only game to use odd&#x2F;even mode, which is normally used for text mode, for 256 color graphics. It gives 128K of memory, extremely fast blitting and double buffering at 320x200 and is a super interesting hack, but it&#x27;s almost completely undocumented. I only found out because QEMU made a mess of it until I decided I wanted to play some Jazz. :)</div><br/><div id="42838315" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42838315" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Cumpiler69</span><span>|</span><a href="#42838124">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42837316">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42838315">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42838315">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt;Jazz Jackrabbit employs some really unique VGA programming to do fast blitting</i><p>Isn&#x27;t this similar(identical?) to the tricks John Carmack used to get side scrolling Mario clones like Commander Keen working on the PC platform, who&#x27;s rudimentary graphics system couldn&#x27;t do that back then?</div><br/><div id="42838473" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42838473" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bonzini</span><span>|</span><a href="#42838124">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42838315">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42837316">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42838473">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42838473">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No, it&#x27;s not. Keen 1 was a 16 color game; 16 color games pack 8 pixels in a byte and spread the color information across 4 planes. Accessing the different planes requires programming the video card&#x27;s registers and there isn&#x27;t really a way to change the representation of the pixels in memory, what Carmack did was write fast blitting routines and use the hardware&#x27;s smooth scrolling capabilities. All these were hiding in plane sight in the EGA&#x2F;VGA manuals, they are exactly how the hardware was supposed to be used even though nobody had done it before Keen.<p>256 color modes are a different beast. The VGA can only load four bytes at a time but those four bytes must have the same address and come from the four planes. So whereas the 16 color mode split the color information across planes, 256 color modes put a whole pixel in a byte and four adjacent pixels go into four planes. Normally you want 1 byte per pixel and ignore planes completely, so the hardware is programmed to remap bits 0-1 of the address to the planes and do some magic so that reads also work as intended. You can still do smooth scrolling in this mode, but double buffering requires more expensive copies from VRAM to main memory.<p>Michael Abrash then noticed that this is absolutely not necessary and you <i>can</i> use planes in 256 colors mode. Unlike Carmack&#x27;s Keen, this was completely undocumented. In retrospect it&#x27;s quite obvious: the VGA was composed of two completely independent pieces of hardware dealing respectively with CPU accesses to VRAM and creating the video output from VRAM contents, and as long as the two are programmed in a compatibile manner things just work. But still it&#x27;s not how you were supposed to do 256 color graphics on the VGA.<p>This was called &quot;mode X&quot; and it gives you several benefits: VRAM to VRAM copies are cheaper, which you can use for both blitting and double buffering, and you have access to 256K of memory which enables higher resolutions (theoretically up to 360x480, in practice everybody used 320x240). This worked well for games like DOOM or Wolfenstein 3D that redrew the whole screen at once, however the wins for blitting were a lot less clear because dealing with the 4 planes meant more complicated routines and a lot of writing to the card&#x27;s registers.<p>So what Jazz does is use a middle ground mode where you have bit 0 of the address used to pick 2 planes and the other 2 are picked through the video card&#x27;s registers. Normally this is used in text mode so that even bytes describe characters and odd bytes describe colors, hence odd&#x2F;even mode. Jazz applies it to 256 color mode and then it only addresses pairs of pixels at once, so that it doesn&#x27;t have to program the video card registers as much as in 4-plane mode X. Essentially the graphics mode is a 160x200 matrix where each of the 160 horizontal cells is composed of two pixels.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42837316" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42837316" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">claxo</span><span>|</span><a href="#42838124">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42835188">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42837316">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42837316">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Currently discounted on GOG, at 0.65 usd, with all the media.

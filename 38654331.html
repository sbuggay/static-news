It was helpful to me to see that it took you some time to come to the decision to change your plan. Losing an engine mid flight is not a minor issue. Still you first continued to fly to the original destination.<p>Making the decision to change plans so that you don&#x27;t reach your desired outcome is something that we try to avoid and therefor neglect the severity of problems that are happening to us.<p>I encountered a related situation recently where snowfall in the mountain blocked our planned route. Instead of taking a detour or going back into the valley we pushed through the snow. We neglected the severe risk of an accident until the very end where we luckily decided to return as we stood in front of a very dangerous section. Even though it obviously would have been a big risk to take that route it still took us a long time to come to the decision to turn around, because we were strongly attached to our plan. Inertia is hard.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

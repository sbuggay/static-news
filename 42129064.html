I think it is worth placing writing&#x2F;coding tasks into two buckets. Are you producing? Or are you learning?<p>For example, I have zero qualms about relying on AI at work to write progress reports and code up some scripts. I know I can do it myself but why would I? I spent many years in college learning to read and write and code. AI makes me at least 2x more efficient at my job. It seems irrational not to use it. Like a farmer who tills his land by hand rather than relying on a tractor because it builds character or something. But there is something to be said about atrophy. If you don&#x27;t use it, you lose it. I wonder if my coding skill will deteriorate in the years to come...<p>On the other hand, if you are a student trying to learn something new, relying on AI requires walking a fine line. You don&#x27;t want to over-rely on AI because a certain degree of &quot;productive struggle&quot; is essential for learning something deeply. At the same time, if you under-rely on AI, you drastically decrease the rate at which you can learn new things.<p>In the old days, people were fit because of physical labor. Now people are fit because they go to the gym. I wonder if there will be an analog for intellectual work.

The use case, and user experience, and thus outcome is, is remarkably different depending on your current ability.<p>Using AI to learn things is useful, because it helps you get terminology right, and helps you Google search well. For example say you need to know a Windows API, you can describe it snd get the name. Then Google how that works.<p>As an experienced user you can get it to write code. You&#x27;re good enough to spot errors in the vote and basically just correct as you go. 90% right is good enough.<p>It&#x27;s the in-between space which is hardest. You&#x27;re an inexperienced dev looking to produce, not learn. But you lack the experience and knowledge to recognise the errors, or bad patterns, or whatever.

We see a decrease in code quality across experience levels which needs to be rectified across all experience levels but even with the time spent refactoring it’s still an increase in productivity. I think I should note that we don’t use these metrics for employee review in any way. The reason we have them is because they come with the DORA (eu regulation) compliance tool we use to monitor code-quality. They won’t be used for employee measurement while I work here. I don’t manage people, but I was brought in to help IT transition from startup to enterprise so set the direction with management confidence.<p>I’m a little worried about developers turning to LLMs instead of official documentation as the first thing they do. I still view LLMs as mostly being fancy auto-complete with some automation capabilities. I don’t think they are very good at teaching you things. Maybe they are better than Google programming, but the disadvantage LLMs have seem to be that our employees tend to trust the LLMs more than they would trust what they found on Google. I don’t see an issue with people using LLMs on fields they aren’t too experienced with yet however.

Which is what we want, again because we’re under some heavy EU regulations where even “safe” external dependencies are a bureaucratic nightmare.<p>I really do wonder what it’ll do to general education though.

I really want LLMs to help me in learning but the success rate is 0.<p>They often can not generate relatively trivial code When they do, they can not explain that code. For example, I was trying to learn socket programing in C. Claude generated the code, but when I stared asking about stuff, it regressed hard. Also, often the code is more complex than it needs to be. When learning a topic, I want that topic, not the most common relevant code with all the spagheti used on github.<p>For other subjects, like dbms, computer network, when asking about concepts, you better double check, because they still make stuff up. I asked ChatGPT to solve prev year question for dbms, and it gave a long, answer which looked good on surface. But when I actually read through because I need to understand what it is doing, there were glaring flaws. When I point them out, it makes other mistakes.<p>So, LLMs struggle to generate concise to the point code. They can not explain that code. They regularly make stuff up. This is after trying Claude, ChatGPT and Gemini with their paid versions in various capacities.<p>My bottom line is, I should NEVER use a LLM to learn. There is no fine line here. I have tried again and again because tech bros keep preaching about sparks of AGI, making startup with 0 coding skills.

That may sound obvious, but many people don&#x27;t seem to take notice that the products of student activities are worthless in themselves. We don&#x27;t have students do push-ups in gym class to help the national economy by meeting some push-up quota. The sole reason for them is to promote physical development. The same principle applies to mental tasks. When considering LLM use, we need to be looking at its effects on student development rather than on student output.<p>So, what is actually new about LLM use? There has always been a risk that students would sometimes submit homework that was actually the work of someone else, but LLMs enable willing students to do it all the time. Teachers can adapt to this by basing evaluation only on work done in class, and by designing homework to emphasize feedback on key points, so that students will get some learning benefit even though a LLM did the work.<p>Completely following this advice may seem impossible, because some important forms of work done for evaluation require too much time. Teachers use papers and projects to challenge students in a more elaborate way than is possible in class. These can still be used beneficially if a distinction is made between work done for learning and work done for evaluation. While students develop multiple skills while working on these extended tasks, those skills could be evaluated in class by more concise tasks with a narrower focus. For example, good writing requires logical coherence and rhetorical flow. If students have trouble in these areas, it will be just as evident in a brief essay as a long one.</div><br/><div id="42132902" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42132902" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Eisenstein</span><span>|</span><a href="#42132026">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42129191">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42132902">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42132902">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It is trivially easy to spot AI writing if you are familiar with it, but if it requires failing most of the class for turning in LLM generated material, I think we are going to find that abolishing graded homework is the only tenable solution.<p>The student&#x27;s job is not to do everything the teacher says, it is to get through schooling somewhat intact and ready for their future. The sad fact is that many things we were forced to do in school were not helpful at all, and only existed because the teachers thought it was, or for no real reason at all.<p>Pretending that pedagogy has established and verified methodology that will result in a completely developed student, if only the student did the work as prescribed, is quite silly.<p>Teaching evolves with technology like every other part of society and it may come out worse or it may come out better, but I don&#x27;t want to go back fountain pens and slide rules and I think in 20 years this generation won&#x27;t look back on their education thinking they got a worse one than we did because they could cheat easier.</div><br/><div id="42133655" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42133655" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">low_tech_love</span><span>|</span><a href="#42132026">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42132902">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42133174">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42133655">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42133655">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a (senior) lecturer in a university, I’m with you on most of what you wrote.

Furthermore, putting a problem into a calculator and then double checking the answer is a skill in itself that is taught.<p>I think the same sort of solution will be needed across the board now - where students learn to think for themselves without the technology but also learn to correctly use the technology to solve the right kinds of challenges and have the skills to check the answers.<p>People on HN often talk about ai detection or putting invisible text in the instructions to detect copy and pasting. I think this is a fundamentally wrong approach. We need to work with, not against the technology - the genie is out of the bottle now.<p>As an example of a non-chatgpt way to evaluate students, teachers can choose topics chatgpt fails at. I do a lot of writing on niche topics and there are plenty of topics out there where chatgpt has no clue and spits out pure fabrications.

How do you construct challenges that AI can&#x27;t solve?
2. What skills will humans need next?<p>We talked about &quot;critical thinking&quot;, &quot;creative problem solving&quot;, and &quot;comprehension of complex systems&quot; as the next step, but even when discussing this, how long will it be until more models or workflows catch up?<p>I think this should lead to a fundamental shift in how we work WITH AI in every facet of education. How can a human be a facilitator and shepherd of the workflows in such a way that can complement the model and grow the human?<p>I also think there should be more education around basic models and how they work as an introductory course to students of all ages, specifically around the trustworthiness of output from these models.<p>We&#x27;ll need to rethink education and what we really desire from humans to figure out how this makes sense in the face of traditional rituals of education.</div><br/><div id="42130568" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42130568" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rurp</span><span>|</span><a href="#42129665">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42129718">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42130568">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42130568">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; When I was young, I refused to learn geography because we had map applications.

Having a basic mental model about many aspects of the world is extremely important to thinking deeply about complex topics. Many subjects worth thinking about involve interactions between multiple domains and being able to quickly work though various ideas in your head without having to stop umpteen times can make a world of difference.<p>To stick with the maps example, if you&#x27;re reading an article about conflict in the Middle East it&#x27;s helpful to know off the top of your head whether or not Iran borders Canada.

Yes, Linkedin is hyping the latest job trend. But study after study shows that the bulk of engineers are not doing ML&#x2F;AI work, even after a year of Linkedin putting up those banners -- and if there were even 2 ML&#x2F;AI jobs at the start of such a period, then 10% week-over-week growth would imply that the entire population of the earth was in the field.<p>Clearly that is not the case.

I&#x27;ve seen the impact of students who used calculators to the point they limited their ability to do math.  When presented with math in other fields, ones where there isn&#x27;t a simple equation to plug into a calculator, they fail to process the math because they don&#x27;t have the number sense.  Things like looking over a few experiments in chemistry and looking for patterns become a struggle because noticing the implication that 2L of hydrogen and 1L of oxygen create 2L of water vapor being the same as 2 parts hydrogen plus 1 part oxygen creates 2 part water, which then means that 2 molecules of hydrogen plush 1 molecule of oxygen create 2 molecules of water, all of this implying that 1 molecule of oxygen has to be made of some even number of oxygen atoms so that it can be split in half to make up the 2 water molecules which must have the same amount of oxygen atoms in both.  (This is part of a larger series of problems relating to how chemist work out the empirical formula in the past, eventually leading to the molecular formula, and then leading to discovering molecular weight and a whole host of other properties we now know about atoms.)<p>Without these skills, they are able to build the techniques needed to solve newer harder problems, much less do independent work in the related fields after college.<p>&gt;Imagine a world where Statistics was primarily taught with Excel&#x2F;R instead of with paper. It&#x27;d be better, I promise you!<p>I had to take two very different stats classes back in college.  One was the raw math, the other was how to plug things into a tool and get an answer.  The one involving the tool was far less useful.  People learned how to use the tool for simple test cases, but there was no foundation for the larger problems or critiquing certain statistical methodologies.  Things like the underlying assumptions of the model weren&#x27;t touched, meaning students would have had a much harder time when dealing with a population who greatly differed from the assumption.<p>Rote repetition may not be the most efficient way to learn something, but that doesn&#x27;t mean avoiding learning it and letting a machine do it for you is better.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42130159" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42130159" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dr_dshiv</span><span>|</span><a href="#42129665">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42130036">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42130400">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42129844">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42130159">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42130159">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Times tables aren’t the problem.

Oh but of course they aren&#x27;t invaluable in understanding addition, they are invaluable in understanding concepts that use addition, cause ... why exactly? You saved 1 second finishing the problem that you may have understood before you completed that addition step? You didn&#x27;t have to &quot;context switch&quot; by using a calculator? Students who don&#x27;t know the sum often give unused name and go back at the end of the problem and solve it later. This behavior is of course discouraged since students can&#x27;t understand variables until much later if ever and not knowing something you were taught represents the failure of the student and thus the teacher, school, government and society.<p>Infinitely better is learning from someone who speaks the language.

I had a few friends of mine that I used to teach in our course work. For some of the fundamental classes for stem (e.g. Probability and Stats), even though I tried to show him a way to arrive at the solutions, he tried to ask directly for the solutions instead of arriving at them by himself.<p>The same thing was true for probably me when I was studying geography and history in my high school years since they were taught largely by a collection of trivia knowledge that I did not find interesting. I would have used chatgpt and be done rather  than studying them. But, when I took the courses that covered the same topics in history in my university, it was more enjoyable because the main instructor was covering the topic to tell a story in a more engaging manner (e.g. he was imitating some of the historical figures, it was very funny :))</div><br/></div></div><div id="42131079" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42131079" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ufo</span><span>|</span><a href="#42129788">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42129882">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42131756">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42129943">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42131079">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42131079">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a professor it&#x27;s frustrating.

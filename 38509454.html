Mainly for safety reasons (I do not trust much small relays) and also because I wanted to support three-phase power for an European T2 installation.<p>(2) Instead of printing my own PCB with an Arduino for the PWN, I just bought one command module from China&#x2F;UK provider. Mainly for pure lazyness reason :) The module itself is shield behind the RCD class B.<p>(3) I have added a shelly 3EM front of the system. To use it as a watt-meter with MQTT report and also as a remote control system.<p>My little advice for people interested to do their own: DIY is always an excellent way to learn and if you want to do your own, do it... <i>BUT</i> please make your installation reviewed by someone with an electrical engineering or technician background if possible. These systems can easily pump 7 to 22KW during extended period of time: Any cable which is not screwed properly or under-sized can bring you a fire.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;adevress&#x2F;open-ev-station&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;README-fr.md">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;adevress&#x2F;open-ev-station&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;READ...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="38514052" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38514052" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mrb</span><span>|</span><a href="#38514796">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38510971">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38514052">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38514052">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&quot;It costs about £900 in the UK to have an EV charger installed by an electrician&quot;</i><p>£900 is $1140.

Higher end EVSE will do things like load balancing a shared supply of power (ie chaining multiple Tesla EVSEs to the same 50A line), setting supply power limits depending on how much power is in use (ie the Porsche Connect Plus modulating lower current when a clothing dryer starts), and managing Car to Grid functionality (Hyundai).<p>EVSEs also manage DC charging in commercial settings, which bypasses part of the charging hardware in some cars.<p>My Porsche Taycan is available with multiple chargers from the factory. I have the faster AC charger unit and there is a third unit that is only sold in Europe for Type 2 chargers. The actual charger handles converting AC to DC, which is car specific and why it’s not in the EVSE.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38512144" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38512144" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">elihu</span><span>|</span><a href="#38511067">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38511090">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38511182">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38511118">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38512144">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38512144">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The terminology is kind of confusing, but usually the thing called a &quot;charger&quot; is the part that converts AC to DC at whatever voltage the pack requires.<p>For level 1 and 2 charging, the charger is in the car.

The average homeowner is in no position to judge whether the work someone they hired does exceeds the scope of their license, or whether all the details of the work that need a permit get one, or whether work any work that doesn&#x27;t get inspected is in fact done to code.

The longevity is a big question, since usually there&#x27;s no easy way to check &#x2F; test that with a singleton bespoke design&#x2F;build, and that&#x27;s sometimes what distinguishes the one-off vs mass manufactured stuff, albeit in both directions. Sometimes a bespoke design misses some subtle design choice and it breaks down sooner, but sometimes you can do a lot more careful handcrafting and &quot;simple&quot; over-engineering with a bespoke singleton to make things last even longer than mass produced stuff.

The argument went that projecting human traits, feelings, and behaviours onto animals had no scientific basis and there was no way of testing what goes on in animals’ minds.<p>What&#x27;s always been funny to me about the scientific approach to animal consciousness&#x2F;emotions&#x2F;empathy is that in a perfectly rational world the default assumption would be that animals and humans exist along a spectrum and there isn&#x27;t a sharp cliff where humans are 100% conscious and empathetic but dogs are 0%. The claim that humans are categorically different than other animals is the extraordinary one, not the claim that we are made of mostly the same stuff.<p>The only reason why animal consciousness has been controversial historically is a religious one—the Bible has typically been read as placing humanity in a category of its own. And yet we see countless secular scientists clinging to that perspective when even a cursory glance at the evidence and a basic application of Occam&#x27;s razor would suggest the opposite.</div><br/><div id="40713928" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40713928" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">maxbond</span><span>|</span><a href="#40698462">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40711069">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40713928">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40713928">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think there is also a misguided razor that people who self identify as rationalists often apply, which goes, &quot;the most cynical or disenchanted answer is likely the correct one.&quot; An overcorrection to superstition, perhaps.<p>I personally did this, and one of the symptoms was being overly skeptical of animal consciousness. People would tell me this dog was smart or that it was feeling a certain way, and I dismissed it, thinking them fanciful. One moment that showed me I was misguided was when I took a cookbook out from a low shelf, and replaced it. I didn&#x27;t put it exactly where I&#x27;d retrieved it from. Several hours later, the cat walked by the shelf, stopped, and started examining the cookbooks.<p>I was impressed because I wouldn&#x27;t have noticed those books being out of place. I realized that my cat knew things that I did not. That put a crack of doubt in my facade of cynicism. Eventually I realized that cynicism was hollow and obscured the truth, rather than revealing it.</div><br/><div id="40714485" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40714485" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">coderenegade</span><span>|</span><a href="#40698462">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40713928">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40714317">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40714485">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40714485">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s an easy trap to fall into for those who&#x27;ve never spent significant time around animals.

By this definition there are many continuous levels of consciousness and self-consciousness and these attributes are not binary all vs nothing.

Because it&#x27;s obviously not true. And you conflate two concerns, namely, &quot;having consciousness&quot; and &quot;placing humanity in a category of its own&quot;.<p>First, you don&#x27;t see denial of consciousness in other animals in the ancient or medieval world. If anything, it is much more natural to conclude other animals are conscious based on observation than it is to deny consciousness. Even today, I don&#x27;t know anyone who denies animals are conscious. Everyone treats their pets, for instance, as conscious beings, because they are. Now, people also anthropomorphize animals, sure, but there&#x27;s a difference between the two degrees of attribution. Attributing consciousness is far more conservative than attributing human qualities in an equivocal way.<p>Take Aristotle&#x27;s <i>De Anima</i>, for example, in which he analyzes the varieties of life according to the kind of &quot;soul&quot; each possesses, and such that each higher soul entails the powers of all the lower souls. The three kinds he identifies, ordered from lowest to highest, are the nutritive soul, characteristic of plants; the sensitive soul, characteristic of animals; and the rational soul, particular to human beings. Even here, we can see both a certain uniqueness to human beings alongside what you might call the consciousness of animals by virtue of the sensitive soul. What differentiates human beings from all the animals is not that they are conscious, but that they are rational.<p>Second, where the Bible is concerned, I have no idea where you get the idea that it claims other animals lack consciousness. Consider just these two passages from the Old Testament:<p>Genesis 9:2-3: &quot;The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth, and on all the birds in the sky, on every creature that moves along the ground, and on all the fish in the sea [...]&quot;<p>Do you see any mention of rocks in this verse? Do things lacking consciousness live in fear?<p>Proverbs 12:10: &quot;The righteous care for the needs of their animals, but the kindest acts of the wicked are cruel.&quot;<p>I <i>suppose</i> you <i>could</i> be kind to an unconscious living thing in the sense that can act for its objective good, but it seem a little strange to speak of animals in this way, but not plants, if animals are as unconscious as plants.<p>Now, yes, human beings are recognized as different from the other animals as early as Genesis, having been created in the image of God, which has to do with a relation of <i>analogous</i> similarity with God, where human beings are understood as personal creatures possessing rational intellect and free will (&quot;analogous&quot; cannot be stressed enough; the infinite God is very much unlike any created being, and so any similarity can only be analogical; see the <i>analogia entis</i>). However, it does not follow that the other animals lack consciousness. The ancients and medievals would find this claim ridiculous.<p>If you want to know where the denial of consciousness in other animals began, you can thank modern thinkers like Descartes, who posited that the universe is composed of two kinds of things, <i>res extensa</i> and <i>res cogitans</i>. <i>Res extensa</i> is merely extension in space, while <i>res cogitans</i> is the seat of thought, sensation and thus consciousness. According to this anthropology, of the animals, only human beings are a composite of both, and so only human beings are capable of consciousness. The angels are <i>res cogitans</i>, while the other animals are mere <i>res extensa</i>. In other words, according to Descartes&#x27;s mechanistic worldview, animals are effectively insensate machines.<p>And so this is a recently development in history, very much occurring within the ferment of modernity. Materialism also finds its roots in Descartes, not because he was a materialist himself, as he admitted the existence of <i>res cogitans</i> that is not reducible to <i>res extensa</i>, but because he framed things in those terms. Materialists, operating within those parameters, reject the existence of <i>res cogitans</i>, instead claiming that all that has been attributed to <i>res cogitans</i> is reducible to <i>res extensa</i>. Of course, it isn&#x27;t (e.g., the problem of qualia, or the problem of intentionality), which is why materialism was stillborn, but now transmuting into preposterous things like eliminativism among a stubborn remnant of believers.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40698559" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40698559" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">deanCommie</span><span>|</span><a href="#40698462">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40712758">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40698491">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40698559">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40698559">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The challenge is that part of an advanced human society is creating black-and-white lines in structures to promote peace and prosperity.<p>For example, everything we associate with the magical age of 18 years old. &quot;Adulthood&quot;, sexual consent, voting, drinking, smoking, conscription all begin on an arbitrary day and we take no consideration of the reality of the maturity of the person.<p>(Not to mention that &quot;maturity&quot; is entirely cultural and contextual. A harsher world (like one that most of humanity existed in for our entire history) causes earlier maturity. A gentler one (that we are obviously all trying to create) delays it.<p>So with animals, I see the spectrum, and I see that we are seeking to set a line...somewhere. Some set it just after humans. Humans are special, and everyone else is fair game. Vegans also have a pretty clear line.<p>Everything else, vegetarians included, are pretty &quot;fuzzy&quot;. I&#x27;m an omnivore myself, but if you asked me for a concrete logical reason why my personal ethics allow me to eat pig but not dog, I don&#x27;t think I could give you a ethically consistent one other than &quot;pigs are delicious, and dogs are my friends&quot;.<p>Personally, I do believe that the same way that our generation asked our grandparents how they could&#x27;ve been ok with the racial discrimination &amp; segregation that was ubiquitous in their youth, I think my grandchildren will ask me the same about my consumption of meat.<p>The reasons will likely be a mixture of climate impact (species of fish going extinct), and cost (because of the energy cost required to create pigs and cows). Society will form an ethical consensus about why it&#x27;s not appropriate to eat animals to help reduce WW energy costs the same way that early people in the Levant found it helpful to create rules about not consuming pigs or shellfish (for sanitary reasons).<p>And there&#x27;ll be &quot;scandals&quot; about rich people that have secret animal farms similar to what we have today about finding out about billionaires in dubai basically having secret house slaves. (AKA, outrage, but no meaningful change)<p>BTW from where I stand, it seems fairly reasonable to deduce that all mammals are in some way conscious&#x2F;sentient, and have intelligence comparable to our own. Mammals play, mourn their dead, have a common signal that generally causes us to protect the young of all mammal species and find them cute.<p>I also think that there is a strong case for a very unique type of intelligence and conscience in Cephalopods. I have personally taken a stance to not eat cephalopods. Because I think they are in greater danger of going extinct vs. mammals (since their stock counts are so invisible to humanity), and I have decided (subjectively) that consuming a distinct type of intelligence from my own constitutes a form of crime.

When people generally talk about consciousness, they&#x27;re talking about the phenomenology of awareness in the present moment. It&#x27;s not really hard to define.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to establish whether or not an animal is conscious in the way that it&#x27;s difficult to establish whether another person is conscious. The only evidence we have for consciousness is the fact that we personally experience it ourselves. And because of that, we can&#x27;t truly know if other&#x27;s are conscious from a philosophical sense (i.e.—philosophical zombies) but we can posit scientifically that they must be since they share the same brain structure that we do.<p>Now when we&#x27;re trying to establish scientifically whether or not an animal is conscious or not, it&#x27;s more difficult because we don&#x27;t have the subjective experience of being that animal, and we can&#x27;t philosophically transfer the phenomenology of the experience our brain creates onto theirs. So, while I think the question &quot;are animals conscious?&quot; is well-bounded, it&#x27;s not one that is currently answerable due to the currently private nature of consciousness.<p>&gt; Are animals aware of their surroundings?

I&#x27;m sure people without a inner monologue are still conscious.. but—it&#x27;s interesting to think about how different their experience may be like.</div><br/><div id="40715142" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40715142" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nprateem</span><span>|</span><a href="#40714449">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40715078">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40715197">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40715142">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40715142">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Do you ever watch a movie&#x2F;event or listen to music and notice you&#x27;re not internally narrating what&#x27;s happening because you&#x27;re so engrossed in the action?<p>Voila, consciousness without the inner monologue.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40715147" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40715147" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">biztos</span><span>|</span><a href="#40714449">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40714630">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40715197">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40714941">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40715147">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40715147">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I recently learned that some people do not have an inner monologue.<p>This knowledge now affects my assumptions about consciousness and whether it’s really knowable.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40714941" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40714941" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rusticpenn</span><span>|</span><a href="#40714449">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40714630">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40715147">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40714693">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40714941">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40714941">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a former owner of several cats, I can say that the cats I had definitely had consciousness.

I.e. consciousness is not a necessary part of the equation to realize the universe is currently realized. The only reason we know consciousness is part of the equation, is because we experience it ourselves.<p>So I don&#x27;t know if the fact that your cats are agents that are reacting to stimuli is proof that they&#x27;re conscious. Again, if we were an outside observer, like an alien, we would have no way to prove humans are conscious.

This journaller basically happens autonomously, without direction.

For species that have a richer communication, i still don&#x27;t think they would have this... I think the need to write down language, and make it available to others asynchronously plays a part in it.<p>Interestingly, some people report that they have no such journaller, or sometimes called inner voice that talks to them.

He mentions Descartes, and the &quot;cogito&quot;, but quotes Seth in attributing to Descartes an &quot;unholy trinity, of language, intelligence and consciousness&quot;, and then links that &quot;trinity&quot; to behaviorism.<p>This would make one think that until &quot;recently&quot;, most scientists were in the same boat as Descartes, but I think this is really misleading. Descartes believed that mental stuff and physical stuff were categorically different (&quot;cartesian dualism&quot;), whereas almost all scientists would subscribe to some form of monism &#x2F; physicalism. But the reason for the cogito, which has persisted until at least &quot;recently&quot; is that subjective phenomena are intrinsically not accessible for objective observation. At best, we can capture the &quot;correlates&quot; of consciousness, whether those be behaviors, fMRI BOLD signals, EEG readings, etc, none of which directly shows that there&#x27;s an inner subjective experience. There&#x27;s still <i>maybe</i> the possibility of a philosophical zombie, who has the right objectively available signals but doesn&#x27;t have any internal experience.<p>But scientists have all the while been working under the operational assumption that animals have something like our experiences. When we study aggression or stress or motivation or whatever else in animal models, and draw parallels between the brains of mice or monkeys and humans, we&#x27;re assuming that their emotional states feel at least somewhat like ours do. A classic protocol for rodents, relevant in testing anti-depressants (where the whole point is to change some aspect of our subjective experience) is the &quot;forced swim&quot;, where you drop a mouse in water in a vessel with smooth vertical sides, and time how long it takes for them to stop struggling. This is taken to be a measure of &quot;despair&quot;. If scientists decades ago didn&#x27;t believe animals experienced anything, they wouldn&#x27;t do this research.<p>Descartes&#x27; &quot;I think therefore I am&quot; was the minimal statement he could make with absolute certainty -- but we all operate with at least a smidge less solipsism if we assume that other humans are conscious. And it&#x27;s of course only a small extension to guess that other primates, who have rich social relations and brains similar to ours have a lot of overlapping experiences. And that other mammals, like rodents, who have a bunch of stuff in their brains like ours, have overlapping experiences. And then suddenly you&#x27;re open to this landscape of different kinds of creates with different kinds of mental experiences.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

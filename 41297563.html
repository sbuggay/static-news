In order of importance:
1) Lack of sleep (it wasn&#x27;t unusual to operate on no sleep over a 36-48 hour period)
2) Poor or insufficient training. Just because you are &quot;trained or qualified&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean you know how to operate.
3) Poor or missing procedures (let&#x27;s call it UI&#x2F;UX for today&#x27;s lingo). Many procedures were vague, and drawings were hard to understand. The Navy has a feedback system for this, but it often takes months&#x2F;years to resolve.<p>Having said all that, the issues pointed out in the comments and the article, including my comments, have existed for decades in the Navy. At some point, it comes down to the command&#x27;s leadership and superiors to ensure these issues don&#x27;t happen.

We are leading the innovation of a paperless cockpit through the design and development of an eFC mobile application that will provide responsive, reliable information for our aircrews on mobile devices at the touch of a button.<p>I thought that it was a pretty novel idea - it was certainly the most technically-progressive project I worked on when in defense contracting by a country mile. When I attended a program picnic at the Captain&#x27;s house, however, I found no shortage of people who were skeptical of what we were building.

If designed well the UI is intuitive. When designed poorly, the interface is difficult to understand and causes users to make mistakes.<p>Ugh. I don&#x27;t want to quote all 25 of the things I disagree with about this article, so here&#x27;s the first one that came up.<p>A well-designed UI is not necessarily intuitive. Think about vi, or the command line, or Blender, or Figma, or pretty much any UI designed for experts who spend every day using the system. These UIs trade intuitiveness and simplicity for power and speed. They do so knowingly.<p>It&#x27;s not actually desirable to make a UI intuitiveâwhich is to say, to make it behave the way a naive user would expect the first time they use it. Not if you can instead make it more powerful, and train the users how to use it instead.<p>An intuitive submarine control might have buttons to go up and down, left and right, and turn, and then a big red button that says &quot;launch torpedo&quot;, like in video games. But I bet that&#x27;s a bad UI for a real submarine. Instead you want it to have a lot of information on the screen, and hundreds of different functions it can perform if only you&#x27;ve gone through an intense training program to learn how to operate it, which is what the Navy does.<p>I don&#x27;t think that being difficult to understand and prone to making mistakes is the opposite of intuitive, either. I think those are orthogonal.<p>None of this is to excuse the design of that system, which I&#x27;ve never used, and can&#x27;t defend or attack. It&#x27;s just I know that this is a hard problem that you can&#x27;t get around by saying &quot;just design it better&quot;.</div><br/><div id="41306196" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41306196" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pdonis</span><span>|</span><a href="#41305320">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41305647">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41306196">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41306196">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The overall design of &quot;controls&quot; for something as complicated as a ship (or submarine) is of course going to be complex, and would not be expected to cater to the intuitions of a naive user.<p>But if you&#x27;re talking about the basic ship handling controls--rudder and throttles--which were the controls involved in this case, those <i>should</i> be as simple and intuitive as possible, and should be designed in a way that makes it obvious what the rudder and engines are doing, obvious to the point that even a naive user would have a good shot at being able to figure it out. That&#x27;s because those controls are not only the most basic ones, but the most important ones for ship safety. You don&#x27;t want them to be complicated or hard to learn.<p>This incident was a good example of what happens when this basic principle is not followed.

And I would also argue that the human factor component shouldn&#x27;t be missed here, both in terms of sleep deprivation, but also in terms of being able to easily and quickly identify error states or misconfigurations at a glance, without too much cognitive overload.<p>Cognitive overload and complex interfaces are solved with training and repetition: we do this regularly in aviation, pilotage, and all sorts of complex interfaces. But I guess it&#x27;s worth asking aloud, if you can reduce some of the cognitive overload, aren&#x27;t you effectively defending in depth?<p>Sure, every complex system could be distilled to a memorized green screen incantation, and peak performance can be reached by fusing the human brain to a well-mapped, ultra-dense information-fest. But the reality of the situation is that, when training and tiredness failed these sailors, the interface further piled on _unnecessarily_. It could have been designed to be a bit more intuitive, and that might very well have saved the lives of 10 people and $223 million dollars of taxpayer money.<p>&quot;This is a hard problem that you can&#x27;t get around by just saying &#x27;just design it better&#x27;&quot; sure downplays that amount of impact intuitive, clear design can have on, say, preventing the swiss cheese holes from aligning in this particular case.</div><br/><div id="41305912" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41305912" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">karaterobot</span><span>|</span><a href="#41305320">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41305647">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41306221">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41305912">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41305912">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; if you can reduce some of the cognitive overload, aren&#x27;t you effectively defending in depth?<p>Absolutely. But in practice, cognitive overload rears its head in many ways.<p>When most people think of an intuitive system, they think of a simple system as measured in the density of information on screen (&quot;just show me what I need to know, nothing else&quot;) and the paucity of options you have to select from (Hick&#x27;s law and so forth). But if you have to perform complex activities with such a system, the seeming simplicity results in actual complexity, since you have to do things like (for example) diving into a dozen nested layers of menus and screens to reach an option that was hidden there in order to (try to) reduce cognitive burden.<p>A different, equally valid measurement of simplicity (and cognitive burden) is how few transitions or state changes you have to suffer through to get to the state you want to be in. That is to say: how many steps you have to take to do what you want. And since there&#x27;s a chance to make an error at each step, it&#x27;s not even just a question of saving clicks, it can actually be more error prone.<p>I say these measurements are equally valid, but <i>not</i> that either of them are sufficiently robust ways of thinking about good design. I&#x27;m also not trying to downplay the impact of clear, intuitive design. The point I&#x27;m trying to make is that there is no formula for making designs clear and intuitive; it&#x27;s actually quite complicated. In fact, in most cases, you can&#x27;t even do it, you can only find a tradeoff between imperfect solutions.<p>Anecdotally, I have designed dense, complex systems for quantum computing experimentalistsâpeople much smarter than meâand had them tell me &quot;make it simpler!&quot;. I&#x27;ve also tried to make simple systems for biomedical researchers, and had them tell me, in so many words, to make the UI denser and more complex. There&#x27;s no correct level of simplicity you can arrive at <i>a priori</i>, it&#x27;s different for every case, and you have to reach the right balance through testing. If you don&#x27;t do enough testing, your users become your testers.

But you can also set up a scene on an attached computer. Click the button, or tap the touch screen, all the sliders move to the predesignated state.<p>I don&#x27;t know a damn thing about battleships, or destroyers. But a big ass console, with physical knobs and sliders that represent the current state seems like a really good idea. Sure, you can adjust whatever from whatever glass station you want. But everyone can tell at a glance, the state of the world. You can walk over and turn the knob, overriding everything else. And everybody can see you do it, and hopefully understand what that action means.<p>The closest I get to that sort of stuff is my car. The hazard lights are one big dedicated button. There may be a way to turn them on with the touchscreen, I don&#x27;t know. Volume has a physical dial on the console. There are buttons on the steering wheel, but I find myself reaching for the dial when I really need to turn the volume down.<p>Physical controls are expensive. I imagine there&#x27;s stuff that&#x27;s common and essential, that, it&#x27;s probably a good idea to spend the money and have the control. I have strong feelings about this.

More training will only help so much; I&#x27;m guessing, they probably already train on this <i>a lot</i>.<p>My armchair assessment is that these ships should be controlled 99% by computer, which decides the best combination of thrust, rudder, etc. to move the ship where the navigator directs it (whether by joystick to indicate direction, or touch-screen to indicate where on the map you want the ship to go, as well as what speed), and the individual controls (engines, rudder, etc.) should only be overridden in the most dire of circumstances.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s much more to it than that, but the general idea remains the same: this is too complicated to be left to humans, whose time is better spent thinking about other parts of the mission.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41298900" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41298900" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">titannet</span><span>|</span><a href="#41298749">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41298821">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41307718">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41298900">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41298900">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Having rudder and propeller on different stations can be useful to  organize work on the bridge, especially on a warship.

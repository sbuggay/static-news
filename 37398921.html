Try that at a mature company and you&#x27;ll get nowhere. Do it at the small companies that never blow up and you&#x27;ll get nowhere. Even if you&#x27;re in the right company at the right time, there&#x27;s a good chance someone else will be given the opportunity over you.</div><br/><div id="37399947" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37399947" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throw3823423</span><span>|</span><a href="#37399449">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37400303">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37399947">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37399947">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s a little more to it: Make sure your manager, and maybe even your manager&#x27;s manager, likes you. If your manager doesn&#x27;t like you, change teams. If your manager&#x27;s manager doesn&#x27;t like your manager, you should also change teams.<p>The unfortunate reality of those high growth orgs is precisely that the growth leads to a lot of new managers, and as we all probably know by now, a new manager is a bad manager. Since they have no idea of what they are doing, having the best relationship with them as possible is the only thing that matters.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the best ICs, and the most effective managers, end up quitting&#x2F;getting PIPed due to politics. I&#x27;ve seen low performance being rewarded by teams with good bonuses and no deliverable objectives in 2 years, and promotions before ever shipping anything. My evaluation of my performance, and resulting reviews and raises, have minimal correlation: But they absolutely correlate on how much my manager liked me. The more I&#x27;ve focused on this, the better the rewards, the product be damned.<p>This is extra-true in those rocket ship companies, precisely because things for the company are likely to go well regardless of short term performance: Only major failures, (like what Raylene describes in the article as avoiding being critical) can get you in trouble for actual company impact. In those cases your best bet is to be the firefighter who is also an arsonist, and find ways to sell your solutions to problems you yourself caused... but that involves far too much work.</div><br/><div id="37401749" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37401749" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">weeblewobble</span><span>|</span><a href="#37399449">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37399947">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37400303">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37401749">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37401749">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Very good wisdom here.

I’ve always been happiest working for managers that were politically savvy and had “juice”.<p>If your manager is on the precipice of being fired you’re in a bad spot. This is also true of PMs. At mega corps you can and should change teams but in a rocket ship company there probably are no processes for that and even bringing it up is risky.<p>I don’t really have any advice here other than to be aware of it. My last job I got hired on to work under a guy with a lot of juice but then six months later he got promoted and I ended up with a rookie manager.

But now that I am thinking in retrospect about the previous teams I worked on, it rings 100% true. Even when the manager&#x27;s manager wasn&#x27;t super into the manager, as long as the manager was savvy and had &quot;juice&quot;, it was always enjoyable work, and things (such as actual progress on deliverables, good decisions, etc.) always happened. I just could never pinpoint until now why those specific times felt the best.<p>Ironically, the only time I had an absolutely incompetent manager and a pretty savvy and great manager&#x27;s manager, it was awful. The only saving grace was that the manager&#x27;s manager eventually moved the manager into a different role in a different part of the org after an explosive argument.

Even if you do the same good job in both cases, you are almost certainly going to be rewarded and promoted faster in the second case.<p>The key is that this compounds.

Career progression is a game, each big org has their set of rules for it, the people I&#x27;ve seen progress fastest are usually the ones who figured out the game, how to tick the right boxes, how to show to the decision-makers that the boxes were ticked, not necessarily by being absolutely reliable or having a big impact.<p>Usually they jump into the projects that have more visibility or hype, focus their work on the aspects the org considers most valuable for the &quot;next step in the ladder&quot; and jump ship to a different team&#x2F;project&#x2F;department as soon as possible.<p>I&#x27;ve seen that both on engineering and product sides, most of the people I worked with that progressed quickly in their career weren&#x27;t actually reliable, at least not reliable to the people they worked closely with: they jumped ship to other teams&#x2F;parts of the org as soon as possible, leaving just a trail of half-done initiatives that were just good enough to tick the boxes needed for a promotion.<p>Doing a good job is secondary to this, sometimes doing a good job aligns with the box-ticking, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t really matter.

I’m a public sector software engineer for the US government in the DMV. I have eights years in and I’m barely making 6 six figures. I’m considering getting out but it won’t be easy. It’s a weird feeling that at 31 I feel like I already screwed up career and income wise. Is there any chance I could make 200k plus before 40 ?<p>I have a coworker that believes we are paid well considering our benefits and pto compared to the average software developer. His argument is that outside of FAANG, salaries for the average developer aren’t that much higher than ours. And if they are, the working conditions are worst. He also believes FAANG employees are working more than 80 hours work, or they are super better than “public sector employees” so that’s why they command higher pay. I don’t buy the  last one.</div><br/><div id="37401436" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37401436" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">null0pointer</span><span>|</span><a href="#37400772">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37402060">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37401436">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37401436">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I went to a FAANG at a similar point in my career to where you are now.

What are the inputs and outputs? What makes it all work? Etc. if nothing else, that might help understand why the labor market is shit, and what you personally can do about it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

The existing programmable SIMMs seem to work in the 610&#x2F;650&#x2F;800 and 700&#x2F;900&#x2F;950, but I think the onboard ROMs aren&#x27;t being properly disabled, as someone discovered when trying one in an LC 475. I&#x27;m probably going to write a blog post about the topic soon.<p>Also, some exciting news is that ROM disk hacks are definitely on the way for the Quadras. It&#x27;s possible to unlock the full 8 MB of ROM space in several of the Quadras. I&#x27;ve seen video of a Quadra booting from a 7 MB ROM disk. Too bad most of them after the 700&#x2F;900&#x2F;950 don&#x27;t have the socket populated :-( The pads are there at least, for people who dare to add it themselves...</div><br/></div></div><div id="37474070" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37474070" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jandrese</span><span>|</span><a href="#37473578">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37474227">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37474592">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37474070">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37474070">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Apple liked to artificially cripple their machines in the ROM.

The IIci had 32 bit data bus with a 25MHz 68030 and and supported a CPU cache. The LC with a 16MHz 68020 with a 16 bit bus. The Iici was conservatively twice as fast.<p>Second, the LC HW did not support nearly as much ram as the Iici. It shipped with 2MB soldered down (which logically you can think of 2 1MB SIMMs) and had 2 slots that each supported 4MB SIMMs, which were the highest density commonly available at the time. The (cheaper) memory controller used in the LC only supported 24 bits of physical addresses (and only in so many configurations), resulting in a maximum of ~16MB. Once you account for the soldered down two megabytes and how the slots had to be configured that left you with the ability to install 4MB into the each slot you get 10MB.<p>Technically speaking it was probably possible to get it to support 12MB or 16MB with a ROM patch if you desoldered the builtin memory and soldered from the address lines on the controller to some custom memory board. But as shipped with the builtin RAM and the controller chip they included 10MB was the most it could reasonably use.<p>The LCII did up the builtin memory to 4MB and had a software limit of 10MB like the LC (which meant if you installed 4MB SIMMs you would be missing 2MB), but I suspect that was more a result of how quickly it came to market (it was essentially just an LC with a 68030 and 4MB of ram, both of which greatly improved the experience of using the machine with System 7, which shipped after the original Mac LC).<p>Within a year or so after the LCII the the LCIII shipped with a completely redesigned board, and it supported 36MB of ram.<p>Source: I owned a Mac LC, paid for and installed a 2Mb memory upgrade to get it to 4MB, then eventually did a motherboard swap to upgrade it to an LCIII. I can even still tell you how much each of those upgrades cost ;-)</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37474592" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37474592" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">syx</span><span>|</span><a href="#37473578">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37477281">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37474592">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37474592">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have used the Floppy-EMU from BMOW and it was incredibly powerful I was able to emulate hardrives and floppies on both Apple II and Macintosh Plus that I own.

ROM-booting was something Apple supported in the Mac Classic and no other model. The ROM adds new functionality that wasn&#x27;t available to the SE&#x2F;30 (and others). It also adds the ability to boot of a modifiable RAM disk, which is new. Also it&#x27;s 32 bit clean, unlike Apple&#x27;s ROMs. So this fixes Apple&#x27;s bugs as well as adding new abilities to a few models of Macs that they never had. The ROM-booting is facilitated by compression, but putting together a bootable ROM for hardware that&#x27;s never done it before to ROM-boot off the compressed system image is the hard part, not the compression. Much of that is based on the hard work of Rob Braun, Doug Brown, and others who are credited.<p>He put a lot of work into this, the thing he made wasn&#x27;t an existent thing in the world until he did the labor and he documented how to do it for those who want to burn their own. He ships a ROM SIMM with the new image burned on it for $45, given that the ROM SIMM itself isn&#x27;t free, the whole deal seems fair to me.<p>The creator has also been involved in Floppy Emu. He&#x27;s done a ton to help revitalize retrocomputing. Begrudging him selling a ROM image he worked to make is an incredibly toxic take on a person doing really excellent things and sharing the technical details for anyone who want to build the stuff themselves.</div><br/><div id="37475295" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37475295" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bdowling</span><span>|</span><a href="#37473848">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37475081">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37474740">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37475295">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37475295">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;ve convinced me.

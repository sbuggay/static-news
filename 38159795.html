But in a few important ways, it is a problem. Every victory, every success is not my own. It’s a moment I share with an array of teachers who have likely forgotten I even exist. No victory motivated by spite is ever your own, you share it with those you are trying to prove wrong.<p>Other things mentioned in this blog posts are ADHD and &quot;the format of traditional schooling&quot;. None of that inherently causes the spite described. It&#x27;s more philosophical.<p>Scholasticism is found everywhere from religion to bootcamps to public schools. It lends itself well to institutions. It&#x27;s about encouraging conformity and &quot;training&quot; people to perform a certain way in a role. The assumptions causing all this pain are oversimplified ones: the teacher is always right, agreeing with the &quot;right&quot; answers means you understand, and that knowing these answers means you&#x27;re ready for &quot;the real world&quot;.<p>I never felt spite towards these institutions because I was told by my parents from a young age that they merely represent collective agreements, not necessarily the truth. There may be plenty of overlap, but the incentives are completely different, so they eventually diverge. Institutions represent society, not the individual. To be happy with this is to just take it for what is and let your faith lie in yourself and what you learn to appreciate on your own. Indeed most good teachers will also tell you to not take bad grades personally even if you still need to improve. There&#x27;s a lot to admire about institutions and the results they deliver, but it&#x27;s madness to pour your heart into them.</div><br/><div id="38160168" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38160168" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aeglaecia</span><span>|</span><a href="#38160099">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38160031">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38160168">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38160168">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I feel bad for the myriad persons &quot;diagnosed&quot; with artificial conditions that would not exist in absentia of the system ... a fake light illuminating an image to identify with and thus increase &quot;productivity&quot; in this unnatural environment ...

In freshman year of high school, a PE coach said to my face “You’re never going to amount to anything.” Because I was a scrawny kid with no interest in sport. The residual spite served me well as a motivating influence in the rest of my educational life: through university, graduate school, postdoctoral work.

Just like I was during school, those teachers too were probably doing their best, and making mistakes, as we all do. Instead, I thank them for trying, I thank them for their patience. I know I derailed nearly every class and I know that many of you at least recognised the potential, and tried to get me to see what I was capable of. But the truth is, the format of traditional schooling just didn’t work for me. And I now know why.

Let the memory (and feelings) get as strong as they need to be, without trying to suppress or judge how you feel. Then, imagine stepping into the memory and giving a younger version of yourself exactly what you needed.

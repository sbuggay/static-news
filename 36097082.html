I didn&#x27;t realize they would use it against us just blatantly in direct violation of every law put in place to prevent it, though.<p>I think the lesson I learned from the Snowden leaks is, if the government <i>can</i> do it, the government <i>will</i> do it - if not now, one day soon. That&#x27;s... kind of a value-changing, life-changing realization. That no law will stop a government from doing what it wants. We can&#x27;t stop it. But what we can do is install enough peep-holes (transparency) that when it happens, we&#x27;re more likely to find out about it, so we can do something about it.</div><br/><div id="36102040" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36102040" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">brabel</span><span>|</span><a href="#36100020">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36100394">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36102040">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36102040">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Transparency is the key. Governments love secrecy because that allows them to do whatever nasty stuff they want while pretending to be righteous at the surface.<p>Just look at past secrets that have been disclosed recently and think: should those things really be secret? I say absolutely no.<p>The mentality of keeping things secret to hide your real intentions, or to not upset people too much (or they will panic!), or to keep other governments on their toes so you&#x27;re ready to take them by surprise in the event of a conflict (how has that worked so far? The real threat actors will know anyway what naughty stuff you&#x27;re doing to make sure they&#x27;ll be the losers if the need arises - like when you just urgently need more cheap oil) is something we, all peoples of the world, need to overcome as soon as possible.<p>You may argue the situation in the world right now proves that governments need to be ready for conflict all the time, and secrecy gives them more power to take enemies by surprise... but you&#x27;re mistaken, it&#x27;s exactly the opposite! The whole China&#x2F;Russia animosities are due to the West patently doing things, like keeping military bases in every weak country[1] that will let them around China and Russia, that clearly shows they have every intention to escalate to a war with them at the earliest sign of trouble, yet we lie without hesitation about it... like we&#x27;re the peaceful people who keep trying to convince evil governments to change their belligerent ways. Perhaps if we stopped putting weapons pointing right at them, right at their neighbourhood, they would be better persuaded that war is not a possibility?<p>We do the same with climate change by the way... we want everyone else to change, or we won&#x27;t do it alone, forgetting that we&#x27;re the ones who pumped 90% of the CO2 into the atmosphere over the last 200 years of industrialization, while some countries that are now considered &quot;climate villains&quot; have been on it for only a couple of decades... hypocrisy at its worst.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rferl.org&#x2F;a&#x2F;where-are-us-and-russian-military-bases-in-the-world&#x2F;28890842.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rferl.org&#x2F;a&#x2F;where-are-us-and-russian-military-ba...</a></div><br/><div id="36102186" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36102186" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">heywhatupboys</span><span>|</span><a href="#36100020">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36102040">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36100394">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36102186">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36102186">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">See also this columnist&#x27;s take on secrets:<p>&quot;Biden’s classified leak isn’t the problem.

Every negative influence that politicians are open to, the masses are also open to (though scale may vary e.g. wrt corruption). The overwhelming evidence across the globe is that people are easily fooled, easily misled, easily manipulated, prone to illogic, prone to responding emotively, prone to selfishness, and can be corruptible, destructive and suicidal.

I thought I had seen the tip of the iceberg doing security work for over 15y prior, but I had barely seen ripples in the surface. Most of what I saw would have been in the category of &quot;BULLRUN,&quot; which I incorporate into client threat models today,  but also some of the ISP interception equipment I saw at peering points &#x2F; IX&#x27;s during the 90s that had just been called &quot;some old police telco stuff, ignore it.&quot;<p>I think an unintended consequence was that it also emboldened a lot of authoritarian personalities to just say, &quot;yeah, we do this, you are with us or against us, here&#x27;s the line, toe it.&quot; A decade later, participation in elite circles like media, academia, and politics is based on how convincingly one can be seen to parrot obvious untruths, not because anyone believes them at all, but because it signals status to be able to lie to the faces of people who know you are doing it, and still say nothing.<p>Snowden&#x27;s leaks were an unambiguous act of conscience. They made sustaining dissonance about how the sausage of empire gets made a lot harder for regular people - even if we also learned that most people really just like sausage.<p>I tolerate the spook-adjacent types in my field who parrot absurd official lines and slogans about russian interference because being seen to align with it is just how they are trying to survive, and I can&#x27;t judge what people do to keep their families fed. But the ones who know what&#x27;s true, yet take a kind of pleasure in repeating official lies because it makes them feel powerful - I think the real impact Snowden had is showing people like that for what they are, and how low the bar is for getting involved in public service and just doing better. There are amazing people in public service, and they are mostly sidelined by a minority of these eels who demoralize their agencies by normalizing small acts of deviance, corruption, and partisan favours.

It’s the space around politics and think tanks and national security. There’s an implicit expectation that you talk about certain topics in a certain way, and that way usually conforms to the narrative that’s acceptable to the apparatus of power. It’s a vague description but that’s because of the nature of this unspoken expectation.<p>More concrete examples would be how you’re expected to just completely agree that Russia and China are essentially evil and enemies. Like that’s the unspoken premise. Or in the US, playing this game of theatre around how Democrats or Republicans are bad. I’m not American but there’s a talk show host called Tucker Carlson who goes around talking about how Democrats are ridiculous and holds all these inflammatory and demagogue views on air, but is known to be completely normal and reasonable off air and in his private life. That’s the kind of skill that’s seen as necessary in these kinds of “elite” circles, where you’re just expected to be able to hold two contradicting views and milk them to your advantage. You’re expected to be able to peddle mistruths and warp facts convincingly and worse, you’re seen as higher status and more “refined” for being about to pull this off convincingly.<p>Another example I’m reminded of is an Australian one, where a think tank that is funded by arms manufacturers called ASPI, had its CEO defend itself on live television. As you’d expect, he was surprisingly able to spin a tale where they were seen as the good guys using all sorts of deception and rhetorical tricks. I don’t know how these people sleep at night but it’s the very definition of double think from 1984.

It’s a hand wavy pseudo intellectual narrative that goes, Russia commits war crimes and kills civilians, China is Nazi Germany 2.0 and is trying to exterminate Muslims like the  Nazis tried to do with the Jews and America is bad, you know with even more casualties in the Middle East but it’s not as bad as these cartoonishly evil regimes. I mean no offence to you by calling it hand wavy and pseudo intellectual but this is the exact attitude I’m talking about. It goes, “Everybody knows [something] [something]” and that’s usually a big warning sign for me; I know because I had to examine some of my own beliefs that way and it was painful to realise that most of it was talking points I had unfortunately picked up from so called thought leaders.<p>It’s a lot to unpack and I’m not going to discuss Russia because a lot of that is actually true, but why don’t you hold America to the same standards? Also regarding the concentration camps thing, this is another narrative. Can you describe to me what you think is going on in China? I’m genuinely curious. My understanding, after a lot of research and incredulity is that it’s essentially China’s version of Guantanamo Bay, because you know, they had terrorist attacks where there were hundreds killed in stabbings in Xinjiang but you probably don’t know about that right? It seems all that people know is the pictures of lots of Muslims sitting in blue overalls behind wired fences, which has been deliberately used to evoke comparisons to gas chambers and the Holocaust, by ASPI. But when I say this, people often have a knee jerk reaction which is along the lines of: “How can you support genocide or another Holocaust, you’re evil.” Which is the exact problem because the whole premise of the discussion has been completely warped by so called accepted “truths“ and people manipulating our emotions in a classic appeal to pathos. Could the world really be this cartoonishly black and white and good and evil, where my side is morally righteous and our adversaries are morally despicable? This is exactly what Orwell described in his essay, “Politics and the English Language.”<p>Regarding the concentration camps narrative, just Google ASPI and you’ll realise that about 70% of this narrative originates from them. Not only that but they’re literally funded by the military industrial complex (e.g. Northrup Grumman, Thales) and their plan worked because Australia recently bought billions of dollars worth of crappy missiles from the very companies that sponsor this so called “think tank”. It’s most definitely NOT a conspiracy theory and it’s very revealing that these think tanks can be this brazen. If you want to get to the root of this, just search for the origin of common narratives like this one and you’ll find it’s just a handful of sources all repeating the same misleading points. You’ll be shocked at how easily narratives can be seeded in the media.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.afr.com&#x2F;policy&#x2F;foreign-affairs&#x2F;the-think-tank-behind-australia-s-changing-view-of-china-20200131-p53wgp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.afr.com&#x2F;policy&#x2F;foreign-affairs&#x2F;the-think-tank-be...</a><p>And this video is kind of memey but you get the gist.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;_fHfgU8oMSo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;_fHfgU8oMSo</a></div><br/><div id="36101689" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36101689" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kortilla</span><span>|</span><a href="#36098135">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36099410">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36100139">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36101689">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36101689">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;My understanding, after a lot of research and incredulity is that it’s essentially China’s version of Guantanamo Bay<p>Guantanamo Bay isn’t for US citizens though.

Snowden gained nothing from going to Russia, except for protection from the US government. He went from living in Hawaii on a very decent salary to living in a country in which he has no family, can&#x27;t speak the language well, and can&#x27;t travel internationally. Snowden has been very clear and consistent from the beginning about why he did what he did, and his reasons are justified.<p>If you&#x27;re going to criticize Snowden for living in Russia, you&#x27;ll have to propose a better course of action. There are very few countries in which American dissidents are safe. If Snowden had gotten to Ecuador, they would have turned him over by now, just like they did with Assange. EU countries wouldn&#x27;t have protected Snowden - they wouldn&#x27;t even give him a visa to allow him to testify in person about US spying on Europe.[0] If you want to see just how subservient the EU is to the US on these issues, recall that when the Americans thought Snowden might be aboard the Bolivian President&#x27;s plane, they successfully pressured the Europeans to force the plane to land and to submit to a search.[1] They were willing to humiliate a foreign head of state just to hand Snowden over to the Americans.<p>If you go down the list of countries that are capable and willing to shield someone on the US&#x27; enemy list, you end up with a very short list. You can&#x27;t blame Snowden for saving himself after handing over the documents to journalists. He&#x27;s in one of the few countries that can actually shield him.<p>&gt; When he voluntarily became a Russian citizen, swearing an oath of allegiance to Russia during their war of aggression against Ukraine I couldn’t maintain that view.<p>Does everyone who becomes a naturalized American citizen automatically support the Iraq War, the bombing of Libya, drone strikes throughout the Middle East and the Horn of Africa, the supply of weapons for the war in Yemen, America&#x27;s support for Israeli military occupation of Palestinian territories, and everything else the US does? Snowden has been forced by circumstance to live in Russia. Becoming a citizen of the country you live in generally makes sense, as it affords you more rights and permanent status. That doesn&#x27;t make Snowden a spy.<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2014&#x2F;may&#x2F;01&#x2F;germany-edward-snowden-nsa-inquiry?CMP=twt_gu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2014&#x2F;may&#x2F;01&#x2F;germany-edward...</a><p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2013&#x2F;jul&#x2F;03&#x2F;edward-snowden-bolivia-plane-vienna" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2013&#x2F;jul&#x2F;03&#x2F;edward-snowden...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36098208" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36098208" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">36097082</span><span>|</span><a href="#36099942">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36097950">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36098208">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36098208">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">TIL that the Arab polymath al-Kindi invented frequency analysis &amp; wrote the first cryptanalysis book ‘Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages’, in the 9th century.</div><br/><div id="36098779" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36098779" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">StrangeATractor</span><span>|</span><a href="#36098208">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36097950">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36098779">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36098779">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you&#x27;re interested in this sort of thing you&#x27;d probably like David Kahn&#x27;s <i>The Codebreakers</i>.

We wouldn&#x27;t know about it unless someone leaks it, but I don&#x27;t really care if anyone leaks that info - they either already have it or will have it first so it&#x27;s fair to just assume that they do have that capability.</div><br/><div id="36099075" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36099075" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">flangola7</span><span>|</span><a href="#36098103">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36098862">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36098189">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36099075">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36099075">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I find odd enjoyment in observing how one arm of the government is pushing for quantum surveillance abilities while another is urging everyone to quickly adopt PQC.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36098189" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36098189" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MathMonkeyMan</span><span>|</span><a href="#36098103">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36098862">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36098316">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36098189">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36098189">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I want to downvote you but can&#x27;t think of a better reason than I don&#x27;t like what you say.<p>Surely we can encode better behavior into our institutions.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36098316" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36098316" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fsflover</span><span>|</span><a href="#36098103">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36098189">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36100226">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36098316">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36098316">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A case against security nihilism (cryptographyengineering.com)<p>468 points by feross on July 20, 2021 | un‑favorite | 333 comments<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27897975" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27897975</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36101283" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36101283" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rkagerer</span><span>|</span><a href="#36098103">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36098181">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36101283">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36101283">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m saddened that ordinary people still don&#x27;t care enough about their digital privacy.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36098181" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36098181" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">user6723</span><span>|</span><a href="#36101283">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36100200">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36098181">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36098181">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When I tell someone to use Signal app and they say &quot;I&#x27;m not that important&quot; all I can do is smile and nod: &quot;no.. you are not that important&quot;.</div><br/><div id="36098287" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36098287" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bee_rider</span><span>|</span><a href="#36098181">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36099944">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36098287">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36098287">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I prefer to point out: if only “interesting” people encrypt their messages, then encrypting your messages becomes a signal that you are interesting.

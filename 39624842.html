My conclusion after this nightmarish experience is that “leadership” has become a meaningless buzzword, like “freedom”: it means something at its core, and used to mean something (I guess), but its potential to be misused is so great that anyone who actually mean it should avoid using it (as for ex. I avoid using the “freedom” even if I think it’s one of the most important things in life).<p>I also concluded that doing meaningless administrative&#x2F;management work is addictive and those who engage in it will actively and constantly try not only to overemphasise their importance but also force themselves on top of those who they know are doing actual important work. This is in my opinion a form of understated and poorly understood violence, but also a natural survival instinct for those who feel themselves useless (maybe correctly) and must then fight to remain relevant at all costs.<p>Sorry for those 1% of you out there who are actually useful and efficient leaders&#x2F;managers; you know who you are and this is not for you.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39625440" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39625440" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">q7xvh97o2pDhNrh</span><span>|</span><a href="#39626648">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39626273">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39625440">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39625440">[37 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s definitely something a little weird about people who proclaim themselves a &quot;Leader&quot; on their LinkedIn title.<p>I can&#x27;t even imagine how that happens.

I am in a Japanese owned company where I must seem far more extreme to them than the OP seems to me so I&#x27;m not criticising.<p>IMO actual leaders are just people who think ahead so when other people don&#x27;t know what to do they have some sort of answer.  They may not be in positions of authority at all.<p>They have to stick their necks out a bit otherwise their forward thinking is of no use. That requires a bit of arrogance and some people have lots of arrogance of course but without it how could we deal with uncertainty?<p>In real life who really @#$# knows what will happen or what we truly need to do to succeed? Success may be more accidental than planned. If one is to get people to work together however, there has to be a degree of belief in what they&#x27;re working on and that starts with &quot;leaders&quot; - who are forced to bullshit just as politicians are and then get blamed for doing so. If they didn&#x27;t nobody would begin to listen to them. Then the group would not work together and no goal would be accomplished.<p>Authority is another matter. Who is going to take responsibility? There&#x27;s a problem - who is going to take time out of their day to solve it? Who should have made sure it didn&#x27;t happen in the first place? Authority is just the supposed answer to these questions. And at the end, who will be able to get everyone to a decision so that discussion doesn&#x27;t go on for ever.  At the end when their decision turns out to not save the day, who will accept the risk of blame for a failure?<p>You do get people who &quot;don&#x27;t believe in leadership&quot; or authority or whatever but I am a bit suspicious that they are the ones who in practice do a lot of leading and pushing people around and are successful at doing so whilst avoiding responsibility.  So they want more of that obviously. To be fair I probably do a bit of it.

This combination is extremely rare, and I think survivorship bias that you mention mostly exists due to original business goals not being defined formally enough - i.e. people commonly valuing &quot;execution as an activity&quot; instead of &quot;execution is getting from A to B&quot;. You <i>can</i> execute while failing many times over because you lack knowledge or understanding. You <i>can</i> get recognised and praised for execution because nobody bothered to validate that you actually got the result.<p>This might sound insane for the IT world, but this is how business often operates on a day to day basis - vague objectives with recognition for effort and process, instead of the actual result.<p>Which makes &quot;knowing stuff well&quot; an extreme modern leadership blindspot, in my opinion.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39626560" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39626560" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">doodaddy</span><span>|</span><a href="#39625973">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39625268">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39626560">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39626560">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The title was intriguing.

There is no way the company could run with that much turnover and brain drain on a regular basis. People need to learn how to work with all kids of people and personalities… especially if they are working in a leadership role. If a leader feels the need to fire everyone they don’t get along with, they have no business being in that role.<p>A good leader will figure out how to get the most out of each person on the team, not demand they all fit in a certain mold or get out. The boss I had who got the most out of me figured out that if I was interested in a project I would work 12 hour days on it and really go the extra mile, while if I wasn’t interested, I’d drag my feet and procrastinate. If he saw me pushing something off, or with more experience, if I didn’t immediately jump in with both feet, he’d give the project to someone else who would slog through the projects I hated, but flounder on the ones I excelled at. It’s all about resource management, and to do that, there needs to be some variety in the resources.

Even so, most companies the scale&#x2F;size of Google, Apple, Facebook, etc have, at this point, interviewed 95+% of the bay area SWE population, and most (Apple is the exception here) had done so by the time they were ~10-12 years in existence.

I&#x27;ve been in touch with the CEOs and directors at high-functioning organizations, and I&#x27;d rather work with them anyway. They wouldn&#x27;t find work for me instantly, but they might eventually.<p>The only reason I remain employed at this place is that they agreed to give me a three day a week permanent contract (because they pissed the engineers off so much that four of them left in one week). It&#x27;s a <i>convenient</i> deal, and it gives me time to focus on my own business, but I&#x27;d survive without them. I&#x27;m already looking elsewhere but don&#x27;t want to land in a similarly toxic environment.<p>But I think, most importantly, I used to be very inauthentic at work (which is almost half my time and most of my daylight hours!), and it made me miserable. I&#x27;d rather be who I am and get forced to work at McDonald&#x27;s for a bit. So I&#x27;m a little bit afraid, but I&#x27;m more afraid of what happens when I <i>don&#x27;t</i> say what I think.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39625626" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39625626" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eeasss</span><span>|</span><a href="#39625052">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39626370">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39625626">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39625626">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Based on what you said I think that you should change jobs.

If the alarm is broken, that&#x27;s a different story, but it would  suggest not &quot;agree[ing] with the author.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re at all alone in the preference, it just kinda reflects our relationship to work in that people opt for the fire.</div><br/><div id="39626139" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39626139" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hackerlight</span><span>|</span><a href="#39625400">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39625738">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39625417">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39626139">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39626139">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A fire alarm is useless if it&#x27;s always going off.

We think of great generals from David and Alexander on down, sharing their beans or maza with their men, calling them by their first names, marching along with them in the heat, sleeping on the ground, and first over the wall. A famous ode by a long-suffering Greek soldier, Archilochus, reminds us that the men in the ranks are not fooled for an instant by the executive type who thinks he is a leader.</i><p><i>For the manager, on the other hand, the idea of equality is repugnant and indeed counterproductive. Where promotion, perks, privilege, and power are the name of the game, awe and reverence for rank is everything, the inspiration and motivation of all good men.

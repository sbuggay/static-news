The one thing that they lamented often was a lack of maintenance, from historic buildings to lightbulbs in elevators. They tried to posit it as something more cultural, and I dont know if that is true or not for china.<p>I do feel like the culture of tech has become one of maintenance not being part of what we do. When was the last time you saw someone get promoted for &quot;cutting costs&quot; or &quot;making the code less complicated&quot;. When was the last time you sat down and read someone else&#x27;s code and were impressed at how CLEAR and SIMPLE it was?<p>20 years ago we were all running on bare hardware. Now it&#x27;s a hypervisor, with a VM, that has a docker container, that imports everything and a cat. We get tools like artifactory to make up for the fact that all of that might disappear. Top it of with zero ownership (infrastructure as a cost center and not a depreciable asset).<p>It feels like a fuck shit stack of wet turds and were trying to play jenga with them, shuffling them back to the top and trying to get our next gig before the whole thing falls over and hopefully lands in someone else&#x27;s lap.<p>To make a point: do we need docker? No, but writing installable software is hard (depending on language and what you&#x27;re doing). Docker doesn&#x27;t fix the problem it just adds another layer in.<p>The original service is the database. Yet we dont normally expose it because its security model remains rooted in the 19xx&#x27;s. So we have layers of shims over it, ORM, JSON... pick your stack and &quot;scalable&quot; abstraction.<p>The author mentions LLM&#x27;s. The more I play with them the more I feel like this is going to be cool after engineers beat it into submission over the course of the next few years. So much opaque, and so little clarity on what is going on under the hood. It&#x27;s no wonder people are having trouble coming to grips, it&#x27;s a mess! If it were a battery break through it would take 10 years to turn it into a mass producible product, but because its software we throw money at it and let it dangle out on the web!!! (and I dont fear AGI)<p>FTA:
&gt;&gt; I don’t have a prescriptive solution for this. I wrote this text to start a discussion around a feeling I previously struggled with but didn’t know how to label.<p>I do. We need to do better. We need to stop piling on more and strip back to clear and well understood. We need to value readable code over DRY, or Design patterns or what ever the next FOTM is. We need to laud people who make systems simpler, who reduces costs, who reshape and extend existing things rather than build new ones and pile more on top because it&#x27;s &quot;easy&quot; or looks good on the resume.<p>I am part of the problem too, and I need to stop. I need to stop reaching for that next shiny bit of tech, next framework, next library. Because acting like a schizophrenic ADHD child finding candy hasn&#x27;t really served anyone.</div><br/><div id="38590203" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38590203" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ysofunny</span><span>|</span><a href="#38590139">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38590056">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38590203">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38590203">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">why fix anything if it&#x27;s easier to add some other layer and kick the problems down the line?<p>it&#x27;s the economically rational thing to do... you woudln&#x27;t want your kids to have a boring future<p>gota leave some problems to them, heck cause some because we didn&#x27;t know any better anyways</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38590056" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38590056" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">madaxe_again</span><span>|</span><a href="#38590139">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38590106">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38590056">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38590056">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think this is two phenomena being observed as one.<p>While there’s certainly currently an accelerando going on in terms of knowledge growth and change in many fields, there is also bias built into us and our perception of the world - every human has a tendency to be surprised by the degree of change that occurs in their lifetime - we are raised with the world presented as-is, with a static set of truths, yet the only constant thing about the human world is change.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38590106" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38590106" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vaidhy</span><span>|</span><a href="#38590056">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38589979">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38590106">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38590106">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">IMHO, bullshit article.

I&#x27;ve used SuperMemo for a few years now, and have found it invaluable for retaining and revisiting old concepts, especially when switching between different tech stacks.  The priority queue system of supermemo fixes the issues Anki and others have when collections grow to larger than 10K+ cards, where the daily load can often become unmanageable.<p>I find 30 minutes a day of supermemo, supplemented by an hour of purposefully randomized review on weekends keeps even very old topics near the forefront of my mind.  It&#x27;s like having a well-maintained toolbox I can throw at different problems at any time.  The slight daily effort is more than compensated by the retention gains I&#x27;ve noticed over time.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

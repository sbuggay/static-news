They can and <i>should</i> make light of it.<p>Expecting everyone to be deeply affected by all traumatic experiences throughout history is unrealistic. We have defence mechanisms to cope with the overwhelming weight of global suffering, and breaking them down is a bad idea. So shaming those who managed to distance themselves from such events (by saying their dark comedy is in bad taste) is condescending. I say it&#x27;s good to have healthy coping strategies and not be overly affected by awful events we were not exposed to directly – that is called <i>healthy</i> mental resilience. Not everyone should suffer because anyone else has.<p>People should and will still joke, even when awful things have happened to billions in every conceivable niche of life. Really, I would even argue one should not absorb more suffering and terror than they would have been exposed to in one life-time, even if the internet and news media makes it easy.

They arrived on the fourth day after the incident, and by the fifth day his condition started to deteriorate rapidly.
  
  Over the next four days, Slotin suffered an &quot;agonizing sequence of radiation-induced traumas&quot;, including severe diarrhea, reduced urine output, swollen hands, erythema, &quot;massive blisters on his hands and forearms&quot;, intestinal paralysis and gangrene. He had internal radiation burns throughout his body, which one medical expert described as a &quot;three-dimensional sunburn.&quot; By the seventh day, he was experiencing periods of &quot;mental confusion.&quot; His lips turned blue and he was put in an oxygen tent. He ultimately experienced &quot;a total disintegration of bodily functions&quot; and slipped into a coma. Slotin died at 11 a.m. on 30 May, in the presence of his parents.

Totally accidental data collection from work at the bleeding edge, which was work that has transformed society as we know it. Another point is that in order for things like the lab equipment to be sleek and well built, we need to understand needs. This means that any research that meets your criteria is quite likely not at the cutting edge of anything. Most cutting edge labs I know look more like someone raided the hardware&#x2F;electronics store to build some abomination than the Hollywood sleek and shiny labs you might be picturing.

Or they might ask how is it powered, or how does it store all those videos in that little slab. And if we tell them it is connected to other machines with radiowaves, they might ask many questions about that. They might notice that even though the music they hear “came over the radio” it is exceptionally crisp and without any distortion, so they would ask about that, which could lead us chatting about digital error correction codes or compression algorithms. Or maybe they would be fascinated by the camera and take pictures of themselves, or ask about other features the phone has.<p>It is one thing to understand that a transistor is just an electronic switch, and if you connect many of them you can have complex electronic circuits. It is an entirely different thing to experience that you can touch one of the tiny images on the slab and then it shows a colourful birds eye view picture of the buildings around us, and with two fingers you can move around to seemingly anywhere else on Earth and see what is there.<p>We know that the second is just a bunch of transistors appropriately organised but there is a few “wait what? How is that possible?” along the path from understanding transistors to experiencing google earth.<p>And then of course the biggest magic of it all: this device they are seeing is not some rare wonder which only governments or militaries can afford in few numbers.

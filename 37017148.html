And you must read a lot of rubbish before you die, as well, because an exclusive diet of masterpieces will give you spiritual dyspepsia.  How can you know that a mountain peak is glorious if you have never scrambled through a dirty valley?  How do you know that your gourmet meal is perfect of its kind if you have never eaten a roadside hot dog?  If you want to know what a masterpiece <i>The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress</i> is, read <i>Bonfire of the Vanities</i>, and if you have any taste -- which of course may not be the case -- you will quickly find out.  So I advise you, as well as reading great books that I have been talking about, read some current books and periodicals.  They will help you to take the measure of the age in which you live.<p>(I encourage reading the whole lecture [1]!  It&#x27;s a fun read and there are a lot of great bits in there that I could have quoted here.  But I contented myself with just the one excerpt.)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Robertson_Davies" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Robertson_Davies</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tannerlectures.utah.edu&#x2F;_resources&#x2F;documents&#x2F;a-to-z&#x2F;d&#x2F;davies92.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tannerlectures.utah.edu&#x2F;_resources&#x2F;documents&#x2F;a-to-z&#x2F;...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37018888" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37018888" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MikeBVaughn</span><span>|</span><a href="#37019572">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37019301">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37018888">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37018888">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This conception of &#x27;Great Books&#x27; is grim.

His method is laborious. This &quot;chain of summaries&quot; seems to be hardly effective. I think the fractal method is close to be atomic - so a good one IMO.<p>I would suggest to read the book multiple times. The books mentioned here are not literature masterpieces, they are philosophical or they are essays. So the point is to extract information. So it&#x27;s ok to read the book multiple times. If you understand 60% on the first read, then 80% on the second and 95% on the third, it&#x27;s alright (Figures are illustrative). By the way, at 95% of understanding of a book, you are already a &quot;specialist&quot; of the book.<p>Next, take notes when you feel it&#x27;s important about some concepts. Taking notes is an experience things. The best way to boost this learning would be to learn the semantic of the book before reading, actually it&#x27;s the role of the first reading. I would not advise to take notes on the whole book structure before the second reading.<p>Finally, use Zettelkasten-like method to link your notes together. It will reduce redundancy, labour and keep all relevant information.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37019358" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37019358" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">programmarchy</span><span>|</span><a href="#37019931">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37019358">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37019358">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Wow, sounds incredibly arduous. I agree synthesis is a good approach for understanding concepts, but this tends to happen automatically as I read a book because I’m synthesizing it with my worldview or with other concepts I’ve been ruminating on. Breaking down a book and re-synthesizing it doesn’t seem very valuable to me personally, but maybe it’s a good method if you need to teach it to others.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

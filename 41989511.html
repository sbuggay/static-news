Thats with unlimited traffic, but no ddos protection or similar, so I don&#x27;t know how essential that was at DO. Also you&#x27;re on physical hw which is always more annoying if you have to call in because of a failing disk, but from my years of experience this is as smooth as it gets; shut down the server, open a ticket requesting replacement ASAP and give the drive&#x27;s SN, and the server will be up again within 20 minutes. Absolutely acceptable for a side-project that doesn&#x27;t offer anything mission critical. But I&#x27;d really be curious what the bill currently is at DO, and maybe you have some monster HW there that can&#x27;t be matched here.

Every client could serve as a relay that stored its own threads and a constellation of associated mipmaps, and, if some were missing messages, it would be obvious which other clients needed to be checked for the missing portions the next time they logged on.

(I&#x27;ve been meaning to read the paper on Merkle Search Trees so I can figure out what exactly is going on with PDSes.)<p>On the other hand, in practice it seems like the AT proto infrastructure is still very centralized for now. DIDs are excellent in theory, but everyone is using PLC DIDs, which depends on the centralized plc.directory. You can run your own PDSes, but there&#x27;s only one relay for now (that I am aware of.) I also don&#x27;t think there is more than one instance of the Bluesky AppView, and the official instance is locked into the Bluesky Moderation Service, which seems to limit the usefulness of some of the censorship resistance of the protocol.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how much of that is social problems rather than technical, but I worry that since Bluesky and AT proto are gaining massive popularity with this status quo (millions of users!) it&#x27;ll have a problem akin to Matrix.org, where in practice almost everyone is using the same infrastructure anyways.<p>It&#x27;s still relatively early days, but millions of people is definitely enough to where you start to hit problems with having everyone under one roof.

I think the real problem is that we haven&#x27;t decentralized <i>ownership and decisionmaking,</i> instead we shattered big dictatorships into little fiefdoms, often run by local gangs (as one would expect.) Arguing that federation should automatically solve our problems with social media is like the US argument for &quot;state&#x27;s rights.&quot; You had one problem, now you have 50.<p>This is also exacerbated by the fact that people can&#x27;t migrate. That would seem like it should be a developer priority to enable competition between instances, but instead people get irritated when asked about it at all. Every post locks you in farther to a particular instance. If people can leave on a whim, bad instances would starve. Instead of people being able to vote with their feet, the politics of mastodon all revolve around punishing other instances for various examples wrongthink by defederating. So now it&#x27;s little fiefdoms at war with each other, you have to be in the in-crowd of your likely randomly chosen instance to have a say about it, and if you leave you lose everything.</div><br/><div id="41992390" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41992390" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jeroenhd</span><span>|</span><a href="#41990250">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41990778">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41990940">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41992390">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41992390">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My experience is that tons of people heard about Mastodon when the first wave of Musk bullshit hit Twitter and they immediately had an allergic reaction to having to pick a server.

Frankly, we’ve tried the kind of system ActivityPub offers before: a decentralized server network ultimately forming one big system, and the same problems have inevitably popped up every time.<p>XMPP tried to do it for chat. All the big players adopted it and then either realized that the protocol wasn’t complex enough for the features they wanted to offer or that it was much better financially to invest in a closed system. Sometimes both. The big providers split off into their own systems (remember, Google Talk&#x2F;Hangouts&#x2F;Chat and Apple iChat&#x2F;FaceTime both started out as XMPP front-ends) and the dream of interconnected IMing mostly died.<p>RSS tried to do it for blogs. Everyone adopted it at first, but eventually content creators came to the realization that you can’t really monetize sending out full-text posts directly in any useful way without a click back to the originating site (mostly defeating the purpose), content aggregators realized that offering people the option to use any front-end they wanted meant that they couldn’t force profitable algorithmic sorts and platform lock-in, and users overwhelmingly wanted social features integrated into their link aggregators (which Google Reader was famously on the cusp of implementing before corporate opted to kill it in favor of pushing people to Google+; that could have potentially led to a very different Internet today if it had been allowed to release). The only big non-enthusiast use of RSS that survives is podcasts, and even those are slowly moving toward proprietary front-ends like Spotify.<p>Even all the way back to pre-Web protocols: IRC was originally a big network of networks where every server could talk to every other server. As the system grew, spam and other problems began to proliferate, and eventually almost all the big servers made the decision to close off into their own internal networks. Now the multi-server architecture of IRC is pretty much only used for load balancing.<p>But there’s two decentralized systems that have survived unscathed: the World Wide Web over HTTP and email over SMTP. Why those two? I believe that it’s because those systems are based on federated <i>identities</i> rather than federated <i>networks</i>.<p>If you have a domain name, you can move the website attached to it to any publicly routable server and it still works. Nobody visiting the website even sees a difference, and nobody linking to your website has to update anything to stay “connected” to your new server. The DNS and URL systems just <i>work</i> and everyone just locates you automatically. The same thing with email: if you switch providers on a domain you control, all the mail still keeps being routed to you. You don’t have to notify anyone that anything has changed on your end, and you still have the same well-known name after the transition.<p>Bluesky’s killer feature is the idea of portable identities for social media. The whole thing just ties back to a domain name: either one that you own or a subdomain you get assigned from a provider. That means that picking a server isn’t something the average person needs to worry about, you can just use the default and easily change later if you want to and your entire identity just moves with you.<p>If the server you’re on evaporates, the worst thing that you lose is your activity, and that’s only if you don’t maintain any backups somewhere else. For most people, you can just point your identity at a different server, upload a backup of your old data, and your followers don’t even know anything has changed. A sufficiently advanced client could probably even automate all of the above steps and move your whole identity elsewhere in one click.<p>Since the base-level object is now a user identity rather than a server, almost all of the problems with ActivityPub’s federation model go away. You don’t deal with blocking bad servers, you just block bad people (optionally using the same sorts of “giant list” mechanisms already available for places like Twitter). You don’t have to deal with your server operator getting themself blacklisted from the rest of the network. You don’t have to deal with your server operator declaring war on some other server operator and suddenly cutting you off from a third of your followers.<p>People just publish their posts to a server of their choice, others can fetch those posts from their server, the server in question can be moved wherever without affecting anything for those other users, and all of the front-end elements like feed algorithms, post display, following lists and block lists, and user interface options could either be handled on the client-side or by your choice of (transferable) server operator. Storage and bandwidth costs for text and (reasonable) images are mostly negligible at scale, and advertising in clients, subscription fees, and&#x2F;or offering ancillary services like domain registration could easily pay for everything.<p>ActivityPub sounds great to nerds who understand all of this stuff. But it’s too complicated for the average social media user to use, and too volatile for large-scale adoption to take off.<p>AT protocol is just as straightforward to understand as email (“link a website domain if you already have one or just register for a free one on the homepage, and you can easily change in the future”), doesn’t require any special knowledge to utilize, and actually separates someone’s identity and content from the person running the server. Mastodon is 100 tiny Twitters that are somewhat connected together, AT actually lets everyone have their own personal Twitter and connect them all together in a way that most people won’t even notice.</div><br/><div id="41992099" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41992099" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ChrisArchitect</span><span>|</span><a href="#41990250">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41990739">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41991082">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41992099">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41992099">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Good post of historical reminders and I appreciate the framing of bluesky&#x27;s identity approach. Never was sold on Fediverse&#x2F;ActivityPub as being <i>it</i> and not a fan yet of Bluesky&#x27;s slow-building-in-public approach but am intrigued by this key facet of the main role the personal domain takes. How can one easily change&#x2F;migrate their AT identity if they change domains? How is their whole social history transferrable? Like that was one of the problems&#x2F;unclear things to most about Mastodon - that it actually wasn&#x27;t that easy to move instances because sure your identity could move but your posts would be on the old instance, so it wasn&#x27;t really that portable. I&#x27;m all about the permanence and data preservation, so I don&#x27;t want to commit to a platform now without assured control over my data and ability to maintain history&#x2F;identity in a move.

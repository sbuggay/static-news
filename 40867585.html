The meaning of evolution is that the replication process is imperfect, so the replicas are not completely identical to their parent system, i.e. they evolve. It is meaningless to talk about evolution unless you talk about a self-replicating system.<p>The existence of information-storing molecules, like RNA, is not necessary for a self-replicating chemical system. In fact it is pretty much certain that information-storing molecules did not exist in the first living entities.<p>In a self-replicating chemical system without nucleic acids there must exist a closed cycle of chemical reactions, each producing reactants needed by reactions  located later in the cycle and where the net result is the conversion of the simple molecules from the environment, like carbon dioxide, dihydrogen, ammonia and sulfide or sulfite into complex organic substances, including peptides and organic acids, which are either catalysts or reactants or products for various reactions along the closed cycle. Such a closed cycle of reactions is likely to have appeared in pores of suitable minerals, like metallic sulfides, in hydrothermal vents or volcanic vents that supplied the input gases.<p>The difference between the first self-replicating chemical systems and the living beings with nucleic acids is the same as between hardwired control automata and microprogrammed control automata (where the control information is stored in a microprogram memory). The use of a memory (i.e. nucleic acids) has greatly accelerated the evolution of living beings, because previously any changes in the components of a self-replicating chemical system would have been very likely to result in a system that could no longer replicate, so it would die without descendants.<p>There is no doubt that DNA is a later invention and that initially there was only RNA. RNA has 2 main functions, it can be copied into another RNA molecule or it serves as a template for the synthesis of a protein molecule.<p>There is no doubt that the protein synthesis function has appeared later than the self-replication function. The reason is that if there would have ever existed an RNA molecule without self-replication that could be used for protein synthesis, it would have immediately disappeared without any descendants.<p>So the first nucleic acids were RNA molecules able to be replicated, but without any useful function. In other words, they were RNA viruses that were parasites of some self-replicating chemical systems which had metabolism, but which did not use nucleic acids.<p>The host systems must have been using ATP for a long time before the apparition of replicable RNA, and RNA must have appeared due to side reactions that caused losses of ATP by polymerization (ATP and related nucleotides are just monomers of RNA, i.e. its constituent blocks). ATP must have been used as a dehydrating agent to create peptide bonds long before the use of nucleic acids as templates for protein synthesis.<p>Even in the living beings of today there are many peptides that are created without being synthesized in ribosomes with RNA templates, but the mechanism of their synthesis is much less known and understood than the synthesis of proteins with RNA templates. Before nucleic acids, the catalysts of the biological reactions must have been such peptides, which used a much smaller set of amino acids than the proteins of today, perhaps only about 6, but certainly no more than 10.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40898912" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40898912" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Bluestein</span><span>|</span><a href="#40898135">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40898737">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40899076">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40899113">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40898912">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40898912">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The tricky thing about abiogenesis, though, is that it only has to happen once, which makes it difficult to study&#x2F;model scientifically.<p>Excuse my ignorance ...<p>... difficult because - I assume - it only having to happen once leaves you with little examples of it happening to study?</div><br/><div id="40899445" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40899445" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">munchler</span><span>|</span><a href="#40898135">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40898912">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40899113">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40899445">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40899445">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, it didn&#x27;t leave any evidence behind, other than life itself, and it could have been essentially a fluke event.</div><br/><div id="40899477" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40899477" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Bluestein</span><span>|</span><a href="#40898135">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40899445">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40899113">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40899477">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40899477">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for taking the time.-</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40899113" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40899113" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bryan0</span><span>|</span><a href="#40898135">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40898737">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40897360">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40899113">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40899113">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You might be interested in this paper which was talked about on HN last week:<p>“Computational Life: How Well-formed, Self-replicating Programs Emerge from Simple Interaction”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40820022">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40820022</a></div><br/><div id="40900975" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40900975" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smusamashah</span><span>|</span><a href="#40898135">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40899113">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40897360">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40900975">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40900975">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks.

IOW you can get from life to computers, but entropy prevents getting from computers to life.<p>In life, is there any clear distinction between machine and code? Genomics suggests there might be, but so far fiddling with genomes is well known only for edits of taxonomically superficial traits. Has anyone shown edits that give rise to a new subspecies-- much less a new genus? Idk... but it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me to find the answer is be no, and that epigenetic factors might inhibit any approach to editing new lifeforms into existence.<p>Is life is fundamentally emergent, without possibility of construction? I see a definitional hazard; that we may lack the language or cognitive capacity to deal with life&#x27;s dynamics. These may be off limits. Or maybe not?</div><br/><div id="40900584" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40900584" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Bluestein</span><span>|</span><a href="#40897360">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40900068">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40903178">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40900584">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40900584">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; there may be an entropic blockade to stimulating life:<p>Interesting.-<p>PS.

For about 5 years, I spent much of my hobby time writing a-life sims and messing with them. I wanted an &quot;aquarium&quot; that looked interesting that I could have running 24&#x2F;7, constantly evolving. I guess I wrote maybe 10 sims from scratch in Unity, Java, Processing, and p5.js.<p>I have had (limited) success in getting emergent control and coordination behaviours. A couple examples:<p>I played with a &quot;battleground&quot; simulation, inspired by the &quot;Gladiabots&quot; game, where the entities were NN-based fighting robots organised in teams (4v4, 20v20 etc). Random sensor systems, random fire control systems, signal emitters, etc, hooked up to random neural nets where winning teams procreate and evolve&#x2F;mutate. Over a LOT of generations (maybe like 20,000+), I&#x27;d see teams evolve what looked like coherent tactics, including teamwork, role specialisation, and time-based tactics&#x2F;formations.<p>I had a &quot;jellyfish&quot; simulation, similar premise, with small aquatic animals of various &quot;species&quot; who could speciate, etc. The aquarium had qualities like light levels, food production, temperature zones, etc. You always have to be careful to not anthropomorphize too much, but I would clearly see battlegrounds develop and evolve, and successful species rise and fall with behaviours that (again over many thousands of generations) initially look like drunken sailors but evolve into what looks like basic behvaiours, at least at the level you may see in small multicellular organisms.<p>In my experience, getting emergent behaviours needs a difficult-to-optimize balance between system complexity and system stability. Every neuron, sensor, output, or attribute you add to the sim can cause a super-exponential growth in the &quot;problem space&quot; of your denizens. Behaviours that require any form of coordination take so much longer to evolve than uncoordinated behaviours because you tend to need to &quot;get lucky&quot; where both a signal and response evolve&#x2F;mutate at the same time.<p>Another issue is that feed-forward networks are not great at temporal processing. Many basic behaviours require more temporal processing than I expected when I started building these things. I got these to evolve by having features like memory nodes, timer nodes, and recurrent nodes, but if I were to build another one, I&#x27;d experiment more with LSTM-like neurons and other recurrent&#x2F;memory-based architectures.<p>In my experience (and with my horrendously under-optimised codebases), the amount of evolution you need to simulate is super-exponential as you grow the complexity of the sensors, outputs, and neural nets. In my playing around, doubling any single dimension almost always led to more than a 4x increase in the time you need to see new emergence. In my most complex sim, it got to the point where even tweaking a basic variable like temperature or day&#x2F;night cycle would need me to run the sim for at least a day to properly observe the impact, and sometimes more like a week or two. I never really knew when the &quot;evolution ceiling&quot; was hit, which was part of the fun for me -- I love seeing a new behavior suddenly appear.<p>This ALIEN project is really interesting and it has a lot of cool ideas. I haven&#x27;t played with it yet but I think it&#x27;s going to be fun! The project I have been keeping an eye on is Neuraquarium, which has similar design goals to what I have built in the past.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40899319" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40899319" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Bluestein</span><span>|</span><a href="#40897360">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40899273">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40903178">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40897783">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40899319">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40899319">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Is there a level of complexity in the environment that is a base requirement?<p>I think you are unto something here.

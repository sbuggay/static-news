I&#x27;m having a conversation with a hw engineer: (all imaginary below, but the main situation does happen every once in a while)<p><pre><code>  &gt; Me: This USB hub you designed seems to work on my Dell Desktop, but not on my HP laptop. Can you take a look at it?
  &gt; HW Eng: Sure. But could it be a problem with the laptop? Maybe it&#x27;s not my design&#x27;s fault.
  &gt; Me: Come on, it&#x27;s an off the shelf laptop. We can&#x27;t write in the user manual that users shouldn&#x27;t use HP laptops, haha.
  &gt; Hw Eng: Haha, okay, let me check it.
  &gt; Random guy: Haha, I just sent my Asus tablet for warranty repair, you shouldn&#x27;t buy Asus.
</code></pre>
I mean, what should one say to this, if anything? I don&#x27;t know if this is your case also. It&#x27;s just one situation when this can happen.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

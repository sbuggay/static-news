Before the industrial revolution England was already mining around five times more coal than the rest of the world <i>combined</i> just to survive winters. Once they exhausted the easy surface deposits they had to go deeper and deeper which required mechanized power to work against the water seeping in. The first engines were invented not when labor became too expensive but when it was impossible to do with human labor at all.<p>After reading <i>Coal - A Human History</i> I’m of the opinion that the industrial revolution was a complete accident of circumstance on a tiny island that didn’t have enough trees to support its population’s energy needs and a surface supply of coal just big enough to get the industry started but not enough to supply the growing population without digging deeper.</div><br/><div id="40564371" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40564371" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">highfrequency</span><span>|</span><a href="#40563760">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40567663">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40564371">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40564371">[24 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s more complicated than that. Mechanization of the textile industry (initially with hand power, then water power) was underway well before the steam engine&#x27;s widespread adoption.<p>Given the massive importance of textiles to Britain&#x27;s economy and the substantial efficiency gains before the steam engine was used in textile factories, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say that the industrial revolution was entirely a coal&#x2F;heating driven coincidence.<p>These three non-coal factors were also at play in stimulating the automation of spinning and weaving:<p>1. High wages relative to capital costs (compare with India, the previous textile leader, where it was uneconomical to invest in machines to reduce human labor)<p>2. Relatively elastic input supply of cotton from American colonies, and relatively elastic output demand for textiles throughout Europe, India, Africa, Asia and America.<p>3. A parliamentary system that significantly prioritized commercial interests relative to monarchies like Spain, France, China. This was relatively unique in the world (exceptions include the Dutch Republic and Italian city-states like Venice), and certainly unique among states of Britain&#x27;s size and defensibility. It&#x27;s important to remember that kings don&#x27;t really care whether GDP per capita goes up 1% per year or 0% per year; they care about glory from empire expansion and regime defense (and the latter is often manifestly <i>counter</i> to commercialization and automation, which simultaneously empowers a threatening merchant class and also leads to revolts and instability among the lower class.)<p>Note that the first two largely stemmed from Britain&#x27;s increasing domination of world trade, itself founded on a combination of naval hegemony, efficient capital markets, and shipping expertise (many of these inherited from the Dutch legacy following the Glorious Revolution).<p>Outsized results are almost always caused by a confluence of many interacting factors rather than a single explanation like coal deposits.</div><br/><div id="40565292" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40565292" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tuatoru</span><span>|</span><a href="#40563760">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40564371">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40564536">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40565292">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40565292">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There was also a fourth factor, the concentration of a literate and mechanically skilled[1] workforce in the areas that industrialised first, the Midlands.<p>Making ploughs and other agricultural machinery, cutlery, military arms, and other bits of machinery (axles for carts and carriages for instance).<p>The exploitation of coal for kinetic energy allowed the industrial revolution to continue, but yes, it certainly got underway well before coal had any contribution of this sort.<p>I would add that because nearly all of it is invisible, the role of heat in industrial processes is now widely underestimated.

I wasn&#x27;t making that argument at all; quite the opposite!

Concretely, Crompton&#x27;s spinning mule used hundreds of spindles simultaneously and was driven by water power. This parallel development to the steam engine arc suggests that coal alone can&#x27;t fully explain the magic of the British industrial revolution.<p>There was an incentive to innovate and automate, and a political structure that supported it - or at least did not shut it down - that existed independently of Britain&#x27;s coal deposits and heating needs.<p>In my view, the deforestation --&gt; coal --&gt; steam engine arc is important, but just one of several factors (other notable factors being global trade dominance founded on the world&#x27;s strongest navy and most efficient capital markets, as well a parliamentary system consistently advocating for commercial over monarchical interests). Coal deposits and local deforestation near large cities were <i>not</i> unique to Britain (see China, Belgium and Germany).<p>&gt; <i>After reading Coal - A Human History I’m of the opinion that the industrial revolution was a complete accident of circumstance on a tiny island that didn’t have enough trees to support its population’s energy needs...</i><p>This is the part of your initial comment I am responding to. I don&#x27;t mean to make it a straw man, but I do disagree with the primacy of the deforestation --&gt; coal arc. I think Britain with more trees would still industrialize; on the other hand I think Britain without its trade empire or navy, or Britain run by an all-powerful emperor would <i>not</i> have industrialized first.<p>Another take on why the trade empire&#x2F;navy was more <i>primary</i> than deforestation is that the former had a strong causal relationship on the latter. The Royal Navy&#x27;s shipbuilding was a major cause of deforestation [1], and the growth of international trade was itself a significant driver of London&#x27;s population growth which in turn caused the forests to be stripped for fuel.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;legionmagazine.com&#x2F;the-royal-navys-war-on-trees&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;legionmagazine.com&#x2F;the-royal-navys-war-on-trees&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="40564797" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40564797" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwup238</span><span>|</span><a href="#40563760">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40564663">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40570685">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40571128">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40564797">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40564797">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; My point is that the tremendous pre-steam improvements in spinning and weaving indicate that there was an incentive to innovate and automate - and a political structure that supported it - that was independent of Britain&#x27;s coal deposits and heating needs.</i><p>It just sounds like you&#x27;re trying to make an ideological point.</div><br/><div id="40564908" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40564908" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AnimalMuppet</span><span>|</span><a href="#40563760">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40564797">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40571128">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40564908">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40564908">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What?

Consequently, I’d argue, the industrial revolution represents probably just the second time in human history that as a species we’ve undergone a radical change in our production; the first being the development of agriculture in the Neolithic period.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acoup.blog&#x2F;2022&#x2F;08&#x2F;26&#x2F;collections-why-no-roman-industrial-revolution&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acoup.blog&#x2F;2022&#x2F;08&#x2F;26&#x2F;collections-why-no-roman-indus...</a> <i>Note: one of my favourite essays</i></div><br/></div></div><div id="40564155" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40564155" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">songeater</span><span>|</span><a href="#40563760">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40567663">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40564045">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40564155">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40564155">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">this post is a great read on this topic&#x2F;thesis as well: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acoup.blog&#x2F;2022&#x2F;08&#x2F;26&#x2F;collections-why-no-roman-industrial-revolution&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acoup.blog&#x2F;2022&#x2F;08&#x2F;26&#x2F;collections-why-no-roman-indus...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40564045" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40564045" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DrScientist</span><span>|</span><a href="#40563760">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40564155">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40571070">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40564045">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40564045">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I like that idea.<p>I also think there is always an element of chance.

Steam engines were not the industrial revolution, nor were they the cause. Most of these technologies were evolutionary improvements on other technologies that predated the industrial revolution, and the industrial revolution began before their wide adoption. The industrial revolution enabled steam engines, bessemer furnaces, automated looms, and other such technologies, not the other way around.<p>The industrial revolution is really a series of several major upheavals in life which occurred in discreet stages across a rather long time period. You have the scientific revolution that leads to a steady stream of invention and, more critically, refinement which in turn allows machines and processes to be steadily improved over time instead of the haphazard slip-faults of earlier progress. You have the agricultural revolution which both enables massive population growth and frees up large portions of the population to live and work in urban centers. You had the development first of the cottage system, then the british factory system, and then the american factory system, which changed both how goods were produced and how society was structured. There is the metrology revolution which, while building off the scientific revolution, was really more of a political and economic change, and enabled the development of machine tools and economical precision parts. And you have the birth of modern economics and the rise of the capitalist class as a dominant element in society, which really made large capital investments viable. None of these things depended on the steam engine, most preceded the wide adoption of the steam engine. Likewise for the other technologies that typically come to mind when thinking of the time period.<p>The article also fundamentally mischaracterizes other time periods. The Romans were actually quite big on adopting new technologies that would save labor. They were an extremely pragmatic people, and they viewed their reliance on slave labor as undesirable. Especially in late antiquity after their conquests mostly stopped, and as they were frequently troubled by civil wars, labor was actually a major issue. They would have gladly adopted a working steam engine. The issue was that, being pragmatic, they weren&#x27;t big on developing technologies that didn&#x27;t have clear practical applications. The development of what would become Watt&#x27;s steam engine took roughly 200 years of people screwing around with what was essentially a toy, which they mostly did as a means of signalling to their peers that they were sufficiently wealthy that they could dilly-dally on nonsense. It wasn&#x27;t just the steam engine itself, important technical  challenges like precision machining of bores all had to be figured out, it took a whole culture of people pursuing useless invention to make progress, as opposed to one or two hyper fixated polymaths. And even Watt&#x27;s steam engine wasn&#x27;t that good, it would be decades more before people started, for example, putting them on ships.<p>Next, while I&#x27;m sure the book has more, the data the article presents seems to be a very week evidence in support of its thesis. London wages, when normalized for prices, don&#x27;t jump relative to other nations until after 1825. At the normally accepted start date of 1750 for the industrial revolution (even though the groundwork was being laid long before this), London wages were typical for northern europe, lower than those in Amsterdam had been in the past several centuries, and they were falling. Prices for coal in London were typical; prices nearer the coal mines were low but there is no comparison made to other cities outside Britain that were near to coal production sites. For the wages to price of capital, the whole of England is compared to two cities which weren&#x27;t even particularly notable industrial centers when their respective nations first started to industrialize. The analysis of supply side factors seems much more focused on inventors than on the process of invention, which is inherently collaborative and multifaceted. It seems from the quotes at the end that the book is far more conservative in its claims, so perhaps this is sufficient, but again I feel it is ignoring a lot.<p>Finally, I am generally critical of any analysis that asks why the industrial revolution started in Britain, as opposed to elsewhere, and treats it as a unique, solitary data point. Obviously it can only happen for the first time once, but many nations have industrialized, and every time it has been a process spanning decades if not centuries, starting in some regions while reaching others later. While no doubt each example has its idiosyncrasies, for example there&#x27;s a world of difference between the industrialization of Meiji Japan and Communist China, there are nevertheless patterns that repeat. Any convincing theory as to why the industrial revolution started in Britain ought to predict how industrial revolutions begin and spread in general, or at least explain why it needs to be considered separately. I can&#x27;t really blame an english speaking historian for focusing on a region whose primary sources are all in english, but  if you&#x27;re going to call something a global perspective, I expect more.</div><br/><div id="40567960" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40567960" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bluGill</span><span>|</span><a href="#40565349">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40564752">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40567960">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40567960">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The above is why the bicycle and car were invented at almost the same time despite a car seeming to be vastly more complex.

It neatly demonstrates the role of technology as a tool for liberation. From the perspective of the emperors of past centuries, our modern world is, in many ways, worse than theirs. So of course the emperor would never approve of such technologies; even if you showed them a crystal ball and removed all the risk, they still wouldn&#x27;t want it.<p>There are parallels in the modern age. You don&#x27;t need an emperor to get the same effect. With our centrally controlled monetary system, there are strong Cantillion effects which cause wealth compounding; this creates an increasingly strong incentive for people to service the rich and an increasingly weak incentive to service the poor. So we are somewhat in a situation where those who have money in tech think &quot;Why do we need more efficient software tools? I have 10K software engineers on hand to build whatever the company needs. I have a market monopoly so their wages are peanuts to me... The money comes in regardless of development efficiency or improved security. We don&#x27;t need more efficient tools... Why? So that my small competitors can build software at the same speed as me with only 1% of the engineering capacity? Why would I want such tool to exist?&quot;<p>But with high inequality, liberation of the poor isn&#x27;t financially viable. So long as the poor are willing to engage in the current system, their living standards will keep declining, because nobody who is in a position to liberate them has an incentive to do so. There is no incentive to produce such technologies. There is little doubt that technologies have been used to further enslave people, rather than liberate them. This is why the woke&#x2F;DEI agenda is so horrible, it&#x27;s pure gaslighting.

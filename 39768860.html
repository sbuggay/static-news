The school&#x2F;state had a policy where any independent income earners making less than 35,000&#x2F;year would not pay tuition. A single dollar over that would require paying full tuition of ~$60&#x2F;unit or about $750 a semester. One year I worked a little more overtime during the holidays than usual and realized with a week to go in the year that I&#x27;d go a few hundred dollars over, so I called out of a few shifts and nearly got fired over it. I barely squeaked in under the limit, and if I hadn&#x27;t, there was pretty much no way I would have been able to continue school. It&#x27;s not like I could suddenly afford it now that I made $35,001 vs $34,999. I have never understood why things like this don&#x27;t use some sort of sliding scale, rather than absolute dividing line.</div><br/><div id="39769318" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39769318" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hammock</span><span>|</span><a href="#39769281">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39769688">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39769318">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39769318">[34 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">An instructive image of the welfare trap: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Welfare_trap.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Welfare_trap.png</a><p>People making $30K on welfare would need to make $81K at an actual job to have the same income after tax.<p>More info: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Welfare_trap" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Welfare_trap</a></div><br/><div id="39769497" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39769497" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">autoexec</span><span>|</span><a href="#39769281">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39769318">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39770499">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39769497">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39769497">[29 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Something seems very off with that image.

The federal government doesn&#x27;t have tax revenue. It issues a currency and then taxes go toward countering inflation. The notion that a currency-issuing government needs to &quot;balance its budget&quot; in its own currency is a political fiction. Also, policies that benefit people at the lower end of the income spectrum disproportionately actually move money around in the economy, which generally speaking is less inflationary than allowing it to accumulate in various silos like hedge funds<p>2. A &quot;negative income tax&quot; doesn&#x27;t have to require employment. You can make zero dollars in income as a self-employed person, and the self-employed still track their income for taxation purposes<p>3. There are many unnecessary-to-malicious subsidies and inefficient welfare programs that could easily have their rationale subsumed by UBI, and doing so would save considerable cost that is mostly the overhead of all the means-testing personnel and in some cases (like SNAP) completely separate financial machinery necessary to maintain them<p>Even setting all that aside, you could make considerably more &quot;tax revenue&quot; by funding the IRS or reversing some of the nakedly corrupt corporate tax breaks that have been created over the last several decades. There always seems to be more money to subsidize artificially lowering the price of certain goods, fund incredibly inefficient private government contractors to do things that once cost considerably less for the government to do itself, fund drug research only to then allow the resulting breakthroughs to be patented by a private firm and then gouge people for treatment, or buy ludicrously expensive weapons for militarized police forces, but propose anything that actually benefits people and suddenly everyone&#x27;s worried about the costs.<p>The arguments against UBI continue to be nonsensical handwringing at best</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39771942" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39771942" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RhodesianHunter</span><span>|</span><a href="#39769281">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39769746">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39772611">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39771422">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39771942">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39771942">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">16k wouldn&#x27;t cover daycare in much of the US let alone food, clothes, etc.</div><br/><div id="39773153" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39773153" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wizerdrobe</span><span>|</span><a href="#39769281">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39771942">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39771422">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39773153">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39773153">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What are you imagining the typical rate is in much of America.

At the same time, a small 12 year old on the 10U team is going to have a big advantage from age.<p>Around here we do have two different leagues, one for &#x27;recreational&#x27; teams and one for &#x27;reputation&#x27; teams, and you more or less have to demonstrate a decent amount of skill to get on the rep team, and then you&#x27;re playing with much better teams. All the teams are composed of a mix of big and small kids though.<p>Edit to add: All that said, I think bucketing kids by age makes sense <i>and</i> I agree that there can be advantage to being at the extremes of the cohort. Since the US school system usually has a different cutoff date (september-ish) than US youth hockey (jan 1), you might see different results where there&#x27;s grade level based high school hockey and age based youth hockey... but not in Canada where the cutoff is Jan 1 for both.</div><br/><div id="39772338" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39772338" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">munificent</span><span>|</span><a href="#39769339">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39769724">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39770183">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39772338">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39772338">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; I don&#x27;t think you can really just bucket kids by size and ignore age though... there&#x27;s a lot of mental development between 10U hockey and 12U hockey, and putting a big 10 year old on the 12U team is often not right because the level of play is so much different, most 10 year olds won&#x27;t keep up.</i><p>A friend of mine has a son who is giant for his age.

There are a number of factors that can cause the details to vary (age, location, household size, type of plan), but across all circumstances, it wouldn&#x27;t have been uncommon for an individual going from one side of the cut-off to the other to have their health insurance cost increase by roughly $7200&#x2F;yr. That means if an individual buying ACA insurance was going to earn $55k, they&#x27;d be better off reducing their income by $6440 and getting under the $48,560 subsidy ceiling than they are earning $55k.<p>Except that in real life there is no &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null that you can immediately pipe in <i>exactly</i> $6440 to hit your target.<p>You have to spend your <i>time</i> in order to achieve this reduction in AGI.<p>And discontinuities being discontinuous means that the number of people who have the necessary training&#x2F;experience to confidently achieve this in, say, three hours, is probably in the same ballpark as people who can successfully set up encrypted email in the same amount of time.<p>For everyone else, it&#x27;s going to take at least a week&#x27;s worth of time to plan, double check, execute, triple check, etc. (And realistically double that, or more.)<p>At 55K, you&#x27;ve already spent that savings in the value of the time you gave up to get the savings.<p>People often make fun of free software developers for failing to properly value their own time.

That is how you achieve more equable outcomes, give fixed subsidies to everyone and recover via proportional taxes.<p>Instead we end up with a situation where we have arbitrary cutoffs, a large buerocracy just checking for eligibility and often even progressive subsidies (giving more to those with higher incomes)</div><br/></div></div><div id="39770235" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39770235" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">atulvi</span><span>|</span><a href="#39774896">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39771558">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39770235">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39770235">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Need to add this one here

Politicians like labels because the parties depend on labels for branding. They want to use rhetoric to group people, like âpoorâ or ârichâ and the second you do that you create the discontinuity.<p>Avoiding benefit cliffs requires more than understanding the issue of discontinuities, it requires the reduction of identity politics which neither party is on board with. Parties themselves are labels.

As a middle-class techbro, this is a very lite version of a much bigger problem that has affected many low-income people.  News has long had stories about low-income people who are trapped with subsidies they need (housing, food, support for children, etc.).  They make a lousy wage, and can&#x27;t afford to get much of a better wage, because the societal safety net on which they depend would be ripped out from under them before they could afford it to.</div><br/><div id="39770450" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39770450" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hollerith</span><span>|</span><a href="#39770414">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39772036">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39770450">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39770450">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;I know I wouldn&#x27;t feel good about having to move from a nice building because the startup was doing OK.<p>Subsidized apartment buildings in the US don&#x27;t make you move out if your income goes up: they just take away your subsidy, i.e., your rent goes up to what HUD calls the apartment&#x27;s &quot;contract rent&quot;. Then HUD (statistically speaking) directs the money they used to use to subsidize your rent to building more subsidized housing. HUD <i>wants</i> successful people living in HUD-subsidized buildings, at least the ones with children in them, to serve as role models.</div><br/><div id="39770916" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39770916" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neilv</span><span>|</span><a href="#39770414">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39770450">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39772036">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39770916">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39770916">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Interesting; that sounds enlightened of HUD.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39772036" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39772036" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BWStearns</span><span>|</span><a href="#39770414">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39771746">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39772036">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39772036">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s interesting how the marathon discrepancies mostly disappear at left and right of the curve (looking at 2:30 and 6:30).

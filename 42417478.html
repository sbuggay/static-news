I think some initial design sketches are useful, but you often reach a point where you can only learn by implementing. I&#x27;ve encountered so many design constraints in the past that I couldn&#x27;t have planned for, but perhaps others are better at comprehensively thinking through a problem space than I can.<p>I agree with the blog post that doing a hacky solution is very helpful to understand the problem space better, although I think it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s challenging in an organization. In a lot of orgs, it might be viewed as a waste of time to work on something hacky. It could also come across as wasting people&#x27;s time by engaging in too many discussions over PRs. People want shipping solutions today, not explorations that might need to be rewritten later. Asking for feedback might also come across as someone being unsure of a solution and needing &quot;help&quot; on it.<p>The dynamics of working in a team generally nudge devs to make more conservative moves and writing more up-front design docs, which will be slower and safer. I&#x27;m not arguing that&#x27;s a bad thing, though. You need the documentation to communicate intent across an org and many other people will need to pick up the work, too. A PR may not provide enough space to comprehensively explain the overall design.<p>As an indie dev now, I find sketching some designs, followed by prototyping, then &quot;massaging&quot; the prototype into a working, shippable solution the ideal workflow. However, it only works because I&#x27;m solo and don&#x27;t need to worry about getting an okay on potentially risky solutions or having to communicate and get buy-in on implementations.

So much easier than prototyping.  But still &quot;can it be done?&quot; is a far cry from &quot;can we do it?&quot;.<p>The benefit of prototyping is to show that something is possible.  There the key question is integration: can persons Pn make code C on system S that meets both goal X and constraint Y - i.e., a design as product development.<p>Leaving aside bad-faith behaviors, the real question is socialization: 1. how to gather collective wisdom in some relatively natural and encouraging manner to encourage collective deep consideration of hard problems to avoid waste and get things done.  And 2. the same for motivation: getting everyone aligned, understanding their role and the quality&#x2F;schedule risks.<p>Given the uncertainties and costs of product development, the prototype has significant advantage of seeming &quot;real&quot; relative to some &quot;ideal&quot; solution, and thus can bias teams to the concrete, particularly when issues are contended.

The first draft tends to address all the wrong problems, doesn&#x27;t abstract the right things, is over and under engineered in all the wrong places. Fine, it&#x27;s a draft I guess<p>2. But here&#x27;s the kicker: unless it&#x27;s really unusable, there is now pressure on users to accept the draft, because changing it, perhaps substantially, requires work, and as it it sort of kind of works, if you squint. And this thing is there and you can pretend it&#x27;s a job done.<p>I think ploughing in to writing code works if you ha r a decent idea of what you need to achieve and what the pinch points are.

Successful design docs require MORE work (or far more meeting time, at least) than rapid prototyping. Because they need to mentally step through all the logic, gotchas and integration issues without writing a line of code.<p>For a math metaphor, it&#x27;s like doing a complex problem in your head then making a document stating which mathematical tools you will use, THEN writing down the actual formula. Versus the &quot;show your work&quot; approach of trying a few things, recalibrating or re-routing, then settling on the final approach.<p>So the design doc approach is truly terrible and inefficient. Except...<p>If a Very Smart Person is making the design doc and can pump out a perfect plan quickly...<p>And&#x2F;or if the engineers implementing the solution are too junior to understand the build&#x2F;rebuild approach...<p>Or if they are likely to miss various integration footguns...<p>Or if they are likely to go far down the wrong path completely...<p>Or if the organization is of such size that no one has understanding of all the parts and integration parts so you need to set hard I&#x2F;O requirements for clean handoffs.<p>There may be more reasons for design docs, but I strongly agree they should only be used when necessary and certainly not required so that management gets to feel useful. They add a hefty tax to development speed and it&#x27;s management&#x27;s job to understand that cost&#x2F;benefit ratio.</div><br/><div id="42425744" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42425744" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fwip</span><span>|</span><a href="#42425224">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42426624">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42425744">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42425744">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It think it mainly depends on the difficulty of the problem.<p>If you&#x27;re working on a very difficult math problem - say, a novel proof - you&#x27;re definitely going to lay out the tools and techniques, the various steps of the proof, before you sit down and start writing it out.

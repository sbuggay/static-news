I never really understood why React and Angular became big for the general web. They have a lot of usage in enterprise applications, where you typically access them from a “pc”, but even then they suck on the tablets your employees drive around with. At least for the most part they don’t suck that much worse than the terrible native clients that came before (and still do in the rare case that a supplier actually build a native mobile app). Why that spread to the wider web is beyond me though. I get why you would use it for personal projects if it’s your day time job anyway, but a page reload never hurt anyone.<p>I personally think that the most responsible “father” is finance. The article states that there is more money with the web, but in my experience it’s far easier to lock down payments through apps. I agree that part of this is because native apps are better on mobile, but they are also much easier to work with and consume. It’s not easy to make payments function well on the web while in a native app it’s just a click with well powered api behind it. Serving both users and developers. Now, it probably could be easier on the web, but who would deliver it? The article calls out Apple and to some degree Google as guilty of not making browsers competitive with mobile apps, but why would they? If anything it’s in their best interest to keep the web shitty on mobile.</div><br/><div id="41967097" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41967097" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gruez</span><span>|</span><a href="#41966240">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41966172">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41967097">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41967097">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;I never really understood why React and Angular became big for the general web.<p>As opposed to what?

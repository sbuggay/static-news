The solution wasn&#x27;t to accept that bridges collapse, the solution was to not allow just anybody to build a bridge and to create standards that bridges had to adhere to.<p>Also, as a self thought programmer that is regularily shocked of what he finds in the field, done by supposed professionals: Being self thought has nothing to do with it. Because I can also read on someone&#x27;s experiences and mind set. Every self thought programmer will read books on programming made by people who program. Even self thought programmers will avoid goto atatements like the pest even if they don&#x27;t know the original reason for that rule.<p>The problem in software engineering is one of culture. We program shit and move on. If it breaks it is not our fault. Very few people feel ownership and&#x2F;or responsibility for the code. Granted: Very few companies are willing to pay the money needed to allow for such a process, except if they are in a field where it is required by law (automotive, aviation, ...)<p>What we need is a clearer liability structure for software errors. If a companies software is investigated after privacy leaks and they are on the hook for each individuals data that they mistreated if the software is not up to standard companies will think twice to cheap out on software engineering. If software engineers are on the hook if a company gave them everything needed to make a safe product and they didn&#x27;t, they are on the hook.<p>I don&#x27;t say everything needs to follow that level&#x2F;standard, but as of now a software error is treated like a unavoidable act of gods will that nobody could have foreseen or prevented.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36706391" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36706391" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stOneskull</span><span>|</span><a href="#36705378">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36705659">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36706112">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36705401">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36706391">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36706391">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">even with self-teaching, you look up forums&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;etc. they aren&#x27;t so direct, but many past mistakes are wrapped up in these places of advice. i imagine there would be at least 9 past mistakes by others incorporated into the lessons and advice (and comments) of the topics, for each mistake you make yourself.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36705401" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36705401" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kiba</span><span>|</span><a href="#36705378">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36705550">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36706019">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36705401">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36705401">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Nothing drive the point home than emotional pain.

First, data is inherently abstractive and abstractions are leaky. And second, we have culturally elevated data to a truth beyond what we can see with our own eyes.<p>Or, to paraphrase Douglas Adams: &quot;The data is definitive. Reality is frequently inaccurate.&quot;<p>Because abstractions are leaky, it&#x27;s easy to create false apparent patterns in data. And when the data is trusted more than the reality it is supposed to describe, those false apparent patterns become unfalsifiable, because the only way to falsify them is the data that created them in the first place.<p>The goal to avoid human bias and compensate for human fallibility is a good one. So I don&#x27;t think that &quot;data&quot; is a bad idea. What I think is that data is a <i>tool</i>, to be used alongside intuition and experiment, as a means for understanding the world. If your beliefs are wildly inconsistent with the data, it is worth asking why and lowering your confidence in those beliefs (but you need not immediately abandon them). If your beliefs are consistent with the data, it&#x27;s worth asking what <i>other</i> beliefs might be. If you did an experiment and predicted one set of observations but observed another, that&#x27;s proof that at a minimum your <i>prediction</i> failed (even if your theory was not a bad one), and that deserves investigation. These are legitimate uses of data.</div><br/><div id="41327310" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41327310" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">devjab</span><span>|</span><a href="#41323832">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41325634">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41327310">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41327310">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Or, to paraphrase Douglas Adams: &quot;The data is definitive. Reality is frequently inaccurate.&quot;<p>Having worked with public sector data in Denmark this part is particularly hilarious to encounter in the wild. Even something as “simple” as an organisational chart is something will multiple realities depending on who you ask. Often the people working within context of the different realities will be quite fanatical about their reality.<p>The place I worked had an employee registry which became the foundation for more and more purposes as the digital services grew. Typically being the foundation for rights to the 300+ different IT systems. It was based on the payment system, which was sort of natural when it was build because that is the one place every employee is registered. Of course this became an issue. For one, teams can only have one manager in basically every Danish HR system, I’m not sure why that is, because a lot of teams have multiple managers performing different roles. Sometimes some of the manager roles where delegated, sometimes the responsibilities were simply spilt. In any case, because there was no data on this hierarchy it was hilariously hard to do things like default who would have access rights to approving vacation, audit and so on. Then you had healthcare, which works three shifts with a different amount of people on each shift. Especially the night shift was a challenge, because they needed access to the whole house and every patient. Which might’ve been easy if there was a regular night shift team, but heathcare personal rotate shifts. Even the specifically designed patient registry which was solely build for patient care couldn’t handle this because nobody had thought about it before they build it (or the data laws like GDPR).<p>Anyway, there was a billion different things where data didn’t represent a single reality. I can’t get into the stuff involving citizens, but let’s just say that it will be horrible when different departments use the data with AI as though their own reality is the only reality.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41325634" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41325634" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gnoack</span><span>|</span><a href="#41323832">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41327110">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41325634">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41325634">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think this is a big misinterpretation of that Alan Kay quote, which was in response to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11941656">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11941656</a> - the author of that comment aims to create a programming language with a focus on &quot;data processing&quot;.<p>Alan Kay has long wanted to &quot;get rid of data&quot; in programming, as described at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;userpage.fu-berlin.de&#x2F;~ram&#x2F;pub&#x2F;pub_jf47ht81Ht&#x2F;doc_kay_oop_en" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;userpage.fu-berlin.de&#x2F;~ram&#x2F;pub&#x2F;pub_jf47ht81Ht&#x2F;doc_kay...</a><p>The entire discussion that this Alan Kay quote is from has always been about the prominence of &quot;data&quot; as a central concept in programming, not about other aspects like privacy or &quot;big data&quot;.</div><br/><div id="41326124" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41326124" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Phiwise_</span><span>|</span><a href="#41325634">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41325814">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41326124">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41326124">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How about this quote instead, then?<p>&gt;&quot;Big data&quot; is a way that a lot of people are trying to make money today, and it&#x27;s a favorite of marketing people because it&#x27;s in the wind. ...

So I don&#x27;t know what kind of processes produced it, how and why it was collected, any transformations that might have happened on the way to storing it, etc. Without that information, I simply cannot know for sure what any of it really means with enough precision to be able to draw valid conclusions from it.<p>The best I can do is advise caution, say that this data can help us form hypotheses whose only true use is helping us form a plan to collect <i>new</i> data that <i>will</i> help us answer the question we have.

Such a publication would be reviewed and scrutinized rather haphazardly.

But it shouldn&#x27;t be surprising - these companies put a lot of energy into making the process unpleasant for users (often in ways that are blatantly violating the laws) while framing themselves as the victims.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41324065" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41324065" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ozim</span><span>|</span><a href="#41323424">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41323682">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41323959">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41324065">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41324065">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes social norm is if I have phone number of my friend and I am going to share it with someone, I ask that friend first if he wants his phone number shared with person asking.<p>Crooked companies overstepped social norms because they could get away with it - which is clear definition of an asshole, someone doing something shitty just because he knows he can get away with it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

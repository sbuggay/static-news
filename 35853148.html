I chose a boring stack with plenty of developers available: MySQL, PHP with Laravel, and Angular 2. Since then, I&#x27;ve been a founding engineer at some startups using the latest, cutting-edge tech stacks. I&#x27;m proud to announce that the stack I managed as CTO is still running stable and smooth with minimal intervention, and it remains easy to modify. Meanwhile, the startups with flashy stacks and nearly impossible-to-debug architectures have gone out of business.<p>It amazes me how some companies still adopt the &quot;build it and they will come&quot; approach, and when confronted with harsh reality, they double down on building (and especially increasing architectural complexity). CEOs, if you can&#x27;t attract customers with an idea or don&#x27;t have a vertical that people are eager to pay for, cramming 1000 half-baked features into a microservice architecture and using the latest programming language &#x2F; paradigm won&#x27;t save your company!</div><br/><div id="35859101" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35859101" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Cthulhu_</span><span>|</span><a href="#35854555">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35855036">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35859101">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35859101">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;boringtechnology.club&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;boringtechnology.club&#x2F;</a> remains relevant, and I try to apply it wherever I go with... varying results.<p>One issue though is that it seems more difficult to find competent developers for boring stacks, because they&#x27;re always looking for the next challenge, the next thing they consider interesting or what looks good on their profile (vs what is best for their employer).</div><br/><div id="35859454" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35859454" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Volrath89</span><span>|</span><a href="#35854555">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35859101">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35859455">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35859454">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35859454">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;d love to work on a &quot;boring&quot; stack and just ship features and build stuff but... companies are like a herd, and they all ask for the same microservices&#x27; technologies when interviewing, no matter what they are building.<p>So if I stay with a boring stack, I&#x27;d lose competitive advantage and face the potential of being &quot;un-hirable&quot; in the not-so-distant future.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35859455" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35859455" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cryptos</span><span>|</span><a href="#35854555">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35859101">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35859454">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35855036">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35859455">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35859455">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Maybe the word &quot;boring&quot; scare some people away, but it is a good contrast to exciting new technology anyway. &quot;Mature&quot; would probably the more appropriate term.

The fact that the response to lack of PMF was to double down on product features and tech (instead of a business pivot), in my opinion, was what made the investor money go poof and the startup die down.

When you are exploring how to construct something, building a prototype in a few days or weeks is a good approach.<p>First, itâs a huge stretch to say its simpler to use microservices. Anything distributed has to deal with consistency, dropped messages, serialization, propagation latency etc. If you choose to ignore those aspects, that doesnât make it simpler, it just leaves a wrapped gift of complexity to your future coworkers who will have to maintain it.<p>Secondly, this wasnât the case of building something exploratory for future unpredictable workloads. All the requirements were already available. This tells you an important story: Amazon engineers were not able to estimate upfront how much âserverlessâ resources were needed, and how this âmicroservice meshâ would perform. This isnât surprising, because the more complex a system is, the harder it is to predict how itâll work under some workload. And it doesnât help that the microservice preachers have been actively discouraging developers to think about infrastructure.<p>I donât have a horse in this race.

The problem is that they called this refactoring a microservice to monolith transition, when itâs clearly a microservice refactoring step<p>If I understood the post at all, I disagree.<p>One can spend hundreds of HN comments discussing technology stacks, monoliths, etc, and this is important: it affects maintainability, developer hours, and money spent on orchestration. For some applications, almost the entire workload is orchestration, and this discussion makes sense.<p>But for this workload, actual work is being done, and it can be quantified and priced.  So letâs get to the basics: an uncompressed 1080p video stream is something like 3 Gbps. It costs a certain amount of CPU to decompress. It costs a certain amount of CPU to analyze.<p>These have price tags. You can pay for that CPU at EC2 rates or on-prem rates or Lambda rates or whatever. You can calculate this! And you pay for that bandwidth.  You can pay for 3Gbps per stream using S3: you pay S3 and you pay EC2 (or whatever) because that uses 1&#x2F;10th of the practical maximum EC2 &lt;-&gt; S3 bandwidth per instance. Or you pay for the fraction of main memory bandwidth used if you decode and analyze on the same EC2 instance (or Lambda function or whatever). Or you pay for the fraction of cache bandwidth used if you decide partial frames and analyze without ever sending to memory.<p>And youâll find that S3 is not âchattyâ. Itâs catastrophic.

The cost. The $&#x2F;CPU&#x2F;RAM cost of Serverless is beyond bonkers. When I was pricing up Cloud Functions vs Spot instances on GKE I think I came to the conclusion Cloud Functions are about 300x as expensive. If your code can run on serverless it can probably run on Spot instances which you can just add to your GKE deployment using another node pool and only schedule things that can handle nodes going away within 60s there and instantly reap 300x cost savings. This is because Serverless is sold at a massive premium to CPU list prices and Spot is sold at like ~30-40% of list prices depending on machine type (for those curious when I last checked T2D was the best for price&#x2F;performance for highly single thread performance dependent workloads, ala Node.js)</div><br/><div id="35853928" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35853928" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kpw94</span><span>|</span><a href="#35853565">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35853811">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35857241">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35853928">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35853928">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;

This code could be deployed to a VM, appengine, or k8s in less than a day if needed.<p>&gt; Amount of Infrastructure as Code overhead, ala Terraform, CloudFormation, whatever else floats your boat to support serverless is insane. The sheer number of objects that need to defined, kept in sync etc is just bonkers. Not to mention if you have multiple services setup like this it&#x27;s all boilerplate you either need to abstract or carry around.<p>One of the advantages of our use of serverless is that we don&#x27;t yet need any of that complexity.<p>&gt; Hides serious programming deficiencies like memory leaks because context is thrown away after servicing request.<p>What you descried is literally not a serious deficiencies. If you code leaks memory, but never runs long enough for that to have meaningful impact, it&#x27;s not a problem.<p>&gt; Unpredictable runtime makes observability more complicated, probably forcing you into poor decisions as a result, i.e prom push gateway.<p>The serverless solutions we use have observability built in for free... and datadog automatically can pull that in if you wnat a starting point for more.<p>&gt; Runtime&#x2F;execution time limits mean people trying to do all-serverless end up doing horrible things to accomplish long-running tasks.<p>If you have something that <i>must</i> be long running, serveless isn&#x27;t a great pick for that one thing (at least, witht he solutions I&#x27;m aware of).<p>That said, there are some elegant ways to handle that using serverless (e.g. by breaking it into smaller tasks with shorter durations)... and going non-serverless isn&#x27;t a silver bullet, I&#x27;ve seen terrible architectures for long-running code in all kinds of deployments.<p>&gt; All of the above leads to increasing pressure to make poor architectural decisions to work around limitations of the runtime.<p>Completely ignoring that serverless can encourage better architectural decisions.<p>&gt; EDIT: Actually I forgot the worst con. The cost. The $&#x2F;CPU&#x2F;RAM cost of Serverless is beyond bonkers. When I was pricing up Cloud Functions vs Spot instances on GKE I think I came to the conclusion Cloud Functions are about 300x as expensive.<p>Curious.<p>Let&#x27;s have a 1s task on Cloud Run with 1 CPU and 1GB of memory:<p>CPU: $0.00002400&#x2F;s
Memory: $0.00000250&#x2F;s
Request: $0.40 &#x2F; million<p>Total = $0.0000269 for 1 request lasting 1s.<p>Current spot pricing for C3 instances is:<p>$0.003086 &#x2F; vCPU hour
$0.000413 &#x2F; GB hour<p>Or for 1s that would be:
0.00000097&#x2F;s<p>Which is 27x cheaper - so you&#x27;re already off by an order of a magnitude.<p>It gets worse - that&#x27;s 1GB of RAM, however the VM needs RAM for it&#x27;s own OS etc, so maybe you need to provision 2GB of memory, a bit more CPU etc.<p>The minimum billing time for compute instances according to docs is 60s... so 60x cost if you only need to do this hourly or less.<p>You&#x27;re entirely responsible for <i>all</i> time spent, including startup, shut down, idle etc. This just adds more and more cost.<p>The expected availability model is completely different - serverless should be available in milliseconds, seconds at the worst. Spot instances have no such expectations.<p>It&#x27;s a fundamentally different model - a spot VM can&#x27;t loadbalance, serve code or anything without devops. So now we&#x27;re spending likely $XXX&#x2F;hour on devops to try to save fractions of pennies an hour.<p>When this is all said and done, I don&#x27;t think you really understand the cost or use-cases of serverless well - and dramatically underestimate the costs of the solutions you present.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35857272" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35857272" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scarface74</span><span>|</span><a href="#35853565">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35853811">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35858212">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35854580">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35857272">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35857272">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Infinite concurrency is a bit of a curse.

I&#x27;m not a professional, but I learned a thing or two.<p>My opinion is as follows:<p>Installing kubernetes with kubeadm is easy. You can do it in few hours if you&#x27;re fluent with Linux.<p>Kubernetes storage is where it starts to be hard. We were lucky to have OpenStack hosting which allows to use network block storage (ceph) without any additional work. Using kubernetes without any storage might severely limits apps you can run there, although it&#x27;s possible. Using local storage is an option but also with many &quot;but&quot;. Rolling out ceph: I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s hard.<p>Load balancing: again I was lucky to have OpenStack load balancer. Otherwise, I think that it&#x27;s possible, but definitely not within a few hours, unless you did it before.<p>Kubernetes networking might be tricky. I wasn&#x27;t able to implement it in a way I like. I used calico with overlay mode in the end, but I&#x27;d prefer &quot;flat&quot; network. Calico overlay mode was easy.<p>Upgrading kubernetes manually is easy. At least until it breaks, it didn&#x27;t break for me yet. kubeadm just works.<p>Node autoscaling is hard. There&#x27;re no simple solutions, at least I didn&#x27;t find any. Our cluster does not autoscale. Manual scaling is not hard, though. I can implement autoscaling with loads of bash&#x2F;terraform&#x2F;cloudinit scripts but I&#x27;d rather not to. I think that node autoscaling is what managed kubernetes offering do well.<p>Now that we have kubernetes, story is not really over. We need to collect logs for nodes, for services, for pods. We need to collect metrics. We need to set up alerts. We need to have traces. Service mesh looks really nice so you can see how services interact with each other. Those things are not for given. They take lot of time and expertise.

As for Postgres, nothing against it, it is a very good SQL database, though my opinion is that you should limit yourself to basic SQL as much as you can, so that you are not dependent on a particular database.</div><br/><div id="35856783" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35856783" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cutler</span><span>|</span><a href="#35853565">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35854803">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35855392">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35856783">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35856783">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t get how a Spring app rewritten in PHP, assuming a framework is used, reduces code significantly given that PHP5+ is a dynamically-typed Java clone with the same mind-numbing boilerplate.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35855392" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35855392" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">websap</span><span>|</span><a href="#35853565">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35854803">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35853690">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35855392">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35855392">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Serverless first is a great way to start building your business.

JVM can handle almost any workload shape, the main one it doesn&#x27;t do well in is memory constrained environments (though it&#x27;s possible if you really want to).
PHP, Node&#x2F;TS, Python, Ruby all suffer from being single threaded so can&#x27;t take advantage of properly large machines without a ton of extra complexity and you pay a high memory overhead for most of those strategies.<p>Go is OK, I hate writing it but it can do all the things so if that floats your boat go for it.

The JVM, and specifically Java, and even more specifically Spring, have a lot of annoying warts, it&#x27;s just that other languages have different warts. I agree that you shouldn&#x27;t try to rewrite everything in an obscure, untested technology, but beyond that, there&#x27;s a number of options with enough tradeoffs. But it seems we&#x27;re largely in agreement there.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with the &quot;keep everything in one language &#x2F; stack&quot; sentiment. There&#x27;s certainly companies that overdo it, having 20 different languages at the same time. But there&#x27;s also valid reasons for keeping certain tech stacks separate (e.g. having to do ML &#x2F; data analysis stuff in Python). In the worst case, the &quot;use only a single language&quot; mindset leads to disasters like GWT, which is something that my current company unfortunately still uses because some Java developers (that don&#x27;t work for the company any more) thought that JavaScript was beneath them.<p>I also wouldn&#x27;t choose PHP, for the record. I would like to trash it here, but I&#x27;ve never actually been forced to use it, so I can&#x27;t even comment on it.<p>I&#x27;m not so sure about k8s. I think you can get away with much simpler deployment models, too. At some point the overhead of having to manage everything manually (or a need for zero-downtime deployments) might make the added complexity of k8s more bearable, but it&#x27;s certainly added complexity and not necessary everywhere and all the time.<p>I 100% agree about postgres, it&#x27;s so good and feature-rich that you should probably really only ever use another database if you have very specific needs (except maybe also adding redis as a cache, because redis is also very good).</div><br/><div id="35855972" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35855972" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DanHulton</span><span>|</span><a href="#35853565">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35853876">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35856795">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35855972">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35855972">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Quarkus also has a lot of annoying warts, as does just plain ol&#x27; Java.<p>Lord, if I never see another Builder pattern again in my life, I may die a happy man.</div><br/><div id="35856807" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35856807" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cutler</span><span>|</span><a href="#35853565">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35855972">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35856795">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35856807">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35856807">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Agreed.

It&#x27;s the only &quot;serverless&quot; deployment I&#x27;ve done. It still works fine for that purpose, and it&#x27;s less trouble than manually deploying to multiple servers. Forced updates are an occasional headache but at least they&#x27;re all in one place. The code does a lot of serverside computation for a lot of client connections, so that part needs to scale, and since there&#x27;s relatively little database stuff it just connects to a single RDS instance.<p>I can&#x27;t think of any other code of mine for which I&#x27;d use Beanstalk or something similar now, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to evaluate each project independently and pick the right tools for the job.</div><br/><div id="35855354" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35855354" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jpgvm</span><span>|</span><a href="#35853565">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35855279">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35856771">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35855354">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35855354">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah Beanstalk was pretty simple and decent for it&#x27;s time.<p>I told anyone that wasn&#x27;t comfortable with Cloudformation + Packer and wanted to be on AWS to use it during that era.

People were doing immutable AMIs on ASGs at the high end and then everything down to pet AWS instances w&#x2F;Capistrano or similar tools at the low end.<p>These days things are different, containers were a big deal. If you target k8s your application is pretty portable, can be run locally in something like kind to integration test the infra components, etc. You can take it to the 3 major clouds and bring most of your ingress, secrets, volume, etc configuration with you.<p>For me k8s has been a godsend because for once I haven&#x27;t had to learn a whole new set of idioms each new place that are all equivalent but different in their own special snowflake ways.</div><br/><div id="35855391" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35855391" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">emodendroket</span><span>|</span><a href="#35853565">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35855354">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35857391">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35855391">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35855391">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; You can take it to the 3 major clouds and bring most of your ingress, secrets, volume, etc configuration with you.<p>How often have you seen someone actually do this, and was it ever actually as &quot;easy&quot; as they imagined?

What I figured out early (the hard way) was that it wasn&#x27;t worth the time trying to screw around with leader instances that installed and ran cron jobs or anything like that. I just have an little separate ec2 instance that acts as a heartbeat for cleaning up the DB and buckets, rather than trying to get Beanstalk to do that consistently. I think it&#x27;s extremely well suited for <i>one layer</i>, the API; and counterintuitively I find it easier not to containerize that, because it gives me more flexibility to switch DBs or storage engines without touching the API, and without having to rework a container and redeploy the API itself.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35854746" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35854746" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vlovich123</span><span>|</span><a href="#35853565">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35853842">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35856771">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35856372">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35854746">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35854746">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Have you tried Cloudflare Workers?

I actually advocated for the move to Cloudflare and we ended up adopting workers because Cloudflare unfortunately has broken stale-while-revalidate support. So I built an implementation in Workers that abuses the Cache API to store our own TTLs and also our revalidating state. It works pretty well as we don&#x27;t end up with too many isolates per POP but it&#x27;s not perfect.<p>I didn&#x27;t end up using KV or other features yet, they weren&#x27;t a good fit for the cache revalidation implementation.<p>I think at-least for now I see it differently to FaaS services like Lambda&#x2F;CloudFunctions because I don&#x27;t intend to use it to implement application logic, rather just augment (or in this case shore up deficiencies) in the edge.<p>We may consider doing more stuff at the edge later for latency advantages.
This to me changes the calculus because Lamba (well vanilla, not Lamda@Edge) and CF solve my usual problems just with higher costs.
CloudFlare workers actually let me do things I couldn&#x27;t do.
So the cost is still just as high as FaaS platforms BUT importantly I actually get something for it, something I can&#x27;t otherwise have and important enough I am willing to pay the costs and overheads for.<p>Please advocate for real state-while-revalidate support internally!

You grow into it OR start with a large enough problem to demand it.<p>You start with GitHub pages or Cloudflare pages where all you have is CSS, HTML, and JS served from the equivalent of a global CDN that you didnât have to build for essentially free.<p>For a mom and pop shop, how many times are they going to have to contact you over the next 20 years for a piece of software doing its job running on GitHub pages? Practically zero, unless itâs a feature request. Canât say the same for a Linux box plugged into the wall under your desk or an R620 at the colo downtown.<p>Then you graduate to sprinkling a little bit of persistent state in. When you need a little bit of persistent state for a small mom and pop, deciding to vet colo vendors and signing that shop up to be responsible for sysadmining an R620 with a Linux kernel is irresponsible. You find a serverless vendor for your DB layer (like the Firebase of yore) or a set of CRUD handlers written on infra that fully manages the language runtime, operating system, kernel, and infra for your customer (like Cloudflare workers).<p>How many times is the customer going to need to contact you over the next 20 years for your Cloudflare worker? Probably only a handful. Odds are, significantly less than an R620 plugged into a server rack at the colo downtown.<p>If you outgrow this, you probably are starting to look at VMs or colo.<p>Serverless is real. Itâs not lambda. Itâs pervasive. Itâs provides substantial value in ongoing maintenance and engineering costs if you pick the right vendor. And a majority of the market demands it as a starting point.<p>An engineer is expensive and most customers arenât in a position to practice the craft themselves.

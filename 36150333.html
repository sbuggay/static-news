They all came with a CD with the unique calibration file for the back to tune out these characteristics to a large degree.

Probably due to sawing, mounting or bonding stresses.<p>There are other causes for similar artifacts, e.g. banding because of mismatch between ADCs, though most CCD-based DSCs only used 1-4 ADCs interleaved. I believe some of the larger CCD sensors used separate read-out channels for quadrants, which would look similar to a stitched sensor in addition to likely being stitched anyhow. Also some Toshiba CMOS sensors had issues with banding due to mismatches between the column group ADCs. Lastly modern sensors for mirrorless cameras have split pixels for auto-focus in every n-th row, which also causes banding because they respond differently.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36161746" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36161746" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">muhehe</span><span>|</span><a href="#36161341">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36162219">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36161746">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36161746">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Does this survive jpeg (or similar) compression or do you need raw file for this?</div><br/></div></div><div id="36162219" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36162219" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mefarza123</span><span>|</span><a href="#36161746">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36162219">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36162219">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I am new on this topic so I tried to educate myself on this: (Source: MirrorThink.ai)<p>What is Sensor definition: 
A sensor fingerprint is a unique pattern or characteristic that can be attributed to a specific sensor, such as those found in digital cameras or other imaging devices. These fingerprints are often caused by variations in the manufacturing process of sensor elements, resulting in slight differences in the way each sensor captures and processes data. In the context of digital cameras, sensor fingerprints are often referred to as photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU), which is a multiplicative noise component that can be estimated and detected in images.<p>Sensor fingerprints can be used for various applications, such as identifying the source of an image, enhancing the quality of images captured by different sensors, and improving the interoperability of biometric systems that rely on data obtained from multiple sensors.<p>Several methods have been proposed to detect and enhance sensor fingerprints, including deep learning techniques, such as adversarial learning and edge loss, as well as local textural features and skin distortion analysis for fingerprint presentation attack detection.<p>Here there are three of the applications:<p>1. Digital camera forensics: Identifying sensor fingerprints can be used to trace the origin of digital images, helping to determine the specific camera or imaging device that captured the image. This can be useful in cases of copyright infringement, image forgery, or other digital media investigations.<p>2. Multimedia forensics: Sensor fingerprints can be used to authenticate and verify the integrity of multimedia content, such as audio, video, and images. By analyzing the unique noise patterns introduced by the sensor, it is possible to determine if the content has been tampered with or manipulated.<p>3. Device identification and tracking: Sensor fingerprints can be used to uniquely identify and track devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and IoT devices. By analyzing the unique characteristics of the sensors in these devices, it is possible to determine the specific device that generated the data, which can be useful for security and privacy applications.<p>Patent (Source: MirrorThink.ai): Method and apparatus for identifying a digital camera - 2007-05-29<p>This patent describes a method and apparatus for identifying a digital camera by analyzing the sensor fingerprint. The method involves extracting a noise pattern from an image captured by the camera, which is then compared to a database of known noise patterns associated with different camera models. The sensor fingerprint is used to uniquely identify the camera that captured the image, which can be useful in forensic investigations involving digital images.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

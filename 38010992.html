Off the top of my head, we:<p><pre><code>   * Manually create pre-configured accounts for potential customers, sometimes with up to an hour of entering in their existing data so things look familiar right from first login.
    * Investigate problems and repair live data, usually just by logging in as a user and using the tools in the product. Can they do this themselves? Sure. Do they appreciate our doing it instead? Oh, hell yes.
   * Have screen-sharing calls where we walk customers through the process of linking our product with third parties (e.g. OAuth pairing with Square so they can process payments).
   * Call customers who are want help or advice with _other parts of their business_ that aren&#x27;t related to our product, but about which we know something. Don&#x27;t know what you should put in your vendor contracts or what % you should charge for sales commissions? Give us a call; we&#x27;ll help you out.
</code></pre>
...plus probably dozens more that aren&#x27;t fresh on my mind. We work flat-out to onboard every single customer, no matter how small, because word-of-mouth is our only growth channel and delivering a surprisingly human onboarding&#x2F;support experience is the best way I know to generate great referrals. It doesn&#x27;t scale, but it&#x27;s also probably our main growth driver.<p>It&#x27;ll work until it doesn&#x27;t, I guess, but so far doing things that don&#x27;t scale is <i>how</i> we scale.</div><br/><div id="38017119" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38017119" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dclowd9901</span><span>|</span><a href="#38016704">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38017722">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38017119">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38017119">[32 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What you’re describing here is _good customer service_, which basically doesn’t scale at all ever (at least in any automated way).

In practice, your typical academic has no experience with containers&#x2F;Linux&#x2F;system-level dependencies. To prevent their walking away, I basically set up their software environments for them on an individualized basis when they reached out to us through intercom.<p>As PG says elsewhere, one of the main advantages of an early-stage startup is they can devote an insane level of attention to early users.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeocean.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeocean.com&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="38020703" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38020703" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">austin-cheney</span><span>|</span><a href="#38016707">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38019216">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38020703">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38020703">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Original test automation application.<p>I wrote a new test automation application because in my primary personal application I need to run test automation in the browser, I needed it to be faster than prior existing solutions, and I needed it to be distributed to browsers on different machines of the same local network.  The test samples for this new test automation application are just JSON data structures defined against a TypeScript interface, so the code editor literally tells you what properties are missing to complete a test and what the allowed values are.<p>Its faster than other test automation tools for the browser because it does not make use of CDP.  Instead a test receiver is required to be embedded in the given page(s) which evaluates the tests and transmits the results.  Its also faster because it only uses WebSockets and not HTTP.  I was executing 89 tests comprising a total of 284 points of evaluation against event execution in the browser at 6.22 seconds from Node start to test completion.<p>This took tremendous trial and error to get correct, but now I have experience writing and executing test automation at a depth that almost nobody else has and can do it faster than all the popular test automation applications.  It also required that I rewrite large portions of my primary personal application to make everything WebSocket based for faster execution across the board and also to greatly simplify the service&#x2F;transmission architecture on both the browser and the Node layer.<p>This experience is winning me employment at higher rates when many senior developers are challenged to find new employment.  Writing this new test automation did not scale at all and took tremendous time to get correct and stable, but now it allows scale and rapid execution of colossal refactors I could never do before.  Since the test automation executes on the local machine only in less than 10 seconds I find that I was running it dozens of times a day for large feature enhancements.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38019216" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38019216" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throw_nbvc1234</span><span>|</span><a href="#38020703">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38019059">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38019216">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38019216">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Amazon same day delivery was supposedly bootstrapped by ordering ubers via burner phones.

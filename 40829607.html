Corporate politics and company culture is such a strong force.<p>The reality is many direct managers have little visibility into their reports day-to-day work because they are not hands-on enough. They should be checking the work product. Example: They should at least be looking at PRs and even participating in code reviews themselves. If you proposed this to some &quot;engineering managers&quot; I am familiar with, they would say this is not their job and you are crazy for even mentioning it.

The repetitions slide into the background and the differences stick out. The more code there is, the easier to see what goes together (data aggregates&#x2F;structures), what the overall flow should be (control, conditionals, order etc.).

If you only do something very rarely anyway, spending time to automate it won’t have a great ROI. But for things you do moderately often that take a minute or even just a few seconds, you can afford to spend a surprisingly large amount of time optimising them and still get a big pay-off over a time frame measured in years.<p>I view time spent learning to use my tools efficiently and automating common tasks as a sound investment. Editors are a great example. Sure, I <i>could</i> fire up any of the usual suspects and write code somewhat productively. But in my fully customised editor of choice, I can insert and adapt common code patterns that would take me 10–30 seconds to type out fully in mere moments using templates and macros. I can jump to any position visible on-screen with around three keystrokes. I can see syntax highlighting for various file types that I use all the time, including some unusual ones that don’t have definitions readily available, and warnings for several different programming languages in real time as I work.<p>These save me a few seconds every time I use them, but how many times is that every day? The effort to set them up has probably repaid itself 100x over by now! And the lack of latency is also a qualitative improvement since it means once I’m ready to start writing, I can do so roughly as fast as I can think, instead of constantly being held back and interrupted for a moment.<p>¹ <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1205&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1205&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="40832117" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40832117" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tdumitrescu</span><span>|</span><a href="#40830077">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40831210">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40833751">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40832117">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40832117">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; If you only do something very rarely anyway, spending time to automate it won’t have a great ROI<p>For code-editing, maybe.

&gt; doctors hurt people for years while learning to save them<p>It&#x27;s then a separate reply from someone else about deaths from errors&#x2F;malpractice.<p>So, nobody seems to be expressing the mentality you are, correctly, lambasting (at least so far as I&#x27;ve read in the comments). But, as it is relevant to the lessons we&#x27;d all want to pass back to ourselves (in my opinion, it&#x27;s because we wish to hold ourselves accountable to said lessons for the future), let&#x27;s address the elephant in the comment.<p>Normalising deaths, especially the preventable ones, is absolutely not something that anybody here is suggesting (so far as my read of the situation is).<p>Normalising responsibility, by recognising that we can cause harm and so <i>do</i> something about it, that seems far more in-line with the above comments.<p>As you say it yourself, there&#x27;s a time and a place, which is undoubtedly what we hope to foster for those who are younger or at the start of learning any discipline, beyond programming, medicine, or engineering.<p>Nobody is saying that the death and loss is acceptable and normalised, but rather that in the real world we need a certain presence around the knowledge that they will occur, to a certain degree, regardless. So, we accept responsibility for what we can prevent, and strive to push the frontier of our capacity further with this in mind. For some, that comes from experience, unfortunately. For others, they can start to grapple with the notion in lieu of it through considering the consequences, and the scale of consequence; as the above comments would be evidence of, at least by implication.<p>These are not the only ways to develop a mindset of responsibility, fortunately, but that is what they can be, even if you find the literal wording to suggest otherwise. I cannot, of course, attest to the &quot;true&quot; feelings of others, but neither can anyone else... But in the spirit of the matter, consider: Your sense of responsibility, in turn, seems receptive to finding the areas by which such thinking can become justification for the very thing it would otherwise prevent, either as a shield purpose-built for the role or co-opted out of convenience. That too becomes integral, as we will always need to avoid complacency, and so must also promote this vigilance to become a healthy part of the whole for a responsible mindset -- lest we become that which we seek to prevent, and all that.<p>Exactly as you say, there&#x27;s a greater problem, but this thinking is not necessarily justification for it, and can indeed become another tool to counter it. More responsibility, more mindfulness about our intents, actions, and consequences? That will prove indispensable for us to actually solve the greater problem, so we must appreciate that different paths will be needed to achieve it, after all, there are many different justifications for that problem which will all need to be robustly refuted and shown for what they are. Doing so won&#x27;t solve the problem, but is rather one of many steps we will need to take.<p>Regardless, this mindfulness and vigilance about ourselves, as much as about each other, will be self-promoting through the mutual reinforcement of these qualities. If someone must attempt to visualise the staggering scale of consequence as part of developing this, then so be it. In turn, they will eventually grapple with this vigilance as well, as the responsibility behoves them to, else they may end up taking actions and having consequences that are equivalent to the exact mentality you fear, even if they do&#x2F;did not actually &quot;intend&quot; to do so. The learning never ends, and the mistakes never will, so we must have awareness of the totality of this truth; even if only as best we can manage within our limited abilities.</div><br/><div id="40834534" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40834534" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">goosejuice</span><span>|</span><a href="#40829866">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40831374">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40834996">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40834534">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40834534">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; A recent Johns Hopkins study claims more than 250,000 people in the U.S. die every year from medical errors.

There&#x27;s no problem with that, I&#x27;d just wish it was labelled &quot;software engineering advice&quot; or &quot;advice for programmers&quot;. Few of the points are about programming itself and the list is overall pretty good.<p>Consider this just a rant from an older programmer who hasn&#x27;t fully recognized that &#x27;programming&#x27; is now largely a social endeavor with online info for everything, language and library ecosystems, etc. I wonder how much of this information I would have internalized if it were all available in my time. Seems like the kind of thing I might read and nod in agreement and forget to apply when relevant without some hard earned run-ins (which is how I&#x27;d picked them up).<p>As for actual programming advice, the thing I&#x27;d highlight is to look at the <i>data</i> first and foremost. It goes from initial conditions to post conditions. The differences are what your program&#x2F;function does, but both the pre&#x2F;post conditions should be able to be fully described as a valid static state. Once you understand that, the problem, the <i>code</i> is largely plumbing with a small part that applies the functional transformation. There&#x27;s so much focus on the form and style of &quot;the code&quot; that seems to consider it the main thing rather than an artifact of getting the main thing done: think any time there seems to be fancy abstractions that don&#x27;t provide value to offset its complexity. To relate it to a point in the post, if you can&#x27;t connect the difficulty you&#x27;re having with the logical transformation that needs to be done (e.g. from database state to state), it&#x27;s likely self-inflicted (or it could be due to a poor choice of database schema).

Hence developers tend to work close to the limit of what they can handle in terms of complexity, which for anyone who hasn’t all the same context in their head (like the developers themselves some time later) is really more than they can handle in an effective manner.<p>From another perspective, this is a form of entropy: There are many more ways to increase complexity than to reduce it.

  * When you log in
    Difference between login and interactive shells
    System shell files vs user shell files
    .zshenv for environment variables like PATH, EDITOR, and PAGER
    .zprofile for login shells, we don&#x27;t use it
    .zshrc for interactive shells
    Your login files are scripts, and can have anything in them

  * Moving Around

  ** Where am I?
    pwd = &quot;print working directory&quot;
    stored in variable $PWD
    Confusingly, also called current working directory, so you may see CWD or cwd mentioned

  ** What is here?
    ls
    ls -al
    ls -alt
    . prefix to filenames makes them hidden
    . is also the current directory!
    .. means the parent directory

  ** Finding my way around
    cd
    cd -
    dirs | sed -e $&#x27;s&#x2F; &#x2F;\\\n&#x2F;g&#x27;

  ** Getting Help From The Man
    man 1 zshbuiltins
    manpage sections

  ** PATH
    echo $PATH | sed -e $&#x27;s&#x2F;:&#x2F;\\\n&#x2F;g&#x27;
    zshenv PATH setting

  ** Environment Variables
    env | sort
    EDITOR variable

  ** History
    ctrl-r vs up arrow

  ** Permissions
    Making something executable

  ** Prompts
    zsh promptinit
    zsh prompt -l

  ** Pipes
    Iterate to show how pipes work
    cat ~&#x2F;.zshrc | grep PATH

  ** Commands

  *** BSD vs GNU commands
    BSD are supplied by Apple, and Apple often uses old versions

They care about UX of your product.<p>- Fix small usability issues as soon as you notice them, since these issues are usually the most annoying for end users.<p>- Do not start writing code with some popular design patterns.

Few zombie stories are about the zombies themselves. The original author almost hits the nail on the head - the &quot;Elite panic&quot; stuff is a closer understanding of what these stories are about.<p>It&#x27;s... Almost an accurate description of a zombie story. The goal of a zombie story is usually to just say &quot;Yeah, look at us humans. Even when the world falls apart around us, we&#x27;d rather still hurt and murder each other for selfish gain rather than surviving and sticking together.&quot; Which is an assumption that has been challenged very often, especially on the scale of humans that most zombie stories operate on (usually no larger than 4 or 5 families that the cast interacts with.)<p>It&#x27;s also to the point where it becomes very predictable when a group that seemingly breaks the mold shows up, just to show they&#x27;re much more morally evil than it first seems. Group is well off during the apocalypse -&gt; they&#x27;re cannibals. Odd friendly loner -&gt; he&#x27;s keeping a zombie (usually a loved one) in his basement and wants to feed the main characters to it. Safe bastion with surviving humans -&gt; someone offs themselves and it falls apart infighting because of the added zombie. Every &quot;good&quot; group must be punished because it&#x27;d defy the logic of the genre.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t really believe much of what zombie stories have to say is accurate - reality has shown us that when humans are put through events where the majority of other humans around them aren&#x27;t available (ie. Natural disasters), that we tend to stick together and survive together.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37206726" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37206726" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SideburnsOfDoom</span><span>|</span><a href="#37206030">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37206293">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37205927">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37206726">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37206726">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s possible that he&#x27;s speaking less about &quot;Night of the Living Dead (1968)&quot; as an early zombie film, and more about &quot;White Zombie (1932)&quot; as an influence on later films, as it earlier and more clearly on topic: Set on a sugar cane plantation on Haiti, with voodoo, etc. As the title suggests, the shock is not just that there&#x27;s a zombie, but that ... this time, she&#x27;s White!</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37205927" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37205927" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pavlov</span><span>|</span><a href="#37206030">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37206447">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37205927">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37205927">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; “Note that I&#x27;m allergic to kitsch Americana, especially Westerns, am a singularity skeptic and atheist in real life, expect FTL travel and&#x2F;or time travel to prove impossible, ditto mind uploading and &quot;true&quot; general artificial intelligence, and strongly suspect the answer to the Fermi paradox is that our kind of tool-using intelligent life is vanishingly rare in the cosmos.

We&#x27;ve been working for a year, and large chunks of the system are done. One (fairly major) part is yet to be completed.<p>Management doesn&#x27;t understand the process, or have confidence that the project will ultimately be successful. I don&#x27;t blame them for being skittish, software projects (especially conversions) have a long history of failure.<p>We had weekly meetings with them on progress - which are now twice-weekly (because that will speed things up.) Mostly they don&#x27;t attend directly, a middle manager acts as a go-between.<p>The developer view is that of course this will work (personally I&#x27;ve never been in doubt on that front) but the time-scale is uncertain because the system is large and old. But we&#x27;re talking months left, not years. Yes, I&#x27;m aware of the 80&#x2F;20 principle, but we&#x27;re well into the 20% already.<p>Of course to management it&#x27;s a binary state, done or not-done. It&#x27;s hard for them to guage progress. There&#x27;s no &quot;trust&quot; in what we say.<p>Which makes sense to me. We might have done 0 work for a year. If all we did was the meetings -they wouldn&#x27;t know-.
(Its a fixed price job, so it doesn&#x27;t make sense for us to drag it out.)<p>Of course the risk is all on them. They&#x27;ve spent a bunch of money and are nervous. They made (good) tech decisions (based on the advice of outside people who understand the tech) but they feel very uncertain. Ultimately if the project fails they&#x27;ll take a hit (not so much us.)<p>There&#x27;s no easy fix here - you can&#x27;t just argue that managers should be technical (the tech is not their core business), and more &quot;consultants&quot; won&#x27;t make them feel warm and fuzzy.

When we&#x27;re pushed on providing speculate data (when will this be done?) we ecplain why that&#x27;s impossible for us to determine and suggest (to the middle manager) that he guesses instead. He tends to not push too hard there.<p>Part of building trust (at least as far as him) is in not making-stuff-up. We&#x27;re clear on what we do know, and clear on what we don&#x27;t know.<p>Obviously I don&#x27;t know yo what extent that is passed on upstream.

Everyone says everything is real to appeal to the CGI bad crowd. Media outlets hype the new practically shot movie. After a few weeks or months after the release, the VFX studios behind the movie show off their work.

Would it maybe look better if they did it practically? Possibly, but a lot of the revulsion to it is based on seeing real movies that looked really bad because they did CGI as a shortcut around shooting a movie in the city they say it&#x27;s set in, or clearly working around having an actor just shoot in an empty room and add other characters in later with no real interaction between them.<p>If you do something poorly, it reflects poorly on the results. If it becomes endemic to do something cheaply and poorly, people will think that method is indicative of cheapness and laziness. It doesn&#x27;t negate that it may be possible to do it well, but you can&#x27;t just chide everyone for seeing the trend and reacting to it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40305164" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40305164" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">move-on-by</span><span>|</span><a href="#40304617">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40306228">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40305164">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40305164">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would not want to work with anyone at either the Fortune 500 company or the vendor.

(For IBM iSeries folks, it was Turnover.) And we used it for everything. Java code included. In particular, we used it for database migration scripts. And you know how database migration goes. You keep adding files and you never remove any. And there gets to be quite a few very quickly at the beginning of a project. And the folks in charge of setting up the release management system for our database migration scripts did so in such a way that we had to list out each one individually. Every release, we had to type like 50 database migration script filenames one-by-one. With no tab completion. (Not to mention the Java .war files we were deploying as well.) And by &quot;release&quot;, I mean every release <i>to the dev environment.</i><p>(Now some of you who know of Turnover might know of a janky Eclipse fork that would let you create Turnover forms in a drag-and-drop way rather than through the green screen, but there were reasons we didn&#x27;t want to go that direction. Long story.)<p>As soon as I figured out how much of a PITA this would be every single day, I decided to do something about it. I wouldn&#x27;t ask for permission. I&#x27;d ask for forgiveness (if it came to that.) So I set about writing a way to automate this. That way involved running the dumb terminal emulator (the &quot;green screen&quot; app tn5250j) in Xvfb and simulating key strokes to it. God was it a nasty hack, but it worked reliably and God was less painful to deal with than what we had before.<p>Part of why I didn&#x27;t ask permission was because I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure I could make it work and I didn&#x27;t know if the boss would ok a project that <i>may</i> pay off given our tight deadlines. But once it <i>did</i> work, I didn&#x27;t keep it a secret and the boss praised me for it. Still don&#x27;t know he&#x27;d have let me undertake that project had I explained and asked permission ahead of time, but everything very much worked out with that project in the end.<p>Here&#x27;s to lying to your boss.

So it got outsourced.<p>The outsourcing company was a tiny local software house. They delivered on every single requirement in under 3 months. Despite my better judgement I was impressed.<p>Until we gave ot to an actual customer. After some back and forth with initial errors (relatable) it started running on a small portion of traffic.

We used the next month to productize it.<p>My initial.design was presenting user behavior as scenes, sort of like a comic book, instead of animating stuff to pretend it&#x27;s a video.

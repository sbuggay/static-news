Along with Hofstader, his ideas were foundational to hacker culture. What a time to go, where there has been a kind of cog.sci winter for the last 20 years, but the last year of LLMs has forced philosophy of mind back into the public consciousness. Though largely today under the guise of &quot;AI Safety&quot; and &quot;alignment,&quot; Dennet&#x27;s articulations form the tools we&#x27;re going to be using to reason about ethics as they relate to these things we think of as minds - and regarding how we relate to these things that increasingly resemble other minds. Without too much lionizing (even though he has, however, just died), it would be hard to say that new ideas in philosophy as a whole have had more impact in a lifetime or more than that.<p>A lot of very clever people disagreed strongly with him. However, since not one of them could deny they were shaped by the forces they opposed, those controversies became the shape of his own huge and formidable influence. I&#x27;m sure he would want to be remembered for something else, and I have the sense sentimentality was not his thing at all, but his popularization the term &quot;deepity,&quot; was in the character of many of his ideas, where once you had been exposed to one, it yielded a perspective you could afterwards not unsee.<p>I hope an afterlife may provide some of the surprise and delight he brought to so many in this one.</div><br/><div id="40091641" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40091641" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seydor</span><span>|</span><a href="#40089340">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40090445">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40091641">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40091641">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">AI safety is moralism of the boring kind, not even some new moral philosophy.

My understanding (informed by Onora O&#x27;neill, Dan Bonevac, and various Stanford Encyclopedia entries :-)) is that Kant does not specifically depend on Newtonian assumptions but that human perceptions <i>have to be mediated</i> by time and space. Instead of overturning Kant, relativity and QM put <i>even more distance</i> between what we, as mortal, physical beings, can perceive versus whatever is really going on in the world.<p>Kant&#x27;s project was to discover, given all of that, what anyone can say about things like ethics.

You are exactly right about the way Kant uses that in his argument. It&#x27;s flexible enough that it can be understood as resilient, I think.<p>I tried show how science can nevertheless speak to it in several ways. One is the convenient equivalence between Kant&#x27;s necessary conditions and nature as we understood it at the time. That equivalence makes it easier to be comfortable positing time and space <i>as we understand them</i> as necessary conditions that are prior to nature. It would be harder (but not impossible!) to entertain if there was daylight between what we believed our faculties to be and what we believed the natural world to be, if what was &quot;necessary&quot; was something different than what we thought we experienced (such as, say, a singular loaf of unified spacetime). An implication of Kant&#x27;s view, as I understood him, was that we should be ready to believe it&#x27;s different anyway, but nevertheless, it&#x27;s easier to swallow when it perfectly aligns with how we thing the world really is.<p>Second, for a different way of stating a similar point, if time and space are non-newtonian in some important way, we may have to understand that <i>that</i> is what we experience in the first instance, and we would have to wrestle with the fact that our intuitions may attest to a variety of possible underlying necessary conditions. (Wittgenstein has been mentioned in this thread, so for a paraphrase of something he supposedly  said, in reply to a student noting that it looks like the sun goes around the earth: &quot;What would it look like if the earth went around the sun?&quot; So it may be with the nature of our faculties.)<p>Third, as we gain deeper understanding of brain functions of ourselves and other creatures, we may have inroads to how certain of our conscious experiences depend on conceptual abstractions or models. And if so, it transforms it into an open empirical question rather than one where we are simply stuck presuming necessary conditions. Kant might insist that that is all already through the lense of our faculties such as they are, but we, with more information, would be increasingly comfortable just not entertaining them as we get increasingly robust empirical understandings of conscious experience.<p>None of these is a &quot;defeater&quot; argument by itself and there&#x27;s a lot that can be talked about here of course, but I think given 21st century science, if Kant were trying to present his vision for the first time we might find it more challenging to reconcile with what we know of the natural world.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40091656" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40091656" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dontupvoteme</span><span>|</span><a href="#40088614">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40090432">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40091081">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40090832">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40091656">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40091656">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Relativity overturned those Newtonian assumptions<p>Only in *very* specific situations which are extremely extremely extremely unrelated and WELL out of both practical and theoretical bound to the human perception of reality.<p>Relativity is kind of the trivia of physics, it really has not informed much technology apart from a few things in space - compare this to, say, quantum electrodynamics which tells us why weird stuff happens in things we&#x27;ve made quadrillions of (not to mention quantum computing, etc.)<p>The only time we would have ever brushed up against it naturally <i>might</i> have been when we put clocks into space so that we could better send nukes into other parts of the globe.</div><br/><div id="40093930" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40093930" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vmladenov</span><span>|</span><a href="#40088614">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40091656">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40091822">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40093930">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40093930">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Relativity is kind of the trivia of physics, it really has not informed much technology apart from a few things in space<p>GPS is kind of a huge one, though it technically is just a few clocks in space.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40091822" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40091822" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xpe</span><span>|</span><a href="#40088614">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40091656">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40093930">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40090832">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40091822">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40091822">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Relativity did overturn the previous assumptions!

Just because someone had the idea first, doesn&#x27;t mean that work is the source of the idea going forward.<p>I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that Wittgenstein&#x27;s truth tables are those that guided the development of computer science.<p>&gt;In a manuscript of 1893, in the context of his study of the truth-functional analysis of propositions and proofs and his continuing efforts at defining and understanding the nature of logical inference, and against the background of his mathematical work in matrix theory in algebra, Charles Peirce presented a truth table which displayed in matrix form the definition of his most fundamental connective, that of illation, which is equivalent to the truth-functional definition of material implication. Peirceâs matrix is exactly equivalent to that for material implication discovered by Shosky that is attributable to Bertrand Russell and has been dated as originating in 1912. Thus, Peirceâs table of 1893 may be considered to be the earliest known instance of a truth table device in the familiar form which is attributable to an identifiable author, and antedates not only the tables of Post, Wittgenstein, and Åukasiewicz of 1920-22, but Russellâs table of 1912 and also Peirceâs previously identified tables for trivalent logic tracable to 1902.<p>PDF of Anellis&#x27;s paper: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;ftp&#x2F;arxiv&#x2F;papers&#x2F;1108&#x2F;1108.2429.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;ftp&#x2F;arxiv&#x2F;papers&#x2F;1108&#x2F;1108.2429.pdf</a><p>&gt;But even if that conclusion is challenged, it is now clear that Russell understood and used the truth-table technique and the truth-table device. By 1910, Russell had already demonstrated a well-documented understanding of the truth-table technique in his work on Principia Mathematica. Now, it would seem that by 1912, and surely by 1914, Russell understood, and used, the truth-table device. Of course, the combination of logical conception and logical engineering by Russell in his use of truth tables is the culmination of work by Boole and Frege, who were closely studied by Russell. Wittgenstein and Post still deserve recognition
for realizing the value and power of the truth-table device. But Russell also deserves some recognition on this topic, as part of this pantheon of
logicians.<p>&gt;In this paper I have shown that neither the truth-table technique nor the truth-table device was &quot;invented&quot; by Wittgenstein or Post in 1921-22. The truth-table technique may originally be a product of Philo&#x27;s mind, but it was clearly in use by Boole, Frege, and Whitehead and Russell. The truth-table device is found in use by Wittgenstein in 1912, perhaps with some collaboration from Russell. Russell used the truth-table technique at Harvard in 1914 and in London in 1918. So the truth-table technique and the truth-table device both predate the early 1920s.<p>PDF of Shosky&#x27;s relevant paper: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mulpress.mcmaster.ca&#x2F;russelljournal&#x2F;article&#x2F;download&#x2F;1912&#x2F;1938&#x2F;0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mulpress.mcmaster.ca&#x2F;russelljournal&#x2F;article&#x2F;download...</a></div><br/><div id="40092039" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40092039" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">GrumpySloth</span><span>|</span><a href="#40088614">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40091743">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40091531">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40092039">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40092039">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I suspected Frege, which is why I went looking for a source, but found Peirce instead.

Some of them are better models of the world than others, and so those are the ones that we tend to think of as &quot;the way&quot; of doing arithmetic.

I&#x27;ll take -4 for the team and ask the English language for its own interpretation [1]:<p>&quot;In the high-stakes world of technology, where the choice of a programming language can either pave the way to efficiency or lead you into the depths of debugging hell, imagine if programming languages were as enigmatic and complex as the philosophers of yore. Hereâs how I envision this quirky universe.<p>Plato: <i>HTML</i><p>Platoâs ideal forms find their match in HTML. Much like Platoâs theory, where objects in the physical realm are mere shadows of their perfect forms, HTML is but the scaffolding of web content, giving structure but relying on the more material CSS and JavaScript to breathe life into its skeletal outlines. HTML, the philosopher of the web, contemplates the essence of web structure in a cave of its own making, illuminated by the flickering screens of web developers trying to decode the shadows of their CSS frameworks.<p>Aristotle: <i>Python</i><p>Aristotle, known for his logic and systematic approach to the physical world, would be Python. Just as Aristotle classified flora and fauna, Python organizes data with lists, tuples, and dictionaries, making it ideal for developers who seek clarity and readability. Pythonâs philosophy is simple yet profound, mirroring Aristotleâs quest for understanding through empirical observation and not-so-metaphysical methods.<p>Descartes: <i>C++</i><p>&quot;I think, therefore I am,&quot; proclaimed Descartes, and so would any program written in C++. C++, with its complex syntax and powerful capabilities, reflects Descartesâ dualism. It can create almost metaphysical experiences in virtual realities but can also cause existential crises with its pointers and memory leaks, leading programmers to doubt everything, especially their choice of language.<p>Nietzsche: <i>Assembly</i><p>Nietzsche, the philosopher of power, will to manifest, and the Ã¼bermensch, resonates with Assembly language. Not for the faint-hearted, Assembly is for those who dare to manipulate the very fabric of hardware. Like Nietzscheâs writing, Assembly is tough to decipher, powerful in its capacity, and not commonly understood by the masses, often leaving one to ponder in solitude about the eternal recurrence of debugging sessions.<p>Kant: <i>Java</i><p>Kant, who was all about rules and categorical imperatives, fits perfectly with Java. Javaâs platform-independent mantraâwrite once, run anywhereâis a stern dictate akin to Kantâs moral imperatives. Both philosopher and language demand strict adherence to their defined structures and frameworks, leaving little room for moral or syntactic error.<p>Sartre: <i>JavaScript</i><p>Existentialist par excellence, Sartreâs notion of existence precedes essence is the lived reality of every JavaScript framework. Just when you think you understand the essence of the JavaScript ecosystem, a new library or framework pops into existence, challenging the very core of your understanding. Sartreâs philosophy of radical freedom and existential angst mirrors the liberty and chaos of JavaScriptâs untyped, loosely structured syntax.<p>Hegel: <i>Haskell</i><p>Hegelâs dialectical method moves through thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, much like how Haskell approaches problems with its pure functional programming paradigm. It encourages developers to think in terms of transformations of data, often leading to a synthesis of solutions that are as elegant as they are abstract, reflective of Hegelâs complex philosophical constructs.<p>In this whimsical world where philosophers are programming languages, choosing the right one could well depend on whether you prefer the existential dread of debugging Sartre&#x27;s JavaScript at 3 AM or contemplating the Platonic forms of your HTML content. In either case, the philosophical underpinnings of your chosen language might just lead to as many questions about the nature of reality as lines of code.&quot;<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;584f78d7-6a9e-438d-ab87-02cebdfc8b9b" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;584f78d7-6a9e-438d-ab87-02cebd...</a></div><br/><div id="40090197" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40090197" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sdwr</span><span>|</span><a href="#40088614">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40089595">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40092629">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40090197">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40090197">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sartre and Hegel are pretty solid, the rest feel tenuous at best</div><br/><div id="40090287" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40090287" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CamperBob2</span><span>|</span><a href="#40088614">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40090197">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40092629">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40090287">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40090287">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t know, pretty hard to argue with Nietzsche&#x27;s pairing with assembly.

My understanding is that his main goal at that time was to show that many of the classic problems of metaphysics which plagued philosophers for centuries or more are literally just nonsense. He didn&#x27;t write the Tractatus to convince regular people though, but to convince academic philosophers of his time. He earned his fame by being somewhat successful.

If anything his criticism of his own work was that it was excessively represented language as being the kind of language used by the natural sciences, which was a narrow slice of the full breadth of possible ways language can be used to convey meaning. The very thing that makes his career so fascinating is that he was purely an engineering bro, who cared more about math and logic, and he brought that perspective into philosophy, and challenged philosophy as being nonsense when measured against the standards of the hard sciences. That&#x27;s essentially what the Tractatus is, and also the reason why it was retrospectively regarded as dogmatic.<p>Shannon&#x27;s information theory is brilliant, but born out of an interest in formalisms related information transmission, and while it can be treated like it&#x27;s in conversation with theories of semantic meaning, I don&#x27;t think it was ever considered a specific repudiation of any particular approach. There was a whole century&#x27;s worth of &quot;ordinary language&quot; philosophy in the anglo world guilty of much graver offenses in regarding uncritical assumptions about ordinary language as some kind of conceptual or informational bedrock, and the ways you apply Shannon to any of that, while I think you can, are non-obvious.<p>&gt; And Wittgenstein actually had no excuse because Shannon published while Wittgenstein was still alive.<p>Tractatus came out something like 20 years before information theory, and by the time it was published he had already taken his late career &quot;turn&quot; to self criticism, but again, I don&#x27;t think anyone treated Shannon like it was any specific commentary on his philosophy, the topics are rather remote and while they can &quot;speak to&quot; one another in a sense, a lot depends on how you build out your conceptual bridge between the two topics.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40089878" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40089878" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wizzwizz4</span><span>|</span><a href="#40088614">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40089212">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40090144">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40089061">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40089878">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40089878">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Information-theoretical arguments are powerful, but they&#x27;re not the only worthwhile approaches.

Having multiple different routes to a given understanding is useful.<p>Wittgenstein was studying the <i>nature of language</i>, something closer to mathematics than to physics. And he came up with these ideas no later than 1933: Shannon only published his work on information theory in 1948.

I think the distinction is important, and relevant, and even critical. It is a distinction I will continue to make.<p>I put the concept of âphilosophical zombiesâ as quackery. At best, the p-zombie thought experiment shows that we havenât really come up with a definition of consciousness that explains what we want it to explain. Some people use p-zombies as part of a larger argument against physicalism. Chalmers published a modal logic argument against physicalism using p-zombies. One of the tricky things about modal logic is that it requires a deeper understanding of modal logic in order for you (you, someone reading a modal logic argument) to make good decisions about which propositions you are willing to accept in a modal logic argument. Since most people only have an intuitive understanding of modal logic, it is a good way to win an argument but a bad way to explain your position.<p>Iâd say that this work (p-zombies) is quackery in the sense that itâs consistently directed at something which I consider to be unproductive, which is the work of undermining or attacking physicalism &#x2F; physical monism. At some point, in these discussions, you end up having some argument about the semantics of ontology and how you define âexistenceâ. If your semantics for âexistenceâ admits non-physical things to exist (like, if youâre a Platonist), and youâre having a conversation with someone who believes in physicalism, then I donât think either person in the conversation is going to get much out of it, other than a better way to explain their own position.<p>Edit: I hope that paints a complete enough picture and covers the important parts of my complaints about p-zombies. I donât have my finger on the pulse of philosophy and I may be missing something important, maybe thereâs some really important argument p-zombies are used for, and maybe I donât understand Chalmers; thatâs always a risk. My main complaint here is that it seems to be some tool to make an argument against physicalism, but this tool doesnât help you understand physicalism, or help you understand its alternatives. Itâs just an argument that you can have between somebody who believes in physicalism and somebody who doesnât, where neither person will agree with the other one after hearing the argument.</div><br/><div id="40089362" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40089362" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">keiferski</span><span>|</span><a href="#40088614">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40089233">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40089973">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40089362">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40089362">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I can see how you would find that unproductive, but I don&#x27;t know if it really counts as quackery.<p><i>Quack: 1) A practitioner who suggests the use of substances or devices for the prevention or treatment of disease that are known to be ineffective.<p>2) A person who pretends to be able to diagnose or heal people, but is unqualified and incompetent.</i><p>The inside baseball term more relevant to what you&#x27;re talking about, I think, is &quot;talking past each other.&quot;

He says the same thing he says in one of his papers, I think it&#x27;s &quot;Real Patterns&quot;, which appeared in one of his later collections: Real consciousness <i>does</i> exist, but it is not like what many people think it is like. It does not have all of the properties that many people think it has. He <i>does</i> say that things with <i>those</i> properties don&#x27;t exist--because nothing with those properties can exist. But he does <i>not</i> say that consciousness does not exist--just that it doesn&#x27;t have those properties.<p><i>&gt; the apparent total denial of experience</i><p>He doesn&#x27;t say this either, although many of his opponents misdescribe him as saying that--because they cannot understand what he is actually saying. The only concept of consciousness they can grasp is the magical concept they have in their heads--I call it &quot;magical&quot; because it cannot exist if consciousness is a physical process working according to physical laws. And the latter kind of consciousness, the physicalist kind, is the kind Dennett describes and the kind he believed existed. So for opponents of his who can&#x27;t even grasp that there <i>is</i> such a concept of consciousness, the only way they could interpret what Dennett was saying was that he was denying that consciousness existed.<p>But that is a gross misrepresentation of his views: he was <i>not</i> saying that people don&#x27;t have experiences or thoughts. He was just saying that those real things, when you actually do the hard work of figuring out <i>how</i> they work in accordance with physical laws, turn out not to have some of the properties that people thought they had before that hard work was done.

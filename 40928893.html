Probably 5k lines of typescript at most.<p>2. Integration with the Typescript language server was just not as good as VSCode. I can&#x27;t pin down exactly what was wrong but the autocompletions in particular felt much worse. I&#x27;ve never worked on a language server or editor so I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s on zed&#x2F;VSCode and what&#x27;s on the TS language server.<p>Eventually all the little inconveniences wore on me and I switched back to VSCode.<p>I will probably try it again after a few more releases to see if it feels better.</div><br/><div id="40930865" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40930865" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">j1elo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40929204">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40929479">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40930865">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40930865">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m on the same camp, but in the end it turns out we were not putting it to the actual, real, hard-world test.<p>VSCode is very fast for me, <i>when I open it in the morning and just starting my day</i>.<p>But once I&#x27;ve opened the main project <i>and</i> 7 support library&#x27;s projects, <i>and</i> I&#x27;m in a video-call on Chrome sharing my screen (which is something that eats CPU for breakfast), <i>and</i> I&#x27;m live-debugging a difficult to reproduce scenario while changing code on the fly, <i>then</i> the test conditions are really set up where differences between slow&#x2F;heavy and fast&#x2F;lightweight software can be noticed.<p>Things like slowness in syntax highlighting, or jankyness when opening different files.

I frequently need to do that when e.g. reviewing different branches and, say, running some of the test suites or whatever — work where I want to leave the computer doing something in that branch, while I myself switch to reviewing or implementing some other feature.<p>When I start VS Code, it often re-opens all the windows, and it is slow as hell right away (on Linux 14900K + fast SSD + 64GB RAM, or on macOS on a Mac Studio M2 Ultra with 64GB RAM).<p>I&#x27;ll save a file and it will be like <i>jank...jank... File Save participants running</i> with a progress bar. (Which, tbh, is better than just being that slow without showing any indication of what it is doing, but still.)<p>I&#x27;ve tried to work with it using one window at a time, but in practice I found it is better for my needs to just quit and relaunch it a few times per day.<p>I try Zed (and Sublime, and lapce, and any other purportedly performant IDE or beefed-up editor that I read about on this website or similar) like every couple months.<p>But VS Code has a very, very large lead in features, especially if you are working with TypeScript.<p>The remote development features are extremely good; you can be working from one workstation doing all the actual work on remote Linux containers — builds and local servers, git, filesystem, shell. That also means you can sit down at some other machine and pick up right where you left off.<p>The TypeScript completion and project-wide checking is indeed way slower than we want it to be, but it&#x27;s also a lot better than any other editor I&#x27;ve seen (in terms of picking up the right completions, jumping to definition, suggesting automatic imports, and flagging errors). It works in monorepos containing many different projects, without explicit config.<p>And then there&#x27;s the extensions. I don&#x27;t use many (because I suspect they make it even slower). But the few I do use I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without (e.g. Deno, Astro, dprint). Whatever <i>your</i> sweet set is, the odds are they&#x27;ll have a VS Code extension, but maybe not the less popular editors.<p>So there is this huge gravity pulling me back to VS Code. It is slow. It is, in fact, hella fucking slow. Like 100x slower than you want, at many basic day-to-day things.<p>But for me so far just buying the absolute fastest machine I can is still the pragmatic thing to do. I want Zed to succeed, I want lapce to succeed, I want to use a faster editor and still do all these same things — but not only have I failed so far to find a replacement that does all the stuff I need to have done, it also seems to me that VS Code&#x27;s pace of development is pretty amazing, and it is advancing at a faster clip than any of these others.<p>So while it may be gated in some fundamental way on the performance problem, because of its app architecture, on balance the gap between VS Code and its competitors seems to be widening, not shrinking.</div><br/><div id="40934648" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40934648" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Fluorescence</span><span>|</span><a href="#40929204">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40933311">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40929479">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40934648">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40934648">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Vscode is very snappy for me on less powerful machine Ryzen 3900 (Ubuntu, X-windows).

If not so deep in thought to almost be blind, I am reading other docs &#x2F; code as I type. I am not an ultra fast typist but if I mistype, I can feel it and don&#x27;t need the visual feedback to know it. I might be this way because I am old and have used tools with lag you measure in seconds.<p>I only care about latency if it interrupts me and I have to wait and that&#x27;s typically not typing but heavier operations. I am utterly intolerant to animations. I don&#x27;t want less I want zero, instant action. I don&#x27;t want janky ass &quot;smooth scrolling&quot; I want crisp instant scrolling. I have no idea why animations are even popular.<p>Some of the text-editor latency discussion reminds me of high screen refresh rates for office work. When people &quot;check the refresh rate&quot; they have to do that violent wiggling of window to actually have large content moving faster enough to see a difference. You have to look for it to then get upset about it.<p>The worse case would be if it&#x27;s more of an illusion like fancy wines - a fiction driven by context. Lie to someone that an editor is an electron app and they will complain about the latency. Software judgement also has toxic fashion and tribal aspects. Something unfashionable will accrue unjustified complaints and something cool or &quot;on your team&quot; will be defended from them.

For example, ctrl-click (or jump to usages) on a definition that is used in multiple places opens up a new tab with a list of the results. In most other editors I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s instead opened up a popover menu where I can quickly select which really I want to jump to.

If I&#x27;m pairing with someone remotely, I don&#x27;t have any issue having them download VS Code. We provide a config in our project repo for VS Code, so it&#x27;s really quick for people to get set up enough to join the real-time collab session with me. `brew install visual-studio-code` and then `code .` in our repo, plus OAuth with Github to authenticate the collaboration feature.<p>I think it really is great. Makes pairing much easier, and really speeds up drugery like refactoring 500 cases where it doesn&#x27;t quite make sense to do a codemod. It&#x27;s not quite like the upgrade from Word97.exe to Google Docs since we have git, but it feels similarly amazing to &quot;just&quot; to be talking about some code, click the other user&#x27;s icon to jump right to their cursor and help them get unstuck.<p>I personally bounce between VS Code, Xcode, and nvim+tmux, and I don&#x27;t have a problem with keeping a &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; editor around for collaboration or pairing.

It doesn&#x27;t work <i>at all</i> on NixOS, so it&#x27;s just wasting its time and our bandwidth constantly downloading and trying to update binaries that will never run.<p>The thing is, I would just disable it, but you can&#x27;t, as far as I can tell. There&#x27;s this somewhat angry issue about it here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zed-industries&#x2F;zed&#x2F;issues&#x2F;12589">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zed-industries&#x2F;zed&#x2F;issues&#x2F;12589</a><p>They might have a point but beyond whether or not they have a point regarding the fact that it automatically fetches binaries from the Internet, not having an option to disable it is just cruel.<p>I still like Zed a lot and I also have a big appreciation for the design of GPUI, which I think is a very well-designed UI library that puts focus on the important things.

What you need to ensure is that you have a desktop portal provider set up that provides org.freedesktop.impl.portal.FileChooser. What&#x27;s kind of neat about the way xdg-desktop-portals is architected, you can pick and choose different implementations for different services. This is especially useful outside of desktop environments where you might need to use e.g. the wlr provider for screenshots and screen capture, but you still want e.g. KDE file dialogs.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that the documentation for XDG desktop portals (and generally, setting up a complete desktop setup when using compositors like labwc or Sway) is relatively poorly documented.

This does make some sense, especially considering that, for better or worse, using a web browser engine as a UI has become increasingly popular of a decision. However, in the end this leads to almost all new &quot;greenfield&quot; UI projects trying to develop scalable vector UI rendering engines that need advanced and highly optimized vector rendering libraries like Skia and Pathfinder. Having everything in vector all the way through is elegant, but it&#x27;s complicated.<p>The insight with GPUI is that it&#x27;s not really necessary to be that general, the vast majority of UIs are made up of a relatively small number of different primitives that you can build on to basically do anything. So instead the vast majority of what&#x27;s going on in GPUI is layers of roundrects. Text rendering is the classic approach of rendering into glyph atlases. I think this is a vastly more sustainable model for a UI library.<p>I don&#x27;t know if GPUI is ready to be used on its own, but it does have a spiffy if brief website.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gpui.rs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gpui.rs&#x2F;</a><p>Given that Zed actually has good &quot;UI-feel&quot;, it tells me they are focused on the right things. A lot of new greenfield UI frameworks are spending a ton of time on trying to build extremely generic vector graphics systems but the actual widgets feel bad and are missing all kinds of tweaks and nuance. Here&#x27;s a good litmus test for text editors: what happens if you double click and drag? In most good UI frameworks, this should result in word selection and then expanding that selection left or right. In a lot of smaller greenfield UI libraries, something vastly less useful will happen :(</div><br/><div id="40932938" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40932938" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">iamnbutler</span><span>|</span><a href="#40929528">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40929630">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40932911">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40932938">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40932938">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Lots of the app’s UI right now is a layer of components on top of gpui (check out the ui crate!) that are pretty Zed-specific at the moment.<p>Some of these things will likely be made more general and have dedicated gpui elements built for them (button, input…)<p>I think not rushing to cover everything right out the gates is giving us the time to feel out apis that feel good to write and work well for us.

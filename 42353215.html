It&#x27;d have to stop being used for the original function.<p>This is demonstrably wrong, as we have many examples of old buildings and we know what people actually feel about them.<p>Consider two very famous examples of buildings that completely changed their purpose, but are still the same building: the Pantheon and the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. The Pantheon was a Roman temple to all of the Gods when it was built in 126, and  became a Christian church ~400 years later, but everyone recognizes it as the same building. The Hagia Sophia was a Christian church built in 537, and 1100 years later became an Islamic mosque, but it is still the same building to everyone.<p>Then for the opposite example: St Peter&#x27;s Basillica at the Vatican. This was built in 1506 on the site of a much older church, also called St Peter&#x27;s Basillica (commissioned by emperor Constantine), which also served as a Christian church, was also used the parish of the Pope, was also the location of papal coronation and so on. And still, no one would say &quot;St Peter&#x27;s Basilica was built by Saint Constantine&quot;, because the current basilica is universally recognized as a new building, despite serving the same function.<p>A building is recognized for the beauty and specifics of its structural and painterly elements, not for its role. If it is destroyed and rebuilt in almost the same size and shape, then it is recognized as the same building; regardless of entirely changing its purpose.<p>Conversely, if a building is rebuilt into a completely different shape, even a universally admired as beautiful one, it is considered a different building, even if keeps serving the same purpose.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42354928" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42354928" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">akerl_</span><span>|</span><a href="#42354179">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42354811">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42355608">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42354635">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42354928">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42354928">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The entire thing can be rebuilt and it will still be the real Notre Dame de Paris<p>This statement is kindof the whole point of the &quot;ship of Theseus&quot; thought experiment.</div><br/><div id="42355159" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42355159" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Sebb767</span><span>|</span><a href="#42354179">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42354928">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42355356">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42355159">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42355159">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A more favorable interpretation would be that the church consists of more than just its worldly parts; its place and use are also part of its identity.

    At the end of summer 2019, Notre-Dame Lead reported levels of up to 123,000 μg&#x2F;m², which represented 25 times the &quot;standard&quot; threshold of 5,000 µg&#x2F;m² set by the regional health authority ARS, at the Place Saint-Michel, a 10-minute walk from the cathedral. “Yet no significant clean-up operation was carried out. It was as if the problem didn’t exist,” Toullier lamented. 

    “But what about run-off water from the roof, which will be laden with lead?” asked Thébaud-Mony. In a notice published in January 2021, the French High Council for Public Health estimated that “the roof of Notre-Dame alone … would emit around 21kg of lead per year (about two tonnes per century) in run-off water”.

    “Lead could have been replaced by another substance like zinc or copper,” said Thébaud-Mony. “When alternatives exist, why choose lead and risk human health?” This was the case for the Chartres cathedral, destroyed by a fire in 1836. The original structure had lead roofing, which was replaced by copper when it was rebuilt. Though perceived as less stable, copper is significantly less toxic.</code></pre></div><br/><div id="42355470" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42355470" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lostlogin</span><span>|</span><a href="#42354880">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42354983">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42354956">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42355470">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42355470">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Though perceived as less stable, copper is significantly less toxic.<p>If have thought the reduced weight quite a bonus too.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42354956" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42354956" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">canucker2016</span><span>|</span><a href="#42354880">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42354931">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42354487">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42354956">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42354956">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aleteia.org&#x2F;2024&#x2F;11&#x2F;04&#x2F;how-does-notre-dame-of-paris-intend-to-avoid-another-fire" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aleteia.org&#x2F;2024&#x2F;11&#x2F;04&#x2F;how-does-notre-dame-of-paris-...</a><p><pre><code>    In more detail, Notre Dame&#x27;s new fire protection system rests on five pillars.

    The first is surveillance. “In addition to thermal cameras, an air suction and analysis system will be in constant operation,” explains the public institution in charge of restoring Notre Dame of Paris. “Any outbreak of fire detected by at least two pipes will automatically trigger the misting system.”

    The system will release a mist consisting of fine droplets of water diffused into the wooden framework, which, if necessary, will considerably reduce the temperature in the space and smother the incipient fire.

    The third pillar is the thickening of the batten: the thin planks of wood that separate the trusses from the lead roofing. “One millimeter thick has a fire resistance of one minute: We added 15mm [0.6”, editor’s note], giving the fire a quarter of an hour less chance of spreading to the roof,” explains the company.

    Fire-stop trusses have been installed to separate the spire from the choir on one side and the nave on the other. They divide the space in three, preventing or delaying the spread of fire from one to the other.

    Finally, the entire network of dry columns has been redesigned to facilitate firefighting operations. The flow of water that can be mobilized has been multiplied by three to reach up to 600m3 (264 gallons) of water per hour.</code></pre></div><br/><div id="42355465" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42355465" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aeronaut80</span><span>|</span><a href="#42354880">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42354956">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42354487">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42355465">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42355465">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">600m3 is 132,000 imperial gallons.

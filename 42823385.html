Read [1] People who deal with intel data need to work with possibly wrong info. Most spy novels don&#x27;t get this. Real military planning works more like: &quot;Intel says the enemy is at A or B, most likely at A. How much resources should we devote to A vs B, or hold in reserve until we find out by encountering the enemy? What&#x27;s our plan if we guess wrong?&quot; Planning has to assume that intel might be wrong.<p>Go watch &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (WWII). Read the story of the Son Tay raid (Vietnam). The many overestimates of Soviet capability during the Cold War. The underestimates of North Korean missile capability. Sometimes uncertain intel really works, as with the attack on the bin Laden compound in Pakistan.<p>Retrospective intel questions may never be answered. It&#x27;s known that the US atomic bomb program had another Russian spy who is mentioned by code name in VENONA transcripts, but that spy was never identified. There are still arguments over whether the explosion of the Maine in Havana harbor in 1889 was an accident or a hostile act. It&#x27;s still not clear why Turret 2 of the USS Iowa blew up in 1989. Huge amounts of effort were expended on all three of those questions, all of which were important at the time, and yet they remain unsettled.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cia.gov&#x2F;resources&#x2F;csi&#x2F;static&#x2F;Article-Principles-of-Intelligence-Analysis-Studies65-4-Dec2021.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cia.gov&#x2F;resources&#x2F;csi&#x2F;static&#x2F;Article-Principles-...</a></div><br/><div id="42828643" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42828643" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">choppaface</span><span>|</span><a href="#42825046">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42828158">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42825569">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42828643">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42828643">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It’s also important to weight dramatic changes in the White House this week, too, right?

Either the range of the bats carrying these coronaviruses is much larger than anyone in the world (including Dr Shi) knows about, or else the &quot;blast radius&quot; of the animal trade in China is considerably larger than anyone knows about.</div><br/><div id="42828272" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42828272" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tripletao</span><span>|</span><a href="#42825046">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42827981">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42826829">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42828272">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42828272">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the usual theory for SARS-1 is spillover from bats to other non-human animals outside Guangzhou.

And it has been shown to be a highly virulent numerous times in many different forms. No matter how low the chances of winning the lottery, when literally billions of people are playing it daily, it is only of matter of when, not if, it turns into something more dangerous.<p>Now none of that comes anywhere near proving anything, but the fact that we have had multiple coronavirus infections in the past, many of which have come dangerously close to pandemic level infections, makes a natural occurrence seem the most likely source.<p>On top of all that, even if it did come from a lab, why does that matter? A handful of extra lottery tickets were sold and someone won from that pool. This isn&#x27;t some bioweapon modified virus purposefully bred from a farm of human subjects, you would never be able to get away with such a program in a large publicly known virology lab and we aren&#x27;t knowledgeable enough in viral genetics to make something like that without testing it on farms of people. There are no markers indicating engineering it in any way that we are actually capable of. And worst case it is something a mere handful of unguided generations away from a sample that was pulled from the public already and the lab got &quot;lucky&quot; with a random mutation on a petri dish they were studying.</div><br/><div id="42826908" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42826908" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Enginerrrd</span><span>|</span><a href="#42825046">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42826829">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42827338">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42826908">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42826908">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re not saying it, but you&#x27;re obviously starting with a very different bayseian prior than my 50&#x2F;50.<p>As someone that makes forecasts for a living, I&#x27;d like to see what you&#x27;re assumptions are about the base rates there.<p>As for how the facts produce modifications to the base rate, personally I think that a virus identified in a cave over a thousand miles away popping up in a very urban area right next to a BSL facility that specializes in researching that type of virus moves the needle toward it being more likely a lab escape.  You seem to feel otherwise and I don&#x27;t really agree.  In particular, if you take the converse: suppose the virus wasn&#x27;t known at all to man, you&#x27;d probably argue it also pushes you toward the conclusion that it was a natural spillover.  (In which case, I&#x27;d be in agreement.)  So I don&#x27;t think that argument is really a logical one.<p>Your objection in the last paragraph, describing this as a &quot;bioweapon modified virus&quot; is really a classic strawman, and since it isn&#x27;t the argument I was making I see no reason to indulge it.  It is indeed a relatively ridiculous notion.<p>Also, just for precision, my own assessment of the truth value there is about 70% in favor of a lab-leak.</div><br/><div id="42827626" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42827626" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AngryData</span><span>|</span><a href="#42825046">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42826908">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42827338">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42827626">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42827626">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Its origin is at a huge meat market full of both hunted and farmed produce and animals both live and dead from all over the country and attended by thousands of people daily.

(Granted, the arc began long before 2019 with a through-line of research going back to the 2002 SARS outbreak.) And it&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve many other advancements. Creation of CRISPR and related technology emerged in part out of gain of function research with viruses. Gain of function is a critical tool in testing hypotheses about how foundational molecular machinery works, and viruses are a convenient research model for exploring and testing ideas in that space.<p>But I&#x27;m not sure the origin should matter to that debate. And I&#x27;m even more sure it probably won&#x27;t matter, even if we agreed on a definitive answer.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42826617" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42826617" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rayiner</span><span>|</span><a href="#42825046">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42826449">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42826598">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42827179">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42826617">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42826617">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Whenever you have an institutional failure, you need to do a root cause analysis to fix the problem.

For example, Sen. Tom Cotton is quoted as saying:<p>&gt; “Now the most important thing is to make China pay for unleashing a plague on the world,” Mr. Cotton said.<p>That could backfire in a couple ways.<p>1. China could say that they&#x27;ll consider paying for COVID escaping their borders if the US pays for the damage the things that have escaped its borders have caused, such as greenhouse gases.<p>Yes, I know that China currently is emitting more greenhouse gases than the US, but since CO2 emissions stay in the atmosphere for several hundred or even thousands of years the US is responsible for more of the CO2 currently in the atmosphere than China is.<p>It&#x27;s 26% US, 16% China, 7% Russia, 6% Germany, 5% UK, 4% Japan, 4% India, 2% France, 2% Canada, 2% Ukraine, 2% Poland, rounded to the nearest 1%. All the rest of the countries round to 1% or 0%.<p>That&#x27;s a can of worms I don&#x27;t think the US wants to open.<p>2. China could say they they&#x27;ll consider paying, but only up to the amount of damages that would have been reasonably incurred if the US had handled COVID competently.<p>There were several distinct patterns in COVID deaths in the US. First, there were states like Washington that had a fairly linear growth in the cumulative number of deaths per capita from the start through April 2022, and then after that continued with a linear growth but not as steep.<p>Then there were states like New York, which got hit very hard in the first two months, because of a combination of nobody really knowing yet how to treat it and dense populations of especially vulnerable people. New York reached in two months a deaths per capita number that Washington took 22 months to reach.<p>But after those first two months, New York&#x27;s deaths grew at about the same rate as Washington&#x27;s, except during the Delta surge and to a lesser extent the Omicron surge. Washington&#x27;s rate picked up during those surges, but not very much.<p>There were states like Florida. Its curve was like Washington&#x27;s first 3 months, the switched to growing about twice as fast. By the end of 2021 it had almost caught up to New York. From then it and New York both continued at about the same rate was Washington, with Florida slightly higher so it passed New York in August 2022.<p>Other states tended to be a mix of those three patterns. California was close to Washington up until Delta, which brought it to near Florida, but then after Delta was was similar to Washington. A little better actually. Right after Delta it had about 70 more deaths per 100k than Washington, but by March 2023 was down to 56 more deaths per 100k.<p>Texas was like Florida until Omicron, which it handled better, and after that it was similar to Washington, or even a little better. It had 140 more deaths per 100k than Washington right after Omicron, but only 115 more by March 2023.<p>By March 2023, which is when the data I&#x27;m using ends, Washington stood at 206 deaths per 100k population, California at 256, Texas at 322, New York at 396, and Florida at 404.<p>Tom Cotton&#x27;s state, Arkansas, was basically the same pattern as Florida, except with a higher rate. It ended up at 431 deaths per 100k by March 2023.<p>A good case can probably be made that somewhere from 25% to 50% of the Florida deaths were due to Florida&#x27;s lax handling of the pandemic.<p>That too is probably a can of worms many politicians would not want to open, especially if their state is one of the ones that China would be arguing should get greatly reduced damages.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42826907" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42826907" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tootie</span><span>|</span><a href="#42825046">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42826603">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42827807">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42826907">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42826907">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s also pretty clear in the article that the newly appointed head of the CIA is very politically motivated to endorse this conclusion.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42827807" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42827807" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">miguelazo</span><span>|</span><a href="#42825046">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42826907">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42825904">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42827807">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42827807">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What’s most disturbing and highly irresponsible about comments like that and all of the reporting on this development is that there’s almost zero acknowledgement that the lab in question was being funded by the US government and much of the Gain of Function research was being directed by a US nonprofit with ties to the US government.</div><br/><div id="42828489" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42828489" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">macns</span><span>|</span><a href="#42825046">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42827807">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42828001">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42828489">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42828489">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sources for this?

The paper, published in Nature Medicine on March 17, 2020, was titled “The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2” and played a leading role in creating a public impression of a scientific consensus that the virus had emerged naturally in a Chinese “wet market.”
The paper was the subject of a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, which coincided with the release of a report by the subcommittee devoted to the “Proximal Origin” paper. It contains limited screenshots of emails and Slack messages among the authors, laying out its case that the scientists believed one thing in private — that lab escape was likely — while working to produce a paper saying the opposite in public.<p>The newly exposed documents include full emails and pages of Slack chats that were cropped for the report, exposing the “Proximal Origin” authors’ real-time thinking. According to the metadata in the PDF of the report, it was created using “Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word,” indicating that the report was originally drafted as a Word document. Word, however, retains the original image when an image is cropped, as do many other apps. Microsoft’s documentation cautions that “Cropped parts of the picture are not removed from the file, and can potentially be seen by others,” going on to note: “If there is sensitive information in the area you’re cropping out make sure you delete the cropped areas.”<p>When this Word document was converted to a PDF, the original, uncropped images were likewise carried over. The Intercept was able to extract the original, complete images from the PDF using freely available tools, following the work of a Twitter sleuth.</div><br/><div id="42827262" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42827262" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zmgsabst</span><span>|</span><a href="#42826893">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42827226">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42827259">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42827262">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42827262">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I phrased that poorly:<p>I understand how WIV could have <i>caused</i> a pandemic, but I don’t understand the other direction — how WIV doing gain-of-function would help the situation in which there was a zoonotic origin, eg at the wet market.<p>The person I was replying to said that our opinion on gain-of-function should depend on the origin — but I don’t understand how gain-of-function would have helped at all.

Coronaviruses are hard to contain, even if you have good practices. For example, the earlier SARS outbreak (from the early 2000s) had <i>several</i> documented lab leaks, including multiple within China (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7096887&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7096887&#x2F;</a>).<p>2. The US state department was aware that China was conducting dangerous research on coronaviruses on poorly managed labs a few years before the COVID-19 pandemic (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2021&#x2F;03&#x2F;08&#x2F;josh-rogin-chaos-under-heaven-wuhan-lab-book-excerpt-474322" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2021&#x2F;03&#x2F;08&#x2F;josh-rogin...</a>).<p>3. The WHO got completely manipulated by China, either willingly or just due to their incompetence. For example, it is well documented now that the WHO publicly praised the Chinese government but privately was concerned and frustrated by the lack of transparency and sharing of vital information, including blocking visits to Wuhan (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;health-news&#x2F;how-china-blocked-who-chinese-scientists-early-coronavirus-outbreak-n1222246" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;health-news&#x2F;how-china-blocked...</a>).<p>4. The NIAID (Fauci’s agency, under NIH) conducted gain of function research through a third party, EcoHealth Alliance. The grants are all public and document gain of function research, which was <i>illegal</i> since President Obama had banned it through an executive order. There was evidence that the NIH helped EcoHealth craft their grant language in a way to avoid oversight processes that would have blocked the grant (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;11&#x2F;03&#x2F;coronavirus-research-ecohealth-nih-emails&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;11&#x2F;03&#x2F;coronavirus-research-eco...</a>). Note that the president of EcoHealth, Peter Daszak, is a listed author on gain of function publications from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. After years of trying to bury this, the Biden administration finally blocked funding to EcoHealth in 2024 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;05&#x2F;16&#x2F;health&#x2F;us-government-suspends-fundingforvirus-research-group-at-center-of-covid-19-origin-controversy&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;05&#x2F;16&#x2F;health&#x2F;us-government-suspends...</a>).<p>5. China only allowed a WHO visit over a year after they knew of the COVID-19 outbreak, in early 2021.

Another is that a lab leak makes the government seem much more culpable, since they would presumably have more direct control over the activities of government funded scientists. In any case, I think world governments have been reluctant to endorse theories that place more blame on the Chinese government for fear of forcing them into a defensive posture and risking a larger confrontation.

The CIA&#x27;s position was hiterto &quot;we&#x27;re not yet sure&quot;, and now it&#x27;s &quot;we still aren&#x27;t sure but we&#x27;re leaning towards lab leak&quot;. That&#x27;s not a radical shift, it&#x27;s a very slight shift in the direction that other three-letter agencies have been leaning for <i>years</i>.<p>There were almost certainly some politics involved in the decision to release the report now, but it&#x27;s not like the CIA were staunch advocates for zoonotic origins up until now, and again: Biden&#x27;s FBI and DOE were already leaning this way!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;02&#x2F;28&#x2F;politics&#x2F;wray-fbi-covid-origins-lab-china&#x2F;index.html"

Yet it was noticeable that the pardon is backdated to 2014. This is, coincidentally, the same year that the US three-year ban on gain-of-function research took effect and also the start date for an NIH grant to Wuhan that biosafety experts such as Richard Ebright, professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, believe is linked to the “reckless” research that sparked global pandemic. “The pardon is a travesty,” he told me.<p>The evidence has shown clear efforts to avoid such scrutiny. One memo disclosed that “Tony” had told David Morens, a senior adviser to Fauci, how to avoid requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), suggesting that he stop using government-issued phones for his gmail accounts. A leaked email indicated that Morens was coached on evasion of FOIs by Margaret Moore, Fauci’s long-serving assistant — who pleaded the fifth when asked to testify. “I learned from our foia lady here how to make emails disappear after i am foia’d but before the search starts, so i think we are all safe,” he wrote. Another senior aide to Fauci misspelled key conspirators, presumably to avoid searches intended to fulfil FOIA requests.&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="42826053" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42826053" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tensor</span><span>|</span><a href="#42825826">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42826308">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42825844">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42826053">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42826053">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The biggest irony in this is that apparently the lesson the current US government learned was &quot;let&#x27;s cancel all the fire stations and fire all the fire fighters!&quot;</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42825844" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42825844" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Workaccount2</span><span>|</span><a href="#42825826">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42827975">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42825844">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42825844">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We will probably never know what happened unless the CCP collapses and all the documents leak out.<p>China had a bit of a freak out when the pandemic first started and pretty much silenced everyone close to the lab and kept everyone else out.

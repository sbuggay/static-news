The Saturn was entirely a Sega of Japan design. There&#x27;s an interview (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mdshock.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;16&#x2F;hideki-sato-discussing-the-sega-saturn&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mdshock.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;16&#x2F;hideki-sato-discussing-the-se...</a>) with the Saturn hardware designer that gives some perspective into why he chose to make the hardware the way he did. Basically, he knew that 3D was the future from the response the PSX was getting, but besides AM2 (the team at Sega that did 3D arcade games like Virtua Fighter, Daytona USA, etc), all of Sega&#x27;s internal expertise was on traditional 2D sprite-based games. Because of this, he felt the best compromise was to make a console that excelled at 2D games and was workable at 3D games. I think his biggest mistake was that he underestimated how quickly the industry would switch to mainly focusing on 3D.<p>The actual result of Sega&#x27;s infighting was far more stupid IMO. Sega of America wanted a more conservative design than the Saturn using a Motorola 68020 (successor to the 68000 in the Genesis) which would have lower performance, but developers would be more familiar with the hardware. After they lost this fight, they deemed the Saturn impossible to sell in the US due to its high price. SOA then designed the 32X, a $200 add-on to the Genesis that used the same SH2 processors as the Saturn but drew graphics entirely in software and overlayed them on top of the Genesis graphics. The initial plan was that the Saturn would remain exclusively in Japan for 2-3 years while the 32X would sell overseas. Sega of America spent a ton of money trying to build interest for the 32X and focused their internal development exclusively on the 32X. However, both developers and the media were completely uninterested in it compared to the Saturn. After it became evident that the 32X wouldn&#x27;t hold the market, Sega of America rushed the Saturn to market to draw attention away from the 32X, but had to rely exclusively on Japanese titles (many of which didn&#x27;t fit the American market) because they&#x27;d spent the past year developing 32X titles (the 32X had more cancelled games than released ones). All of this ended up confusing and pissing off developers and consumers.</div><br/><div id="39828789" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39828789" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">phire</span><span>|</span><a href="#39826352">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39828099">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39834565">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39828789">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39828789">[15 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Now that&#x27;s a good interview.<p><i>&gt; I think his biggest mistake was that he underestimated how quickly the industry would switch to mainly focusing on 3D.</i><p>I think his mistake was a bit more subtle than that. Because he didn&#x27;t have any experience in 3D or anyone to ask for help, he didn&#x27;t know which features were important and which features could be ignored. And he ended up missing roughly two important features that would have bought the Saturn upto the standard of &quot;workable 3D&quot;.<p>The quads weren&#x27;t even that big of a problem. Even if the industry did standardise on triangles for 3D hardware, a lot of the artist pipelines sick with quads as much as possible.<p>The first missing feature is texture mapping. Basically the ability to pass in uv coordinates for each vertex (or even just a single uv offset and some slopes for the whole quad). The lack of texture mapping made it very hard to export or convert 3D models from other consoles. Instead, artists had to create new models where each quad always maps to an 8x8 texel quad of pixels.<p>The second missing feature is alpha blending, or semitransparent quads. The Saturn did support half-transparency, but it only worked for non-distorted sprites, and you really want more options than just 50% or 100%.<p>With those two features, I think the Saturn would have been a workable 3D console. Still not as good as the playstation, but probably good enough for Sega to stand its ground until the Dreamcast launched.</div><br/><div id="39829478" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39829478" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mmaniac</span><span>|</span><a href="#39826352">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39828789">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39833569">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39829478">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39829478">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The quads weren&#x27;t even that big of a problem. Even if the industry did standardise on triangles for 3D hardware, a lot of the artist pipelines sick with quads as much as possible.<p>&gt; The first missing feature is texture mapping. Basically the ability to pass in uv coordinates for each vertex.<p>These two situations are fundamentally related. Most 3D rasterizers including the Playstation use inverse texture mapping, iterating over framebuffer pixels to find texels to sample. The Saturn uses forward texture mapping, iterating over the texels and drawing them to their corresponding framebuffer pixels.<p>The choice to use forward mapping has some key design consequences. It isn&#x27;t practical to implement UV mapping using forward mapping, and quads are also become a more natural primitive to use.<p>&gt; The second missing feature is alpha blending, or semitransparent quads. The Saturn did support half-transparency, but it only worked for non-distorted sprites, and you really want more options than just 50% or 100%.<p>I don&#x27;t consider this to be a significant problem. The checkerboard mesh feature provides a workable pseudo-half-transparent effect, especially with the blurry analog video signals used at the time.<p>Side note but forward mapping is also the reason why half-transparency does not work for distorted sprites. Forward mapping means that the same pixel may be overdrawn.

And it had both UV mapping and translucent polygons. The sega saturn titles that were ported to the NV1 look absolutely great. And I the Sega Model 3 also implemented both UV mapping and transparency on quads (I&#x27;m just not 100% sure it was using forwards texture mapping).<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting the Saturn should have implemented the full perspective correct quadratic texture mapping that the NV1 had. That would be overkill graphically (especially since the ps1 didn&#x27;t have perspective correct texture mapping either), and probably would have taken up too many transistors.<p>But even a simple scheme that ignored perspective correctness were the artist provided UV coord for three of the vertices (and the forth was implicitly derived by assuming the quad and it&#x27;s UVs were flat) would have provided most of the texture mapping capabilities that artists needed. And when using malformed quads to emulate triangles, the 3 UV coords would match.<p>And most of the hardware is already there. VDP1 already has hardware to calculate the slopes all four quad edges from vertex coords and an edge walker to walk though all pixels in screen space. It also has similar hardware for calculating the texture space height&#x2F;width deltas and walking though texture space. It&#x27;s just that texture space is assumed to always have slopes of zero.<p>So that&#x27;s the only changes we make. VDP1 now calculates proper texture space slopes for each quad, and the texture coord walker is updated to take non-zero slopes. I&#x27;m hopeful such an improvement could have been made without massively increasing the transistor count of VDP1, and suddenly the saturn&#x27;s texture mapping capabilities are roughly equal with the PS1.<p><i>&gt; I don&#x27;t consider this to be a significant problem. The checkerboard mesh feature provides a workable pseudo-half-transparent effect</i><p>I think you are underestimating just how useful proper transparency is for early 3D hardware.<p><i>(by proper transparency, I mean supporting the add&#x2F;subtract blend modes)</i><p>And I haven&#x27;t put it on my list of &quot;important missing features&quot; because sometimes games want to render transparent objects. As you said, the mesh (checkerboard) mode actually works for a lot of those cases. And if you are doing particles, then you can often get away with using non-distorted quads, which does work with the half-transparent mode. <i>(though, from an artistic perspective, particles would really look a lot better if they could instead use add&#x2F;subtract modes)</i><p>No. Proper transparency is on my list because it&#x27;s an essential building block for emulating advanced features that aren&#x27;t natively supported on the hardware.<p>One great example is the environment mapping effect that is found in a large number of ps1 racing games. Those shiny reflections on your car that sell the effect of your car being made out of metal and glass. The ps1 doesn&#x27;t have native support for environment mapping or any kind of multitexturing, so how do these games do it?<p>Well, they actually render your car twice. Once with the texture representing the body paint color, and then a second pass with a texture representing the current environment UV mapped over your car. The second pass is rendered with a transparency mode that neatly adds the reflections over the body paint. The player doesn&#x27;t even notice that transparency was used.<p>Environment mapping is perhaps the most visually impressive of these advanced rendering tricks using translucency, but you can find dozens of variations spread out though the entire PS1 and N64 libraries.<p>Probably the most pervasive of these tricks are decals. Decals are great for providing visual variation to large parts of level geometry. Rather than your walls being a single repeating texture, the artist can just slap random decals every so often. A light switch here, a patch of torn wallpaper there, blood spatters here and graffiti over there. It the kind of thing the player doesn&#x27;t really notice except when they are missing.<p>And decals are implemented with transparency. Just draw the surface with it&#x27;s normal repeating texture and then use transparency to blend the decals over top in a second pass. Sometimes they Add, sometimes they Subtract. Sometimes they just want to skip transparent texels.
And because the Saturn doesn&#x27;t support transparency on 3D quads, it can&#x27;t do proper decals. So artists need to manually model any decal-like elements into the level geometry itself, which wastes artist time, wastes texture memory and wastes polygons.<p>For some reason, VDP1 doesn&#x27;t even support transparent texels on 3D quads, the manual says they only work for non-distorted quads.<p><i>&gt; Side note but forward mapping is also the reason why half-transparency does not work for distorted sprites. Forward mapping means that the same pixel may be overdrawn. If a half-transparent pixel is blended twice, the result is a corrupt pixel.</i><p>No... This isn&#x27;t a limitation of forwards texture mapping. Just a limitation of VDP1&#x27;s underwhelming implementation of forwards texture mapping.<p>I don&#x27;t think it would be that hard to adjust the edge walking algorithm to deal with &quot;holes&quot; in a way that avoids double writes.<p>My gut says this is basically the same problem that triangle-based GPUs run into when two triangles share an edge. The naive approach results in similar issues with both holes and double-written pixels (which breaks transparency). So triangle rasterizers commonly use the top-left rule to ensure every pixel is written exactly once by one of the two triangles based on which side of the edge the triangle is on.<p>----------<p>Though that fix only allows 3D quads to correctly use the half-transparency mode.<p>I&#x27;m really confused as to why VDP1 has such limited blending capabilities. The SNES had proper configurable blending in the 90s, and VDP2 also has proper blending between it&#x27;s layers.<p>And it&#x27;s not like proper blending is only useful for 3D games. Proper blending is very useful for 2D games too, and certain effects in cross platform 2D games can end up looking washed out on the Saturn version because they they couldn&#x27;t use VDP2 for that effect and were limited to just VDP1&#x27;s 50% transparency on VDP1 instead of add&#x2F;subtract.<p>VDP1&#x27;s 50% transparency already pays the cost of doing a full read-write-modify on the framebuffer, so why not implement the add&#x2F;substract modes? A single adder wouldn&#x27;t be that many transistors? That would be enough to more or less match the playstation, which only had four blending modes (50&#x2F;50, add, subtract and 25% of background + 100% of foreground).<p>Though, you can go a lot further than just equality with the PS1. The N64 had a fully configurable blender that could take alpha values from either vertex colors or texture colors (or a global alpha value).<p><i>&gt; VDP2 can also provide half-transparent effects in various circumstances - this video provides a comprehensive look at various methods which were used to deliver this effect.</i><p><i>&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=f_OchOV_WDg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=f_OchOV_WDg</a></i><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s a great video.

Normal 3D quads (with Gouraud shading) use a 15 bit format with five bits of Red, Green and Blue representing the final color (and the the top most bit is set to one).<p>Those background elements instead use a palletted color format. The top bit is zero (so VDP can tell which format to be used used on a per-pixel basis) and then there are 3 bits of priority (unused in this case), 3 bits of &quot;Color calculation ratio&quot; which Gamehut used to implement the fade, and a 9 bit color palette index.<p>So it&#x27;s not just that you can&#x27;t use Gouraud shading, but these fading objects are limited to a global total of 512 unique colors which must be preloaded into VDP2&#x27;s color ram (well, I guess you could swap the colors out each frame)<p>-----<p>Importantly, since this trick only works against VDP2 background layers, it can&#x27;t be used to blend two 3D quads against each other.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39834565" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39834565" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eek2121</span><span>|</span><a href="#39826352">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39828099">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39828789">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39828183">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39834565">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39834565">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think it is funny that both were wrong. 2D games are still very much being developed and released today, and many outsell 3D games, even AAA 3D games.<p>People beat Sega up back then, and also now, but I do not think their hardware was that bad. The pricing was a huge issue.<p>If I were them, I would have NOT released the 32X as a standalone, NOT released the Saturn, and instead focus on a fusion of the two into a standalone cartridge based system. For everything people criticized the Saturn for, the cartridges made it work. The N64 showed off the advantage of using a cartridge over a CD based system.<p>If I were going to release a non-portable gaming system today, I&#x27;d build one around cartridges that are PCIE 5.0 x4 based and design it so that a) you can quickly shut off the system and replace the game rather than digging through ads&#x2F;clunky ui&#x2F;launcher. b) access and latency times are fast c) the hardware is potentially extendable in many different ways.<p>However, I actually liked the 32x and it&#x27;s games. Maybe that is because I got the 32x on clearance at walmart for $10 and the games for $1-$2 each, or maybe it was because many of the games were fun and were a genuine upgrade over my 16 bit systems.<p>I don&#x27;t think the Saturn was bad, but it was overpriced for the time and definitely rushed.<p>I DO think this rush to make consoles require an internet connection has left a sizable hole in the market, a hole that nintendo is only half filling.

But VDP2 doesn&#x27;t do 3D at all, it&#x27;s responsible for the SNES &quot;mode 7&quot; style background layers. If you remove VDP2 (and ignore the fact that VDP is responsible for video scanout) then the resulting console can still do both 3D just fine (Many 3D games leave VDP2 almost completely unused). 2D game would take a bit of a quality hit as they would have to render the background with hundreds of sprites.<p>If you instead removed VDP1, then all you have left are VDP2&#x27;s 2D background layers. You don&#x27;t have 3D and you can&#x27;t put any sprites on the screen so it&#x27;s basically useless at 2D games too.<p>As far as I can tell, the Saturn was always meant to have both VDP1 and VDP2. They were designed together to work in tandem. And I think the intention (from SEGA JP) was always for the design be a 2D powerhouse with some limited 3D capabilities, as we saw on the final design.<p>I&#x27;m not saying there wasn&#x27;t arguments between SEGA JP and SEGA US. There seems to be plenty of evidence of that. But I don&#x27;t think they munged the JP and US designs together at the last moment.

Only in the last years did homebrew people really push the limits here with &quot;F3DEX3&quot;.<p>&gt; and a god awful bilinear filtering on all output.<p>I think that&#x27;s a frequent misconception. The texture filtering was fine, it arguably looks significantly worse when you disable it in an emulator or a recompilation project. The only problem was the small texture cache. The filtering had nothing to do with it. Hardware accelerated PC games at the time also supported texture filtering, but I don&#x27;t think anyone considered disabling it, as it was an obvious improvement.<p>But aside from its small texture cache, the N64 also had a different problem related to its main memory bus. This was apparently a major bottleneck for most games, and it wasn&#x27;t easy to debug at the time, so many games were not properly optimized to avoid the issue, and wasted a large part of the frame time with waiting for the memory bus.

With cartridges they could end up undershooting, and losing sales, or overshooting and end up with expensive, excess inventory.<p>Then to top it all off, Sony had much lower licensing fees!

It is as you say, except that shading and texturing come for free. You may be thinking of Playstation where you do indeed get decreased fillrate when texturing is on.<p>Now, if you enable 2cycle mode, the pipeline will recycle the pixel value back into the pipeline for a second stage, which is used for 2 texture lookups per pixel and some other blending options. Otherwise, the RDP is always outputting 1 pixel per clock at 62.5 mhz. (Though it will be frequently interrupted because of ram contention) There are faster drawing modes but they are for drawing rectangles, not triangles. It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve done benchmarks on the pipeline though.<p>You&#x27;re exactly right that the UMA plus high latency murders it. It really does. Enable zbuffer? Now the poor RDP is thrashing read modify writes and you only get 8 pixel chunks at a time. Span caching is minimal. Simply using zbuf will torpedo your effective full rate by 20 to 40 percent. That&#x27;s why stuff I wrote for it avoided using the zbuffer whenever possible.<p>The other bandwidth hog was enable anti aliasing. AA processing happened in 2 places: first in the triangle drawing pipeline, for inside polygon edges. Secondly, in the VI when the framebuffer gets displayed, it will apply smoothing to the exterior polygon edges based on coverage information stored in the pixels extra bits.<p>On average, you get a roughly 15 to 20 percent fillrate boost by turning both those off.

IIRC one of the official figures was ~180k tri&#x2F;sec.<p>I could draw a ~167,600 tri opaque model with all features (shaded, lit by three directional lights plus an ambient one, textured, Z-buffered, anti-aliased, one cycle), plus some large debug overlays (anti-aliased wireframes for text, 3D axes, Blender-style grid, almost fullscreen transparent planes &amp; 32-vert rings) at 2 FPS&#x2F;~424 ms per frame at 640x476@32bpp, 3 FPS&#x2F;~331ms at 320x240@32bpp, 3 FPS&#x2F;~309ms at 320x240@16bpp.<p>That&#x27;d be between around 400k to 540k tri&#x2F;sec. Sounds weird, right ? But that&#x27;s extrapolated straight from the CPU counter on real hardware and eyeballing, so it&#x27;s hard to argue.<p>I assume the bottleneck at that point is the RSP processing all the geometry, a lot of them will be backface culled, and because of the sheer density at such a low resolution, comparatively most of them will be drawn in no time by the RDP. Or, y&#x27;know, the bandwidth. Haven&#x27;t measured, sorry.<p>Performance depends on many variables, one of which is how the asset converter itself can optimise the draw calls. The one I used, a slight variant of objn64, prefers duplicating vertices just so it can fully load the cache in one DMA command (gSPVertex) while also maximising gSP2Triangle commands IIRC (check the source if curious). But there&#x27;s no doubt many other ways of efficiently loading and drawing meshes, not to mention all the ways you could batch the scene graph for things more complex than a demo.<p>Anyways, the particular result above was with the low-precision F3DEX2 microcode (gspF3DLX2_Rej_fifo), it doubles the vertex cache size in DMEM from 32 to 64 entries, but removes the clipping code: polygons too close to the camera get trivially rejected. The other side effect with objn64 is that the larger vertex cache massively reduces the memory footprint (far less duplication): might&#x27;ve shaved off like 1 MB off the 4 MB compiled data.<p>Compared to the full precision F3DEX2, my comment said: `~1.25x faster. ~1.4x faster when maxing out the vertex cache.`.<p>All the microcodes I used have a 16 KB FIFO command buffer held in RDRAM (as opposed to the RSP&#x27;s DMEM for XBUS microcodes). It goes like this if memory serves right:<p>1. CPU starts RSP graphics task with a given microcode and display list to interpret from RAM<p>2. RSP DMAs display list from RAM to DMEM and interprets it<p>3. RSP generates RDP commands into a FIFO in either RDRAM or DMEM<p>4. When output command buffer is full, it waits for the RDP to be ready and then asks it to execute the command buffer<p>5. The RDP reads the 64-bit commands via either the RDRAM or the cross-bus which is the 128-bit internal bus connecting them together, so it avoids RDRAM bus contention.<p>6. Once the RDP is done, go to step 2&#x2F;3.<p>To quote the manual:<p>&gt; The size of the internal buffer used for passing RDP commands is smaller with the XBUS microcode than with the normal FIFO microcode (around 1 Kbyte). As a result, when large OBJECTS (that take time for RDP graphics processing) are continuously rendered, the internal buffer fills up and the RSP halts until the internal buffer becomes free again. This creates a bottleneck and can also slow RSP calculations. Additionally, audio processing by the RSP cannot proceed in parallel with the RDP&#x27;s graphics processing. Nevertheless, because I&#x2F;O to RDRAM is smaller than with FIFO (around 1&#x2F;2), this might be an effective way to counteract CPU&#x2F;RDP slowdowns caused by competition on the RDRAM bus. So when using the XBUS microcode, please test a variety of combinations.</div><br/><div id="39835921" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39835921" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mips_r4300i</span><span>|</span><a href="#39826352">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39834148">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39835731">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39835921">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39835921">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m glad someone found objn64 useful :) looking back it could&#x27;ve been optimized better but it was Good Enough when I wrote it.

I have specialized equipment. Hardware. I need to interface with manufacturing. So on.<p>Guess what? I&#x27;m going on 1 year fully remote, and I&#x27;m doing great! Turns out, all that fancy equipment can be brought home with you. We deal with a contract manufacturer, and emailing them from home is no harder than emailing them from the office. Instead of being stuck in a concrete jungle, I can go test the product out in a more realistic environment in the park across from my home. It&#x27;s made me happier, healthier AND more productive.

Early in March 2020, the people in my group were all watching the data that were becoming available. My boss came into our work area and said: &quot;You guys can all see what&#x27;s happening. Let&#x27;s clear out of here, then we&#x27;ll figure out what to do.&quot;<p>I went and got my minivan, loaded it with the contents of my lab, and took it home. Then I ordered high speed Internet service. A few days later the schools closed, and my family was all working at home. I already had some lab space at home due to my side business.<p>Now, I didn&#x27;t really mind working from work. It&#x27;s a few minutes bike ride from my house.<p>Oddly enough, things were happening so quickly that even being a few days or weeks ahead of the game meant that we were charting new territory within our company, which is a large multinational. For instance, with no specific location, we started collaborating beyond our original group. We improved our use of rapid prototyping services. We got a lot done despite, I think, having a more relaxed pace of work. Though I work in &quot;hardware,&quot; what that means in this day and age is spending somewhere between 0 and 100% of your time programming. I spent a lot of time programming while looking out the window, taking a break and going for a walk, and so forth.<p>It was also comforting to go back, eventually. I like the people. It could get lonely at home. I&#x27;m definitely not a introvert.<p>(Edited to clarify: March 2020)</div><br/><div id="41565127" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41565127" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">teekert</span><span>|</span><a href="#41562094">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41562800">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41565144">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41565127">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41565127">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was in a role that did require a lot of talking, in a large health tech company.

Someone with a family is perhaps less inclined to change jobs. Someone older is more likely to have health issues or a dependent with health issues, which is an even stronger disincentive to change jobs. It is still not a great job market AFAIK, quitting at the moment is not going to guarantee a new job is available.<p>Perhaps something of a corollary of the saying, don&#x27;t attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence. The Amazon senior folks making these decisions almost certainly have reasons. If people quit, maybe they just don&#x27;t care who it is. I really wonder if they AB tested RTO. Given it is Amazon, I would put a small wager they have.<p>Further, the impact between middle managers and individual contributors is uneven in remote work. The article mentioned there was a desire to reduce management. Remote work was an interesting experiment IMO to show the (lack of) effectiveness of middle management. Perhaps the impact to ICs is negative, but the middle management can be more effective. Arguably that would give greater &quot;focus&quot; on the specific KPIs desired by the VP level. Again, would be super fascinating to know the data used by Amazon here, of if this is a rare decision truly made by fiat alone.<p>Others have mentioned Amazon&#x27;s real estate holdings. I kinda think that is likely. Amazon made huge investments to stop leasing offices and to build and own their own offices. If nobody is there, the surrounding neighborhood is devalued, in turn devaluing the offices further. It would be s considerable loss on paper. ICs perhaps are about as effective in office under a whip compared to remote, and if some quit - then maybe all the better to reduce head count.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41563047" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41563047" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JambalayaJimbo</span><span>|</span><a href="#41562094">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41562780">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41563866">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41563215">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41563047">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41563047">[16 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Career focused younger people have also been adversely affected by wfh for the last few years in a big way.

Neither is worth more than a couple grand. I acknowledge that more expensive equipment exists, but I&#x27;ll come back to that.<p>&gt; There are insurance considerations too - your house burns down with $250k worth of test equipment inside, who is paying for that?<p>My employer already has insurance on their equipment, and I already have insurance on my equipment. I see no problem here.<p>Even if there was a problem, why do you expect ME to be saddled with the burden of a problem that clearly exists between my employer and their insurer? Why should I (and thousands of others) pay the cost of 20 hours a week in commuting, when my company and the insurance provider could spend a couple hours to fully think through their terms?<p>&gt; There is a lack of critical thinking when it comes to extreme WFH arrogance.<p>I recognize that not everyone can work remote. At the time the shutdowns began, I was working for a defense prime in an airgapped lab. Obviously, I couldn&#x27;t bring my equipment home. But, in that case, there was a <i>reason</i> for onsite work - national security. For most devs, there simply isn&#x27;t a similar justification for onsite work.<p>None of what I said in my toplevel comment is intended to disparage anyone with a job that <i>demands</i> onsite work. 
Note how I never disparaged anyone in that situation, nor did I disparage anyone who runs a company where people are in that situation. I merely stated how much I like <i>my</i> situation, with some quiet jabs at companies too stubborn to afford the same benefits to themselves and their employees. Develop some reading comprehension before you start slinging accusations of poor critical thinking.<p>So I see it the exact opposite way. I see a staggering level of arrogance in Amazon&#x27;s move to sequester thousands of people in an office who simply don&#x27;t need to be there. It&#x27;s detrimental to the workers&#x27; health and happiness, it&#x27;s a needless cost on Amazon&#x27;s behalf, it pollutes our environment, and it does jack to improve their product.

What is the value of working at Amazon (or even just AWS) these days?

But then again, Amazon doesn&#x27;t claim monopoly on those and one has to assume the risk of working for a place that churns people out and has upper-level management that are hostile to IC&#x27;s needs&#x2F;wants.<p>Perhaps a better question is - if one can get an offer at other FAANGs and the equivalents... is there a reason to choose Amazon over others?</div><br/><div id="41559772" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41559772" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neofrommatrix</span><span>|</span><a href="#41559672">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41560590">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41559772">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41559772">[66 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s not worth working there as a L5&#x2F;L6 level engineer.

The only engineers,IMO, that like it there are those adept at finding new bootstrapped teams and designing and writing the product from scratch and releasing the MVP. They then hand over the crappy MVP to other engineers to support and move on to other new products.

It&#x27;s the best boot camp one could ask for regarding general skill development imo (not particular frameworks etc but like, the theory and practice).  There&#x27;s also some things I miss like the weekly ops review and the general engineering culture, especially when it came to explicitly listing service limits, API specs, and cost up front in your design. Oh, and I honestly miss the docs culture.  Quip wasn&#x27;t as good as Google docs but the actual docs themselves and process of authoring them were SUPER valuable.<p>Coding wise, CDK was so much better than terraform (once we moved to CDK from lpt+cfn, which was way worse imo).  Smithy and open API are neato too (@smithy externally everyone uses thrift it seems, but the overlap of functionality&#x2F;use cases isn&#x27;t identical).<p>Probably the biggest thing I miss was bones (kind of successor to octane), which is kind of like yeoman or create react app but would include so so much of the excellent internal tooling of ci&#x2F;CD approval actions.  I don&#x27;t know of a real external equivalent, but would love to have one.  If you ever see a Breland Miley or Ian Mosher apply to your company, HIRE THEM IMMEDIATELY.

The COE process they followed to do post-incident analysis was flawed and based on discredited approaches like the &quot;5 whys&quot;.  I don&#x27;t know if it has changed since I left, I rather hope it has.<p>I genuinely believe there is no such thing as a root cause.  The reason I believe that is both grounded in personal experience, and in the 40+ years of academic research that demonstrates in far greater detail that no failure comes about as a result of a single thing.  Failure is always complex, and that approaches to incident analysis and remediation that are grounded in it are largely ineffectual.  You have to consider all contributing factors if you want to make actual progress.  The tech industry tends to trail really far behind on this subject.<p>A couple of quick up-front reading suggestion, if I may:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;how.complexsystems.fail&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;how.complexsystems.fail&#x2F;</a>  - An excellent, and short, read.  It&#x27;s not really written from the perspective of tech, but every single point is easily applicable to technological systems.  I encourage engineers to think about the systems that they&#x27;re responsible for at work, their code, incidents they&#x27;ve been involved in, as they read it.
Everything we deal with is fundamentally complex.  Even a basic application that runs on a single server is complex, because of all the layers of the operating system below it, let alone the wider environment of the network and beyond.<p>* If you&#x27;re willing to go deeper: &quot;Behind Human Error&quot; ISBN-10: ‎9780754678342.  It&#x27;s a very approachable book, written by Dr Woods and several other prominent names in the academic research side in to failures.<p>My favourite example to use when talking about why there&#x27;s no such thing as a root cause has been the 737-MAX situation.  Which has only become more apt over time, as we&#x27;ve learned just how bad that plane was.<p>With the original 737-MAX situation, we had two planes crash in the space of 5 months.<p>If we follow a root cause analysis approach, you&#x27;ll end up looking at the fact that the planes were reliant on a single sensor to tell them their angle of attack (AoA).  So replace the single sensor with multiple, something that was already possible to do, and the planes stop crashing.  Job done.  Resilience achieved!<p>That doesn&#x27;t really address a lot of important things, like, how did we end up in a situation where the plane was ever sold with a single AoA sensor (especially one with a track record of inaccuracy)?<p>Why did the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) keep overriding pilot input on the controls, which it didn&#x27;t do on previous implementations of MCAS systems?
Why was the existence of the MCAS system not in the manuals?
Why could MCAS repeatedly activate?<p>If the MCAS hadn&#x27;t behaved in such a bizarre fashion, where it kept overriding input, it&#x27;s arguable that the pilots would have been able to correct its erroneous dropping of the nose.  If you&#x27;re sticking with a &quot;root cause&quot; model, there&#x27;s a pretty strong argument that the MCAS system was the actual root cause of the incident.<p>Given the fairly fundamental changes to the controls, and the introduction of the MCAS, why were pilots not required to be trained on the new model of plane? Is Boeings attempts to avoid pilots needing retraining the <i>actual</i> root cause?<p>Why was an MCAS system necessary in the first place?  It&#x27;s because of the engine changes they&#x27;d made, and how they&#x27;d had to position them in relation to the wings that tended to result in the planes nose wanting to go up and induce a stall.  The MCAS system was introduced to help with counteracting that new behaviour.  Was the new engine choice the root cause of failure?<p>and so on and so forth..<p>If you look at the NTSB accident report for the 737-MAX flights, it goes way deeper, and broader in to the incident.  It takes a holistic view of the situation, because even the answers to those questions I pose above are multi-faceted.  As a result it had a long list of recommendations for Boeing, the FAA, and all involved parties.<p>Those 2 crashes were the emergent property of a complex system.  It&#x27;s a symptom.  A side effect.  It required failures in the way things were communicated within Boeing, failures in FAA certification, failures in engineering, failures in management decision making, the works.<p>No one at Boeing deliberately set out to make a plane that crashes.  A lot of the decisions about how they do things are reasonable, and make some sense, in isolation.  But they all contributed together to make for a system to which it became a question of &quot;when&quot; and not &quot;if&quot; a major disaster would occur.<p>If resilience and incident analysis just focuses on a singular root cause, the systems that produced the bad outcome, will continue, and will inevitably make more bad decisions.  The only thing that would improve is that they would probably never make a decision to sell a plane with a single AoA sensor.<p>As we&#x27;ve seen over time, the whole broken system has resulted in a lot of issues with the MAX, beyond that sensor situation.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41562962" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41562962" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jp57</span><span>|</span><a href="#41559672">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41561202">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41561934">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41560657">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41562962">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41562962">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Sorry for an obligatory: there is no such thing as a root cause.<p>While I get what you mean, I think most people who&#x27;ve been in the situation know what I&#x27;m talking about.

Competitive packages. Tons of responsibility and freedom. I can&#x27;t stress this enough. an L7+ really has lots of freedom and influence. They get to choose which meetings to go to, how much code they write, what architecture to use, who to work with, and have a serious say on what product features to launch, and which oncall to participate (except the GM escalation oncall). The company&#x27;s policies and culture ensure that. They will be accountable for the architecture they choose, so of course they have the final say on what architecture to use -- typical freedom and responsibility. Plus, they have veto power of one&#x27;s rating and promotion, after all. Other benefits include Lots of resources at their disposal. Good opportunity to learn from truly great engineers, at least in AWS. Note I&#x27;m not saying that every L7+ is great. All I&#x27;m saying that there are many truly great engineers and scientists that one can learn from. Think about the L7+ who built EC2, DDB, EBS, S3, SQS, and etc. Think about the L7+ who are fellows of ACM or NAE, who invented algorithms, built new systems, created new programming languages, and etc. They did not only spearhead the evolution of the underlying distributed systems, but also pushed large-scale application of queuing theories, formal verifications, and etc, as well as helped shape the engineering culture of the company.

That said, a coworker of mine mentioned an algorithm that seemed to work: first you pick a company that solves a problem that fascinates you and that has people are you willing to work with. You can check LinkedIn for the employe profiles, and you can rely on friend recommendations. The bottomline is, you minimize your chance of regret when it comes to choosing a company. If the company folds, at least you get to work with interesting people, build friendship, learn something new, and work on something fun and meaningful. The second second step is to rely on math. Give the company a time box, say 2 years. If the company does not have satisfying momentum in two years, then jump ship. Note it&#x27;s about growth and momentum, however you define it. Everything else is secondary consideration. In 10 years, you will have 5 times. Now, the chance that you will succeed at least once 1 - P^6, where P is the failure rate of the companies. Even if the failure rate is 30%, you success rate will be 99.76%, an almost guaranteed success. And now, if you always join a top-tier company in the corresponding sector, your chance of success will even be higher. There are two catches, though. First, you need to be able to switch job whenever you want, so leetcode hard and study hard in your focused domain of experience. Second, 2 years of experience hardly can be enough for progressing your level of expertise, so you will have to work like hell to make 2 years of experience worth four years, instead of having one month of experience repeating 24 times.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41561228" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41561228" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">monocasa</span><span>|</span><a href="#41559672">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41561184">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41562014">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41562557">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41561228">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41561228">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; For instance, partner engineers in Microsoft also enjoy great life.<p>Sort of.

This is a declining trend and when looked at year over year 2020 to 2021 had 8% advancement while 2023 to 2024 only showed 4% advancement.  Furthermore, the senior ICs are comfortable in their role and the number of them moving up to management has dropped from 5% to 3% in the 2020 to 2024 time frame.  If this continues, we may be looking at a lot of unsatisfied junior developers who are not progressing and a lot of satisfied senior developers and leads who would traditionally shift to the management track... well, not take that step in their career progression.&quot;<p>Yes, that&#x27;s a just-so story.

The plan to enforce this in January, after Q4 when people are busy at work (with Amazon’s Q4 peak retail sales period) and with the holidays, makes it clear that Andy Jassy intends to make this an impossible change. He just wants to force people out - maybe to do a layoff without paying severance. Or maybe it is a way to select for young people that live in downtown cores near Amazon offices, and get rid of older people or people with families. You know, people that live away from city centers, have commutes, and cannot deal with an abusive RTO policy. I hope they face lawsuits and also that talent flees.<p>The only reason Andy Jassy and Amazon can get away with this is because they have enough market power that they don’t have to care about consequences. In other words, they are too big to fail, and immune to the negative effects of this that may result from real competition. It’s time for them to also face anti trust regulation.

This leads you to believe organizing is suboptimal. But, the data does not show individual performance is tied to compensation, therefore you&#x27;re arguing against a model based on a meritocracy fallacy and an incomplete mental model. You might also overweight your own performance vs that of others, in the same way that a majority of drivers believe themselves to be better than the average driver.<p>Understandably, it is hard to internalize that we are not special, that performance is hard to measure, and that organizations communicate something different than reality. &quot;Show me the incentives and I&#x27;ll show you the outcome.&quot;<p>&quot;I am a gambler and I don&#x27;t want my upside restricted&quot; is more honest than &quot;the profession shouldn&#x27;t organize because a small cohort will miss out on outsized comp that they can work hard and are recognized for.&quot; Also, importantly, you asked &quot;how would a profession ... benefit&quot; when you really mean just the folks at the top of the income distribution, not the entire profession. One might also consider that pay transparency laws exist because of well known and researched pay inequity issues across wide swaths of the economy.<p>&gt; When asked about the rationale for the size of their paycheck, both workers and executives overwhelmingly point to one factor: Individual performance. And yet research shows that this belief is false and largely based on three myths people have about their pay: that you can separate it from the performance of others; that your job has an objective, agreed-upon definition of performance; and that paying for individual performance improves organizational outcomes. Instead, your pay is defined by four organizational forces: power, inertia, mimicry, and equity. The bad news is that these dynamics have reshaped the economy to benefit the few at the expense of the many. The good news is that, if pay isn’t some predetermined, rigid reflection of performance, then we can imagine a different world in terms of who is paid what, and how. -- Jake Rosenfeld, a top scholar of the US labor market.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Myth_of_meritocracy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Myth_of_meritocracy</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;2021&#x2F;02&#x2F;youre-not-paid-based-on-your-performance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;2021&#x2F;02&#x2F;youre-not-paid-based-on-your-perform...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41560679" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41560679" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kerkeslager</span><span>|</span><a href="#41558594">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41559090">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41562138">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41561275">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41560679">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41560679">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And, just because we&#x27;re paid well doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t be paid <i>better</i>.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41561275" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41561275" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eikenberry</span><span>|</span><a href="#41558594">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41559090">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41561447">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41561275">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41561275">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is no way to join w&#x2F;o having a job at a union shop.

The motivation of forming a firm over a collection of contractors “is to avoid some of the transaction costs of using the price mechanism” of the market [1]. Put another way, it’s the power of intra-firm communication and trust. That’s what you’re getting at in celebrating camaraderie and flexibility at start-ups.<p>When a firm is small, <i>i.e.</i> below Dunbar’s number, that intra-firm communication is implicit. Above that, however, at least <i>some</i> communications must be mediated. Unless one wants pure fucking chaos, that mediation requires formalised communication. We call that system bureaucracy.<p>Once you have bureaucracy, you’ve  lost the benefits of implicit communication. A large firm must thus either lose that culture entirely <i>or</i> constrain it to the top of the firm: elite group of fewer than 150 people, often much fewer, who have the flexibility to operate outside the bureaucracy and the camaraderie to trust each other with that power. (Or, again, pure fucking chaos. Almost every generation has shining examples of business leaders who want a big workforce with no bureaucracy.)<p>The former, bureaucracy all the way down, is conventional corporate management. This is where unions found their footing. The second, bureaucracy except at the top, is the “modern” way. (“Founder mode.”) It, more than traditional management, screams for unionisation because it explicitly creates a two-tier culture where agency is reserved to one side.<p>Note that I do not believe in antagonistic unions. They need the power to act, but ones with a trigger finger will put their companies (and themselves) out of business.

I worked at US Engineering, an MEP subcontractor.

That needs to cover all of the overhead of office jobs, it needs to cover legal because the final phase of construction is inevitably litigation, etc.<p>Software wasn&#x27;t unionized, but the pipefitter were, the welders I met were, unions were a very heavy presence.<p>&gt; You’ll go from having tight-knit and motivated teams building something awesome together to debating contracts.<p>Those pipefitters were very tight-knit, never saw them on the job debating contracts. They took a pride in their work that from an outsider seemed kinda strange, saying things like “welp, gotta go help Tyler make his next million.” (Tyler being the CEO and heir of the family business.)<p>I also know a former teacher who was head of her school&#x27;s branch of the teacher&#x27;s union, her teachers were relatively tight-knit, she did describe her particular job as handling and filing complaints and stuff, not so much contract negotiation though.<p>&gt; Top performers won’t be rewarded based on merit anymore because everything becomes about the collective.<p>At USE, merit became more important, not less. if you were getting a raise, you had to be able to justify to every other part of the company “hey why is she getting a raise and my people are not.” At Google it was “who can play the perf game best and talk the best talk,” at USE it was “my people made Tyler an extra hundred thousand, what did your people do.” The teacher friend, I didn&#x27;t ask, but it might be a moot point because during the Bush administration all publibly-funded schooling in the USA was transitioned to hard metrics and student outcomes, so it surely stands against your point but you would also surely say that it&#x27;s not a representative sample?<p>&gt; One of the many dope things about startups is the ability (i.e., necessity) to wear multiple hats, building something from 0 to 1. As the job roles become strictly defined, you lose that magic.<p>So the shop floor did have some very specialized roles. If you are a Master Welder, then the entire rest of the shop floor is basically set up to provide you the illusion that all you have to do to make Tyler money is to show up and weld every piece that is fed to you and inspect it and sign it. Someone else at the Cutter station will make sure that the pipe was cut the right length, someone at Tack-Up will take care of making sure that your parts are already tacked together so that you don&#x27;t have to hunt around for parts. Stuff like that. But the rest of the folks just wear 10 hats over the course of a day. Like until you have met people who work with their hands like woodworkers, you don&#x27;t quite have an appreciation for how much freedom one has to just make little tools or racks or a holding enclosure, just welding together some little crane because you got sick of having to sometimes hold this thing for a minute or two while others slid things into place. I want to say at one point they casually dropped “yeah we <i>rebuilt these doors</i> on the loading bay last month, so that we could load another skid into our trucks sometimes.”<p>Freedom to do stuff, they had! And with teaching, I mean, they load you with so much work that there&#x27;s no time but aside from the exact minutes of when a class is in your room, the teacher had creative freedom to teach in any way they wanted (and they needed this freedom because any given class has vastly different students with different learning needs). One personal contribution I made: “trashketball,” students could perform tasks on paper to earn the right to throw it into the trash to win either 2 or 3 points off their team. (A different teacher needed an approach to build a kinetic fun activity into their curriculum.)<p>&gt; Hard work and unique contributions should mean something, but they won’t in such an environment.<p>Like I don&#x27;t think this comment would have gotten me <i>decked</i> or anything if I’d said it to one of these construction workers, but it may have ended several conversations with “yeah I don&#x27;t work with Chris, that guy&#x27;s a prick.” I think that the teachers would agree that their hard work and unique contributions are deeply undervalued, but they would blame the taxpayer and the embezzlement-adjacent acts of some school administrators for most of that?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41562093" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41562093" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xingped</span><span>|</span><a href="#41558594">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41561447">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41560591">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41562093">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41562093">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Heck yeah!

I&#x27;m not going to speculate too hard on what that reason is, but it&#x27;s a profession older than those practiced by just about anyone on this forum, found across every culture, in every part of the world, at every time in history. You <i>could</i> say that it&#x27;s just the case that managers can abuse and extract value from their employees, and that certainly does occur, but in claiming that that&#x27;s all that management is you would be arguing for the greatest market failure in the history of mankind.

If you want to convince people to run remote teams, you need to figure out what the trade-offs they&#x27;re concerned about are and address them, not pretend they aren&#x27;t there at all.</div><br/><div id="41562815" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41562815" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fnordpiglet</span><span>|</span><a href="#41561901">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41562334">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41562770">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41562815">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41562815">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As someone who spent half his career in executive management of globomegacorps management is for the most part total bullshit.<p>Every global company is already working remotely because teams are spread out everywhere. Even if your team isn’t your dependencies are. The more senior you get the more you work on zoom these days. Before the pandemic it was in conference calls.<p>In fact the half assed in office approach is worse because not everyone is on the same foot. The remote offices from the leaders don’t get to have the on mute influence with the leader. When the call ends the people in the local room with the leader have a little meeting to make the real decisions. That’s grossly inefficient and unfair, to the point it’s started to make me sick to my stomach when I see it happen and I refuse to book rooms for in the office meetings.<p>In fact a role I had prior to the pandemic was figuring out how to shut down most offices of a megacorp to save money. We called it “bring your own office.”  We analyzed deeply the interactions and determined in a global corporation the percent of time we make better decisions in office was less than 20% or 1 day a week. When the pandemic hit our predictions came true. But our elderly CEO couldn’t understand how the strategy he agreed to to save money would work once his ideological hackles got raised so he mandated everyone return 5 days a week even tho we were then 5 years into the bring your own office plan he agreed to. There were no metrics or reason other than, basically, he likes working in the office because it made him successful in his career and he can’t conceive that anyone could do anything different.<p>There are people who work better in the office and having a small office with plenty of high quality meeting areas and private places to work is smart. Management should allow knowledge workers to work the way they work best and figure out how to maximize team efficiency as managers are required to do. It’s a hard job. I know. I’ve done it. But RTO is a short cut that fails to recognize the incredible inefficiencies inherent in the approach, especially in a global company.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41562770" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41562770" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">billti</span><span>|</span><a href="#41561901">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41562334">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41562328">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41562770">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41562770">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Who are you to tell neurodivergent employees to suffer?<p>I found this line telling.

We didn’t see any productivity decrease, generally speaking. But we all know the whole back-to-office thing is just because C-levels want to justify the grants from banks, investors, etc., by showing a “working office with people in there.” Middle managers wanted it back because, as it turned out to everyone, they were useless, so it was a justification for their positions. Additionally, real estate landlords lobbied to push it back because, without rent income, they wouldn’t be able to pay it back to the banks. The government has its reasons too, because it’s easier to focus on building small hubs and maintaining infrastructure for these offices instead of starting to work on rural areas. It ultimately shifts the power dynamics from the government, landlords, and banks to the average person, and that was an absolute no-no direction for them and had to be killed early on.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41562012" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41562012" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">op00to</span><span>|</span><a href="#41561324">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41561544">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41562069">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41561903">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41562012">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41562012">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m plenty invested in my company’s success and have worked both in office and for the last 15 years remotely.

They will increase this measurable impact by 60%+ by mandating another 2 days of office-work per week.<p>Much more likely, there are motives to doing this change that are not aligned with data and stated goals.

This is inherent in a hierarchical arrangement of power.  Managers then fundamentally attend to their own interest, which means having employees at home.

Managers were responsible for meeting plan targets, but to be more efficient the system as a whole needed decentralization, but managers had every incentive under the sun to maintain maximum control (useless and efficiency destroying as it was), and so decentralization never occurred.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41560860" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41560860" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">r0m4n0</span><span>|</span><a href="#41564407">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41565747">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41560860">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41560860">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Super commuters are going to start sweating.

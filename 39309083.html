I still use it regularly as it&#x27;s often quicker than using a calculator. Also, it has one great advantage over a calculator in that its scales are visual and often I can look along them to read off multiple solutions to a problem without even having to reposition the slide. That is, it has properties that not even calculators have.<p>This 2&#x2F;83N is also a prised possession of mine, it used to belong to my mechanical engineer father who bought it in the 1960s. It&#x27;s a wonderful tool and it&#x27;s in still perfect condition along with its case, instructions and its quick reference table (shame I can&#x27;t post a photo of it here).<p>I believe tools of this quality have historical value and I—as its temporary custodian—have a duty to look after it carefully.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39311628" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39311628" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacquesm</span><span>|</span><a href="#39312245">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39311432">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39311628">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39311628">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Coincidentally I&#x27;m making one right now.

A slide rule is a precision instrument, the cursor and the scales should be free of scratches, the cursor should slide freely but without play across the outside ways and the slides themselves should slide with some friction but never so much that you need to apply force. Low quality ones may have discolored to the point that using them is harder, the better quality ones came in a cover and should have been stored there. I&#x27;d probably avoid wood as the base material, it&#x27;s too unpredictable.<p>Dirt is fine, damage is not and slop is to be avoided.<p>In Europe Aristo made nice and affordable ones that sold in a hard plastic casing, if you can find one of those in the original sleeve it should be fine even if it has been sitting for three decades or more. Other good brands: Faber-Castell, Ahrend, Hemmi. You can find them for $10 or less if you look around for a bit.

   Choose scales you&#x27;ll use (typ 2 linear and 2 log, some have trig roots etc)
   Choose one with the precision you think you&#x27;ll need

I think most of them are plastic, but some feel better in the hands. There are of course metal, wood, and I think ivory. There are cylindrical ones, and all sorts of historical examples. If you&#x27;re going to carry it around you&#x27;ll want a case (or a pocket protector) to put it in.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39311354" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39311354" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dreamcompiler</span><span>|</span><a href="#39311432">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39311354">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39311354">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I still have my old slide rule (aluminum) and my Dad&#x27;s (wood).

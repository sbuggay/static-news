One of the biggest patterns is that whatever I consumed for the last 2 or 3 days pops up in my mind as a thought much more often than I&#x27;d want. So whatever my inputs are, it&#x27;s important.

It is an unique kind of experience, not just a different conceptualization of an everyday experience.<p>Buddhists say that you are where your attention is. So if a sound captures 100% of my attention, I am that sound. This feels strange on the surface, but when you look deeper into it, it reveals deep wisdom about the human experience.<p>In my understanding, it is possible, through years of practice (meditation etc.), to learn to direct your attention. Most of us have very limited capability to direct our attention, because we have not practiced it. Actually, modern life trains us to become less capable of directing our attention.<p>Based on your description, when you talk about &quot;focusing on one task&quot;, you describe a flow state where you are 100% absorbed in the task. In a way you have not consciously decided to focus your attention. (I use a very specific meaning for the word conscious here, it is more aligned with the buddhist sense of the word, instead of western sense of having-thoughts-about the thing).<p>Your attention has been captured by the task at hand. In a way you are lucky that an useful and productive task has captured your attention.<p>In my understanding, if you learn to direct and hold the attention consciously,  there is a next stage you can learn, where you become able to split your attention, to be conscious of two things at the same time.<p>If you direct some of your attention to the task at had, and some attention to a part in you observing yourself doing the task, then it feels as if the task is &quot;happening&quot;, instead of you &quot;doing&quot; the task.<p>When this happens, there are effects on the physical experience as well, such as time slowing down. I have been blessed with such experiences when dancing, It seems to be possible to have such experiences also without being able to consistently and consciously direct the attention, as I have been blessed with such experiences in my dancing.

So really wonder what this trailblazer thing is about.<p>Another very apparent shortcut to ADHD treatment, also not universally accepted, is called endogenous adrenaline - the simplest drug molecule as somebody (Neal Stephenson in Snow Crash if memory serves right) designated it, and extreme sports provide a lot of it for free. This article though, does not seem to be about any of these - adrenaline or sports. Extreme sports such as snowboarding, downhill biking, paragliding (not really a sport), motorbiking, etcâ¦ are all about said state of flow and attention. No other activities I can think of that impact ADHD so quick and profound. Cause you loose your attention only once with these things.</div><br/><div id="41831965" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41831965" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">devjab</span><span>|</span><a href="#41829523">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41831591">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41834852">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41831965">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41831965">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In Denmark where I am from mindfulness is actually a rather big part of ADHD mastering (or whatever they call learning to live with it these days). Exercise and medicine are also part of it, but learning skills to help you function are bigger. I think breathwork as you point out is individual. Here they tend to have you try out various ways of gaining focus through mindfulness though. The one which worked best for me is holding hands under water, like washing hands, others meditate, others again so the whole breath focus thing and so on.<p>I do think this article plays a little light on what you can do, and how much of it youâll need to do, to actually tame your attention. I do a lot of things. I donât keep my mobile phone near me when I donât want to use it. I do mindfulness. I plan to head out at 9:00 if Iâm really supposed to head out at 9:15 because that means Iâll get out at 9:13-9:17 and not stress about it leaving more energy to focus my attention. I do the drugs, in my case Lisdexamfetamin is the least shitty. I ride my bike everywhere. I walk in the woods. I do a lot of things like that and it helps, but itâs not like itâs quite as simple as this article might make it sound. Even if you do it in small steps.<p>I think the biggest difference between how we deal with ADHD and attention here and the article is that we donât focus on attention. We view ADHD as an âenergy deficiencyâ. This is because you pay attention to too many things with ADHD, which means you run out of energy sooner than regular people. At which point you canât pay attention to things that arenât interesting to you. What is worse is that youâll hyperfocus on things that, are, interesting and that will drain your energy as well. Youâll probably also forget to eat because you donât really feel hunger, again draining you. Anyway, to live with ADHD in Denmark is in large parts about managing a fuel tank which is simply much smaller than everyone elseâs. Because you need the fuel to pay attention.</div><br/><div id="41834115" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41834115" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hackernewds</span><span>|</span><a href="#41829523">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41831965">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41834852">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41834115">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41834115">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How do you get more energy? aka fuel</div><br/><div id="41835264" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41835264" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">larodi</span><span>|</span><a href="#41829523">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41834115">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41835358">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41835264">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41835264">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">With awe and inspiration perhaps.

And I must say it had tremendous effects. The times where I was doing active extreme sports (Downhill mountainbiking or Motocross in my case) have been those where I had my mind in the clearest possible state. It&#x27;s not only that my mind would calm down in that exact moment, but it lasted for quite a few days.<p>At first there was the adrenaline spike, when it wore off then the body exhaustion kicked in, and when my body started to recover, the week was almost over again and I could get another dose.<p>Over the past couple years I tried to avoid the risk a little and been just doing &quot;easy&quot; mountainbike tours. And oh boy, that&#x27;s the thing for me. I think only my brother can relate how that feels to me. It starts out like a normal bike ride, but my eyes are always on the outlook for some fun spots (where can I jump up&#x2F;over&#x2F;down? How long can I wheelie today? You name it..). This combined with hours of just mundane paddeling is the way for me. Keeps stress levels low and my mind at ease, plus a few fun adrenaline spikes.<p>BUT ritalin is still a great great relieve for me. Though I wish I would not need it. For now it works, but I&#x27;ll try to find habits that will hopefully make it obsolete one day.

It always blows my mind how much work people will put into this stuff without consulting&#x2F;citing the thousands of years of cognitive scientists that have been working on the problem, but thatâs more of a systemic problem; itâs what we get for describing the history of science as âfirst there was silly philosophy, and then in 1600 we finally figured out empiricism and actual&#x2F;real&#x2F;true science startedâ. I absolutely agree that cognitive science in general is about to take the world by storm as we learn more about our neurology (Google âDeWaveâ), and systematize philosophies.<p>The DOJ recently filed the first big post-Covid telehealth suit against a California ADHD treatment company (aka Adderal distribution) called Done, and itâs honestly fascinating to read the blog posts written by the founding doctor. His professional and philosophical opinion is that ADHD is a wildly underdiagnosed neurological state that can come and go over a lifetime, especially in reaction to attention-degrading âexocorticesâ as your article calls them. Obviously his credibility is damaged by the fact that he made ~$2.5M off that stance, but still, I think there might be something there. His favorite citation is Hippocrates, though Iâve never actually looked for the primary source heâs referring to.<p>The big exception to my complaint above is, in 2024, of course Stoicism, probably because itâs so damn <i>cool</i> (a book by an ancient general on how to be stronger? Sign me up!) and can be downright utopian when summarized in the right way, promising you eternal control.

It touched on some nuances of a topic Iâve been thinking about for some time.<p>Iâve stopped reading the news for a while now. There are times I only catch up on big news, weeks after they happen. The media tends to mix the important and the irrelevant, often adding sensationalism to stories that donât really matter to you, and an unguarded mind can easily fall for it. If something major happens, itâll reach you eventually. Everything else is mostly irrelevant and just a distraction. Worrying about things we canât control is a waste of our attention.<p>While ideas are often exaggerated, actions are undervalued. Yet small, intentional actions are the key to mental well-being. Adding a simple 10-minute routine to a part of your day can naturally help structure the moments before and after that routine. I believe these small steps are essential for cultivating balance in oneâs life.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41833967" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41833967" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">famahar</span><span>|</span><a href="#41835290">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41830793">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41833967">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41833967">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The best book I&#x27;ve read on attention and living in the present is &#x27;The art of noticing&#x27; by Rob Walker.

It was forced upon me under threat of punishment as a child and heavily exacerbated my OCD and tic syndrome, which led to further punishment anyway.<p>Learning to be okay with medication has taken a long time. But the last couple decades of research have made a few things clear. Importantly, ADHD has been shown to be a genetic disorder, wherein your brain simply doesn&#x27;t produce the same amount of dopamine receptors as a normal person.<p>This has a profound impact on your mood, executive functioning skills, motor function and more. Drugs which increase the dopamine available in your system can have negative effects (some extra dopamine gets shunted to your motor cortex and causes motor dysfunction&#x2F;aggravates tics) but when you consider that 60% of ADHD sufferers are also diagnosed with depression, or in my case a large comorbidity with OCD and bipolar disorder, it becomes clear how valuable medicine can be.<p>ADHD is beginning to be understood as a reward-deficiency syndrome [0] and in this light, meditation&#x2F;mindfulness and good habits are only coping mechanisms for an underlying condition which is ultimately genetic and massively aided by dopaminergic drugs. The result is literally night and day for many people, especially those who did not get diagnosed until adulthood and never developed coping mechanisms.<p>&gt; But making absolute statements about what people can or cannot do cuts both ways.<p>I just lost one of my best friends last year because I moved in with him and experienced incredible prejudice around my disorder, which he was convinced was made up and not real. He would wax on and on about mindfulness, and <i>constantly</i> get defensive and aggressive at the slightest, most inconsequential manifestations of my disorder, and it rapidly deteriorated my mental health at a time where I was already in dire need of a safe space. His bias and increasingly erratic response to my disorder made me feel unsafe until I had no choice but to leave. The entire experience was very traumatic and reminded me of all the times as a child that my disorders lead to punishment and physical abuse. Some people have mild ADHD and it might be a slight convenience for them, but in my case it has been a major defining aspect of my life with a long list of consequences over the years.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2626918&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2626918&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41830509" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41830509" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">afro88</span><span>|</span><a href="#41829486">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41829762">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41833404">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41830509">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41830509">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re right, but it&#x27;s a bit of an uncharitable take on the post.

Would I change in the same way the river changes color but still be the same person? And then I saw the curtains blowing wildly, and outside rain was falling harder, causing everyone to scurry and shout. I smiled. And then I realized it was the first time I could see the power of the wind. I couldnât see the wind itself, but I could see it carried the water that filled the rivers and shaped the countryside. It caused men to yelp and dance.<p>I wiped my eyes and looked in the mirror. I was surprised at what I saw. I had on a beautiful red dress, but what I saw was even more valuable. I was strong. I was pure. I had genuine thoughts inside that no one could see, that no one could ever take away from me. I was like the wind.<p>I threw my head back and smiled proudly to myself. And then I draped the large embroidered red scarf over my face and covered these thoughts up. But underneath the scarf I still knew who I was.

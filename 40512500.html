I imagine that price has more than doubled since. It caused my financial condition and professional development to crash and stall just as it was beginning. It’s impossible to know what might have been, but I sincerely believe that my circumstances, and the limited options for mitigating their long term effects, cost me (and by extension, society) at least 10x that initial bottom line cost in missed opportunities, and lost productivity&#x2F;wages.<p>What makes the issue so terribly entrenched, apart from our peculiar association between health insurance and employment, is how utterly opaque everything about healthcare costs are. Both systemically, in that it’s much more difficult to craft policy, as well as practically, in that for many (most?) individuals it can be impossible to know in advance how much any given course of treatment might cost, and no opportunities for “shopping around” or price comparisons.<p>For most Americans, and companies, I think our healthcare system is essentially a very short-sighted and inefficient tax. For others—people in situations such as mine, and very probably for a meaningful portion of the ~30M-50M Americans still uninsured&#x2F;underinsured—it’s an unreasonably high burden that accounts for so much more than just the money spent, and a constant specter clouding their lives in uncertainty and risks. For the self-employed and entrepreneurs, it’s a crucial consideration that defies simple calculations, and just by the averages will have prevented a significant number of potential endeavors from ever leaving the initial planning stage and&#x2F;or denied startups access to otherwise valuable talent. We should be pursuing bigger picture policies, and while I’m not arguing that the federal government is a good answer to everything, it’s clearly the answer to this kind of management of universal needs with clear societal benefits.<p>Sorry for the lengthy comment, my hamster brain was apparently restless.

When interest rates were &lt;1%, private equity was bidding up prices of businesses because it was a decent place to park money, but now that you can get 5.3% from a money market, the additional return from buying a business isn&#x27;t worth the risk.<p>&gt;<i>What about the tax implications of the sale.

His expectation was that I&#x27;ll keep a pretty large percentage after taxes because of Section 174. I had a large amount of expenses each year in software development from overseas contractors, and with Section 174 changes that went into effect in 2022, I had to amortize them over 15 years.[0] But with the liquidation of the company, I can count those expenses immediately, and they offset the income from the sale. So Section 174 is still a bad deal for software founders, but at least when you liquidate the company, you don&#x27;t have to wait out the full 15 years of amortized expenses.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.pragmaticengineer.com&#x2F;section-174&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.pragmaticengineer.com&#x2F;section-174&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="40514979" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40514979" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">runako</span><span>|</span><a href="#40512512">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40513450">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40514946">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40514979">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40514979">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Congratulations!<p>&gt; Yeah, from what I&#x27;ve heard, SaaS businesses sell for a much higher multiple, often selling as a multiple of revenue rather than earnings.<p>Adding some color as I have been through the process of selling a SaaS.

But once I started the sales process, that basically became non-viable because it meant I&#x27;d be investing thousands in software development, but it wouldn&#x27;t pay off for another year or so, so it would weaken our profit and loss statements and result in a lower valuation.<p>There were a lot of things like that, where I had to reject any investment that wouldn&#x27;t pay off in three months or less.<p>The other thing that was a bummer about preparing to sell was realizing that everything effectively becomes so much more expensive. Normally, if I want to give someone a $5k bonus, it costs me $5k. When I knew I was about to sell and wanted a 3x multiple, the $5k bonus effectively costs me $20k because it&#x27;s $5k for the bonus itself and then -$15k for the sale price on a 3x multiple. I could try to argue that the $5k is &quot;discretionary&quot; and therefore not part of SDE, but I think the buyer would be in their right to argue that it&#x27;s not discretionary, as it sets bonus expectations for future years.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;retrospectives&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;#what-would-make-recurring-subscriptions-worth-the-effort" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;retrospectives&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;#what-would-make-r...</a></div><br/><div id="40517672" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40517672" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">abtinf</span><span>|</span><a href="#40512512">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40516559">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40518424">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40517672">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40517672">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Everything was always that expensive, it was just less obvious.<p>What if you had moved to outsource the office tasks sooner?

The sale involved preparing reports that I&#x27;d never created before, and it was extremely important for me not to make any mistakes because I didn&#x27;t want the buyer to think I&#x27;d provided fraudulent information.<p>I also had to focus much more on short-term results than normal. Part of this was a lack of time to oversee complex projects, but the other part was that it&#x27;s to my detriment to invest in something that pays off in six months if I sell the company at month three. But I can&#x27;t run that way forever, so I knew if I tried to run the company like that indefinitely, I&#x27;d pay the penalty for always focusing on the short-term at the expense of long-term.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40515585" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40515585" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ativzzz</span><span>|</span><a href="#40512512">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40514813">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40516235">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40515585">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40515585">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; and we received pre-qualification for an SBA loan<p>What does this mean?

So many reasons!<p>The thing I really love about running a company of my own is that I don&#x27;t have to get anyone&#x27;s approval to do things. If I have an idea, I can work on it, and I don&#x27;t have to convince anyone or justify the time or money.<p>I also really love being able to choose my own hours, tools, and schedule. At Google, I found real-time chat distracting and net negative (I get that they bring value to some people, just not me), and I found that most meetings were a waste of time. At TinyPilot, we never used real-time chat, and we were deliberate and efficient about meetings.<p>At Google, I often found that things that were good for the company or my team or our customers were often not aligned with incentives for me (e.g., it was easier to get promoted for launching a complex feature than for a trivial feature that solved the problem elegantly). With my own small company, it&#x27;s much easier to align incentives between me, my teammates, and our customers.<p>I could go on and on, but I guess the underlying issue is that I place a high value on independence and autonomy, and no employer can match what I get on my own.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40519462" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40519462" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sgallant</span><span>|</span><a href="#40512512">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40516235">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40513028">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40519462">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40519462">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Congratulations on the sale and the upcoming baby!<p>There are a lot of comments here comparing the financial outcome of your TinyPilot journey Vs what could have been had you remained at Google.

The margins on pure software products are so high, so software businesses can afford to pay their software engineers really well. I&#x27;ve heard that typically hardware products sell for about 3-4x their bill of materials, so that eats up a huge chunk of your profits. And then there are all the other costs like storage, shipping, fulfillment that are nearly zero for a software business but significant for a hardware business.<p>I think for similar reasons, we don&#x27;t see a lot of successful hardware startups.

The cost of switching vendors in hardware is pretty high once you&#x27;ve built a pipeline around a particular vendor, so it&#x27;s important to have reliable vendors.

That said, I don&#x27;t want to overindex on this one experience, as I know other founders who found product-market fit more gradually.<p>But my experience with TinyPilot does support lessons I&#x27;ve been taught that you should launch early, potentially without even a working product ready. In previous projects, I&#x27;d gotten too excited about the engineering and convinced myself I needed it first, but TinyPilot was a really small amount of engineering before I started selling.<p>My other takeaway from TinyPilot was how much of a difference it makes to sell a product that&#x27;s aligned with my blog audience. I&#x27;m not really an IT blogger, but a lot of my readers are IT people and enthusiasts, so my blog was a huge advantage in finding early customers. My other products were things that had nothing to do with my blog like parsing recipe ingredients or finding live comedy.<p>I don&#x27;t have a strict plan for my next product, but I want to focus on things that I can test quickly and drop if I can&#x27;t find paying customers within the first two or three months.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40518797" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40518797" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Ahmd72</span><span>|</span><a href="#40515220">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40514588">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40518797">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40518797">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Been following your story from the beginning Michael, as around the time your tinypilot&#x2F;KVM came out, I was having the same issues but never occurred to me or had the energy to tackle it.

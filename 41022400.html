I had used it a bit at university but I was coming from a Python job so, naturally, I hated its syntax BUT:<p>1. The project was in ancient C++ for many reasons and even the most modern C++ is at least 5x more difficult to write code in than TCL.   So why write code that runs once in the life of the program in C++?  There&#x27;s often plenty of code that doesn&#x27;t benefit from being compiled - that looks for a configuration file, reads and validates lines and calls functions to build initial datastructures...setup code, string handling.  You save a millisecond or two by doing it in C++ but only once in a program that runs for hours - why waste all that dev&#x2F;debug effort?<p>If you choose judiciously then you can end up doing a lot of your performance insensitive, setup-type code in TCL and a great deal of the time you&#x27;ll be able to debug and fix bugs in an interpreted language without recompiling anything.<p>2. Python, though great, has a global interpreter lock. TCL fits in with threaded programs excellently.  This can be a make-or-break feature.<p>3. TCL&#x27;s syntax which I dislike, seems to map excellently into C - calling C from TCL just seems a lot easier than in python.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41022622" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41022622" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dang</span><span>|</span><a href="#41022970">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41022597">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41022622">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41022622">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Recent and related:<p><i>A brief interview with Tcl creator John Ousterhout (2023)</i> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41017367">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41017367</a> - July 2024 (56 comments)<p>Previous discussions of current submission:<p><i>Why you should not use Tcl (1994)</i> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14944103">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14944103</a> - Aug 2017 (52 comments)<p><i>Why you should not use Tcl (1994, &quot;The Tcl War&quot;)</i> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=7071479">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=7071479</a> - Jan 2014 (1 comment)</div><br/><div id="41023115" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41023115" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DonHopkins</span><span>|</span><a href="#41022622">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41022597">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41023115">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41023115">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Here&#x27;s another good TCL War discussion from July 3 2016:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12025218">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12025218</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vanderburg.org&#x2F;old_pages&#x2F;Tcl&#x2F;war&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vanderburg.org&#x2F;old_pages&#x2F;Tcl&#x2F;war&#x2F;</a><p>Also part 2:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vanderburg.org&#x2F;old_pages&#x2F;Tcl&#x2F;war2&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vanderburg.org&#x2F;old_pages&#x2F;Tcl&#x2F;war2&#x2F;index.html</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12027092">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12027092</a><p>DonHopkins on July 3, 2016 | parent | context | favorite | on: The Tcl War (1994)<p>&gt;Around the time leading up to the TCL war, Lua was peacefully and quietly born in a manger at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil:<p>&gt;&quot;In 1993, the only real contender was Tcl, which had been explicitly designed to be embedded into applications. However, Tcl had unfamiliar syntax, did not offer good support for data description, and ran only on Unix platforms. We did not consider LISP or Scheme because of their unfriendly syntax. Python was still in its infancy. In the free, do-it-yourself atmosphere that then reigned in Tecgraf, it was quite natural that we should try to develop our own scripting language ... Because many potential users of the language were not professional programmers, the language should avoid cryptic syntax and semantics. The implementation of the new language should be highly portable, because Tecgraf&#x27;s clients had a very diverse collection of computer platforms. Finally, since we expected that other Tecgraf products would also need to embed a scripting language, the new language should follow the example of SOL and be provided as a library with a C API.&quot;<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lua.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;hopl.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lua.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;hopl.pdf</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29379272">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29379272</a><p>&gt;For Netscape in 1995, I believe Python would have been a better choice than JavaScript, but Lua would have been an even better choice, given how much smaller, simpler, and more efficient Lua is, and the eventual excellence of LuaJIT.

And he topped it off with Tk. Tcl&#x2F;Tk took off in a huge way. It was easy to understand. The source code, written in Mr. Ousterhout&#x27;s methodical and lucid style, was a joy to read. At the time, about the most convenient option for developing a GUI to run on a unix system was to write C code against the Motif toolkit - an ugly, expensive, and frequently disappointing process. With Tcl&#x2F;Tk in hand, people started handing out new &quot;mini-GUIs&quot; for this and that, like candy. Tcl&#x2F;Tk started to find application in some rather intense areas, like, for example, the &quot;control station&quot; software for some oil rigs. It was a smash hit.<p>&gt;Meanwhile, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m letting too many cats out of the bag here, the informal Silicon Valley social network of well placed hackers were quietly and unofficially circulating some very interesting confidential whitepapers from Sun Microsystems. One of their researchers, a fellow called Mr. Gosling, had dusted off a language he&#x27;d once led the design of called &quot;Oak&quot;. Oak was originally intended for use in embedded systems. Its basic premise was that devices ought to be Turing complete and hackable, whenever possible. Oak&#x27;s approach to statically verifiable byte-code comes from that origin. Mr. Gosling came out of Carnegie Mellon University and the attiude behind Oak was popular there. As one grad student had quipped a few years earlier: &quot;If a light switch isn&#x27;t Turing Complete I don&#x27;t even want to touch it.&quot;<p>&gt;In light of the rising star of web browsers, the folks at Sun conceived the notion of offering up a derivative of Oak to serve as the extension language for browsers. (It is probably worth mentioning here that Mr. Gosling was earlier well known for making one of the very first unix versions of Emacs.) Oak was re-named &quot;Java&quot; and the rest of its history is fairly well known.<p>&gt;I&#x27;ve read, since then, that up to around that point Brendan Eich had been working on a Scheme-based extension language for Netscape Navigator. Such was the power of the hegemony of the high level folks at Sun that the word came down on Mr. Eich: &quot;Get it done. And make it look like Java.&quot; Staying true to his sense of Self, he quickly knocked out the first implementation of Mocha, later renamed Javascript. This phenomenon of Sun&#x27;s hegemony influencing other firms turns out to be a small pattern, as you&#x27;ll see.<p>&gt;Mr. Ousterhout was hired by Sun (later he would spin off a Tcl-centric start-up). The R&amp;D; team there developed a vision:<p>&gt;Java would be the heavy-lifting extension language for browsers. The earliest notions of the &quot;browser as platform&quot; and &quot;browser as Microsoft-killer&quot; date back to this time. Tcl, Sun announced, was to become the &quot;ubiquitous scripting language of the Internet&quot;. Yes, they really pimped that vision for a while. And it was &quot;the buzz&quot; in the Valley. It was that pronouncement from the then-intimidating Sun that led to the Tcl wars.<p>&gt;Mr. Eich, bless his soul, brute-forced passed them, abandoning Scheme and inventing Javascript.

Their domain of expertise is hardware. These shops also have not had for the most part a cohesive culture that spanned projects.

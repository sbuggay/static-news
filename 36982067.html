It may very well be that chronic Lyme&#x27;s disease does not exist, but the arguments that claim this still appear to miss some key points.<p>The argument that chronic Lyme&#x27;s disease does not exist relies on the existence of a reliable test for Lyme&#x27;s disease. The article questions the existence of such a test. If the tests are not reliable, any research that uses the tests to deduce that chronic Lyme&#x27;s disease does not exist, is not reliable either.<p>There are researchers that believe in the existence of the chronic Lyme&#x27;s disease. They have some arguments on why it is difficult to test, eradicate and even understand Lyme&#x27;s disease.<p>First argument is that Lyme&#x27;s disease is actually an amalgam of several diseases that work synergetically, such as borreliosis, babesiosis and bartonella. If you are cure one, the others take over, and make the body more suspective for the re-emergence of the cured disease.<p>Second argument is that apparently the side effects of the diseases are not actually caused by the disease itself, but poisons released during the die-off of the disease. This is called Herxheimer reaction. So, more you are able to cure, the worse you feel, initially. That is why it is difficult to recognize what is helpful in curing the disease and what is harmful.<p>Third argument is that borreliosis has been observed (by microscope) to change form, and &quot;hide&quot; within other micro-organisms and blood cells. Spiral form is only one of the forms. Perhaps antibiotics can only cure some of the forms?</div><br/></div></div><div id="36992902" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36992902" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">unyttigfjelltol</span><span>|</span><a href="#36996044">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36993771">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36992902">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36992902">[16 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Lyme apparently has been proven to be in the wild since time immemorial and thus the headline is nonsense.[1]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencealert.com&#x2F;congress-is-investigating-whether-the-us-actually-infected-americans-with-lyme-disease" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencealert.com&#x2F;congress-is-investigating-wheth...</a></div><br/><div id="36993048" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36993048" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dawnofdusk</span><span>|</span><a href="#36992902">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36997107">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36993048">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36993048">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not saying that I believe in the conspiracy theory, but can&#x27;t the disease exist naturally while also being the subject of bioweapon research?

Thats the justification part for this development which is probably labelled as &quot;proof of concept&quot; in much the same way a variety of drugs will be tested against a variety of bacteria or virus for medical research, in case its found in the wild.<p>Man has been selectively breeding stuff for hundreds of years, animals like pedigree dogs, cats, livestock, plants, why wouldn&#x27;t the military of any country despite international agreements find ways to get around those agreements.<p>Just look at the US nuclear stockpile, the US didn&#x27;t proliferate new weapons, they merely upgraded the existing nukes and upgrading wasn&#x27;t in any agreement.<p>And if we were to have a perfectly encapsulated bubble of safety, how much would the population levels increase by more than we currently see with todays accidents?<p>Survival of the fittest has evolved to include modern day living.<p>When thinking about the ever lasting lightbulb, if man stopped developing light bulbs of sorts, would we have got to have created the led light bulb as quickly?<p>So conspiracy theories do exist, because we hear them, but they serve many purposes in society, they can smooth over events, they can be educational, they can be used to draw certain types of people out into the open who arguably have health complaints or a drug problem of sorts, which could be worded as a chemical imbalance.<p>Take covid, it funnelled money into drug companies, AI&#x27;s were developed to speed up the making of vaccines which have now started to apply to other viruses, at the same time, the planet was given a rest from our daily activities, insect numbers started to rise, police were able to catch up with criminals that they have been trying to track down for ages, in fact the excuses for catching a lot of criminals was one of the covid successes that hasnt been discussed much, we all got forced into working remotely to get used to not having to commute, bosses and managers had to deal with that loss of instant dictatorship and fire fighting and start to plan more. There&#x27;s a whole host of reasons for covid to have been released on this planet which is why I say it was a biological weapon if it wasn&#x27;t people having panic attacks and a sudden rise of pseudomonas in the lungs like cystic fibrosis sufferers experience due to a sudden influx of iron in their diet, perhaps caused by eating more meat and thus iron during lockdown.<p>So CT&#x27;s do exist, but what is its purpose is probably a better question to ask.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36997107" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36997107" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">boffinAudio</span><span>|</span><a href="#36992902">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36993048">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36993403">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36997107">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36997107">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The fact that it exists in the wild means its a perfect vector for covert experimentation as its natural presence provides the cover of plausible deniability needed for all governments to perform biological experiments on their citizens...</div><br/></div></div><div id="36993403" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36993403" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">m463</span><span>|</span><a href="#36992902">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36997107">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36994212">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36993403">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36993403">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">smallpox was around before it was first used as a bioweapon.</div><br/><div id="36993486" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36993486" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">unyttigfjelltol</span><span>|</span><a href="#36992902">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36993403">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36994212">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36993486">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36993486">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Lyme&#x27;s incubation is long and impact on infected people uncertain, which makes it useless as a bioweapon.

If it was a bioweapon, do you think they were engineering a fully synthetic bacterial genome <i>de novo</i>? In the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s, decades before the first publicly known successes with fully synthetic genomes in the 2000s?<p>It would be far more reasonable to assume they were working from a reference species, selectively breeding, maybe inducing mutations or engaging in some rudimentary gene editing (although the latter seems unlikely).<p>2) The genetic distribution doesn&#x27;t support the conspiracy theory<p>&gt; Population genetics research on Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterial agent of Lyme disease, suggest that the northeastern, Midwestern and Californian bacteria are separated by geographical barriers that prevent these populations from mixing.<p>&gt; Had there been a lab strain, particularly one engineered to be more transmissible, that escaped within the last 50 years, there would be greater genetic similarity between these three geographic populations. There is no evidence for a recent single source â such as a release from a lab â for Lyme disease spirochetes.<p>Keeping in mind the counterargument to point 1) above, this argument is wild. If we assume that a weaponized form of <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> was created from a wild specimen, we would absolutely expect specific variants to only exist in certain regions, particularly the region in which the conspiracy theories allege an outbreak of the weaponized form occurred. The paper the author references here even notes that the worst strains were not found in California [0]:<p>&gt; Eight of the most common ospC genotypes in the northeastern United States, including genotypes I and K that are associated with disseminated human infections, were absent in Mendocino County nymphs.<p>This all seems very consistent with the most likely scenario if there was in fact an effort to weaponize the bacteria and it was released in the northeast.<p>3) Lyme isn&#x27;t a good bioweapon<p>&gt; One of the most important characteristics of a biowarfare agent is its ability to quickly disable target soldiers.<p>Unless the goal is to softly neutralize Communist sympathizers, unfriendly foreign leaders, and left wing politicians.

The inclusion criteria were: 1. neurological limb paralysis with a disability score &gt;4 according to the EDSS Kurtzke disability scale; 2. serological tests pointing to an involvement of the main tick-borne microorganisms Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., Babesia, Anaplasma, and Bartonella; 3. a general disease for more than 6 months with fatigue, pain and subjective cognitive deficit. The patients were administered long-term treatments with repeated cycles (at least three) of 35-day IV ceftriaxone and repeated oral regimens of azithromycinâdoxycycline and azithromycinâdoxycyclineârifampicin. For Babesia, repeated courses of atovaquoneâazithromycin were administered. Ten patients had intractable or severe motor deficits before treatment in the context of Borrelia (two cases) BorreliaâBabesia (four cases), BorreliaâBabesiaâAnaplasma (two cases), BorreliaâBabesiaâAnaplasmaâBartonella (one case) and BabesiaâAnaplasma (one case). For several months, five had been in wheelchairs, and four had been walking with sticks. Seven patients out of 10 (70%) showed complete remission after a mean active treatment duration of 20.1 + 6.6 months, with a mean number of 4 ceftriaxone cycles. Three patients showed an initial remission but suffered secondary antibiotic&#x2F;antiparasitic-resistant motor recurrences. Among the nine patients with Borrelia serologic positivity, treatments obtained complete remission in seven cases (77%). The findings of this ten-case series suggest the usefulness of long-term antibiotic&#x2F;antiparasitic treatments in patients with severe late tick-borne neurological deficits with highly significant elements of tick-borne involvement.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC10294829&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC10294829&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="36995383" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36995383" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cpncrunch</span><span>|</span><a href="#36994191">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36995073">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36994420">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36995383">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36995383">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a study into late untreated borreliosis (a real thing), which is very different from &#x27;chronic lyme&#x27;.</div><br/><div id="36995476" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36995476" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mschwarz</span><span>|</span><a href="#36994191">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36995383">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36994420">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36995476">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36995476">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Can you elaborate on the difference between the terms âlate untreated borreliosisâ and âchronic Lyme diseaseâ?

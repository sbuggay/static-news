The Apple II was the only other computer I had ever used, and so my worldview was that BASIC was how you interacted with a computer. My Radio Shack carried Rainbow magazine and had lots of back issues available, and they were just absolutely delicious to me as a kid with all the program listings and ads for new hardware.<p>What totally confused me at the time though were program listings in assembly (I couldn&#x27;t figure out how you were meant to type those in) and especially the discussions of OS-9. I didn&#x27;t know what it was, and even in some cases where I found a Radio Shack with the Tandy OS-9 distro, it was like 100$ and didn&#x27;t have any games as near as I could tell, so I couldn&#x27;t figure out why you would pay so much for it. Also I lived in a rural location where even the nearest 6809-oriented BBS would have meant expensive toll calls, so I missed the opportunity to learn that way.<p>Anyway skip forward, I started to college in 1993, immediately found Usenet, then Linux, and spent the next 30 years or so steeped in that world. Every so often I would go back and do a little reading on the 6809 world, but because I had never really understood most of what was going on, I didn&#x27;t have a great deal of nostalgia.<p>Finally though, a few weeks ago I came across a link (maybe here?) to a release of the VCC emulator, and although I had played with a couple of 6809 emulators before, I hadn&#x27;t really gone down the rathole of finding the MultiPak roms, or hard disk controller paks, etc. I found a couple of hard drive images, one from the NitrOS9 Ease of Use project, and another random NitrOS9 image packed with old software. What was particularly fascinating to me was the NitrOS9 source itself- since my introduction to Unix was in the 486-MMU-having-era, to see what people were able to do with a 6809 and an assembler was just a joy to read and understand.<p>I feel like probably everything that has ever needed doing on a 6809 has probably been done, and I&#x27;ve done enough 8 bit assembly stuff in school that I don&#x27;t have a powerful urge to go back and make something myself, but boy what a feeling of having come full circle when I cd&#x27;d into the NitrOS9 source directory and found a makefile of all things! I feel so fortunate to have been able to live through a time of such explosive growth and change, and hope to get the chance to do a little OS-9 hacking when I retire some day :)</div><br/><div id="38624063" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38624063" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ansible</span><span>|</span><a href="#38617952">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38619583">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38623504">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38624063">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38624063">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Nice. I had gotten started with a CoCo 1 with just 16KiB of RAM. That eventually got upgraded to 64KiB and <i>Extended</i> Color BASIC.  That made it easier to copy ROM cartridges and save them to cassette tape. One trick there was to cover over or cut the trace to a pin on the cartridge that prevented it from automatically starting.  That was handy for switching between BASIC and the EDTASM+ ROM.<p>One use of all that was to fix the CoCo&#x27;s clone of the arcade video game Galaxian, called Galactic Attack[1]. The CoCo had analog joysticks, and the writer of Galactic Attack thought it would be neat to have the ship you control track the X axis of the joystick. Except it would be unfair to whip the joystick from one side of the screen to the other while avoiding the enemy shots. So in the Galactic Attack game, the player ship <i>lazily</i> tracked the position of the joystick, moving slowly to the position of the stick. In practice this made the player ship hard (for me) to control and felt unresponsive. And it made it hard to hold still in the case an enemy bomb was close by.<p>I had already modified one of my Atari 2600 joysticks to work on the CoCo (probably a Rainbow magazine article). So what I did next was to modify the joystick routine to just create three zones (move left, dead zone, move right) for the X axis values.  The game may or may not have been written with all relative branches (instead of absolute), so I might have had to fix that too.<p>Good times.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lcurtisboyle.com&#x2F;nitros9&#x2F;galacticattack.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lcurtisboyle.com&#x2F;nitros9&#x2F;galacticattack.html</a></div><br/><div id="38624163" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38624163" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacquesm</span><span>|</span><a href="#38617952">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38624063">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38623504">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38624163">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38624163">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">CoCo had a UK clone made called the Dragon 32, which under the hood actually shipped with 64K ram, some careful tweaking and copying of the ROM to it&#x27;s own spot allowed you to switch that upper 32K on and suddenly your ROM was RAM which meant you could extend the basic interpreter.

Community mattered, even back then! The 6800 was laid out much more sensible from an instruction set perspective, the term used is &#x27;orthogonality&#x27;, if you know the rules you can predict the existence of a particular mnemonic and parameters easily, whereas with the 6502 it was mostly a matter of learning it all by heart. Easy to do because both were tiny in comparison with todays CPUs. I suspect that&#x27;s where the GP&#x27;s nightmare comment relates to, the fact that the 6502 always felt like it could have been so much better if they had spent a bit more time on this subject.<p>The 6800, it&#x27;s more modern and upgraded brother, the 6809 and the <i>much</i> larger 68000 all were much more logical and predictable. The Z80 became widespread due to - amongst others - Sinclair with the ZX-80 and ZX-81, and Radio Shack using them in their line of TRS-80 micro computers, and a large number of people cut their teeth on those. I had access to them at work (I worked for Tandy on Saturdays, which was the European name for RS) and never found that chip much to my liking, but it was the engine behind the CP&#x2F;M software environment.<p>Programming in assembler (or even directly in machine code) is an exercise in abstraction to the point that you have to have a very good memory and to be able to limit the scope of what you are doing to be able to make any progress at all. But it beat the pants of BASIC (the most common alternative on micro computers at the time) in terms of speed and control so if you wanted to do anything serious with those machines that&#x27;s how you did it.<p>The 6502 had awesome hardware support in terms of peripherals and the machines you found it in (with the BBC Micro model &#x27;B&#x27; as the pinnacle of home computing at the time) and the 6800&#x2F;6809 had an edge if you wanted to roll your own system from scratch. Various bus based systems (S-100, Eurocards, VME) gave you the option to build systems and to swap out the CPU with something else. The BBC again led the way here by speccing a bus called &#x27;the Tube&#x27; (a pun on the London underground) that allowed you to build specialist co-processors that used the original BBC as an I&#x2F;O processor.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38619092" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38619092" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">julian55</span><span>|</span><a href="#38619627">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38617909">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38619092">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38619092">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I liked the 6800, it was the first microprocessor I used, back in 1975.

As late as 1981, Intel was focused on the various products that microprocessors could be designed into, such as clothes dryers and sprinkler systems. It&#x27;s hard to imagine from the modern perspective, but the selection of the 8088 for the IBM PC was just another application. Intel viewed the iAPX 432 as their processor for real computing. Take a look at the cover of Intel&#x27;s 1981 annual report which lists some of the 10,000 products that used microprocessors, putting personal computers down on the list between cameras and solar energy system control: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intel.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;dam&#x2F;doc&#x2F;report&#x2F;history-1981-annual-report.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intel.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;dam&#x2F;doc&#x2F;report&#x2F;history-1981-an...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="38620042" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38620042" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dboreham</span><span>|</span><a href="#38618414">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38619532">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38620319">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38619578">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38620042">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38620042">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This isn&#x27;t true.

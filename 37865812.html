No doubt not complete but attractive overviews.<p>&gt; At some point some videos might address the startup world?<p>It’s arguable how relevant startups are to current HN users, now that you mention it. Or, to put it another way, it’s arguable how relevant that gatekeeping is to HN; downvoting submissions isn’t a feature for a reason, and flagging is for posts that violate HN guidelines.<p>I am mostly kidding, but I couldn’t resist poking fun at:<p>0) my own expense as an HN user;<p>1) a HN user’s dismissal of a frontpage post on HN, which seems oxymoronic, and  possibly against HN guidelines when such dismissal is not just of the content of the OP but also of HN and its users, as it seems implied that FP posts belong on HN axiomatically, tacitly, and implicitly, as the users of HN have made it so by voting;<p>2) at how subtly insipid and at once droll it is to be you and me, stand-ins in for HN writ large:<p>me liking this post and Asianometry, writing this comment, then posting to to HN in response to you;<p>you who backhandedly compliments OP by extension and offhandedly praises HN by proxy, both of us earnest and with good intentions, knowing that likely nothing will change, yet locked in this vicious cycle of posting and commenting, call and response, tit for tat, no rhyme or reason, not quite forever but almost, til the heat death of the universe, all matter quantum tunneling to lead and so isolated from all other matter that any kind of interaction is literally and metaphorically impossible, at which point there is no more OP, HN, you, or me, and yet, there’s so much nothing that quantum foam virtual particles cause an entirely new universe or enough thereof to cause another Big Bang just springs into existence;<p>3) the fact that it may not be the first time this has happened before.<p>It stands to reason that it’s the users of HN who determine what is relevant to them, and which posts reach the top, such as this post right here, and that arguably such posts as reach the frontpage belong on HN as voted on by HN, QED.<p>That said, I’m not trying to be pedantic or to insult you here, though your comment seems to “damn with faint praise” while also implying that the HN voters who posted and upvoted this submission and also Asianometry YouTube  channel subscribers are wrong to like what they like, this post.<p>Furthermore, the rest of your comment and even the parts I was critical of are in a superposition as regards the HN guidelines; for, by posting your comment, you may have ensured not just the survival of HN by creating original content, you have ensured that my post in response was on this, our shared timeline, possibly even ensuring the survival of the human species into perpetuity, one can hope.<p>For all that and more, for the same reasons I hope you made it this far with me in my comment, I hope my upvote brings you solace in the endless time we have left, and that it brings you comfort in the boundless possibilities we have yet to contemplate, yet alone calculate.<p>If you made it this far, it’s already too late. Don’t worry though: this is not the beginning of the end, just the end of the beginning.<p>Thank you for reading. You’ve been a great commenter and certainly prompted me to write a doozy myself. To you, to OP, to the rest of HN and the wider internet at large, to all of us here and those who have gone before, please bow your heads, raise your glasses, and join me in a toast to our past, our present, and our future posts. They are not yet written. Please tip your dang.<p>&#x2F;s</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37866962" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37866962" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zubairq</span><span>|</span><a href="#37866724">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37866962">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37866962">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks, being half Asian myself this channel is a great find!</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

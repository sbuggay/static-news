There may well be some system of notation that is superior to the standard that has developed in Western music; but nothing I’ve seen matches the expressive flexibility and compactness of the way music is now notated.<p>Experienced players read music in a way that overcomes some of the limitations that form the assumptions that are behind these alternative notation systems. Instead of looking at a measure as a collection of individual notes that must be perceived, interpreted and executed in sequence, they take it in as a chunk. (I imagine reading code must be similar.) This is why the density of traditional notation isn’t intimidating - after a while it can be read as a whole.<p>Whether a system like this could be a pedagogical bridge to formal notation remains to be seen. I’ve encountered such bridging systems before. I’m an admitted skeptic because my orientation to this is that if you want to learn a thing, just start learning the thing. The struggle, within limits, is known to enhance learning.</div><br/><div id="37620625" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37620625" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">_gabe_</span><span>|</span><a href="#37616384">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37618483">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37620625">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37620625">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Instead of looking at a measure as a collection of individual notes that must be perceived, interpreted and executed in sequence, they take it in as a chunk.<p>I’m not professional, but I have been playing for awhile and can sight-read fairly easily. What you said here is 100% true, and I liken it to learning to read a language. Watch how kids learn to read, they have to look at each syllable and letter and sound out each word. Eventually, after enough practice, you don’t read individual letters, you read words. Then, you begin to observe the nuance of the grammatical structure.<p>I feel like reading music notation has followed a similar trend for myself. I no longer read individual notes, I see chords and progressions. Just like stories tend to follow a plot line, and you can predict how the story may end, music follows a plot line, and you can predict the movement. This is also why certain styles of music is so interesting! We expect the plot to move in a direction and then are surprised by the twist. This video by 8 bit music theory gives a good overview of how that can be done[0].<p>I especially love when I’m playing through a new piece and every part of the song just makes sense. Yiruma’s music in particular feels very natural for me, and it’s an absolute joy to play through the song and have it all flow together so well.<p>Anyways, I think a lot of people just don’t give it enough time and give up a bit too early. It’s magical when you pass that point of reading individual notes and enter into the territory of really reading pieces. I still have so far to go, but music will always be a relaxing and fulfilling hobby.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;gzK1CTxxRH0?si=H3aUQo83lVl-2BQK" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;gzK1CTxxRH0?si=H3aUQo83lVl-2BQK</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37618483" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37618483" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">heleninboodler</span><span>|</span><a href="#37616384">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37620625">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37616713">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37618483">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37618483">[14 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I spent decades not understanding music theory and thinking of music as a sequence of notes, and I never understood why music notation and the layout of a piano were so bizarre.

I&#x27;m <i>far</i> from an expert), I&#x27;ve realized that both sheet music and the piano layout are both very clever in unexpected ways that, as you point out, make the music notation both expressive and more compact than a straight timeline of linear note values, because they lean on the fact that sections of music tend to skip very predictable parts of the range of notes.  They tend to use them in particular patterns that make it useful to reduce your focus to a subset of the available range at any given moment.</div><br/><div id="37619007" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37619007" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">patmorgan23</span><span>|</span><a href="#37616384">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37618483">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37618969">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37619007">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37619007">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah, it even goes down to the physics of harmonics.<p>There&#x27;s this absolutely wild video by Adam nealy about how polyrhythms are actually cords.

I&#x27;m not buying it. The commonality is very stretched (notes are ratios, and chords are several ratios together). That&#x27;s like saying &quot;code is actually poetry, both are based on the arrangement of alphabet symbols groupped in small blocks&quot;. More something for a TedX talk, than something practicing composers and musicians have in mind when using either.<p>For starters, in chords the ratios are stacked vertically (multiple &quot;ratio&quot; notes played together at once), in polyrhythms horizontally. In chords it carries harmonic information, where polyrhythms can and are just as well be played with unpitched drums and percussion. And in general they serve different purposes. You can have chords playing without any polyrhythm in the rhythm side or play monophonic lines with polyrhythms.</div><br/><div id="37620251" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37620251" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wheels</span><span>|</span><a href="#37616384">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37619348">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37620166">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37620251">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37620251">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I just watched the first half of the talk, and it&#x27;s pretty interesting.

Fifty years later, I still play the piano every day, but the only reading I do is occasionally looking at the chords and melody lines for jazz standards.<p>The music theory I learned when young has been very helpful over the years, and it would have been more difficult for me to absorb it then without using standard music notation. But I no longer think about music in terms of notes on a stave; I have gradually developed my own mental representation of it.<p>I still listen to classical music, and I do wish that I had acquired and maintained better sight-reading skills so that playing it would be a pleasure for me now rather than a chore.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37621282" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37621282" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vidarh</span><span>|</span><a href="#37616384">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37619211">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37620519">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37621282">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37621282">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m a very mediocre pianist, and my take would be that I&#x27;m not looking for a bridge because I know I&#x27;ll never spend enough time to be <i>good</i> and I don&#x27;t care about getting good, but I enjoy sitting down and playing (butchering) some pieces now and again.

Personally I&#x27;m happiest when I&#x27;m able to step away from the sheet music, but I also read to an intermediate level.<p>It turned out what got me much more fluent with sheet music reading was copying out some scores that were a little bit of a stretch for me, at the time, due to having multiple performances of same music at short notice.<p>For most music I play (I&#x27;m on sax in a couple of street bands) I much prefer to have internalised the music and be able to operate from memory based on knowing the key and some intuition of the harmonic structure.  In fact if I know a tune too well the sheet music starts to throw me if I try reading and playing.<p>Intuition is important.  The fact that I already had good intuition on the sax, but that it was a struggle on the piano is what made me stop piano lessons because getting better at piano was eating in to my getting better at the sax time too much.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37619194" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37619194" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">whartung</span><span>|</span><a href="#37616384">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37620519">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37619909">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37619194">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37619194">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Far from left field related.<p><pre><code>  &gt; Instead of looking at a measure as a collection of individual notes that must be perceived, interpreted and executed in sequence, they take it in as a chunk.

Look at the cover image. I can see a few notes. I can see vastly more notes in sheet music. I can easily evaluate if the piece is playable, I can scan and look for broader patterns. I can see that a bass note is being held for 8 measures (and I may choose to repeat it at some point). I can look ahead quite a bit. I can understand the repeat structures - don&#x27;t gasp, but you don&#x27;t have to take repeats, or you can repeat more times than written, especially with 20th+ century music, where you are often expected to do things like choose your own ordering of measures or blocks of measures. There are fingerings. I can see if the composer is writing out finger pedaling explicitly  (Couperin normally does, Bach normally doesn&#x27;t). I can see the pedal markings, general contours of dynamics. I can see the trills, etc., which are often just suggestions rather than hard requirements. I can see the meter, meter changes, keys, key changes, accidentals. I can see a big scary chord coming up and spend a bit more time looking at it while I play a few measures behind. I can see that Bach is repeating a phrase a 5th down, or inverting it, or reversing it. I can see the difference between passages meant to be played in time, and fioritura type writing.<p>I haven&#x27;t used these piano roll systems so there are undoubtedly some things that are nice about it for an experienced player that I don&#x27;t know about, so that paragraph is one sided. But that one side is very important - I&#x27;d loathe to go without them, and can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;d ever trade them for whatever advantage the piano roll might bring. After all, a player can take a sheet of paper Chopin wrote, produce that music at a more or less performance level. So it gives you about everything you need. I could imagine a current composer might find something more expressive about the piano roll (maybe expressing note durations not evenly subdivided by 2 or 3).<p>I suspect there is something neurological happening that stops some people from sight reading well, just like some people struggle with text. I&#x27;ve read accounts of people trying for years, with seemingly good practice techniques, still struggling.<p>So things like this, synthasia, etc., seem to have a niche. But in general, I suggest, think about someone proposing an app that instead of displaying printed text output it sonically. Great boon for certain situations or people! Undoubtedly someone is using one to read this very post. But a terrible replacement for reading in general.<p>If a six year old was relying on screen readers because reading is too hard to learn, after testing for dyslexia and vision problems, you&#x27;d urge them to make the effort; the advantages of reading text vastly outweighs the 1st grade difficulties of learning to read (yes, that time span will differ by language and writing system, not the point). Literacy is empowering, and arguing that the auto mechanic down the street can&#x27;t read yet makes a good living is probably not a convincing argument to not teach a child to read.<p>I learned to sight read at age 4-5 with a plastic brain (I recall my mother having to teach me the letters a-g, and how to write them, for example), so I may underestimate the difficulties of learning later in life. But if you are in a situation where some kind of notation is helpful (again, not all are), learn standard notation!<p>edit: I thought of a counter-example. Say you play in a band. You can record your output to midi, and then share it with others. You can quantize midi and turn it into sheet music, but chances are you playing is not rhythmically exact. Sight reading that sort of thing is painful (notes carry 1&#x2F;16th note into the next measure, that sort of thing), and I imagine a piano roll would often be easier.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37620291" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37620291" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">keithalewis</span><span>|</span><a href="#37616384">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37619568">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37617302">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37620291">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37620291">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; if you want to learn a thing, just start learning the thing<p>This.

Whether those things are necessary or useful depends mostly on what genre you&#x27;re interested in playing.<p>Some genres, like rock and folk music, involve little or no written material. There are certainly players who have never read music from a sheet. I attend a week-long folk music camp every summer, and there&#x27;s no sheet music. I perform jazz &quot;standards&quot; in small ensemble settings entirely by ear.<p>But I also belong to a 19-piece jazz ensemble, that plays from sheet music. It&#x27;s really not practical to expect the players to figure out their parts by ear and perform them from memory. Requiring that would greatly reduce the scope of our repertoire, and the band&#x27;s ability to attract players. Sheet music literally expands the artistic palette of the composer, to the delight of both the performers and the audience.<p>Sheet music allows students to study and work through a large amount of literature, quickly. My kids are both studying music in college, and the amount of material they&#x27;re exposed to every week is mind blowing, in lessons, class, rehearsals, and even getting together to play for fun.<p>Having been a part time working musician for a few decades, I&#x27;ve also noticed that sheet music is a band management tool. My band would be incapable of performing if we couldn&#x27;t call in one or two substitutes per performance, some of whom are sight-reading on the bandstand. Same deal for a classical orchestra. In a smaller band that I play in, the bandleader is composing most of the material, and we scribble edits and rehearsal notes in our parts as we collaborate on refining each piece.<p>Up through the 1960s or 70s, the instrumental parts for most popular music was recorded by professional musicians who were working from written material, even if they made sometimes dramatic changes to the songs. This was just the most efficient way to manage a studio date. The touring musicians could always learn the songs by ear later on.

A 9 year old will need to practice reading and playing daily for at least 3 years before they can kinda sorta (sight-)read through beginner material with some facility. Most (middle-class with supportive parents) children who are learning to play an instrument benefit from having the time, space, and energy to do this as a part of their ordinary schooling routine. This is of course in contrast to many adults who have to attend to work, family, and other life things.<p>I started learning to play music as an adult with zero training as a child, and in my observation, adults (such as myself) don&#x27;t actually have a problem learning sheet music, <i>so long as they&#x27;re comfortable practicing reading for several years daily</i>, just like a child would. I&#x27;m several years in with daily practice, and I can work my way through sight-reading early-intermediate classical repertoire, albeit slowly.<p>Adults, at least those with the privilege of learning music, are usually already quite literate and perhaps even quite formally educated. Moreover, said adults also have a strong conception of music—their ears are good and attuned to their preferred styles of music. To many such adults then, it feels agonizing to start learning to read, and dedicate oneself to the pursuit at a child-level for many years.

The App Store description does not mention the subscription and what features it unlocks, and in the app it doesn&#x27;t trigger until you try to play a song. If you dismiss the window, you actually have to go back to playing a song (and wait) to see it again as there isn&#x27;t a settings pane or other trigger <i>just</i> to see the subscription page. A few suggestions on that front:<p><pre><code>  - Put the pricing either on a splash window after opening for the first time OR in a message tile on the library screen
  - Include certain (full) songs in the free version and give them a badge of some sort (&quot;free&quot;, &quot;included&quot;, etc.)
  - Put a badge in the toolbar indicating whether you are in a free or paid mode
  - Make it clear if a subscription is valid for iOS *and* macOS or if they are separate (2x the cost) (edit: downloaded on iOS and it&#x27;s not limiting anything so it must be a universal subscription. Put that early in the description for sure.)

I put a piano in my apartment in 2020, the year the app appears to have been first released. Several people in my household were looking for something exactly like this to practice and never came across it, though we did get suckered into a few $10&#x2F;month or $75&#x2F;year subscriptions for other things that ended up barely getting used. If the pricing stays the same but is much clearer to people I believe you could get decent conversion from a little bit of targeted advertising.<p>Besides that, the import dialog could be less spartan. It is not indicated in the app itself that it takes MIDI files only. Normal users may not know what a MIDI file is at first but you might be surprised at how many would learn and go seek those if given a tiny bit of guidance. Tons of non-technical people have learned to get their hands on playable guitar tabs the same way.<p>As for the playing interface, I like it quite a bit. Plenty of people will comment about how anything getting in the way of becoming an expert in sight reading is somehow evil (hyperbole) but this is silly. I could easily recommend this app to friends who played Guitar Hero as kids and now want to play along to stuff on the piano or keyboard– hey, we all got older and maybe acquired more &quot;mature&quot; instruments with black and white keys. I used to read standard sheet music for chamber&#x2F;orchestra but it&#x27;s been years and frankly it&#x27;s the least important skill for the type of music that I play. However I do have a piano and once in a while want to play something without getting into a lesson on sheet music especially since what I used to read had far less range than a piano.<p>App Store note: searching for &quot;piano tabs&quot; the app doesn&#x27;t show up even after a <i>lot</i> of scrolling. &quot;piano tabs learning &amp; practice&quot; finds it as the top result. I am a fan of the plain name; it&#x27;s short and self-explanatory to the point that I imagine people do randomly search those terms without knowing about your app. That should be a good thing but in practice it seems the discoverability isn&#x27;t there which is worth looking into.</div><br/><div id="37612946" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37612946" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ics</span><span>|</span><a href="#37612677">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37613490">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37612946">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37612946">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Some suggestions and features based on personal preference, so I&#x27;m putting in a separate comment.<p><pre><code>  - Put an &quot;Import MIDI file&quot; button in the Imported Files section
  - Star or bookmark icon, pick one for favorites. Currently one is used on the library screen and a different one in the song view.
  - Sidebar for the different sections with hide&#x2F;show toggle, for example I don&#x27;t like to scroll through stacked Sections and don&#x27;t really care to see Recents at all
  - Options for thumbnail, tab display could be one but some variations would be interesting:
    - Color based on tempo
    - Dot-based graphic (primarily aesthetic, but recognizable at a glance)
    - Size S&#x2F;M&#x2F;L option which assigns per section
  - Tags for tracks, ideally color-codable. Maybe I want to tag something &quot;mastered&quot;, or &quot;difficult&quot;, &quot;somber&quot;, etc.
    - After entering the search box, escape key or outside click should dismiss and return to the home layout. Currently the sections get reorganized, Favorites and Recents disappear and Pieces shows up at the bottom, but I can&#x27;t get back without closing the app.
  - &quot;Choose Random&quot; button to open a piece
  - Composer interface, create new pieces from scratch or modify from the library using something similar to the playing interface
    (n.b. a decent interface for this if no keyboard&#x2F;midi-in would be present a 1+-octave keyboard with some modifiers, so multiple key taps can create individual notes, optional rest interval, or extend a continuous note. Row-level actions so you can duplicate creating repeats, shift up&#x2F;down, etc. Slight differences between macOS&#x2F;iOS.)
  - Allow user editable text, emoji, or color highlight in the play scroll. Noting a section of the piece is one obvious use but it could be handy for several uses.
  - (semi serious) watch integration to vibrate on tempo.
  - Music box mode, notes only play as you scroll (I see you did this actually. My daughter is gonna love this...)</code></pre></div><br/><div id="37613531" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37613531" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacobp100</span><span>|</span><a href="#37612677">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37612946">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37613490">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37613531">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37613531">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks again for the suggestions!<p>What OS were you using where you couldn&#x27;t get out of the search page?

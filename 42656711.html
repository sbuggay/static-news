If there is speculation then demand becomes connected to the buying power of the wealthy, and thus demand and prices are likely to be higher.<p>In particular, the wealthy investing class collectively have way, way more money than the renting class, so the finances of the wealthy class distort housing prices upward in ways which dwarf the supply and demand effects from actual renters moving in and out of an area.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42664364" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42664364" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cudgy</span><span>|</span><a href="#42661863">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42663402">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42663654">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42664019">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42664364">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42664364">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And yet most large cities have sections of it that are in total blight with abandoned homes, with windows blown out or plywood covering access holes to prevent intruders.<p>Much of the problem is that the bourgeois class wants to live in the popular neighborhood, bidding up rents and values in isolated sections of large cities.

The UK also has about 500 or so homeless people per 100000 inabitants. In the US the number of people in prisons is about that number per 100K. On top of their huge homeless problem.<p>There is the brutal reality that the climate in Finland and being homeless are not a great combination in the winter. And the summers are short. Getting people off the streets saves lives. If it&#x27;s -20 during the night you can either lock people up or collect their corpses in the morning. Most people will seek shelter by themselves or not reject shelter when it is offered to them. But people with serious psychiatric issues, that are maybe a bit self destructive and under the influence of alcohol or drugs are going to have trouble doing rational things. So, yes, Finland does the pragmatic thing here. I don&#x27;t have good statistics on this but I bet there are more than few corpses being collected in the US and the UK on a yearly basis.<p>I&#x27;ve lived in Finland for a few years. It&#x27;s a friendly place that is mostly safe and nice to be. There&#x27;s a level of pragmatism and compassion with much of what they do that other countries could learn from. Including the business of incarcerating people. The US and UK are maybe a bit lacking with that. Finland has prisons and psychiatric wards (not the same thing) of course. But people don&#x27;t stay in those endlessly. Prison sentences are generally short, and rehabilitation is something they put a lot of effort on. Most crime there relates to people doing stupid shit because they are drunk, mentally ill, etc. The solution usually includes addressing those issues after they serve their shortish prison terms.

Sure, both things can lead to traffic accidents, but they&#x27;re pretty different problems.<p>People who temporarily need some assistance to get back on there feet are in a categorically different group than the people who are currently unable to function in society. These are fundamentally different problems.<p>I&#x27;ve seen how D.C. has tried housing first. It&#x27;s given thousands of individuals free apartments, for life as far as I can tell, some in very expensive areas. It&#x27;s been an enormous failure, since housing doesn&#x27;t actually solve the very serious underlying problems that many of these people have. A lot of long-term residents to flee places that were once (comparatively) affordable because of rising crime and violence. The Washington Post has occasionally covered this [1][2].<p>I watched a neighborhood meeting recently about the issue. The city does wellness checks on the people in the program - but they can just completely ignore them, and nothing happens. Long term residents have been forced out after people in the program have attacked them or threatened to kill them and the city doesn&#x27;t do anything, and doesn&#x27;t even remove them from the program. A councilmember was taking part in the meeting, and had nothing to say other than he was looking into ways that the city could provide more help to people in the program.<p>The linked article is bordering on misinformation by not mentioning Finland&#x27;s compulsory commitment, and also ignoring the failures of housing first in the U.S. like D.C.&#x27;s that haven&#x27;t included that aspect. That&#x27;s why a lot of these programs end up failing - people try to pick and choose the elements that they want, and ignore necessary elements that they find inconvenient. In the end, that doesn&#x27;t help anyone.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;dc-politics&#x2F;dc-housed-the-homeless-in-upscale-apartments-it-hasnt-gone-as-planned&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;16&#x2F;60c8ab9c-5648-11e9-8ef3-fbd41a2ce4d5_story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;dc-politics&#x2F;dc-housed-t...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;dc-md-va&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;08&#x2F;dc-paid-housing-chronic-homelessness&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;dc-md-va&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;08&#x2F;dc-paid-h...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42661984" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42661984" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">timewizard</span><span>|</span><a href="#42661863">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42662938">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42658502">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42661984">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42661984">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot; does not automatically mean &quot;good, moral, and upstanding lifestyle.&quot;<p>To the extent that people have a natural right to exist and society does not I think it should be contingent on administrators to prove the standard they&#x27;re applying is actually reasonable and non discriminatory.</div><br/><div id="42662098" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42662098" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ty6853</span><span>|</span><a href="#42661863">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42661984">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42662141">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42662098">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42662098">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The standard ought to be they have or imminently are going to harm others.

It&#x27;s been a bad run of being a target of criminal activity, unemployment and just running out of money during my job search. I cope with a mix of volunteering, overpriced housing (think $1200&#x2F;month for a room in a rural area before I ran out of money for that), catsitting, house-sitting, staying with family and sleeping in my ancient car. Although I&#x27;m a citizen I don&#x27;t qualify for any government support or programs, even though we have employment insurance here which I paid into for years.<p>I&#x27;m from Ottawa where the cold is obviously deadly, as it is in Finland. I do feel that we need to take shelter more seriously in public policy compared to warm areas because of that. Last week someone froze to death overnight a few blocks away from where I was crashing on a couch with family. Walking through downtown Ottawa and seeing the huge empty, lit, warm buildings with people freezing to death right outside is striking. Any practically minded person can see the problem is political and philosophical, not practical.<p>I can tell all the posters who think people choose to be homeless that I&#x27;m certainly not one of them. The comments about the importance of avoiding a downward spiral are certainly correct. Searching for work is hard enough normally and becomes increasingly difficult without access to things like a kitchen and toilet.<p>What I see in this Finnish policy is the starting assumption that doing nothing is not a good option. After reaching that point there can a rational discussion about what to do with whatever money is being spent - do you pay more people to hand out blankets and conduct surveys or just use it to buy housing units? As a homeless person I would really like to see Canada have a policy like I&#x27;m reading in this article instead of what we are doing now. The crappy temporary shelters and bureaucratic spending strategy obviously isn&#x27;t working.<p>Even just economically, to have a government pay for years of schooling and subsidize advanced degrees then just be ready to let that person die on the street when they are ready to work but can&#x27;t happen to find something seems like a waste.

It&#x27;s similar in size,  although Austin has been growing more lately. Curiously, they are also both capitols, college towns and they have a river flowing through them.<p>A major difference is that Austin has a new development with 200-400 unites on every block it seems. Cranes are everywhere downtown, and even in random neighborhoods they have huge new developments. Ottawa has no shortage of land, there&#x27;s a huge amount of available land to develop in either direction, but they evidently aren&#x27;t building nearly as much.<p>The result? I&#x27;m looking at 2 bedroom apartments, and they are 1000$ cheaper than they were 3 years ago when I first moved here. Rent has gone down and continues to go down.

Growing the economy is great, but only if done in such a way that it&#x27;s sustainable. Growth or death is too simplistic, perfectly captured by the grandparent comment. Bringing in immigrants to generate growth when you can&#x27;t house the current population seems crazy. Things don&#x27;t have to get bigger to be successful. You could make a business and have zero employees and make a living. Does it need to be a massive company that&#x27;s growing? There is always a limit, and something will eventually prevent growth, so why does it have to be an external force?<p>Where I am we are trashing the waterways and the land in pursuit of money. You can&#x27;t swim in most our rivers anymore - the recent numbers look good though, as the government redefined &#x27;swimmable&#x27; and now it&#x27;s &#x27;safe&#x27;, despite the contaminants.

If you go to Helsinki, there&#x27;s a shiny new library in the downtown area that is warm, cozy, modern, and has plenty of space for people to work, study, work on art projects, etc. They have books, 3d printers, studios, co-working options, etc.<p>Anyone is welcome there. Including homeless people, unemployed people. Anyone. You don&#x27;t see people camping out there (they have other options so they&#x27;d be kicked out) but they do provide an environment that welcomes anyone that wants to to come and learn and develop themselves and can behave themselves.<p>It&#x27;s a good example of Finnish pragmatism. It might be a bit socialist&#x2F;idealistic. But it also is a good idea that might actually work. If you find yourself in Helsinki, it&#x27;s called Oodi and is right next to the train station. Beautiful building. Worth visiting for the architecture alone.<p>My point here, the Finnish approach is not fighting symptoms but fighting the root causes: mental health, poverty, education, etc. Those things go hand in hand. If you are out of a job, you get poor. If you are not educated, you can&#x27;t find a job. If you are poor you might develop mental health issues, become homeless, and become even harder to employ, etc. Breaking that cycle is the key. Get people healthy, teach them stuff, house them.<p>It&#x27;s a mix of ideology, compassion and pragmatism that drives Finland to do these things. You don&#x27;t have to buy into the ideology. But most people are not cold sociopaths and are capable of having empathy. Pragmatism is what makes the difference here.<p>Especially when ideology gets in the way. Which I would say is the main challenge in many harsh, capitalist doctrine dominated societies that are leaving people homless. There&#x27;s plenty of empathy and charity there but it&#x27;s mostly limited to giving people access to shelters and soup. People donate but also oppose real solutions. So, things get worse.<p>Oodi is a pragmatic solution. So is the Finnish way of addressing problems with people being homeless. And realizing that education is part of the problem.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42660372" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42660372" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">andrewla</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658502">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42663027">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42660372">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42660372">[63 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Without digging too deep into the nature of the statistics they use, I&#x27;m a little skeptical of this.<p>The transition to using the word &quot;homeless&quot; has resulted in transforming something we can&#x27;t easily measure -- &quot;drug addicted or mentally ill people being a public menace&quot; -- into something that we can measure -- &quot;people without a good living arrangement&quot;.<p>Sure, the latter is important in a lot of ways too.

We have a number of effective drugs, but they rapidly become ineffective if not taken.

They are also quicker to use lithium and clozapine when indicated. They also do much longer hospital stays when needed than our revolving door policies here. Also they don&#x27;t have meth and fentanyl epidemics yet.<p>We know that the longer psychosis goes untreated&#x2F;the more times someone goes off the meds, the harder it is to treat, and that what happens in the first few years of someone developing a psychotic disorder makes a huge difference in long term outcomes.<p>An American might develop psychosis in their mid 20s, end up committed for a few weeks and placed on antipsychotic pills until they&#x27;re no longer floridly psychotic, and then go home, not follow up with doctors&#x2F;refill meds, and end up on a cycle of this with more and more brittle symptoms until they&#x27;re homeless and have no real chance of recovery.<p>The same person in Northern Europe would likely be hospitalized for longer initially, started on an injectable that only needs to be given once a month, and they leave the hospital with fewer residual symptoms. They&#x27;re then followed by an ACT team with a nurse visiting to check on them and make sure they&#x27;re eating and keeping housing, and ensuring that shot goes in their arm every month. They don&#x27;t necessarily fully recover, but a lot of them end up being able to do some kind of schooling&#x2F;employment&#x2F;volunteering and they are either stable enough to keep housing without being evicted for disruption, or are shuffled into staffed group homes.</div><br/><div id="42660821" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42660821" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">andrewla</span><span>|</span><a href="#42660372">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42660567">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42661295">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42660821">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42660821">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Do we have any numbers on the number of people that are in this system?

Essentially those few hundred with Pandemrix-induced narcolepsy are now a permanently disabled minority without organized legal advocacy. The party-opposing party,  that should not be opposing them, Pharmaceutical Injury Insurance Pool (LVP) has significant financial and legal resources. LVP has substantially broader access to archives and expert knowledge. The impaired functional capacity and financial position of those affected makes it difficult to advocate for their rights.<p>The state implemented the vaccination program and transferred responsibility to the insurance pool system with its own financial interests. The pool system determines assessment criteria and makes evaluations without external oversight. Initially, there was talk of &quot;million-euro compensations.&quot; The government guaranteed to finance the remainder if pool funds were depleted.<p>Legal cases have been fought against LVP regarding time limits of confirmed cases. Compensations have remained a fraction of original expectations. Narcolepsy patients are too small a minority to influence Parliamentary politics or re-enter public discourse. This special group has been left alone to defend their rights within the pool system.<p>The compensations were based on Käypä Hoito Guidelines for accident injuries, which are unsuitable for narcolepsy: narcolepsy doesn&#x27;t necessarily cause clear cognitive deficits despite its severity, and comparison to brain trauma is not medically possible. The drafters would probably agree if asked that it wasn&#x27;t intended for this use. A person with narcolepsy can be formally capable of work, but this might consume all of their alert hours &amp; energy, leaving nothing for actually having a life. The system may equate narcolepsy, in permanent damage, with injuries similar to a broken finger in workplace accidents, hence the permanent disability compensations are insufficient for dignified life.<p>The wage compensation issue is more significant. The determination basis for loss of earnings compensation is problematic as it&#x27;s based on achieved education and work history, although the illness has impaired these opportunities. The same neurological illness produces different compensations depending on onset timing, as those with established careers may fare better than those who couldn&#x27;t compete for university placement. This particularly affects those who became ill in childhood&#x2F;youth, as it doesn&#x27;t account for lost opportunities. In practice, even those from educated backgrounds with academic potential (e.g. top grades or plans for university before narcolepsy) may receive compensation based on average or low income.<p>Opportunity cost compensation appears unlikely. The state has not promoted reassessment of applicability of Käypä Hoito criteria.<p>There is insufficient monitoring of equality in compensation decisions and appeals, inadequate communication about compensations (the question whether all victims are even aware of their rights seems open), and questionable document management and decision-making transparency. LVP defines compensation terms, makes compensation decisions, and handles appeals, creating a conflict of interest as LVP has financial incentive for strict interpretation.<p>Permanent damage compensations are treated as earned income by Kela, requiring their use for basic living expenses, though they&#x27;re meant as lifetime compensations for an incurable neurological illness.<p>(this is partly machine-translated from personal notes)</div><br/></div></div><div id="42660502" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42660502" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">m2024</span><span>|</span><a href="#42660372">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42661024">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42663027">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42660502">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42660502">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A lot of words to say that doing anything at all must be impossible.<p>Not understanding how homelessness (or poverty generally) leads to mental illness is remarkably disconnected.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42663027" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42663027" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tlogan</span><span>|</span><a href="#42660372">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42659895">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42663027">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42663027">[19 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wanted to point out that the approach adopted by Finland may not be suitable for the United States.

This is a common flaw in most homelessness strategies. In reality, there are at least 5 to 10 broad categories—such as former convicts, individuals with substance abuse issues, those with mental health challenges, people who lost jobs or income, refugees, and more. Each of these groups requires a unique approach tailored to their specific circumstances.

The level of government best suited to do the actual work is hamstrung... if any one city fixes homelessness (somehow), more homeless will show up. If they do that again for the new arrivals, more homeless show up.<p>The first to solve it is punished with tens of thousands of newly arriving homeless who, as you might imagine, will find a way to get there if it means not being homeless anymore. But budgets are finite and the cost per homeless must he higher than zero, but in a practical sense the number of homeless aren&#x27;t entirely finite.<p>If you start from the other end, with the feds, then you might as well hold your breath. Homelessness is so far down the list of priorities, that even if it somehow did bubble to the top, the polarization in Congress will sabotage any effort, and we&#x27;ll end up with boondoggles that both sides can criticize and that won&#x27;t really help any homeless at all.<p>This isn&#x27;t a choice being made, it&#x27;s just the complexity of the real world that some are still blind to even after graduating college and (theoretically) turning into grownups.<p>There&#x27;s actually a technical solution too, but since it&#x27;s dry and boring, most leftists (and quite a few of the rightists) find it too boring to ever want to try.

Homelessness in the US is in many respect a mental health and substance abuse issue, exacerbated in the post-Reagan era when our mental health system was gutted and weakened.<p>If you want to reach those people and keep them off the streets, you need more than just empty houses.</div><br/><div id="42658990" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42658990" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">itishappy</span><span>|</span><a href="#42657163">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42658267">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42660306">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42658990">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42658990">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Chronically homeless make up about a quarter to a third of the US homeless population.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huduser.gov&#x2F;portal&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2023-AHAR-Part-1.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huduser.gov&#x2F;portal&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2023-...</a></div><br/><div id="42659371" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42659371" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">EA-3167</span><span>|</span><a href="#42657163">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42658990">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42660306">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42659371">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42659371">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s true, but they make up a disproportionate number of the &quot;visible homeless&quot; that people encounter in camps, taking drugs on the street, etc. A lot of homeless people are at a low point in their lives, but use the systems offered to them and dig themselves back out.

They tend to assume that the regulation causes the problem, but when looked at more critically, it&#x27;s clear that the regulation is a formalization of a combination of consumer &amp; business preference.<p>For example, Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations.  If you get into the gritty details, you&#x27;ll find that they have a whole bunch ofloopholes that seem to favor larger trucks &amp; SUVs.  Many people will point to these regulation as <i>causing</i> people to buy light trucks &amp; SUVs, but the data seems to suggest consumers prefer to buy these vehicles and auto manufacture prefer to sell them (they are extremely profitable).  I postulate that, if CAFE requirements were eliminated, the best selling vehicle in the USA would continue to be the F-series and other trucks and SUVs would continue to dominate the top 10, because the regulations are influenced by consumer preference, not the other way around.<p>I think the same logic applies to zoning.  People largely want to own single family homes (SFH) in the suburbs; builders largely want to build SFHs in the suburbs.  There&#x27;s no reason to believe that changes in zoning will cause a meaningful shift in consumer and business preference.  In the handful of ultra expensive metro areas, sure it might move the needle because economics trump preference, but in most of the USA, there&#x27;s plenty of space to build housing.  It&#x27;s hard to imagine a developer in Pittsburgh choosing to build housing in an industrial area in the city over some empty land on the outskirts.</div><br/><div id="42659113" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42659113" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">marssaxman</span><span>|</span><a href="#42657163">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42658325">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42657836">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42659113">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42659113">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I appreciate your skepticism!

Don&#x27;t make claims in areas where you have zero knowledge just because you think it helps your point.<p>I&#x27;m in a small sub-&#x2F;ex-urban town with a rural character which has zoning, and have been involved in local issues. I&#x27;ve never met a single person who feels the way you claim (although there are surely a few examples somewhere). No one looks down on the low income ppl who are here because their families were here before housing started to get tight and expensive.  Most everyone either grew up here or came specifically because they <i>WANT</i> to live in a quieter area, have some wildlife, maintain gardens, etc.  No one is avoiding poor people, they are SEEKING quiet and green spaces where you can do outdoor activities.<p>Moreover, saying that zoning in locales like this should be changed to accommodate low-income high-density housing is just stupid.  Yes, the current homeowners could get rich subdividing their properties, razing the trees and putting up condos.  Great, maybe you get a lower-income population. But getting ANYWHERE useful from here, even groceries or convenience stores, is a 5-10 mile car ride, and the rail station to the big city is 25min away by car. Any low income person is now condemned to replace housing expenses with car expenses, purchase&#x2F;lease, maintenance, insurance, fuel, etc..  And, they now have a big commute reducing their time available.<p>It is really simple to just blame other people and yell &quot;they&#x27;re just greedy!&quot;, and it surely makes you feel better and more righteous.<p>It is much harder to actually figure out complex problems and create solutions that work.</div><br/><div id="42662463" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42662463" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sudosysgen</span><span>|</span><a href="#42657163">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42660077">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42660347">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42657836">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42662463">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42662463">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The groceries and convenience stores and so on will naturally appear once density increases if they are allowed to.

Alright rant over I am privileged I know.<p>I&#x27;m gonna live a life though, mid sports car, land, not give up. I&#x27;ll continue to donate too whether in cash or open source work but first I have to get out of debt, been in debt for 15 years now crazy. That&#x27;s why I have my tech job, drive for UE, donate plasma and freelance to speed run my debt off.

I think the problem with the US is very clear to me as an outsider observer. It&#x27;s a vast country that is so big that technically it&#x27;s still being colonized. And in order to speed up this process there is unchecked capitalism. And you can never rely on a benevolent billionaire to solve your problems. Only the government can be held responsible for its citizens.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

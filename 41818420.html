The parent comment had a valid point.  Just because a population may fit a certain distribution, does not mean that any given sample size will also fit that distribution. Samples are used to ideally create a representative group of a population, that is smaller than the population.  However, the sample size required to come close to a representative distribution can vary between populations and variables being examined. Also, using the birthday paradox is a terrible example and has nothing to do with statistical significance, as the so-called birthday paradox is just a simple function.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41822503" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41822503" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">notfed</span><span>|</span><a href="#41820851">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41823355">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41822755">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41822503">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41822503">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If that&#x27;s true, I&#x27;m confused how this is a &quot;double-blind, randomized, controlled trial&quot;?<p>Also, what&#x27;s up with drug studies always having such a low sample size?

The way the &quot;adjustment&quot; works is that you are able to &quot;see&quot; and &quot;touch&quot; experiences you could not before, because they would have annihilated you. They open a door to re-living things and re-processing. Hard for me to see that you would come out of that &quot;broken&quot;, if there&#x27;s nothing to process your trip will be a pleasant high.<p>Which is not to say that psychedelics (LSD, 2C-B, Mescaline, Psilocybin) are not powerful stuff and that they allow for mental states that would be unlivable otherwise (clinically that would be schizophrenia or something like it). I do believe that their therapeutical <i>and</i> recreational benefits do outweigh the drawbacks though.

IMHO there is no bad journey, it <i>is</i> stuff that needs that wants to be seen.<p>Nor is the journey itself what counts, one cannot expect a quick fix from a 4 or 5 hour journey. What really counts is the preparation (4 to 8 weeks) before, and integration afterwards (again 4 to 8 weeks).

In my case I kept coming back and allowed myself more and more to let the bad experiences happen. Finally I just learned to be with what is, and accept things and myself the way it all is.

My suspicion is the trip is the treatment, or at least part of it - that the experience of being in an entirely different mindstate, of reacting to the world in a fundamentally different way using different mental pathways for several hours - is a core part of the treatment. Medicine has a bad habit of ignoring the patient&#x27;s lived experience - to look at the patient broadly as a mechanism, and particularly as a collection of mechanisms, and to see things like hypertension* as something to be treated with a chemical offset and not a reflection of the full factors of a person&#x27;s life. My hope is that the psychedelics will help us recognize a paradigm shift here (like, in data leading to changes in practice, not just in their normal way), but I think they&#x27;ve still got too much of the taint of the hippie on them to really be taken seriously.<p>* I&#x27;m using hypertension as just an example of a particular ailment, I&#x27;m not making a statement on the treatment hypertension in particular.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41819595" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41819595" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">phoronixrly</span><span>|</span><a href="#41819381">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41820992">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41820759">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41819595">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41819595">[55 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I often hear people talk about the risks of psychedelics, which are to be considered, but what’s the risk of doing nothing or withholding the best treatment?<p>The risk is to make things worse.<p>And I know that I am preaching to people that are of the opinion that they know better than the FDA, scientists and doctors and are all for self-medicating based off of the echo chamber here and a few cherry-picked, limited and flawed by default (like in the case of this one) studies on the first page of Google.</div><br/><div id="41819723" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41819723" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tastyfreeze</span><span>|</span><a href="#41819381">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41819595">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41820400">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41819723">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41819723">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Many people here are speaking from experience.

A doctor who already has familiarity with a patient&#x27;s mild or moderate symptoms of anxiety or depression may very well just prescribe one if asked and if not contraindicated. Not that you should randomly start popping Prozac, but it&#x27;s unlikely to hurt you if you did.<p>Ask your doctor, try the things that doctors currently believe are most likely to work first. If for whatever reason you choose to go beyond the current medical consensus, please stay safe and keep your doctor up to date.</div><br/><div id="41820461" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41820461" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LocalH</span><span>|</span><a href="#41819381">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41819836">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41819931">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41820461">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41820461">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I guarantee you the number of people who have died from SSRI misuse is higher than the number of people who have died from psilocybin misuse.

To this day, there are still many American doctors who don&#x27;t actually know about the Nobel Prize given in 2000 for this discovery, and claim it&#x27;s &quot;stress&quot; and tell you to go home. Some claim they &quot;know&quot; but than try to &quot;change your gut PH&quot; and still refuse to give antibiotics due to &quot;superbug&quot; risk.<p>This is a &quot;small&quot; thing (GI pain is not small to those who have it) - but if the doctors are screwing up such a small thing institutionally, what else do they mess up on?<p>One is travelers sickness. Doctors in the USA do not want to perscribe front line antibiotics for it because of fear of superbugs - but they&#x27;ll uncritically go eat their lunch at a McDonalds that same day, where they consume meat bathed in antibiotic slop which is more likely to contribute to superbugs then the amoxicillin that they didn&#x27;t give you would have.<p>Or what about right now, when it&#x27;s become clear that Ozempic is literally a super-drug. Every doctor on earth should be trying to give that stuff to literally anyone.<p>I can go to &quot;third world countries&quot; with deregulated health systems and get infinitely better care that I have real control over for on the orders of 1 USD (that&#x27;s how much it cost for me in Thailand to get front line antibiotics for travelers sickness INCLUDING THE DOCTORS VISIT!)<p>Why do we still sell Neosporin despite doctors wanting it off the market (also for risk of superbugs)? Why do few people in America use Providone-iodine for wound treatment despite it being by far the best solution scientifically for it (and it stains yellow)? Maybe it&#x27;s because we&#x27;re stupid. There really aren&#x27;t better explanations.<p>What about Circumcision? I&#x27;d straight up put doctors who do it in jail and many European nations would do the same. American doctors think circumcision is just fine, and long, deeply bitter swaths of medical ethics journals are dedicated to fighting over this again and again.<p>Or what about the widespread disagreement over even basic stuff like digital rectal exams? There&#x27;s no agreement on if they are worth it because often sticking one&#x27;s hand up the butt of an old man does more damage to them than finding out that they (like everyone else at old age) have benign prostate cancer?<p>Doctors in America have not earned their position of deference. The scientifically minded on HN who do their own research can and often do know how to treat certain conditions better than white-coats.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41819827" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41819827" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dingnuts</span><span>|</span><a href="#41819381">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41819778">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41819953">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41819880">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41819827">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41819827">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">that&#x27;s easy to say when you forget about the state of healthcare.. everywhere, actually.

Not only to the system, as people often wind up in hospitals due to laced products or incorrect doses (see marijuana in a lot of states where dealers really aren&#x27;t concerned about quality), but also to the individual.

Bad drunk teenager.   Suicidal in college (failed attempt).<p>- No drugs except alcohol until I was in my mid 20s.<p>I&#x27;ve been prone to major bouts of depression my entire life. I went to therapy multiple times a week for years and got on SSRI&#x27;s towards the end of university as a response to a failed (but serious) suicide attempt.<p>SSRI&#x27;s never did anything for me except make me feel like shit (and not be able to take one). Eventually I went off them and sort of got by, and I managed to stay safe by drinking no alcohol. Therapy twice a week was an utter waste of time and money.<p>Then, sort of on a whim, I grew some mushrooms at home with my then fiancée and we took them together. I was mid 20s and had no prior experience with any drug but alcohol. Not knowing what I was doing, we took a BIG dose. I had a trip that was fun at first and then became quite unenjoyable.<p>For the next twelve months I felt like myself again. The change was subtle but, over a long term, quite obvious.<p>After about 18 to 24 months, my depression came back. We took mushrooms again and the same thing happened. A year of well being in exhcange for 2 fun hours and 6 tough ones.<p>So about every two years I&#x27;ll take a big (2-4g dry) dose of mushrooms and...it&#x27;s like magic. I feel like myself again. I&#x27;m &quot;back.&quot; Life is not happy, none of my problems go away, but I feel like I&#x27;m an agent in my own life as opposed to a spectator.<p>The well being lasts about a year or 18 months (less if I&#x27;ve been drinking alcohol). It&#x27;s almost never as bad as when I was suicidal, but it still sucks. For me depression is like being a professional chef and one day your taste buds make everything taste like ash. Or a painter and one day you see colors less and less.<p>Last year I went into a VERY deep depression, so deep that I <i>refused</i> to take mushrooms until my wife basically forced me to. Same thing. The very next day I felt like &quot;I was back.&quot;<p>Those things changed my life.<p>I&#x27;ve since had fun with other drugs maybe 5 times. Acid a couple times, molly a couple times. Cheap (wtf) fun for a half a day, but nothing like the impact mushrooms have on my mind.<p>I&#x27;ve had one bad trip while taking mushrooms recreationally. I don&#x27;t understand who would take those things for fun, at night.<p>Strictly during the day, well-rested, with loved ones, and in nature!<p>I&#x27;m also convinced that the impact they have on me is purely chemical. It has nothing to do with &quot;facing my demons&quot; or &quot;connecting with a higher spirit&quot; or anything like that. I just get off my stupid rut.<p>&quot;Neurons that fire together wire together&quot; as they say, and when I&#x27;m depressed it&#x27;s the stupid neurons that fire together. Mushrooms makes a whole different set fire, and fire hard, and that seems to be enough.<p>The deepeest lesson I&#x27;ve gotten while on shrooms is:<p>&quot;I&#x27;m trying my best.

Note, that I am not trying to impart any sort of mystical value to this, or trying to be poetic.<p>It&#x27;s an incredibly scary experience that makes you feel like you&#x27;re disintegrating in a metaphysical sense. Your mind, perception, body. Yourself. Like you&#x27;re falling apart, being disassembled and that you will never be able to get yourself together again. You have no agency. And then you are gone. I believe this is what they call &quot;ego death&quot;.<p>And then after you&#x27;re gone, you&#x27;re left with all these pieces of yourself. Including a lot of them that you forgot ever existed. Or how they fit together. Or some that you were subconsciously aware of but never perceived them. Like opening a shelf of Legos from your childhood. It&#x27;s very dream-like.<p>Then comes the awareness, understanding and grief. I&#x27;ve never cried as much in my life, and I&#x27;m not a crying person.<p>Then comes hope.<p>And you get to assemble yourself back again. Feels like something between waking up, coming back to reality and a chain-reaction of those &quot;AHA!&quot; moments.<p>And then you&#x27;re back, but you&#x27;re not the same, and you understand more about yourself.<p>While the next few months were some of the best I had in decades, I&#x27;m extremely averse to repeating this experience, as it feels really traumatic.<p>I was in a controlled, safe, although not a clinical environment, and I am terribly aware how much this can fuck your brain up in ways I can probably never imagine. We have no idea how this machine works and this is basically decompiling an incredibly complex binary during execution, moving code around, recompiling, and hoping it works.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41823007" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41823007" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AI_beffr</span><span>|</span><a href="#41819935">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41823007">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41823007">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">in 2020 i was very interested in psychedelics because of the breakthrough with PTSD and MDMA via MAPS. so i read pihkal and tihkal and i started reading a biochemistry textbook and generally took an intense interest in that area. and i went to oakland when i had the chance to be back in the bay area and i went to zide door and bought a small amount of psilocybin. at a bohemian friends house (it has since been cleaned out and sold, perhaps the last such house in the bay area at the time!) i took the little capsule in my palm and contemplated if i really wanted to take the risk. and i did. it was not a large enough dose to produce a psychoactive effect -- i think i had read that a psychoactive dose was not necessary to see benefits in mental health. there is one effect that i remember very clearly. it was when it got later into the night that i noticed something subtle but extremely strange. i felt awake or energized in some way. and i realized that my whole life, during the evening and late hours i would be sort of depressed and not feeling good. and so that was the first time that i felt lucid and energized after dusk. my whole life i had always known that i feel very depressed and agitated at dusk. but this experience really showed me how abnormal it was. later on i made a connection that is very oddly absent in medical circles that explains this. you know how when someone is having a deadly allergic reaction they are meant to use what is known as an &quot;epi-pen?&quot; thats because epinephrine, whats inside the pen, reduces inflammation. but what isnt mentioned or connected anywhere to anything is that when you go to sleep at night your body massively reduces the level of epinephrine that circulates in your blood so that you can sleep. inflammation therefore must increase. and inflammation is implicated in many psychiatric disorders including and perhaps most of all with depression.<p>one time much later i was in the hospital because i had a bad fever. maybe i was being kind of paranoid for going in. but as i was laying in the hospital bed my fever suddenly broke. and a wave of intense depression, unmistakable, washed over me. i thought this might be turning into an emergency but soon enough it passed as if nothing had happened. it was very useful to know about the connection between inflammation and depression during that little journey.<p>why is the connection between inflammation and various psychiatric diseases not taken seriously by the medical establishment? because its too complicated of a subsystem for a statistical study to tease it out. even if it were the sole cause of depression it still wouldnt lend itself to any study that is not exploring directly the biochemical mechanism. expect some breakthroughs in this area.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

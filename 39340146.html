It&#x27;s 1&#x2F;3 the cost to build the Abraj Al Bait tower in Saudi Arabia. It&#x27;s like 3% of the net worth of Bezos, Musk, Eliison, or Zuckerberg.<p>Recreating Linux alone would be a massive endeavor, taking hundreds of people many years, to say nothing of gcc and clang and git, and those are just the developer tools needed to build all the other stuff. Estimating $300,000 per developer (including salary + benefits + office space + computers), $4 billion is 13,000 person-years. Google has about 26,000 developers, so it&#x27;s saying Google could recreate all open source software in 6 months. Or one tenth of Google could recreate all open source software in 5 years.

A new image compression standard comes out. What are the chances that it becomes widely accepted and used if there isn&#x27;t any Open Source (or at least free) tooling to compress and decompress it? And just &quot;free&quot; might not be enough, because lots of folks need to incorporate it into their own software (image viewers, browsers, chat clients etc.), and they wouldn&#x27;t take that risk if they could link it, but maybe not apply a security fix if the vendor didn&#x27;t react quickly enough.<p>Image formats are a relatively benign example, but deeper in the stack, non-interoperability becomes much more of an issue. How many programming languages without Open Source implementations became really successful? How about OS APIs? Do you think we would have somewhat compatible libc and syscall landscapes without Open Source BSD distributions and Linux?<p>And then there&#x27;s version control, implementation of communication standards (bluetooth, USB, but also TCP&#x2F;IP stacks).... the more I think about it, the more horrifyingly fractured the software world would look without OSS as a unifying force.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39342070" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39342070" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PreInternet01</span><span>|</span><a href="#39342665">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39341978">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39342070">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39342070">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The method in the paper definitely seems flawed: if, for example, PostgreSQL would not exist, that doesn&#x27;t mean every software company would be developing their own RDBMS -- the much more likely effect would be more mega-yachts for Larry Ellison...<p>I&#x27;m not even sure there <i>is</i> a sensible method to quantify the economic impact of Open Source, since it&#x27;s pretty much an &quot;alternate universe&quot; situation. Without OSS, Linux would most likely not exist, meaning that... everyone would be paying for Unixware per-seat licenses? Which would probably make AWS a nonstarter, etc. etc. On the other hand, there <i>would</i> most likely be a lot more profitable small software companies, but not enough to make up the difference.<p>So, &quot;Open Source is a good thing, economically&quot; might be a defensible statement, but putting an actual Dollar value on that will always be more fiction than science.</div><br/><div id="39342377" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39342377" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rvense</span><span>|</span><a href="#39342070">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39341978">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39342377">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39342377">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah, it&#x27;s weird. &quot;How would people behave if everything was different?&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t see how there&#x27;s either $5 VPS or Heroku free tier in a world without free Linux on commodity hardware, and I&#x27;d argue that without those, software would have taken a much smaller bite out of the world than it has over the past 15-20 years.<p>One thing I know is that all the companies I&#x27;ve worked for in my 10-year career would not have been possible to start the way they did without open source software. First of all, they all had a period of at least a year where they were just an idea and built up an MVP for no cash. If license costs had been significant, who knows how that would played out.<p>Second of all, throughout my career a significant portion of my coworkers have been self-taught. Actually, everyone has, to some degree, even the people with actual CS degrees have run stuff for fun.

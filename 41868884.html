This has been suspected for years, but now there&#x27;s an experimental result.<p>What this tells us for AI is that we need something else besides LLMs. It&#x27;s not clear what that something else is. But, as the paper mentions, the low-end mammals and the corvids lack language but have some substantial problem-solving capability. That&#x27;s seen down at squirrel and crow size, where the brains are tiny. So if someone figures out to do this, it will probably take less hardware than an LLM.<p>This is the next big piece we need for AI. No idea how to do this, but it&#x27;s the right question to work on.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-024-07522-w.epdf?sharing_token=1BwycCwx1wQ2Sfnub1-o0NRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MYYopL5qENCL5gCQ3HDKyBWf6AQLs-HC3fMMzU9skb40K1DK-HWblYUyHTAQuuliWeLXeg5lXVNFOTa3fVek1R0et9kPjIgQljFd2wX1hSlqWjpOKSrRjz8t2mUDQ6Vr6DlhIlAndISxjxnRU2FPd2XMQFK5UDTh5Osiq6IYOksvy1nGE68d0y9YuJvr4Zrok%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.scientificamerican.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-024-07522-w.epdf?shar...</a></div><br/><div id="41894031" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41894031" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jll29</span><span>|</span><a href="#41890003">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41892068">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41894031">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41894031">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Most pre-deep learning architectures had separate modules like &quot;language model&quot;, &quot;knowledge base&quot; and &quot;inference component&quot;.<p>Then LLMs came along, and ML folks got rather too excited that they contain implicit knowledge (which, of course, is required to deal with ambiguity).
Then the new aspiration as &quot;all in one&quot; and &quot;bigger is better&quot;, not analyzing what components are needed and how to orchestrate their interplay.<p>From an engineering (rather than science) point of view, the &quot;end-to-end black box&quot; approach is perhaps misguided, because the result will be a non-transparent system by definition. Individual sub-models should be connected in a way that retains control (e.g. in dialog agents, SRI&#x27;s Open Agent Architecture was a random example of such &quot;glue&quot; to tie components together, to name but one).<p>Regarding the science, I do believe language adds to the power of thinking; while (other) animals can of course solve simple problems without language, language permits us to define layers of abstractions (by defining and sharing new concepts) that goes beyond simple, non-linguistic thoughts. Programming languages (created by us humans somewhat in the image of human language) and the language of mathematics are two examples where we push this even further (beyond the definition of new named concepts, to also define new &quot;DSL&quot; syntax) - but all of these could not come into beying without human language: all formal specs and all axioms are ultimately and can only be formulated in human language. So without language, we would likely be stuck at a very simple point of development, individually and collectively.<p>EDIT: 2 typos fixed</div><br/></div></div><div id="41892068" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41892068" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CSMastermind</span><span>|</span><a href="#41890003">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41894031">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41891228">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41892068">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41892068">[21 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When you look at how humans play chess they employ several different cognitive strategies.

Let&#x27;s move the concept a bit - &quot;search&quot;. Can LLMs search for novel ideas and discoveries? They do under the right circumstances. You got to provide idea testing environments, the missing ingredient. Search and learn, it&#x27;s what humans do and AI can do as well.<p>The whole issue with &quot;reasoning&quot; is that is an incompletely defined concept. Over what domain, what problem space, and what kind of experimental access do we define &quot;reasoning&quot;? Search is better as a concept because it comes packed with all these things, and without conceptual murkiness. Search is scientifically studied to a greater extent.<p>I don&#x27;t think we doubt LLMs can learn given training data, we already accuse them of being mere interpolators or parrots. And we can agree to some extent the LLMs can recombine concepts correctly. So they got down the learning part.<p>And for the searching part, we can probably agree its a matter of access to the search space not AI. It&#x27;s an environment problem, and even a social one. Search is usually more extended than the lifetime of any agent, so it has to be a cultural process, where language plays a central role.<p>When you break reasoning&#x2F;progress&#x2F;intelligence into &quot;search and learn&quot; it becomes much more tractable and useful. We can also make more grounded predictions on AI, considering the needs for search that are implied, not just the needs for learning.<p>How much search did AlphaZero need to beat us at go? How much search did humans pack in our 200K years history over 10,000 generations? What was the cost of that journey of search? That kind of questions. In my napkin estimations we solved 1:10000 of the problem by learning, search is 10000x to a million times harder.</div><br/><div id="41893284" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41893284" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shkkmo</span><span>|</span><a href="#41890003">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41893179">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41893265">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41893284">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41893284">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You can&#x27;t breakdown cognition into just &quot;search&quot; and &quot;learn&quot; without either ridiculously overloading those concepts or leaving a ton out.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41893265" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41893265" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shkkmo</span><span>|</span><a href="#41890003">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41892803">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41893179">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41893389">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41893265">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41893265">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; LLMs absolutely 100% can reason, if we take the dictionary definition; itâs trivial to show their ability to answer non-memorized questions, and the only way to do that is some sort of reasoning.<p>Um...

If you think about macaques, they have a limited range of vocalization once they hit adulthood.  Noe that the mothers almost never make a noise at their babies.  Lacking language, when a mother wants to train an infant, <i>she hurts it</i>.  (Shades of <i>Blindsight</i> there)  She picks up the infant, grasps it firmly, and nips at it.  The baby tries to get away, but the mother holds it and keeps at it.  Their communication is pain.  Many animals do this.  But they also learn threat displays, the <i>promise</i> of pain, which goes beyond mere carrot and stick.<p>The more sophisticated multicellular animals (let us say birds, reptiles, mammals) have to learn to model the behavior of other animals in their environment: to prey on them, to avoid being prey.  A pond is here.  Other animals will also come to drink.  I could attack them and eat them.  And with the macaques, &quot;I must scare the baby and pain it a bit because I no longer want to breastfeed it.&quot;<p>Somewhere along the line, modeling other animals (in-species or out-species) hits some sort of self-reflection and the recursion begins.  That, I think, is a crucial loop to create the kind of intelligence we seek.  Here I nod to Egan&#x27;s <i>Diaspora</i>.<p>Looping back to your original point about the training data, I don&#x27;t think that loop is <i>sufficient</i> for an AGI to do anything but think about itself, and that&#x27;s where something like Cyc would serve as a framework for it to enter into the knowledge that it isn&#x27;t merely <i>cogito ergo sum</i>ming in a void, but that it is part of a world with rules stable enough that it might reason, rather than &quot;merely&quot; statistically infer.

It seems obvious that non-human animals do this without language. So it seems likely that humans do too and then language is layered on top as a turbo boost. However, it also seems plausible that you could build an abstract representation of the world through studying a vast amount of human language and that&#x27;ll be a good approximation of the real-world too and furthermore it seems possible that reasoning about that abstract representation can take place in the depths of the layers of a large transformer.

Thatâs our diverse, mixed-signal, brain architecture followed by a good upbringing. That means we need to train brain-like architectures in the same way we train children. So, weâll need whatever data they needed. Multiple streams for different upbringings, too.<p>The data itself will be most senses collecting raw data about the world most of the day for 18 years. It might require a camera on the kidâs head which I donât like. I think people letting a team record their life is more likely. Split the project up among many families running in parallel, 1-4 per grade&#x2F;year. It would probably cost a few million a year.<p>(Note: Parent changes might require an integration step during AI training or showing different ones in the early years.)<p>The training system would rapidly scan this information in. It might not be faster than human brains. If it is, we can create them quickly. Thatâs the passive learning part, though.<p>Human training involves asking lots of questions based on internal data, random exploration (esp play) with reinforcement, introspection&#x2F;meditation, and so on. Self-driven, generative activities whose outputs become inputs into the brain system.  This training regiment will probably need periodic breaks from passive learning to ask questions or play which requires human supervision.<p>Enough of this will probably produceâ¦ disobedient, unpredictable children. ;) Eventually, weâll learn how to do AI parenting where the offspring are well-behaved, effective servants. Those will be fine-tuned for practical applications. Later, many more will come online which are trained by different streams of life experience, schooling methods, etc.<p>That was my theory.

It can experience cause and effect.  It can be the cause.

What&#x27;s really happening is that there&#x27;s not enough mental machinery underneath for those words to ever be anything to link up with.</div><br/><div id="41891718" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41891718" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">soulofmischief</span><span>|</span><a href="#41890003">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41891635">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41891260">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41891718">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41891718">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This view represents one possible subjective experience of the world.

Beyond your specific point re:interfacesâwhich I recommend the OG <i>Syntactic Structures</i> for more commentary onâheâs been saying what sheâs saying here for about half a century.

Think me arrogant or conceited or whatever - that is literally the truth, fact - proven many times in the educational system (I was homeschooled and didn&#x27;t follow any sort of curriculum and was allowed to do whatever I wanted bc I kept testing higher than almost everyone) and just for kicks also - the last time I took an IQ test I was in my late 20s and a friend and I had a bet about who could score higher completely stoned off of our ass. We rolled enough blunts apiece that we could be continuously smoking marijuana as we took the IQ test, which followed several bongs finished between the two of us. I was so high that I couldn&#x27;t keep the numbers straight on one of the number pattern questions - it was ridiculous. I scored 124, my lowest &quot;serious&quot; attempt ever - all of this is 100% true. I need anyone to believe me - take this how you will but I have an opinion that is a bit different.<p>I&#x27;m brilliant - I&#x27;ve read volumes of encyclopedias,  my hobbies include comparative theology, etymology, quantum mechanics and predicting the future with high accuracy (I only mention stuff I&#x27;m certain of tho ;) but so much so it disturbs my friends and family.<p>The highest I scored was in the 160s as a teenager but I truly believe they were over compensating for my age - only as an adult have I learned most children are stupid and they maybe in fact didn&#x27;t over compensate. I am different than anyone else I&#x27;ve ever personally met - I fundamentally see the world different.<p>All of that is true but that&#x27;s a rather flawed way of assessing intelligence - fr. I&#x27;m being serious. The things we know can free us as much as they can trap us - knowledge alone doesn&#x27;t make a man successful, wealthy, happy or even healthy - I&#x27;m living evidence of this. That doesn&#x27;t cut it as a metric for prediction of much. There are other qualities that are far more valuable in the societal sense.<p>Every Boss I&#x27;ve ever worked for has been dumber than me - each one I&#x27;ve learned invaluable stuff from. I was a boss once - in my day I owned and self taught&#x2F;created an entire social network much like FB was a few years ago, mine obviously didn&#x27;t take off and now I&#x27;m a very capable bum. Maybe someday something I&#x27;m tinkering with will make me millions but prolly not, for many reasons, I could write books if I wanted ;)<p>At the end of the day, the facts are what they are - there is an optimal level of intelligence that is obviously higher than the bottom but is nowhere near the top tier, very likely near that 100 IQ baseline. What separates us all is our capabilities - mostly stuff we can directly control, like learning a trade.<p>A Master Plumber is a genius plumber by another name and that can and obviously is most often, learned genius. What you sus about yourself is truth - don&#x27;t doubt that. No IQ test ever told me I lacked the tenacity of the C average student that would employ me someday - they can&#x27;t actually measure the extent of our dedicated capacity.<p>I kno more than most people ever have before or rn presently - I don&#x27;t know as much about plumbing as an apprentice with 2 years of a trade school dedicated to plumbing and a year or two of experience in the field, that&#x27;s the reality of it. I could learn the trade - I could learn most every trade, but I won&#x27;t. That&#x27;s life. I can tell you how you the ancients plumbed bc that piqued my curiosity and I kno far more about Roman plumbing than I do how a modern city sewer system works. That&#x27;s also life.<p>It isn&#x27;t what we kno or how fast we can learn it - it&#x27;s what we do that defines us.<p>Become more capable if you feel looked down on - this is the way bc even if what you hone your capabilities of can be replicated by others most won&#x27;t even try.<p>That&#x27;s my rant about this whole intelligence perception we currently have as a society. Having 100 IQ is nowhere near the barrier that having 150 IQ is.<p>Rant aside, to the article - how isn&#x27;t this obvious? I mean feelings literally exist - not just the warm fuzzy ones, like the literal feeling of existence. Does a monkey&#x27;s mind require words to interpret pain or pleasure for example. Do I need to know what &quot;fire&quot; or &quot;hot&quot; is in a verbal context to sufficiently understand &quot;burn&quot; - words exists to convey to to others what doesn&#x27;t need to be conveyed to us. That&#x27;s their function. Communication. To facilitate communication with our social brethren we adopt them fundamentally as our Lego blocks for understanding the world - we pretend that words comprising language are the ideas themselves. A banana is a  - the word is the fruit, they are the same in our minds but if I erase the word banana and all it&#x27;s meaning of the fruit and I randomly encounter a banana - I still can taste it. No words necessary.<p>Also, you can think without words, deliberately and consciously - even absentmindedly.<p>And LLMs can&#x27;t reason ;)<p>Truthfully, the reality is that a 100 IQ normal human is far more capable than any AI I&#x27;ve been given access to - in almost every metric I attempted to asses I ultimately didn&#x27;t even bother as it was so obvious that humans are functionally superior.<p>When AI can reason - you, and everyone else, will kno it. It will be self evident.<p>Anyways, tldr: ppl are smarter than given credit for, smarter and much more capable - IQ is real and matters but far less than we are led to believe. People are awesome - the epitome of biological life on Earth and we do a lot of amazing things and anyone can be amazing.<p>I hate it when the Hacker News collective belittles itself - don&#x27;t do that. I rant here bc it&#x27;s one of the most interesting places I&#x27;ve found and I care about what all of you think far more than I care about your IQ scores.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41891193" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41891193" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eliaspro</span><span>|</span><a href="#41891068">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41892035">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41892129">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41891193">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41891193">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Growing up, I never used words or even sentences for thinking.<p>The abstract visualizations I could build in my mind where comparable to semi-transparent buildings that I could freely spin, navigate and bend to connect relations.<p>In my mid-twenties, someone introduced me to the concept of people using words for mental processes, which was completely foreign to me up to this point.<p>For some reason, this made my brain move more and more towards this language-based model and at the same time, I felt like I was losing the capacity for complex abstract thoughts.<p>Still to this day I (unsuccessfully) try to revive this and unlearn the language in my head, which feels like it imposes a huge barrier and limits my mental capacity to the capabilities of what the language my brain uses at the given time (mostly EN, partially DE) allows to express.</div><br/><div id="41892795" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41892795" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ryandv</span><span>|</span><a href="#41891068">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41891193">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41892129">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41892795">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41892795">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This reminds me of my experiences working with a software developer transplanted from the humanities who was highly articulate and capable of producing language <i>about</i> programming, yet seemed to not be able to write many actual computer programs themselves.<p>I think that I ultimately developed an obsessive need to cite all my ideas against the literature and formulate natural language arguments for my claims to avoid being bludgeoned over the head with wordcelry and being seen as inferior for my lesser verbal fluency despite having written software for years at that point, since early childhood, and even studied computer science.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41892129" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41892129" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">makeitdouble</span><span>|</span><a href="#41891068">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41891193">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41893304">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41892129">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41892129">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think people who can manipulate complex structures but struggle with language tend to see language in a more formal way, putting more effort into understanding its structure and inner working.<p>Basically what to most people is so obvious that it becomes transparent (&quot;air&quot;) isn&#x27;t to us, which apparently is an incredible gift for becoming a language researcher.

In a similar fashion to how this sort of mathematical notation allows for more concise and precise expression of mathematical objects (contrast &quot;the number that is thrice of three and seventeen less of ninety&quot;) and serves to amplify our mathematical capacities, language can perhaps be seen as a force multiplier; I have doubts whether those suffering from aphasia or an agrammatic condition would be able to rise to the heights of cognitive performance.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;17306848&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;17306848&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;15713804&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;15713804&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41893710" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41893710" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">adrian_b</span><span>|</span><a href="#41892701">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41893609">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41893710">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41893710">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I can think without language about all the things that I have experienced directly through some of my senses, but there is a huge number of things that I have never experienced directly and about which I can think only using language.<p>I doubt that this is different for other people.

Whether it&#x27;s uttered words, a series of gestures, subtle pheromones or a slap in your face, that&#x27;s all languages.<p>For the same reason I find extremely odd that the hypothesis that animals don&#x27;t have any form of language is even considered as a serious claim in introduction.<p>Anyone can prove anything and its contrary about language if the term is given whatever meaning is needed for premises to match with the conclusion.</div><br/><div id="41890078" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41890078" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">GavinMcG</span><span>|</span><a href="#41889857">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41890279">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41890078">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41890078">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just as a data point, my guess is that a very small minority of English-language speakers would define the term as broadly as you do, at least in a context relating the concept to analytical thought processes.

(And actually, thatâs reflected when you say language is a means âyou can <i>use</i>â.) Likewise, a slap in the face certainly can be interpreted, but slapping doesnât seem like a <i>means</i> of communicating in generalâbecause a slap only communicates one thing.</div><br/><div id="41892900" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41892900" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dleeftink</span><span>|</span><a href="#41889857">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41890078">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41890426">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41892900">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41892900">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s that fringe.

NOT the other way around.<p>We have 7 primary affective processes (measurable hardware level emotions) and they are not what you think[2].

In fact the emotions we are usually taught are not based on emotional states but on muscle contractions in the face! Not being allowed to talk about emotions in psychological studies or the inner process of the mind is kinda crazy when you think about it.

I lived in a world that was a no-world. I cannot hope to describe adequately that unconscious, yet conscious time of nothingness. I did not know that I knew aught, or that I lived or acted or desired. I had neither will nor intellect. I was carried along to objects and acts by a certain blind natural impetus. I had a mind which caused me to feel anger, satisfaction, desire. These two facts led those about me to suppose that I willed and thought. I can remember all this, not because I knew that it was so, but because I have tactual memory. It enables me to remember that I never contracted my forehead in the act of thinking. I never viewed anything beforehand or chose it. I also recall tactually the fact that never in a start of the body or a heart-beat did I feel that I loved or cared for anything. My inner life, then, was a blank without past, present, or future, without hope or anticipation, without wonder or joy or faith.<p>It was not nightâit was not day.<p>.      .      .      .      .<p>But vacancy absorbing space,
And fixedness, without a place;
There were no starsâno earthâno timeâ
No checkâno changeâno goodâno crime.<p>My dormant being had no idea of God or immortality, no fear of death.<p>I remember, also through touch, that I had a power of association. I felt tactual jars like the stamp of a foot, the opening of a window or its closing, the slam of a door. After repeatedly smelling rain and feeling the discomfort of wetness, I acted like those about me: I ran to shut the window. But that was not thought in any sense. It was the same kind of association that makes animals take shelter from the rain. From the same instinct of aping others, I folded the clothes that came from the laundry, and put mine away, fed the turkeys, sewed bead-eyes on my doll&#x27;s face, and did many other things of which I have the tactual remembrance. When I wanted anything I liked,âice-cream, for instance, of which I was very fond,âI had a delicious taste on my tongue (which, by the way, I never have now), and in my hand I felt the turning of the freezer. I made the sign, and my mother knew I wanted ice-cream. I &quot;thought&quot; and desired in my fingers. If I had made a man, I should certainly have put the brain and soul in his finger-tips. From reminiscences like these I conclude that it is the opening of the two faculties, freedom of will, or choice, and rationality, or the power of thinking from one thing to another, which makes it possible to come into being first as a child, afterwards as a man.<p>Since I had no power of thought, I did not compare one mental state with another. So I was not conscious of any change or process going on in my brain when my teacher began to instruct me. I merely felt keen delight in obtaining more easily what I wanted by means of the finger motions she taught me. I thought only of objects, and only objects I wanted. It was the turning of the freezer on a larger scale. When I learned the meaning of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot; and found that I was something, I began to think. Then consciousness first existed for me. Thus it was not the sense of touch that brought me knowledge. It was the awakening of my soul that first rendered my senses their value, their cognizance of objects, names, qualities, and properties. Thought made me conscious of love, joy, and all the emotions. I was eager to know, then to understand, afterward to reflect on what I knew and understood, and the blind impetus, which had before driven me hither and thither at the dictates of my sensations, vanished forever.<p>I cannot represent more clearly than any one else the gradual and subtle changes from first impressions to abstract ideas. But I know that my physical ideas, that is, ideas derived from material objects, appear to me first an idea similar to those of touch. Instantly they pass into intellectual meanings. Afterward the meaning finds expression in what is called &quot;inner speech.&quot; When I was a child, my inner speech was inner spelling. Although I am even now frequently caught spelling to myself on my fingers, yet I talk to myself, too, with my lips, and it is true that when I first learned to speak, my mind discarded the finger-symbols and began to articulate. However, when I try to recall what some one has said to me, I am conscious of a hand spelling into mine.<p>It has often been asked what were my earliest impressions of the world in which I found myself. But one who thinks at all of his first impressions knows what a riddle this is. Our impressions grow and change unnoticed, so that what we suppose we thought as children may be quite different from what we actually experienced in our childhood. I only know that after my education began the world which came within my reach was all alive. I spelled to my blocks and my dogs. I sympathized with plants when the flowers were picked, because I thought it hurt them, and that they grieved for their lost blossoms. It was two years before I could be made to believe that my dogs did not understand what I said, and I always apologized to them when I ran into or stepped on them.<p>As my experiences broadened and deepened, the indeterminate, poetic feelings of childhood began to fix themselves in definite thoughts. Natureâthe world I could touchâwas folded and filled with myself. I am inclined to believe those philosophers who declare that we know nothing but our own feelings and ideas. With a little ingenious reasoning one may see in the material world simply a mirror, an image of permanent mental sensations. In either sphere self-knowledge is the condition and the limit of our consciousness. That is why, perhaps, many people know so little about what is beyond their short range of experience. They look within themselvesâand find nothing! Therefore they conclude that there is nothing outside themselves, either.<p>However that may be, I came later to look for an image of my emotions and sensations in others. I had to learn the outward signs of inward feelings. The start of fear, the suppressed, controlled tensity of pain, the beat of happy muscles in others, had to be perceived and compared with my own experiences before I could trace them back to the intangible soul of another.

Think of times when someone gets an idea you&#x27;re trying to convey, but you realize they&#x27;re missing some critical context you forgot to share. It takes some activation energy to add that bit of context, so if it seems like they mostly get what you&#x27;re saying, you skip it. Over time, transferring ideas from one person to the next, they tend towards a very compressed form because language is expensive.<p>This process also works on your own thoughts. Thinking out loud performs a similar role, it compresses the hell out of the thought or else it remains inexpressible. Now imagine repeated stages of compressing through language, allowing ideas to form from that compressed form, and then compressing those ideas in turn.

As was fully expected, some bugs emerged. I needed to solve one of them. I designed a system in my head for spawning off child processes based on the parent process to do certain distinct types of work in a way that gives us access to OS process-level controls over the work, and then got about halfway through implementing it. Little to none of this design involved &quot;words&quot;. I can&#x27;t even say it involved much &quot;visualization&quot; either, except maybe in a very loose sense. It&#x27;s hard to describe in words how I didn&#x27;t use words but I&#x27;ve been programming for long enough that I pretty much just directly work in system-architecture space for such designs, especially relatively small ones like that that are just a couple day&#x27;s work.<p>Things like pattern language advocates aren&#x27;t wrong that it can still be useful to put such things into words, especially for communication purposes, but I know through direct personal experience that words are not a <i>necessary</i> component of even quite complicated thought.<p>&quot;Subjective experience reports are always tricky, jerf. How do you know that you aren&#x27;t fooling yourself about not using words?&quot; A good and reasonable question, to which my answer is, I don&#x27;t even <i>have</i> words for the sort of design I was doing. Some, from the aforementioned pattern languages, yes, but not in general. So I don&#x27;t think I was just fooling myself on the grounds that even if I tried to serialize what I did directly into English, a transliteration rather than a translation, I don&#x27;t think I could. I don&#x27;t have one.<p>I&#x27;m also not claiming to be special. I don&#x27;t know the percentages but I&#x27;m sure many people do this too.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41891617" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41891617" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neom</span><span>|</span><a href="#41885384">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41889661">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41889779">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41889777">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41891617">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41891617">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m an idiot.

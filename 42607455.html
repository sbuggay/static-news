This blog post is not about using a passkey to login to your email.<p>This blog post is about using a passkey to login to a website (404 Media) that currently supports login via &quot;magic links,&quot; i.e. instead of passwords, they <i>always</i> send you a &quot;forgot my password&quot; link, which you click on in your email.<p>If you currently login to 404 Media with a magic link, and then decide to login to 404 Media via passkey, and you lose your passkey, you can just get a new magic link sent you via email and reset your passkey, or, if you want, you could just skip the passkeys and go back to always using magic links.<p>Using passkeys to login to your <i>email itself</i> is a whole different ball of wax. Gmail does not have a simple &quot;forgot my password&quot; email that it sends. (That would be pointless if Gmail is your only email address!)<p>The &quot;forgot my password&quot; flow for Google&#x2F;Gmail can involve a bunch of factors, including backup email addresses, backup recovery codes, recovery contacts, SMS, push notification to other apps you&#x27;ve logged into. Google doesn&#x27;t document all of the factors they consider, and neither do any of the other major email providers.<p>I get it: it would be scary to login to Google via passkey if Google is your passkey manager, especially because there&#x27;s no way to export a passkey from one passkey manager to another. Can you trust Google&#x27;s recovery system?<p>That&#x27;s a hard problem for Google, but it&#x27;s a trivial problem for 404 Media. They just send you a magic link, and rely on Google to keep your email secure.<p>And, let&#x27;s face it, most of us run sites that are much more like 404 Media than they are like Google.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42608839" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42608839" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jesseendahl</span><span>|</span><a href="#42608465">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42608858">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42608785">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42608839">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42608839">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">FWIW people don’t actually understand how passwords work either (password hashing etc.), and I am not sure it’s important for most people to understand how passkeys actually work. Also, majority of people reuse the same (extremely weak) password, or they go through an account recovery flow every time they login anywhere. This is why you saw the “magic link” pattern take off in the first place — users were already going through essentially the same flow before. Now at least they can sign in with biometric authentication on a regular basis, using passkeys. And if they do get locked out of their account for some reason, they go through the account recovery flow — same as they did when using their password before.<p>But at least they won’t get phished anymore!

Rather than typing your password (hopefully on the correct site...) and then sometimes confirming with a magic link or a 2FA code, all you do is use your platform native&#x27;s authentication conformation method (face recognition, fingerprint, PIN code, whatever) and you&#x27;re done. This works independently of which site you&#x27;re on.<p>Just as with password managers: If you use the OS built-in solution, you&#x27;re locked into a specific platform (though I admit that with passwords it&#x27;s at least possible to move them manually, albeit super painful if the passwords are secure), so if you&#x27;re using multiple platforms concurrently use a password manager that supports all your platforms - most if not all password managers these days support passkeys.<p>For all breakages related to passkeys, the same applies as with passwords: You use the account recovery flow (which often is the weakest link on any site).<p>As such, passkeys feel like a wonderful shortcut with even slightly improved security (you can&#x27;t present a passkey to the wrong site) in the default case.</div><br/><div id="42608791" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42608791" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alisonatwork</span><span>|</span><a href="#42608465">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42608529">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42608769">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42608791">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42608791">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Except you don&#x27;t just have the vendor lock-in of your password manager, you also have the vendor lock-in of a web browser too.

Or that you can watch a short video explanation describing the <i>benefits</i> of passkeys, and then you &quot;know what a passkey is.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s what a passkey is:<p><i>Passkeys are randomly generated passwords that are required to be managed by a password manager.</i> All the major password managers support them, including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, and 1Password.<p><i>Passkeys can be public&#x2F;private keypairs, or they can just be secret passwords.</i> Webauthn is designed by committee, so there&#x27;s always more than one way to do it.<p><i>By requiring the passkey to be managed by a password manager, you get some anti-phishing protection.</i> A passkey includes metadata, including the website domain that created it, and the password managers simply won&#x27;t provide the passkey to the wrong domain. They provide no way for you to copy and paste the passkey into a website, as you can with a password; there&#x27;s no social-engineering technique someone can use to get you to copy and paste your passkey to an enemy.<p><i>A passkey manager is morally required to do an extra factor of authentication</i> (e.g. fingerprint, Face ID, hardware keys, etc.) when you login to a website, but the website has no way of knowing&#x2F;proving whether that happened; they just get the password.<p><i>You reset your passkey the same way you reset your password</i>, because passkeys are just passwords that have to be managed with a password manager. Some sites make it easy to reset your password, some make it hard. You know the drill; there&#x27;s nothing new or different there.<p>If your site&#x2F;app is comfortable with magic links, or a simple &quot;forgot my password&quot; email, then it would also make sense to let users add a passkey by clicking a link in an email.<p>If your site&#x2F;app doesn&#x27;t have a &quot;forgot my password&quot; flow, you don&#x27;t need one for passkeys, either. (But, surely you have <i>something</i> in place…? Even Yubikeys&#x2F;SSH&#x2F;PGP private keys can be lost.)<p><i>If you&#x27;re happy with your password manager, there&#x27;s no real need to switch</i>, but even very &quot;sophisticated&quot; password users have been known to fall prey to social-engineered phishing attacks.<p>Are you sure you&#x27;re never going to copy-and-paste your password into the wrong hands? I don&#x27;t trust myself that much.<p><i>Passkeys make it harder to switch password managers because the password managers are designed not to let you copy-and-paste a passkey</i>, including from Google&#x27;s Password Manager to Apple&#x27;s Password Manager. I think all the password managers kinda like that lock in, and there&#x27;s something good and bad about it.<p><i>Instead, password managers recommend that sites&#x2F;apps allow each user to have multiple passkeys.</i> Sites&#x2F;apps may or may not actually allow that, but that&#x27;s the only way to be sure a given user can login with both Google&#x27;s password manager and Apple&#x27;s password manager: give each password manager its own passkey for each site.<p>I think Ricky is completely right <i>in this case</i> that if you&#x27;re a site like 404 Media using magic links today, passkeys are just better. As a user, if your passkey doesn&#x27;t work or gets lost, you can just click &quot;forgot my passkey&quot; and get another magic link, and set up a new passkey.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

Doing so at a bar at 3pm in a third world country was exotic enough to get you kidnapped. Since then, society went through a phase where it was almost like a showy thing that people could be working away from the office, to the point where everyone started doing it, and then eventually to where if you want to work on a laptop, you self-segregate with everyone else into a starbucks or whatever, and make sure to keep buying coffee or limit your time.<p>We&#x27;re, in other words, <i>way</i> past the point in human history where walking around with tech on your person is cool because you can do productive things on it, or even cool because you have something new, or cool because the tech itself is cool. It is actually impossible for Apple or anyone else to recapture that now, because everyone now knows that everyone with one of these things is just watching cat videos and looking stupid. Apple seems to be chasing the tech-as-jewelry market with larger and larger ticket items and diminishing returns. Because tech was never jewelry and or status symbol to the people who use it to be productive... and the only card you could ever play in a bar with a laptop, even 25 years ago, was that you were being productive. Not entertaining yourself. I would&#x27;ve been ashamed to sit there and watch cat videos and tune out the world while other people were talking, but I could show them what I was building and get into conversations. This tech violates that norm which Apple assumes is dead - that of not sitting in a social space and walling yourself off from it in a fundamentally antisocial way.</div><br/><div id="39271960" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39271960" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tlb</span><span>|</span><a href="#39270940">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39271060">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39271576">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39271960">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39271960">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For coffee shop computing, I’d like a computer than is clearly only for programming&#x2F;creative work.<p>When you saw Hemingway with a typewriter in a cafe, or Feynman with pages of squiggles in a bar, it was obvious at a glance they were creating.

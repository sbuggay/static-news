That calculator was my first introduction to programming. I’d take the time to write programs for each unit we covered so that I could just input the variables and quickly solve. I had to understand the concept before I could program it so I didn’t really think it was cheating. I did get nervous when SATs came up because I knew my calcs memory would be cleared. I remember my solution was to painstakingly recreate the memory cleared screen and pulled it up before the proctor came around in hopes that they’d assume they already cleared mine.<p>My programming didn’t improve much after high school but I’m still kind of proud of my not-totally-cheating cheating.</div><br/><div id="41595142" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41595142" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Sohcahtoa82</span><span>|</span><a href="#41593770">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41596127">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41595142">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41595142">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Back in my Algebra II class, while learning polynomial expansion, I write a program on my TI-85 that would not only solve the problem, but <i>it would show the work</i>, so I literally just had to copy its output verbatim and I got full credit.<p>I showed it to my teacher and asked it if it would be considered cheating to use it on the test, and she said that if I knew the material so well that I could write a program that didn&#x27;t just solve it, but showed the work, then clearly I knew the material so well that I&#x27;d ace the test even without the program, so I could go ahead and use it, just as long as I didn&#x27;t share the program with my friends.<p>I didn&#x27;t have any friends (This was 1998 where being such a nerd was still looked down on), so it wasn&#x27;t an issue.</div><br/><div id="41595454" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41595454" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shagie</span><span>|</span><a href="#41593770">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41595142">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41596431">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41595454">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41595454">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One of the people I went to school with (several years ahead, his assembly class was on VAX rather than MIPS) had to write a program that solved a polynomial.<p>As he was going through the tome that represented the CISC instruction set of a VAX system (long before easy search engines), he found POLY ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ece.lsu.edu&#x2F;ee4720&#x2F;doc&#x2F;vax.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ece.lsu.edu&#x2F;ee4720&#x2F;doc&#x2F;vax.pdf</a> page 9-118).<p>So, his program, instead of doing all the calculations was setting up a few registers, a large comment block that explained it, a call to POLY, and reading out the registers.<p>He claimed to have gotten full credit and within a handful of semesters later the course was switched from CISC architectures to RISC.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41596431" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41596431" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xp84</span><span>|</span><a href="#41593770">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41595142">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41595454">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41597905">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41596431">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41596431">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My Trig teacher, which was the class where I got my cherished TI-83+, had the exact same opinion of my little TI-Basic programs which worked the same way as yours.<p>I got an A in that class both semesters, which was better than the B I often got in Math (and a C- once in AlgII) because I hated doing homework.

We will all get plenty of self-solving time, but it helps if you can show that you can explain yourself during rapid fire situations involving others, or to bring them along with your plan, or building an unfamiliar plan B with others when two AZ are down in us-east-1 and noone planned for XYZ to be unavailable (eg something that the LLM site depended on)

Are you ever going to be able to replace a good machine operator? Or this just helps reduce the inspection toil and burden? Do they usually need 100% inspection, or just periodic with binning?<p>Injection molding is usually for mass manufacturing - think multiple parts coming in bursts every minute or so - which makes CMM a tough to integrate without way slowing down your line. There&#x27;s also the case of big objects like bumpers and chairs that might not be easy to CMM. We&#x27;re not shooting to replace machine operators - just make their lives easier. With injection molding our customers so far usually really want 100% inspection instead of sampling.<p>&gt; Don&#x27;t most of these machines have the parts just fall in a bin, with no robot arm? Doesn&#x27;t this seem like instead of paying a good injection mold tech, now you&#x27;re paying for an injection mold tech and a robotics tech, if you have to program the arm path for every part setup?<p>Depends on the shop! Some have automated packaging systems that someone has to stare at. Some are trying to add in automated packaging a build out a defect plan. Keep in mind you don&#x27;t necessarily need a full robot to get bad parts off your line - a little shoving arm to just boot the bad parts off a conveyor works fine in some cases.<p>&gt; How many defects are &quot;dimensional&quot; and how many are &quot;cosmetic&quot; ?<p>Varies wildly by design - but I&#x27;d say we see more cosmetic than dimensional. Maybe because the ratio of cosmetic surface to interface surface is fairly high.<p>&gt; Can a defect detection model accept injection mold pressure curves as input? Isn&#x27;t that a better data source for flash and underfilling?<p>I&#x27;ll have to keep that in mind - it&#x27;s a great idea. The hard part there is that you&#x27;ll need a per-machine calibration and a lot of data collection. Could be good though!<p>&gt; Is this supposed to get retrofit, or go on new machines?<p>Ideally both since it&#x27;s a separate camera system, although I&#x27;d love to try to integrate with the machines themselves.</div><br/><div id="41371354" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41371354" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">acyou</span><span>|</span><a href="#41370508">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41370782">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41369317">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41371354">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41371354">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you.<p>I have seen machines with visual pressure curve output on the operator screen for each part.

On something larger like an RTX 4080 GPU it&#x27;s less than 100ms. Because we&#x27;re running big models we can&#x27;t really just spin out more threads ourselves, we throw them over to the GPU (or deep learning accelerator - depending on the platform) and the driver&#x27;s internal scheduler decides how to get it done.<p>In a robotic packaging scenario most of the time is spent by the robot picking up the objects and moving them, so for a 30 second cycle we usually get less than a second to take multiple pictures and make a decision about the part. For a smaller number of images - like 4 - it&#x27;s pretty easy to handle with cheap hardware like an Orin Nano or Orin NX. If we&#x27;ve got more images (like 8) and a tight time budget (like less than 2 seconds) we&#x27;d usually just bump up the hardware, like going to a higher tier of Nvidia&#x27;s line of Orins or using compute with an RTX 4080 GPU or equivalent in it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41369317" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41369317" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jjk166</span><span>|</span><a href="#41370508">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41374166">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41369317">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41369317">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m an engineer at company that injection molds parts for medical and industrial devices.

Good luck! I used to work on this. Your synthetic dataset pipeline is really neat. A foundation model of molding defects might be feasible.
I hope you will also work on the whole inline quality control problem. From what I saw of the field, sometimes you only get the final quality days after painting, finishing or cool down of big parts. And the quality metric is notably undefined for visual defect, using the cad render as a reference is a good solution. Because plastic is so cheap and the process so stable, I have seen days of production shredded for a tiny perfectly repeated visual defects.
Injection molding machines are heavily instrumented [0] and I tried to mix in-mold sensors + process parameters + photo + thermography of hot parts [1] (sry it&#x27;s in french, might find better doc later).

But I think it does leave out the desire some consumers have to purchase domestic. For example, I might be willing to buy a domestically made vehicle if the price is under $25K even if it&#x27;s more than a similar vehicle made overseas. But if the price is over that, I&#x27;m going with the cheaper import.</div><br/><div id="41372870" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41372870" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">doctorpangloss</span><span>|</span><a href="#41369570">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41371163">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41371142">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41372870">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41372870">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The idea of the domestically manufactured vehicle is just that, an idea.<p>There&#x27;s the fiction of quota and part manifests.<p>Then there&#x27;s the reality that, well I assemble a thousand parts in China into one &quot;part&quot; then I import that one &quot;part.&quot;<p>There are a ton of people employed by the autos industry in the US but that&#x27;s so broad.

Have you tried uploading some images of successful injection castings and some of unsuccessful injection castings (they don&#x27;t even have to be of the same mold), telling it &quot;These are examples of success&quot; &quot;these are examples of failures, e.g. flashing, blemish, scratch, etc&quot; and feeding it picture(s) of the casted object?<p>It&#x27;d be interesting to hear how effective that is.</div><br/><div id="41371242" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41371242" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lasermatts</span><span>|</span><a href="#41371142">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41371242">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41371242">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">LLMs like GPT-4o have some pretty impressive image performance. It can actually pick up some of the more obvious defects on our buckets (Steph tested it out just now).<p>Two problems though with the OpenAI approach:
1. You&#x27;d need a cloud connection to send those images up to and get the answer back down so that&#x27;s cost in terms of your round-trip latency, network infra, and the OpenAI account itself.<p>2. It doesn&#x27;t do well with the very subtle defects - mild shape changes, loss of features from short shots, etc<p>It might be worth using in the offline pipeline for auto labeling though!</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

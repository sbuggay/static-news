I remember in the 90s him bringing a laptop home with software that tested otoacoustic emissions via a microphone&#x2F;earbud combo. Later I met one of his colleagues from that time who, whilst working full time and with a large young family, obtained a phd in using this tech to test newborn hearing. That work has been the basis for the UK’s national newborn hearing screening service for decades now, helping to catch issues early where the most impact can be made. I’m really in awe of this profession - it’s pretty out of sight for many but makes a huge difference.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37829113" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37829113" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tommiegannert</span><span>|</span><a href="#37829436">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37829113">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37829113">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks!<p>&gt; The concept that a source of mechanical energy exists in the cochlea appeared validated when in the late 70s it was discovered that sound is produced by the inner ear. [---]  Within five years it was discovered that the outer hair cell could be made to elongate and shorten by electrical stimulation. The function of the outer hair cell in hearing is now perceived as that of a cochlear amplifier that refines the sensitivity and frequency selectivity of the mechanical vibrations of the cochlea.<p>Like high-resolution variable valve timing in ICEs? Amazing things going on in the body.<p>&gt; Aspirin has long been known to cause a reversible hearing loss and more recently it has been shown to block otoacoustic emissions. The experiments show that aspirin causes both effects by a direct action on the outer hair cell.<p>Oh, wow. That sounds like useful information.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

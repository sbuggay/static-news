Still not sure how their adoption plays out over time because, at least in the US, people will fight against mandates to use self-driving cars because it compromises their freedom (note that the freedom crowd (no judgment) will be saying that, at first, because they will consider it their right to drive themselves, but once the privacy implications are clear there will be full-on (figurative?) wars fought over self-driving).

Which is a reasonable and non discriminatory solution to the problem.<p>I hard disagree. I think itâll follow a path more like gun ownership (not trying to wade into that here though). In rural and low density areas, people believe guns provide safety, while in dense urban areas, people believe guns add risk. In low density areas, people will need to drive themselves (I doubt as many people would buy self driving cars vs use as a taxi, roads will be less well mapped, etc ), while urban areas with increased risk of driving accidents will want to restrict access of roads from humans.<p>This urban&#x2F;rural divide doesnât make for good licensure policy. People who depend on driving themselves are less âsophisticatedâ - they wonât want to spend <i>more</i> time getting a license, because they live farther away, theyâre less likely to take drivers classes, etc. We already see states with smaller urban population have easier driverâs license standards and age requirements. Pride in vehicle ownership and car culture is already geographic simply because urban residents are less likely to own a car.

In the suburbs, you need to sell people on expensive vehicles that cost a lot per trip (whether owned or hailed).</div><br/><div id="41414200" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41414200" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lazide</span><span>|</span><a href="#41411956">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41413964">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41414026">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41414200">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41414200">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ultimately I think itâs the same city&#x2F;rural (really dense vs less dense) divide between a lot of things.<p>In a suburban area, it could take 15 minutes for a taxi to get to you.

I was predicting what I think will happen with self-driving cars and the privacy implications if that does to come to pass (still a big if).<p>As for urban vs. rural, I feel like rural will benefit just as much from self-driving as urban. I won&#x27;t detail why, but it&#x27;s pretty much the same reasons as urban. Economics will have to be better if it&#x27;s going to be corporate-controlled cars, but, really, if Elon&#x27;s right (huge if) and you can successfully have autonomy with a Model 3-level of hardware, then rural America may very well have widespread autonomous car access in the next couple of years.<p>Motorcyles? Great point. Not sure how that will shake out. RV&#x27;s? Seems like a fantastic opportunity for autonomy. Sit in the captain&#x27;s seat, beer in hand, actually watch the scenery as you drive on by. In fact I think the market for RV&#x27;s will grow if folks don&#x27;t have to drive them themselves because there are likely many people who wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable driving an RV due to its size, but if it drives itself it could open up a whole new audience.<p>As for pedestrians, do you think pedestrians are being restricted more and more as the years go on? I see the opposite in both urban and rural areas in the US. Genuinely curious how your experience is different and where. I tend to think autonomous cars will make walking more pleasant. No more worrying about a car clipping you making a right turn, or a car driving unnecessarily fast and losing control, or a drunk driver losing control. All of those things may go away with autonomy (I say &quot;may&quot; because we&#x27;re millions if not billions of miles away from anyone saying definitively that self-driving is safer&#x2F;better&#x2F;etc. In my limited experience riding in Waymos, though, I am incredibly optimistic about the technology. And I really look forward to us figuring out the privacy implications and other negatives that could come along with it because I think the benefits are so enormous that it&#x27;ll be a massive shame if the tech does not work out long term).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41414487" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41414487" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">conradev</span><span>|</span><a href="#41411956">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41412351">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41412435">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41414487">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41414487">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Canât I just buy a car that lets me drive it but also can drive itself?<p>I can already today add functionality to cars with after-market hardware: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;comma.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;comma.ai&#x2F;</a>?</div><br/></div></div><div id="41412435" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41412435" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rblatz</span><span>|</span><a href="#41411956">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41414487">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41413768">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41412435">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41412435">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think this plays out where it becomes a luxury to drive oneself.

Over the next 10-15 years it looks like self driving will continue to advance and will likely become safer than the alternative.<p>I think this is a long way away and will vary geographically.<p>For a long time, self driving cars will be more expensive because theyâll have expensive sensors on it. Not many people will want a $100K self driving car instead of a $30k Camry.  This means the cost-per-mile goes up unless utilization rate goes up. The most effective way to do that is make it a Taxi.<p>The natural result of self-driving-taxis is that the people least likely to take a taxi but most dependent on a car (rural Americans) will drive themselves still and those cars will be cheaper because theyâre sensor free. That will never be a luxury product.<p>In urban environments though, the poorest people will continue to own cars but be slowly priced out by insurance. But maybe insurance wonât go <i>up</i> for manual cars, but <i>down</i> for self driving cars.  Theyâve already priced the cost of manual driving, which wonât get more dangerous as less cars are human.

They&#x27;re not always-on (generally they only turn on when the car is in reverse gear), and on many car models they&#x27;re even physically covered when they&#x27;re not active.  (E.g. on my car, the manufacturer logo on the rear of the car flips up to allow the rear camera to &quot;see&quot; when I&#x27;m in reverse gear.)<p>Regarding bugs and remote takeover, the one thing that does feel like a mitigating factor is I expect for many car models it might be tough to find an exploit that enables the rear camera, but doesn&#x27;t let the driver know that it&#x27;s active.  Usually when the rear camera is active, the infotainment display automatically switches to the rear view, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised that there&#x27;s no mode for &quot;turn on rear camera but don&#x27;t display the video feed to the driver&quot; on most cars.  Not as a security&#x2F;privacy feature, but just because it&#x27;s easier to write the code that links the two all the time rather than having it be conditional on something.<p>But yeah, as autonomous driving becomes more pervasive, there will be more cars with cameras recording everything around them at all times.  I expect the manufacturers&#x2F;operators of these cars to store that video for some time after capturing it, even just for quality control, bug tracking, and dispute resolution if there&#x27;s a crash.  And certainly law enforcement already has legal tools to compel the release of this kind of video.<p>I suppose this is just the next step of what&#x27;s already the status quo, though.  Many public places already have (stationary) cameras, either operated by the police or by private individuals, and police generally have the ability to access the latter, even.  Cameras on autonomous vehicles just mean many more cameras over time, cameras that move around.<p>I don&#x27;t really love this situation; I would like to see legislation that makes all of this data protected, and requires companies that store it to delete it after a relatively short amount of time (unless subject to a legal hold).

Rules are meant to protect people, and as such are often specified in terms of the lowest common denominator, with the understanding that the system doesn&#x27;t enforce them when they can be reasonably ignored, using good judgement.<p>Life will be shittier for everyone if an army of self-empowered rule-loving busybodies get to expand their current powers beyond the realm of the HOA.</div><br/><div id="41412750" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41412750" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">c22</span><span>|</span><a href="#41409951">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41412013">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41411972">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41412750">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41412750">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Frankly I&#x27;d rather just get a ticket when I speed by a traffic camera than rely on the discretion of a random police officer who might just be looking for a pretense to search my vehicle or hassle me in some other way.</div><br/><div id="41413271" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41413271" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">refulgentis</span><span>|</span><a href="#41409951">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41412750">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41411972">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41413271">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41413271">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Jaywalking, to my ear, is a  similarly universal &amp; easy example for this not being universally desirable.</div><br/><div id="41413323" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41413323" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">c22</span><span>|</span><a href="#41409951">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41413271">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41414296">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41413323">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41413323">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s probably not universally necessary to jaywalk.

Darkness, fog, rain, snow, etc. can all change what the actual safe maximum speed is.  So even with a posted 55mph speed limit, the maximum safe speed at a particular time might be lower (even considerably lower), and a LEO could cite you for going too fast even if you&#x27;re driving under the posted limit.  (I&#x27;ve been on the interstate in the snow where you&#x27;d be likely to get pulled over if you were going much over 25mph, even with a posted 65mph limit.)<p>Driver skill and reaction time also plays a factor, but of course people are not so great at judging what their own specific safe speed is all the time.  And all other things being equal, you&#x27;re more likely to get into a crash if you&#x27;re driving faster rather than slower, and the injuries you sustain will be worse at a higher speed.<p>IIRC speed limits are often set at some percentile (85th?) of what all drivers would (theoretically) &quot;naturally&quot; drive if there was no posted limit.  And, on highways, cops will often not pull people over for exceeding the speed limit by a moderate amount.  Once, long ago, a cop told me that, absent adverse conditions or other unsafe behavior, he usually will not stop anyone unless they&#x27;re going more than 10mph over the highway speed limit.  And I expect if he were hiding in a speed trap that no one could actually see driving by, and everyone was going 70mph on your 55mph road, he&#x27;d probably just sit there and not bother anyone, unless they were doing something else that was unsafe.<p>I guess this is a long winded way to say that there really is no single safe speed that applies to everyone, in every road condition.  The law acknowledges this, and police often let you do your thing unless they believe you&#x27;re actually doing something unsafe.  The discretion and judgment calls can be a problem (biases, etc.), but I don&#x27;t think a society where unavoidably &quot;fuzzy&quot; laws were always prosecuted would be a great society either.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41412206" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41412206" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">repeekad</span><span>|</span><a href="#41409951">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41411910">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41414744">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41411962">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41412206">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41412206">[31 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You clearly havenât received a letter in the mail for $250 because a camera saw you barely not fully stop for a red light right turn at <i>3am with zero traffic</i><p>A human in the loop needs to be the first line of defense, if an officer isnât willing to be in the field to issue the ticket and show up in court to defend it then there shouldnât be a ticket in the first place, full stop</div><br/><div id="41412935" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41412935" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LinuxBender</span><span>|</span><a href="#41409951">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41412206">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41412252">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41412935">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41412935">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Or the cases when you are on a motorcycle at 3am and the road sensors don&#x27;t sense you so at the advise of a police officer, you carefully and safely run the red light.

Well, obviously there are some states that are very obviously a car at rest.  But if you were to, say, graph my car&#x27;s speed at an intersection with a stop sign, you might see a curve that flattens out to where the slope is zero.  Maybe that zero-slope point is a teeny tiny fraction of a second, though.  Did I come to a full stop?  Yes!  Can a cop actually realize I did come to a full stop?  Often not.  Ok, so I did stop, but did I give enough time while at a full stop in order to assess that it was safe to continue moving?  Do I even need to do that after I&#x27;ve come to a full stop, or can I start that assessment when my speed is 3mph, and know by the time I&#x27;ve fully stopped that it&#x27;s immediately safe to continue?  I think so, yes.<p>It&#x27;s just fuzzy.  Humans are fuzzy.  The law is fuzzy.  Safety is not a yes&#x2F;no binary, it&#x27;s fuzzy.  Many many people don&#x27;t always come to a full stop.

I dispute that.  I think in many situations it is just as safe to nearly-but-not-completely come to a full stop before continuing, and it&#x27;s entirely fine behavior.<p>The law has some difficulty encoding that.  (Not that it&#x27;s impossible, but it&#x27;s difficult, and enforcement perhaps gets weirder if you try.)<p>Let&#x27;s take a related example: jaywalking.  In many places, you can get a ticket for crossing the street somewhere where there isn&#x27;t a crosswalk, or crossing against a red light or a don&#x27;t-walk sign.  I was taught as a child how to look both ways and only cross when and where it&#x27;s safe to do so.  I don&#x27;t need a sign or stripes on the road to tell me that (though I do appreciate those things as hints and suggestions).  Hell, in some places (Manhattan comes to mind), if you don&#x27;t jaywalk, everyone around you will look at you funny and get annoyed with you.<p>California, recognizing this, finally eliminated most jaywalking laws a year and half ago[0].  You can only get cited here if you&#x27;ve failed to do what your parents told you, and you&#x27;re crossing when it&#x27;s not safe to do so.<p>Stopping fully at a red light before turning right is, IMO, similar enough.  For many (most?) intersections, you&#x27;re only going to be a teeny tiny fraction of a percent safer coming to a full stop.  So why bother?<p>[0] Let&#x27;s also remember that jaywalking laws exist only because car manufacturers wanted them.  Walking in the street!?  How absurd!  Streets are only for our beautifully-produced cars!  Not you grubby plebeian pedestrians.

Reasonable human discretion didn&#x27;t help me that time.<p>&gt; <i>if an officer isnât willing to be in the field to issue the ticket and show up in court to defend it then there shouldnât be a ticket in the first place</i><p>I&#x27;m torn on this in general.  The idealist in me really really really wants to agree with your statement, but the sheer number of cars on the roads means that cops see a teeny tiny fraction of things that happen.  Driving-related injuries and deaths are disgustingly high, and I expect most of them are related to speeding, and running red lights and stop signs.  That is, stuff cops are supposed to be policing.<p>No human-powered enforcement mechanism can watch for all of those.  Yes, the usual deterrent factor applies:  even if you are a butthole who doesn&#x27;t care about safety, you might follow the rules because of the (relatively small) possibility that there just <i>might</i> be a cop nearby that sees you doing something bad.  But clearly it&#x27;s not really working all that well; car-related injury and death statistics are still (IMO) unacceptably bad.<p>I feel like this is sort of unique.  Like, for other illegal behaviors, you can usually reduce them through other things.  Like, have a healthy economy, low unemployment, under-control inflation, and housing that&#x27;s affordable enough for everyone who wants to live in a place, and you have an environment where it&#x27;s rare that people feel the need to commit property crimes.  But drivers who speed are gonna speed.  Drivers who run red lights and stop signs are gonna run red lights and stop signs.<p>Maybe -- like for many things -- better enforcement isn&#x27;t the answer.  Better road&#x2F;traffic engineering, stiffer penalties for when people do get caught doing unsafe things... I dunno, maybe that will get us there.  Perhaps we&#x27;ll have some sort of a transit renaissance, and so many fewer people will opt to drive, and that will naturally make things better.  Or maybe self-driving will get good enough (and be used pervasively enough, or perhaps even mandated) that riding in a car will become a lot safer, on par with train or even air travel.  Who knows.<p>Regardless, though, I think my personal level of comfort is somewhere in the middle.  I certainly don&#x27;t want dystopian 100% panopicon-style enforcement of every single thing, where everyone is recorded everywhere they go to make sure they aren&#x27;t breaking the law.  But I think a light sprinkling of automated enforcement here and there is probably not harmful privacy&#x2F;freedom-wise, but can indeed be a societal good.  But I don&#x27;t exactly trust law enforcement to stay within the lines of their mandate when it comes to these sorts of things.  And I don&#x27;t trust elected officials and judges to actually do something when law enforcement gets out of control.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41411962" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41411962" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">laweijfmvo</span><span>|</span><a href="#41409951">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41411910">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41412206">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41414634">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41411962">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41411962">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">From what I remember of my CA driverâs license test (had to re-take the written test when I moved to CA), there is no actual speed limit in CA.

Even if it&#x27;s plain that this citizen-provided evidence is horribly biased, a court might say that the prosecuting entity has the responsibility to sift through the bias, and this responsibility is the difference between the state (the government) and non-state (the citizen who happens to submit only footage of people of a certain race).<p>But eventually the flow of money effectively deputizes the citizen, replacing beat-cop budgets with crowd-source bounties, and years of abuse pass before the courts acknowledge that it&#x27;s actually been state action for quite a while.<p>(Interesting reading: <i>Yick Wo v. Hopkins</i>, which established that a fairly written law can still violate constitutional rights if the <i>administration</i> of that law is unjust.

This has happened (notably, the city of Chicago reduced the time of yellows and it led to more tickets <i>and</i> more accidents).<p>The other thing to remember is that governments don&#x27;t operate red light cameras. They hire contracting businesses to install and operate them, and normally instead of paying a fixed rental&#x2F;maintenance rate for the cameras those companies typically get paid a fraction of the fines. That means the designer&#x2F;operator of the camera doesn&#x27;t have much incentive to make the camera accurate or maximize safety, but to maximize how many cars it can issue tickets to (whether or not they&#x27;re actually breaking the law or not).<p>When you take that to the extreme, the red light camera companies will even lobby local politicians to install more of them, and advertise them not as a tool for safety but for revenue. In some cases they&#x27;ve straight up bribed mayors and city officials with kickbacks from the ticket revenue.<p>All told, red light cameras are pretty shitty at making roads safer.

It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in âadvancedâ countries.â</div><br/><div id="41411502" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41411502" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Spooky23</span><span>|</span><a href="#41411205">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41411289">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41411688">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41411502">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41411502">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Speak for yourself.

You go into a bar. Some cars have driven past the bar right as you entered a few weeks past. Now police realize this is actually a secret gay bar. They take all cars whose gps shows they passed the bar and take their footage. You are seen on camera entering a gay bar and now you are on a list and they start to harass you and question you. Seems like an unlikely situation that is far fetched but I like to remind people it was only in 1965 that the last person was arrested in Canada for homosexuality.

People often failed to understand what that meant. You&#x27;d go to some life-threatening disturbance like a couple of neighbours scrapping in the street over who owned the hedge between their properties, and they&#x27;d both be bursting with aggrieved self-righteousness, both yelling, their wives would either be having a private scrap on the side or would have adjourned to a kitchen for a shared pot of tea and a chat, and they all expected you to sort it out. And they could never understand that it wasn&#x27;t your job.<p>&gt; Sorting it out was a job for a good surveyor and a couple of lawyers, maybe. Your job was to quell the impulse to bang their stupid fat heads together, to ignore the affronted speeches of dodgy self-justification, to get them to stop shouting and to get them off the street. Once that had been achieved, your job was over. You weren&#x27;t some walking god, dispensing finely tuned natural justice. Your job was simply to bring back peace.<p>&gt; Of course, if your few strict words didn&#x27;t work and Mr Smith subsequently clambered over the disputed hedge and stabbed Mr Jones to death with a pair of gardening shears, then you had a different job, sorting out the notorious Hedge Argument Murder. But at least it was one you were trained to do. People expected all kinds of things from coppers, but there was one thing that sooner or later they all wanted: make this not be happening.<p>-- <i>Night Watch</i> by Terry Pratchett</div><br/></div></div><div id="41411448" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41411448" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pjc50</span><span>|</span><a href="#41409936">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41410352">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41412055">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41409990">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41411448">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41411448">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What this conversation is getting at is the police being (percieved to be) selective about what they do and don&#x27;t care about is gradually corrosive to co-operation.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41409990" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41409990" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cryptoegorophy</span><span>|</span><a href="#41409936">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41409969">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41412735">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41409990">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41409990">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It saved me $2000 bill by recording a hit an runner</div><br/><div id="41413820" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41413820" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">telcal</span><span>|</span><a href="#41409936">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41409990">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41412357">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41413820">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41413820">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It saved me a lot more.

This applies to both the prosecution and the defense (both criminal and civil).<p>The protection against &quot;unreasonable&quot; search and seizure comes in the form of the fact the requesting party has to convince the court (usually the registry) that there is reasonable grounds before they will issue a subpoena.<p>As an investigative matter (prior to any charges, court listings, and subpoenas), it is possible to get a search warrant including for evidence held by 3rd parties who aren&#x27;t suspected of anything. Again, police don&#x27;t have carte blanche. They need to convince a judicial officer of some sort that there is reasonable grounds before a warrant will be issued.<p>There are ways to challenge a warrant&#x2F;subpoena. Sometimes a successful challenge only serves to make the evidence inadmissible but doesn&#x27;t prevent the search in the first place (aka &quot;you can beat the ticket but you can&#x27;t beat the ride).<p>All that said, some judges &#x2F; courts tend to practically be a rubber stamp for whatever warrant &#x2F; subpoena the police want.

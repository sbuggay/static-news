The underlying study was observational and did not claim causation.<p>Medical journals and their associated media summaries are awash with low-certainty studies that get de-nuanced and overhyped. These studies are relatively easy to do - not to denigrate the work put in by the original study authors (it’s not their fault the press sensationalize their work). But for strong causative claims you ideally would have blinded controlled randomized trials. Sometimes such trials are not feasible, but that doesn’t mean you get to claim causation anyway just because the work to prove it is too hard.</div><br/><div id="40061702" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40061702" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dathinab</span><span>|</span><a href="#40061276">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40061973">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40061702">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40061702">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s less misleading then you might think.<p>There are cases (enough to not be treated as just some random coincidence; with and without vaccination) where people after Covid had a sever reduction of cognitive abilities that they have problems filling out relatively simple forms. So we can clearly speak of a reduction of IQ.<p>And while there is a lot of research needed and a lot of open questions and already half a year (or so?) into the pandemic we did know from how we observed COVID affecting the brain that it likely will cause a reduction in cognitive abilities at least in some cases which matches the (very many) observations we had since then.<p>This also matches what we know from other older studies about other virus infections which have some similarity with covid, e.g. causing Neuroinflammation. So every thing we observe and do know about the underlying mechanics implies that there is very likely a causation. (Through we need more studies for Neuroinflammation.)<p>So scientist do need to research it more and do need to pin down the exact mechanisms this causes reduction of cognitive abilities in some cases to largely varying degrees and how much of it is a direct and a indirect e.g. psychological effect.<p>But for everyone else it best to assume that getting COVID might reduce IQ if they are unlucky. Because if you aren&#x27;t a doctor, scientist or similar but just a random person who got COVID it kind doesn&#x27;t matter if your IQ gets reduced by COVID directly or indirectly or just correlated due to some other factor you don&#x27;t know about and in turn can&#x27;t systematically avoid.</div><br/><div id="40061955" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40061955" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">freehorse</span><span>|</span><a href="#40061276">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40061702">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40062047">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40061955">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40061955">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I do not think IQ tests are meant or designed to measure effects from illness.

But all had a common thing which was they weren&#x27;t dealing with those issues in a healthy ways. It was turning into a drinking club pretty much after the event was over. Even if you had problems this would exacerbate them over time.<p>There was a hefty dividing line among my friendship group after covid which was people who went down that route and people who went down the health and fitness route. The latter seem to be doing much better in all aspects even if they started in the former group.<p>I was running 10km once a week before. It knocked me off my feet entirely and I don&#x27;t run often now which got to me for a few months. But I fought it and can do that again now if I need to.

This isn&#x27;t because it&#x27;s some magical cure-all. It&#x27;s because their data is biased. The correct hazard ratio is found only in the 12-49 age group.<p>As they say in their discussion, this is because <i>&quot;in the event of a very short remaining life expectancy, (a subsequent dose of) COVID-19 vaccination may be decided against ... Vaccination is also postponed in the event of a fever ... This is also called the &#x27;healthy vaccine effect&#x27; and it is difficult to correct for this in observational research ... the results should be interpreted with caution&quot;</i><p>They also have the problem that <i>&quot;people who have been vaccinated, but have not given permission for registration in CIMS, have been incorrectly classified as unvaccinated (5 to 7 percent of the people)&quot;</i> which means that <i>&quot;This will have influenced the analysis of the risk of death after the first vaccination, because in this analysis the unvaccinated person time served as a reference&quot;</i><p>So this dataset is not usable for detecting vaccine side effects or induced deaths. It is a hopelessly corrupted dataset in which large numbers of people are misclassified and it&#x27;s not a randomized study.<p>But this is public health research, so they are happy to conclude anyway that <i>&quot;Based on these results there are no indications at a population level that COVID-19 vaccination increases the risk of death due to an adverse event.&quot;</i> which is a false statement. Their data doesn&#x27;t allow them to draw such conclusions.<p>The reason this topic is neuralgic is because if you want to be scientifically correct then you can&#x27;t actually know whether vaccines reduced deaths or not, but people really want to believe they did. The trials that were supposed to unambiguously measure this failed, in the sense that they showed no effect on deaths and yielded incorrect conclusions about reductions in infection rates (the number started at 95% effective and then was regularly revised, this is not supposed to happen and was due to their time windowing problems). Then attempts to measure it using mass datasets collected outside of RT context all yield incorrect conclusions due to dataset bias, but are presented as definitive anyway for political reasons.<p>Science is truly in a bad shape :(</div><br/></div></div><div id="40061843" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40061843" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kadkadels</span><span>|</span><a href="#40061232">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40061705">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40062111">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40061848">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40061843">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40061843">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Rule number 1: don&#x27;t argue with conspiracy theorists, they will come up with all sorts of nonsense.<p>&gt;„Fact checkers“ have been shown again and again to be politically biased up to active manipulation.

And you&#x27;re saying this goes beyond the PCR&#x27;s [polymerase chain reaction test] ability to get it in a regular swab so that we are missing chronic cases of SARS‑CoV‑2?<p>Bertagnolli: Correct. The virus can persist in tissues for months, perhaps even years.<p>Faust: OK. I think that&#x27;s certainly one theory, but I&#x27;m not sure that that&#x27;s settled. Is that fair? I mean, there&#x27;s one thing between people who are autopsy, they died of viral sepsis, as opposed to people walking around. Is there a distinction there?<p>Bertagnolli: Our emerging data shows that the virus can persist into tissues in the long term, and I think that&#x27;s really critical because it does help us think about possible ways to combat it, one being better antivirals. I think there&#x27;s a lot of focus on developing new antivirals as a possible way of preventing long COVID, and the other might be more aggressive treatment with antiviral therapy upon initial diagnosis.<p>Faust: If that&#x27;s the case, then it could be reactivated just like herpes is and shingles. Are we going to start seeing people get COVID not from infection, but from themselves in reactivation?<p>Bertagnolli: I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve seen or heard of any instance of that, and I don&#x27;t think you can ever assume that one virus is going to act like another.

There are only two things that will solve the software quality problem:<p>1. Economic incentives. It&#x27;s all just mindless blather unless you&#x27;re actually talking about ways that software vendors will be held liable for bugs in their products. If you&#x27;re not talking about that, what you&#x27;re saying is basically &quot;ok pretty please&quot; useless.<p>2. Reducing the complexity of making products secure in the first place. Making truly secure software products is <i>incredibly hard</i> in this day and age, which is one reason why demanding software product liability is so scary. Professional structural engineers, for example, are used to taking liability for their designs and buildings. But with software security the complexity is nearly infinitely higher, and making it secure is much harder to guarantee.<p>The other thing that people often ignore, or at least don&#x27;t want to admit, is that the &quot;move fast and break things&quot; ethos has been phenomenally successful from a business perspective. The US software industry grew exponentially faster than anyplace else in the world, even places like India that doubled down on things like the &quot;Software Capability Maturity Model&quot; in the early 00s, and honestly have little to show for it.</div><br/><div id="41608371" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41608371" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gwd</span><span>|</span><a href="#41606862">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41607421">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41608371">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41608371">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; At this point, I have to wonder what is even the point of missives like this. ...It&#x27;s all just mindless blather unless you&#x27;re actually talking about ways that software vendors will be held liable for bugs in their products.<p>I think that liability for bugs is exactly where she&#x27;s going with this.  I&#x27;m not an expert, but it sounds from a few things I&#x27;ve heard on some Lawfare podcasts (e.g,. [1][2]) like the idea of software liability has been discussed for quite a while now in government policy circles.  This sort of public statement may be laying the groundwork for building the political will to make it happen.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9UneL5-Q98E&amp;pp=ygUQbGF3ZmFyZSBzb2Z0d2FyZQ%3D%3D" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9UneL5-Q98E&amp;pp=ygUQbGF3ZmFyZ...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zyNft-IZm_A&amp;pp=ygUQbGF3ZmFyZSBzb2Z0d2FyZQ%3D%3D" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zyNft-IZm_A&amp;pp=ygUQbGF3ZmFyZ...</a><p>EDIT:<p>&gt; Making truly secure software products is incredibly hard in this day and age, which is one reason why demanding software product liability is so scary.<p>Loads of companies already are liable for bugs software that runs on their products: this includes cars, airplanes, and I would presume medical devices, and so on.  The response has been what&#x27;s called &quot;safety certification&quot;: as an industry, you define a process which, if followed, you can in court say &quot;we were reasonably careful&quot;, and then you hire an evaluator to confirm that you have followed that process.<p>These processes don&#x27;t prevent all bugs, naturally, but they certainly go a long way towards reducing them.  Liability for companies who <i>don&#x27;t</i> follow appropriate standard processes would essentially prevent cloud companies cutting security to get an edge in time-to-market or cost.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41607421" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41607421" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">EnigmaFlare</span><span>|</span><a href="#41606862">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41608371">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41607452">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41607421">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41607421">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree with her about blaming developers, not hackers.

You wouldn&#x27;t blame the wind for destroying a bridge - it&#x27;s up to the engineer to expect the wind and make it secure against that. Viewing them this way makes it clear that the people responsible for hacks are the developers in the same way developers are responsible for non-security bugs. Blame is only useful if you can actually use it to alter people&#x27;s behavior - which you can&#x27;t for international hackers, or the wind.<p>Banging this drum could be effective if it leads to a culture change. We already see criticism of developers of software that has obvious vulnerabilities all the time on HN, so there&#x27;s already some sense that developers shouldn&#x27;t be extremely negligent&#x2F;incompetent around security. You can&#x27;t guarantee security 100% of course, but you can have a general awareness that it&#x27;s wrong to make the stupid decisions that developers keep making and are generally known to be bad practice.</div><br/><div id="41608404" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41608404" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gljiva</span><span>|</span><a href="#41606862">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41607421">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41607896">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41608404">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41608404">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I agree with her about blaming developers, not hackers.<p>They are clearly called &quot;villains&quot;.<p>Wind isn&#x27;t a person capable of controlling their actions.

Writing secure software is easier than ever.<p>For example, there are several mainstream and full-featured web frameworks that use managed virtual machine runtimes. Node.js and ASP.NET come to mind, but there are many other examples. These are largely immune to memory safety attacks and the like that plague older languages.<p>Most popular languages also have a wide variety of ORMs available that prevent SQL injection by default. Don&#x27;t like heavyweight ORMs? No problem! There&#x27;s like a dozen micro-ORMs like Dapper that do nothing to your SQL other than block injection vulnerabilities and eliminate the boilerplate.<p>Similarly, web templating frameworks like Razor pages prevent script injection by default.<p>Cloud app platforms, containerisation, or even just virtual machines make it trivial to provide <i>hardware enforced</i> isolation on a per-app basis instead of relying on the much weaker process isolation within an OS with shared app hosting.<p>TLS 1.3 has essentially eliminated cryptographic vulnerabilities in network protocols. You no longer have to &quot;think&quot; about this concern in normal circumstances. What&#x27;s even better is that <i>back end</i> protocols have also uniformly adopted TLS 1.3. Even Microsoft Windows has started using for the wire protocol of Microsoft SQL Server and for the SMB file sharing protocol! Most modern queues, databases, and the like use at least TLS 1.2 or the equivalent. It&#x27;s now safe to have SQL[1] and SMB shares[2] exposed <i>to the Internet.</i> Try telling <i>that</i> to someone in sec-ops twenty years ago!<p>Most modern PaaS platforms such as cloud-native databases have very fine-grained RBAC, built-in auditing, read-only modes, and other security features on by default. Developers are <i>spoiled</i> with features such as SAS tokens that can be used to trivially generate signed URLs with the absolute bare minimum access required.<p>Speaking of PaaS platforms like Azure App Service, these have completely eliminated the OS management aspect of security. Developers never again need to think about operating system security updates or OS-level configuration. Just deploy your code and go.<p>Etc...<p>You have to be deliberately making bad choices to end up writing insecure software in 2025.

  Choosing Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) as the core driver of cybersecurity assumes that vulnerabilities are sparse, not dense.  If they are sparse, then the treasure spent finding them is well-spent so long as we are not deploying new vulnerabilities faster than we are eliminating old ones. If they are dense, then any treasure spent finding them is more than wasted; it is disinformation. 

  Suppose we cannot answer whether vulnerabilities are sparse or dense. In that case, a Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) of zero (instant recovery) is more consistent with planning for maximal damage scenarios. The lesson under these circumstances is that the paramount security engineering design goal becomes no silent failure – not no failure but no silent failure – one cannot mitigate what one does not recognize is happening.</code></pre></div><br/></div></div><div id="41607712" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41607712" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gavinhoward</span><span>|</span><a href="#41606878">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41606857">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41607712">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41607712">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t quite agree, but I do somewhat agree.<p>We need to professionalize and actually accept liability for our work.

For example, it exists in Android apps, iOS apps, Flatpak apps (Linux), Firefox[1][2], Chromium browsers[3][4][5], SELinux-enabled distributions such as Fedora and Hardened Gentoo[6], OpenSSH (Linux)[7], postfix&#x27;s multi-process architecture with use of ACLs, etc.<p>Kubernetes, Docker and systemd folk will be familiar with the idea of sandboxing for containers too, and they&#x27;re able to do so using much higher level controls, e.g. turn on Kubernetes &quot;Restricted pod security standard&quot; for much stricter sandboxing defaults. Even if containerisation and daemon sandboxing aren&#x27;t used, architects will understand the concept of sandboxing by just specifying more servers, each one ideally performing a separate job with the number of external interfaces minimised as much as possible. In all of these situations, the use of more granular controls such as detailed seccomp-bpf filters is most useful to mitigate the risks introduced by (ironically) security agent software that is typically installed alongside a database server daemon, web server daemon, etc within the same container.<p>Tweaking some Kubernetes, Docker or systemd config is _much_ cheaper and quicker to implement rather than waiting to rewrite software in a safer language such as Rust (a noble end goal). Even if software were rewritten in Rust, you&#x27;d _still_ want to implement some form of external sandboxing (e.g. systemd-nspawn applying seccomp-bpf filters based on some basic systemd service configuration) to mitigate supply chain attacks against Rust software which cause the software to perform functions it shouldn&#x27;t be doing.<p>[1] Firefox Linux: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searchfox.org&#x2F;mozilla-central&#x2F;source&#x2F;security&#x2F;sandbox&#x2F;linux&#x2F;SandboxFilter.cpp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searchfox.org&#x2F;mozilla-central&#x2F;source&#x2F;security&#x2F;sandbo...</a><p>[2] Firefox Windows: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searchfox.org&#x2F;mozilla-central&#x2F;source&#x2F;security&#x2F;sandbox&#x2F;win&#x2F;src&#x2F;sandboxbroker&#x2F;sandboxBroker.cpp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searchfox.org&#x2F;mozilla-central&#x2F;source&#x2F;security&#x2F;sandbo...</a><p>[3] Chromium multi-platform: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;security&#x2F;process-sandboxes-by-platform.md">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;security...</a><p>[4] Chromium Linux: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chromium.googlesource.com&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;src&#x2F;+&#x2F;0e94f26e8&#x2F;docs&#x2F;linux_sandboxing.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chromium.googlesource.com&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;src&#x2F;+&#x2F;0e94f26e8&#x2F;d...</a>  (seemingly Linux sandboxing is experiencing significant changes as this document or one similar to it does not appear to exist anymore)<p>[5] Chromium Windows: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chromium.googlesource.com&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;src&#x2F;+&#x2F;HEAD&#x2F;docs&#x2F;design&#x2F;sandbox.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chromium.googlesource.com&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;src&#x2F;+&#x2F;HEAD&#x2F;docs&#x2F;d...</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitweb.gentoo.org&#x2F;proj&#x2F;hardened-refpolicy.git&#x2F;tree&#x2F;policy&#x2F;modules&#x2F;services&#x2F;ssh.if" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitweb.gentoo.org&#x2F;proj&#x2F;hardened-refpolicy.git&#x2F;tree&#x2F;p...</a><p>[7] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openssh&#x2F;openssh-portable&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;sandbox-seccomp-filter.c">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openssh&#x2F;openssh-portable&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;sand...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41606847" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41606847" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">notepad0x90</span><span>|</span><a href="#41607344">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41607280">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41606847">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41606847">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Technology vendors are the characters who are building problems...&quot;<p>there are vendors building problems into their products? isn&#x27;t that a crime?<p>What a silly take.<p>&quot;House developers that build weak doors into houses are the real problem, not the burglars&quot;<p>Security is an age-old problem, it is not a new concept.

Burglars can just break the glass window and walk by the no-fence perimeter. You can and probably should get a more secure lock, but it is as strong as the door frame and windows, and whatever alarm system you&#x27;re using. In other words, for that analogy (and for what the CISA boss is saying) to be valid, there needs to be evidence that burglars give up and go home when the lock is secure. I would even go further and ask for a proper root cause analysis. Do the builders of masterlock know how insecure their lock is? If they  are indeed making it weak because of cost, then are they really to blame? they&#x27;re a business after all. Where is the regulation for proper secure locks. As a government agency, CISA shouldn&#x27;t be blaming vendors, that&#x27;s a cheap cop-out. They should be lobbying for regulation and laws, and then enforcing them. So, in the end, even if the CISA boss is right, ultimately she shouldn&#x27;t be blaming vendors but explaining what she&#x27;s been doing to pass regulations.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41607355" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41607355" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">acdha</span><span>|</span><a href="#41606847">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41607466">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41607280">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41607355">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41607355">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hint: she didn’t say that they were building them intentionally.

Writing software to DO-178B standards was estimated in [1] to double project costs. DO-178C (newer standard from 2012) is much more onerous and costly.<p>I pick DO-178 deliberately because the level of engineering effort required in security terms is probably closest to that applied to seL4, which is stated to have cost ~USD$500&#x2F;SLOC (adjusted for inflation to 2024).[2] This is a level higher than CC EAL7 as CC EAL7 only requires formal verification of design, not the actual implementation.[3] DO-178C goes as far as requiring every software tool used to verify software automatically has been formally verified otherwise one must rely upon manual (human) verification. Naturally, formally verified systems such as flight computer software and seL4 are deliberately quite small.

Now getting to the point: there is a real problem in that companies can advertise products to do a certain thing, and they can then have a license agreement that says &quot;we&#x27;re not liable if it fails to do what we said it would do&quot;, but generally despite those licenses (which to be clear are a <i>requirement</i> for open source to exist as a concept), the law has found companies are liable for unreasonable losses.<p>So the question is just how liable should a company be for a bug in their software (or hardware I guess depending on where you place the hardware vs firmware vs software lines) that can be exploited, and your position is that in addition to liability bought about by their own actions (Again despite the &quot;we have no liability&quot; EULAs plenty of companies have ended up with penalties for bugs in their software causing a variety of different awful outcomes.<p>But you&#x27;re going a step further, you&#x27;re now saying, in addition to liability for your errors, you&#x27;re also liable for other people causing failures due to those errors, either accidentally or intentionally.<p>I am curious, and I would be interested in the responses from your Real Engineer coworkers.<p>Who is responsible if a bridge collapses when a ship crashes into it? An engineer can reasonably predict that that would happen, and should design to defend against it.<p>Let&#x27;s say an engineer designs a building, and a person is able to bomb the building and cause it to collapse with only a small amount of fertilizer? What happens to the liability if the only reason the plot succeeded was because they were able to break past a security barrier?<p>Because here is the thing: we are not talking about liability if a product&#x2F;project&#x2F;construction fails to do what it says it will do (despite EULAs, companies generally lose in court when their product causes harm even if there&#x27;s a license precluding liability). The question is who is liable if a product fails to stand up to a malicious actor.<p>At its heart, the problem we&#x27;re discussing is not about liability for &quot;the engine failed in normal use&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;the engine failed after someone poured sugar into the gas tank&quot;, not &quot;the wall collapsed in the wind&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;the wall collapsed after someone intentionally drove their truck into it&quot;, not &quot;the plane crashed when landing due to the tires bursting&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;the plane crashed when landing as someone had slashed the tires&quot;.<p>What you&#x27;re saying, is that a Professional Engineer signing off on a design is saying not only &quot;this product will work as intended&quot;, they&#x27;re saying &quot;this product will even under active attack outside of its design window&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s an argument that seems to go either way: I don&#x27;t recall ever hearing about a lawsuit against door manufacturers due to burglars being able to break through the doors or locks, but on the other hand Kia is being sued due to the triviality of stealing their cars - and even then the liability claims seem to be due to the cost of handling the increased theft, not the damage from any individual theft.<p>[begin ranty portion: this is all I think fairly reasonable, but it&#x27;s much more opinionated than the now initial point and I&#x27;m loathe to just discard it]<p>I&#x27;m curious what&#x2F;who you think is signing off and what they are signing off on.<p>* First off, software is more complex than more or less any physical product, the only solution is to reduce that complexity down to something manageable to the same extent that, say, a car is. How many parts total are in your car? Cool that&#x27;s how many expressions or statements your program can have. And because it&#x27;s not governed by direct physical laws and similar interactions, then that&#x27;s still more complex than a car.<p>* Second: no more open source code in commercial products - you can&#x27;t use it in a product, because doing so requires sign off by your magical software engineers who can understand products more complex, again, than any single physical product<p>* Third: no more free development in what open source remains - signing off on a review now makes you legally liable for it. You might say that&#x27;s great, I say that means no one is going to maintain anything for zero compensation and infinite liability.<p>* Fourth: no more learn development through open source contributions, as a variation of the above now every newbie that submits a change brings liability, so you&#x27;re not accepting any changes from anyone you don&#x27;t know, and who you don&#x27;t have reason to believe is competent.<p>* Fifth: OSS licenses are out - they all explicitly state that there&#x27;s no warrantee or fitness for purpose, but you&#x27;ve just said the engineer that signs off on them is liable for it, which necessarily means that your desire for liability trumps the license.<p>* Sixth: Free development tools are out - miscompilation is now a legal liability issue, so now a GCC bug opens whoever signed off on that code to liability.<p>The world you&#x27;re describing is one in which the model of all software dev <i>including</i> free dev, now comes with liability that matches designing cars, or constructing buildings, both of which are much less complex and much more predictable than even the modest OSS projects, and those fields all come with significant cost based barriers to entry. The reason there are more software developers than there are civil or mechanical engineers is not because one is easier than the other, it&#x27;s because you cannot learn civil or mechanical engineering (or most other engineering disciplines) as cheaply as software. The reason that software generally pays more than those positions is because the employer is taking on a bunch of the financial, legal,  and insurance expenses required to do anything - the capital expenditure required to start a new civil or mechanical engineering companies is vastly higher than for software, and the basic overhead for just existing is higher, which means employers don&#x27;t have to compete with employees deciding to start their own companies. A bunch of this is straight up capital costs, and capital, but the bulk of it is being able to have sufficient liability protection before even the smallest project is started. At that point, the company has insurance to cover the costs so the owners are generally fine, but the engineer that missed something - not the people forcing time crunches, short cuts, etc - is the one that will end up in jail. You&#x27;ve just said the same should apply to software: essentially the same as today company screws up and pays fine&#x2F;settlement, but now with lowered pay rates for the developers, <i>and</i> they can go to jail.<p>All because you have decided to apply a liability model that is appropriate to an industry where the things that are signed off on have entirely self contained and mostly static behavior to a different industry where _by design_ the state changes constantly, so there is not, and cannot be, any equivalent &quot;safety&quot; model or system. Even in the industries that you&#x27;re talking about, where analysis is overwhelmingly simpler and predictable, products and construction fails. Yet now you&#x27;re saying the software development could just be the same as that. When developing a building, you can be paranoid in your design, and make it more expensive by overbuilding - civil engineering price competition is basically just a matter of &quot;how much can I strip down the materials of construction&quot; without it collapsing (noting that you can exactly model the entire behavior of anything in your design). Again, the software your new standards require are the same as that required by the space and airline industry that people routinely already berate for being &quot;over priced&quot;.<p>You&#x27;ve made a point that there are engineers, and professional engineers, and the latter are the only ones who sign off on things. So it sounds like you&#x27;re saying patches can only be reviewed by specific employees, who taken on liability for those changes, so now an OSS project has to employ a Professional Engineer to review contributions, who becomes liable for any errors they miss (out of curiosity, if a bug requires two different patches working together to create a vulnerability, which reviewer is now legally liable?). Those professional engineers now have to sign off on all software, so who is signing off on linux? You want to decode images, hopefully you can find someone to sign off on that. Actually it&#x27;s probably best to have a smaller in-house product, or a commercial product from another company who have had their own professional engineers sign off, and who have sufficient insurance. Remember that you need to remind your employees not to contribute to any OSS projects, and don&#x27;t release anything as OSS, because you would be liable if it goes wrong in a different product that you don&#x27;t make money from now (remember your own Professional Engineers have signed off on the safety of the code you released, if they were wrong, you&#x27;re now liable if someone downstream relied on that sign off).<p>This misses a few core details:<p><pre><code>  Physical engineering is *not* software engineering (which yes as a title &quot;software engineer&quot; is not accurate in many&#x2F;most cases as it does imply a degree of rigour absent in most software projects). Physical engineering does not employ the same degree of reuse and intermingling as occurs in software - the closest I can really think of is engine swaps in cars, but that&#x27;s only really doable because the engine is essentially the most complex part of the car anyway (at least in an ICE), and even then the interaction with the rest of the car is extremely constrained, predictable, and can be physically minimized. For civil&#x2F;structural engineering it&#x27;s even more extreme: large construction (e.g. the complex cases) are not simply made by mashing together arbitrary parts of other projects - buildings fall into basically two categories: the exact same building with different dimensions and a different paint job, or entirely custom.

  Physical engineering has basically an entirely predictable state from which to work. The overwhelming majority of any physical design is completely static, the things that are dynamic have a functionally finite and directly modelable set of states and behaviors, and those states and behaviors vary in predictable ways in response to constrained options. Despite this, many (if not most, though quantifying this would be hard because there&#x27;s also vastly more static engineering than dynamic) failures are in the dynamic parts of these projects than the static portions. Software is definitionally free of more or less any static behavior, the entire reason for software is the desire for constantly changing state.
</code></pre>
A lot of failures in physical engineering are the result of failing to correctly model dynamic behavior, and again, software is entirely the part that Real Engineers have a tendency to model incorrectly.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41607704" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41607704" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">petre</span><span>|</span><a href="#41607125">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41607221">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41607232">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41607704">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41607704">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; As long as &quot;SWEs&quot; do not have stamps and legal liability, they are not real (professional) engineers<p>When and if that happens I’ll move to carpentry.

Blaming it though helps to deflect attention away from ourselves though.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41606774" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41606774" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">davisr</span><span>|</span><a href="#41606732">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41607279">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41606906">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41606774">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41606774">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; If we truly want secure products, we should shutdown all Windows machines?<p>There should be a period where you put a question mark.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41606906" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41606906" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">idle_zealot</span><span>|</span><a href="#41606732">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41606774">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41606850">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41606906">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41606906">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Running the world&#x27;s critical infrastructure on verified, small, readable codebases rather than a diaspora of unvetted closed-source programs sprinkled across Windows and Linux systems sounds like a good start.</div><br/><div id="41606929" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41606929" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aerroon</span><span>|</span><a href="#41606732">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41606906">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41607070">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41606929">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41606929">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It wont matter unless the code is written specifically for the hardware and will only run on that hardware.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41607070" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41607070" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jdougan</span><span>|</span><a href="#41606732">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41606906">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41606929">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41606850">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41607070">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41607070">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We would need to dump POSIX&#x2F;WinXX and replace&#x2F;upgrade them with something better, probably using an object-capabilities approach.

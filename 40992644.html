Money has made me very happy. Once I saved up enough money from a high-paying job, I was able to quit and do whatever I liked. And I love every minute of it now. No 9-5, no wasting time doing things I don&#x27;t want to do.<p>The more money you have, the less you have to waste your precious finite time doing shit you don&#x27;t want to do. Money allows you to pursue your hobbies, travel, and just have time to appreciate life.<p>It does take less than people think. You just need enough to buy a cheap house in the middle of nowhere, an ability to give up some luxuries (big city life if you like that, new stuff all the time), and the intelligence to set up a few sources of relatively passive income and&#x2F;or set up a way to make a little money from hobbies in a surfer-like part-time fashion.</div><br/><div id="40993578" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40993578" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kubb</span><span>|</span><a href="#40993483">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40993525">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40993578">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40993578">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How much in terms of millions in today’s dollars?

Most people can do it and of course if you are married you need the support of your spouse. It just won&#x27;t work if they have a very materialistic lifestyle and like fancy stuff for example. If you have kids, it&#x27;s tricky but again not impossible. I&#x27;ve known some people that do it with kids so it can be done.<p>But assuming that is true, what skills do you have? Can you relocate? What do you consider essential? Feel free to email me if you want with your situation if you want.<p>My opinion is this: it is easier than you think but it requires some very unusual thinking and taking leaps of faith, and yes, it involves a little bit of what society might consider &quot;risky&quot; but less risky than people think. It requires a bit of discomfort but mostly of the mental kind.

A few centuries ago, it was normal for kids to have only a few toys, adults to have a few dozen books, at most, and this was typical. I don&#x27;t think kids then were less happy because they didn&#x27;t have modern consumer abundance.<p>Today, the social expectations on say, eating out at restaurants frequently, traveling for vacation, and so on are expensive, and to be a deliberately frugal person living in an urban area requires a lot of discipline and asocial behavior that wasn&#x27;t necessary before.<p>It would be interesting to do a study like this that selected people who care less about money, or at least cared less about the social expectations of money – and then see what an extra $500 or $5,000 would do.<p>1. Assuming their basic needs like food, shelter, clothing, parks, etc. are met with a decent level of quality.</div><br/><div id="40993172" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40993172" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">em500</span><span>|</span><a href="#40992925">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40992945">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40993172">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40993172">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Studies thad do address relative status:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdfs.semanticscholar.org&#x2F;21f7&#x2F;1b1ce15b2541bb74fef385839942e7389e42.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdfs.semanticscholar.org&#x2F;21f7&#x2F;1b1ce15b2541bb74fef385...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;personal.eur.nl&#x2F;veenhoven&#x2F;Pub1980s&#x2F;89f-full.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;personal.eur.nl&#x2F;veenhoven&#x2F;Pub1980s&#x2F;89f-full.pdf</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40992945" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40992945" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crooked-v</span><span>|</span><a href="#40992925">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40993172">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40992937">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40992945">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40992945">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; A few centuries ago, it was normal for kids to have only a few toys, adults to have a few dozen books, at most, and this was typical.<p>That stuff <i>was</i> &quot;keeping up with the Joneses&quot;, though.

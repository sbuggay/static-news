Canadians cheered higher prices and protectionism because fuck America and fuck Trump, but in the end cut off their nose to spite their face.<p>Canadians deserve their high prices and lack of competition and a market that is not consumer friendly, they made that loud and clear in their support of the Liberals during NAFTA2 Negotiations.<p>Glad I left a long time ago....<p>ExPat</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41497695" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41497695" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xp84</span><span>|</span><a href="#41493404">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41490542">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41497695">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41497695">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If Canada is anything like the U.S. the snag I think you&#x27;ll hit in establishing answers to questions like &quot;what does this pound of butter cost at X chain&quot; is that supermarkets now play so many games with pricing that there isn&#x27;t one answer!<p>1. Prices may be regionally or locally varying based on, I assume, either inventory management needs or their idea of what people in one area will tolerate.<p>2. Pricing gimmicks. At my local supermarket, a standard bag of potato chips is $6.99 or so, but during some phases of the moon it becomes &quot;$1.99 WHEN YOU BUY 4.&quot; Other products, a lot of packaged goods, go on sale in bundles: An item that may be $4.99 will be &quot;$1.99 WHEN YOU BUY 5&quot; participating products which may be chosen from certain unrelated stuff, like crackers, Tide, and Pillsbury biscuits. It&#x27;s up to you to scrutinize the circular, the shelves don&#x27;t always enumerate the eligible products. And finally, the best one, the &quot;with digital coupon&quot; prices. All you have to do is get on a sluggish app in terrible cell service, get properly signed in (oh, be sure to check your email because we needed to send you a &#x27;security code&#x27;) and locate and &#x27;clip&#x27; the coupon and then you get a sale price. If you forget to do that you&#x27;ll pay full price.<p>So in the above situations I&#x27;m concerned what kind of data integrity one would get because different consumers will pay different amounts. For instance, not everyone has room to transport 4 bags of chips home, so they may end up spending $7 for 1 instead of $8 for 4. Therefore the chips are simultaneously $2 and $7.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41490542" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41490542" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">3eb7988a1663</span><span>|</span><a href="#41497695">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41498479">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41490542">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41490542">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not sure if the author is here, but the downloadable SQLite database significantly benefits from applying compression (~75% with gzip).<p>Also, is there a write-up of how they collected the prices?

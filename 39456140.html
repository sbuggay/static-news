And similarly, if someone invests $10 for 10% of a company at $100 pre, they&#x27;re assuming that the discounted cash flows of the company are worth at least $100.  People who analyze financial statements and trade in markets assume this to be true - it&#x27;s fundamental to the price discovery mechanism.<p>But if the actual cost to the tenant was $0, the value of the service might have been any number greater than $0.  And similarly, if all the money in the investment comes back to the investor as revenue, the actual cost of their $10 investment wasn&#x27;t $10, it was $0.  <i>You can&#x27;t make inferences about what they actually value these services and investments at</i>, because the prices were not set by a free competitive market, they were set by companies colluding (or cooperating, depending on framing) for mutual benefit.<p>We saw the same issue with all the food-delivery startups that were offering 6 free meals - they booked the revenue and used it to justify outlandish valuations, and they booked the promotion as a marketing expense, but the root problem is that <i>consumers wouldn&#x27;t buy the product at list price, they were only buying it because of the investor-funded promotion</i>.  Or with Groupon - it was economically unviable for the businesses that participated, but they wouldn&#x27;t find that out until after their revenue could be used to justify the next funding round and cash out in an IPO.<p>Wash-trading is just the limiting case of this, where it&#x27;s apparent to everyone that the economic value of the transaction is zero because there is no actual product being traded, but a self-dealing transaction is used to set a price that other participants in the market anchor off of.<p>The tricky part is that sometimes this tactic <i>can</i> be economically viable, and offering discounted or financed products is a way to get consumers to get over the activation energy of trusting a new product, and once they&#x27;ve converted they become regular customers of the normal product offering and go on to spend a lot more.  This is the point of a sale, or a rebate, or a promotion, or a financing deal.  Which I guess answers my original question about why it&#x27;s legal here but not for crypto wash-trades: it can <i>sometimes</i> result in true economic value being provided, and it&#x27;s difficult to prove malice instead of incompetence.<p>But the caution being offered in this thread is to <i>not take revenue figures or valuations of AI startups or cloud providers at face value</i>, lest you be the one who is incompetent.</div><br/><div id="39462467" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39462467" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fnordpiglet</span><span>|</span><a href="#39457240">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39461941">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39458020">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39462467">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39462467">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m not sure I follow your logic. There is a market for, say, cloud computing services. If it helps you could see it as an exchange of cloud computing services for equity, but the reality is the cash invested likely was not 1:1 exchanged to cloud computing and they had optionality. That’s somewhat irrelevant, but it’s still a real truth. Any money used to purchase cloud services has real expenses and capital allocations associated, real economic value for the company who exchanged equity, and the investment still sits as an asset and liability. It’s hard to argue an AI model company derives no value from GPU hours, or Amazon derives no value from owning equity in and locking an AI model company into their platform and business relationships. This isn’t a wash trade, which literally has no economic value, and it isn’t fake revenues as there is a real exchange of economic value for both parties. The fact the exchange involves at cost services isn’t nothing - it magnifies the investment as otherwise they would have to purchase the services at a higher cost. The idea that reserved capital equipment and supporting services have no material cost or value to Amazon is on the surface false - they have a very real cost, both opportunity and capital, especially in a time of high end GPU shortage. The idea that reserved high end GPU at cost has no value for an AI company is absurd.  The fact it was done as cash gives flexibility in how the investment is used, and the fact it counts as a tiny amount of aws revenues is not materially relevant to anyone.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39458020" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39458020" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fnordpiglet</span><span>|</span><a href="#39457240">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39457522">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39458246">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39457953">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39458020">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39458020">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A realist would say the money is spent somewhere and better on your platform.

If I were CEO of Anthropic, I would have had one job that weekend.<p>I am very curious about Anthropic&#x27;s strategy right now; they launched with &quot;More progressive and careful about AI risks,&quot; which in my opinion is a good AI worker recruiting strategy, but not a good commercial strategy, or even a good quality strategy, based on Claude&#x27;s current state.<p>They have done some outstanding research this year -- in particular, I loved their work on tracking conceptual bundles through different layers, and I&#x27;d say their paper on embedding adversarial behavior in LLMs was my favorite paper of the year -- But, I&#x27;d like to see that research turn into more capable models.<p>As I write this, I wonder what I&#x27;d do if I were in charge there. I think I&#x27;d probably try and one-up Mistral, and release larger more capable models more quickly. I&#x27;d try and buy Groq and build a custom vertically integrated stack that&#x27;s 5x faster in tokens&#x2F;s; worst case Amazon could help with the acquisition and deploy Grok into AWS. Basically the moat would be deployed tokens&#x2F;s at or above certain levels of quality. I&#x27;d stop running anything but my own models on Groq hardware.<p>There are two next-gen directions for inference in the cloud, high quality multi-modal foundation models, which are definitely coming, but also clearly need some UI work to get into a compelling product format, and very long context length models, so I guess I&#x27;d possibly be trying to leapfrog there. It&#x27;s highly competitive in the model space right now, so a model-only strategy isn&#x27;t good.<p>Alternatively, I could sit back and relax and let AWS pimp Claude while we just scaled it up to 250k tokens and used MoE to get non-exponential scaling &#x2F; possibly explore an SSM &#x2F; Mamba architecture, and not worry too much since we have 4bn in the bank.

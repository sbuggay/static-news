This is unsubstantiated though. For juniors this suggests it will help them develop their capabilities to reason about implementations of problems without needing to face a a large amount of them.<p>The author then gives another advice which is to ask for a solution to a problem then after the initial proposal, ask for a 24h solution. This is meant to generate &quot;the real solution&quot;. He likens it the a path algorithm heuristic to reach your goal quicker.<p>Overall the methods are not well discussed in terms of pros and cons, nor substantiated with experiments.<p>Opinion: I think they may help some juniors who need to build up experience and may become stuck in development patterns. But they would rarely be useful to develop someone to be a senior, if all they do is chase fast implementations.

Our initial funding was for single-segment virus analysis, but about a year into the project, our grant collaborators needed to demonstrate multi-segment virus support within two weeks. My PI and I agreed on a quick and dirty method that would produce the analyses needed and could be done in the allotted time. That piece of code was fundamental to how the whole pipeline worked, however, and so as the pipeline grew, it took on the shape of the &quot;gun to the head&quot; decision we had made to the point where other, more essential features of the pipeline had to be delayed so I could come up with more workarounds.<p>There were clearly other issues at play here (scope creep and lack of separation of concerns were huge). My time at the lab came to a close, but if I were to have a chance to continue that project, I would start over from scratch rather than deal with the baggage that that one &quot;gun to the head&quot; moment created.<p>I understand that it&#x27;s a heuristic and not meant to be taken as 100% truth for every situation. I also understand that it&#x27;s trying to avoid that &quot;paralysis by analysis&quot; that&#x27;s so easy to fall into.

I&#x27;d figure out something quick—some combination of reducing scope and doing &quot;things that don&#x27;t scale&quot;—then spend time refining the conceptual design and interfaces, and finally rewrite the initial piece based on that new design.

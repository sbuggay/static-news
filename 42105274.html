Is there any chance for them to win if the case were brought to court?<p>One year ago, I had to contact Apple support because the FindMy feature wouldn&#x27;t work on my Airpods Pro, which still were under warranty. It looked like they were already associated with another account, which wasn&#x27;t mine. That made no sense as I bought them myself at the Apple store and only have a single iCloud account.<p>I went to the store and they acknowledged the issue, and immediately got a replacement which turned out to have the exact same issue. I then had to spend hours on the phone with their customer support. After trying everything without success, the person on the phone told me I&#x27;d get a call back in one week to either issue a refund or find a different solution.<p>That phone call never came. All my following messages to that person were ignored. I finally gave up, but found out I was far from being the only one they had ghosted like that. Reading these stories reinforces my belief that Apple is terrible in terms of accountability when something goes wrong.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42105530" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42105530" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lrem</span><span>|</span><a href="#42105526">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42105463">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42105530">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42105530">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m about to buy a Mac and it will be in the physical store, but for a different reason. In Switzerland if you buy online, you cannot make a return in store. Got a DoA Mac last November. Four people spent a total double digit number of hours on the phone with Apple, who were incompetent to the point it looked like malice. E.g. after taking about half an hour of my time, the lady decided my claim is legit, but she cannot process it because she’s in the wrong country(I called the Swiss number, they never told me they’re transferring the call abroad). But she’ll transfer me to someone who can just press a button now… After a couple minutes of music the same lady picks up, tells me she cannot find Switzerland in the list of countries, so I need to hang up and start from the scratch.

AFAIK most delivery companies nowadays work their shifts with delivery quotas. I.e. the courier needs to deliver everything on the truck (which is typically more than you could deliver in a time-based shift) before calling it a day.
Essentially, courier companies have found out that rather than scaling their workforce to the deliveries workload, it is more profitable to squeeze out a fixed number of employees to save wages, and occasionally apologize for the mixups caused by this situation.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42105540" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42105540" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rkuska</span><span>|</span><a href="#42105463">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42105539">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42105504">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42105540">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42105540">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Similair stories with UPS in Czech republic.

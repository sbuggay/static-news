Maybe future will prove me wrong on this - I&#x27;d be fine with it.<p>My take is an axiom that is omnipresent among tech bubble: Focus on what matters. Let&#x27;s ask ourself every time we put more than one thought into something: &quot;What is this really about?&quot; &quot;Why do I actually have to do this?&quot; etc. Even without AI our academic systems are being gamified every day. AI just accelerates (and partly even democratize) this movement. People follow a fassade and sadly the system followed. We need to start asking general questions more again. With AI and art this is even more visible. It is often overlooked that AI can not create something new. And you do not have the right to make a living by rearranging and combinging already existing ideas. But exactly this is the metric we should focus on: the new. If you don&#x27;t want to create something new, then fine, just copy and paste along. But making something new is hard and you&#x27;ll need to learn the basics yourself (tech the process, learn to learn, etc). But to make this approach imposed is even another misguided junction. It has to come from the one thing that is important: the new, the actual drive, the &#x27;doing it because I want it&#x27;</div><br/></div></div><div id="36953518" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36953518" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tobr</span><span>|</span><a href="#36953822">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36953057">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36953518">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36953518">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Random thought that just occurred to me: something I always wanted as a student but which is likely impractical because of the time it takes from the tutor, is to have an exam in the form of a conversation, where you can elaborate and explain and ask follow-up questions when you’re not quite sure, etc. This actually seems like something an LLM chat would be perfect for?

And to be sure there are Skinner boxes that run on computers like social media and Candy Crush that serve little purpose other than to sap our attention for advertising dollars. But... the act of programming a computer can be as mind-strengthening as writing, perhaps even more so. To program, say, a flight simulator, you have to know enough aerodynamics, deep down, to express it in a concrete, specific, and succinct way to a computer -- so if you want to strengthen your understanding of aerodynamics, writing a program to simulate it might be a good exercise. (I think this form of education was what Alan Kay was trying to get at with Smalltalk and the Dynabook project.)<p>Hmm... might programming and prompting an AI model both count as &quot;forms of writing you <i>can</i> engage in dialogue with&quot;? I think Socrates might sniff at them as weak forms of dialogue compared to sitting around talking with philosophers, but they&#x27;re more active and dynamic than reading fixed, printed text and therefore may well present new avenues of education.</div><br/><div id="36953845" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36953845" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mg</span><span>|</span><a href="#36953057">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36953762">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36953655">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36953845">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36953845">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><p><pre><code>    programming a computer can be as

Collect all student assignments in a database and routinely re-run them through the most up-to-date cheater-catching software available.  Anyone who gets flagged, even years after graduation, gets their degree revoked if they don&#x27;t make an adequate defence to the university.<p>If this is done, students don&#x27;t just have to fool teachers and their tools at the time they take the course, but all tools developed for years afterwards.

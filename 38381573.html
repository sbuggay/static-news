And the prescription is always to go back in time.<p>I don&#x27;t really think that&#x27;s possible. When you&#x27;re a newcomer, a disruptor, the whole point is to be different. You&#x27;re bold, you have a clarity of purpose, you say things like &quot;we&#x27;re building a new kind of a company&quot; or &quot;the user comes first.&quot;<p>But once you achieve market dominance, your priorities <i>have to</i> shift. It&#x27;s no longer &quot;why wouldn&#x27;t you try this&quot; or &quot;let&#x27;s do the right thing.&quot; It&#x27;s &quot;why would you rock the boat and risk the nice thing we have?&quot; It&#x27;s not just about profit. Careers and incomes are at stake. People will get hurt.<p>Risk tolerance aside, your organizational structure ossifies too. When you have people who have been running processes or departments in a particular way for fifteen or twenty years, they have little desire to start over from scratch. And that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, because what&#x27;s the alternative? A cutthroat corporate environment where you&#x27;re never sure about the future of your job?<p>I think the only comedy here is that Google looked at these old-school companies like Microsoft or IBM and figured they can be different just because they &quot;get it.&quot; And then, over time, they rediscovered the reasons why old companies always end up operating in a particular way.</div><br/><div id="38382602" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38382602" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eslaught</span><span>|</span><a href="#38382406">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38383040">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38382602">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38382602">[91 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When I was an intern at Google circa 2010, there was a guest lecture from a business professor who described exactly this process.

In terms of project selection, he focuses on trying to dismiss projects early on, by looking for reasons that a project might fail. And even rewarding employees for scrapping things early on. That doesn&#x27;t sound particularly unreasonable, but it largely just amounts to a conservative planning process. So then what exactly is the difference between a &#x27;moonshot&#x27; and a regular new project?<p>And so when you look at this sort of selection process it ends up being unsurprising that Google&#x27;s &#x27;moonshots&#x27; ended up being things like Waymo, Google watches, glasses, drone delivery, and so on. One of the largest companies in the world, with some of the deepest pockets in the world, and their &#x27;moonshots&#x27; are things dozens of other companies are building as well.

In practice, many of those innovations (Google Inbox, anyone?) were not deemed profitable enough to keep around. Others were never given the resources to grow beyond an experiment. And even with a long leash, a big company project is never going to innovate as quickly as a startup.<p>This year, however, with the extremely deep cuts to Google&#x27;s internal incubator (Area 120), it seems pretty clear that they&#x27;ve given up on this strategy, at least for anything that isn&#x27;t somehow AI-related.</div><br/><div id="38387279" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38387279" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eslaught</span><span>|</span><a href="#38382406">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38384916">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38388775">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38387279">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38387279">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s worth noting that was a turning point: the &quot;more wood behind fewer arrows&quot; policy adopted by Larry [1] initiated the die-off cycle of Google products. Prior to that, as far as I am aware, they were much more tolerant of products staying around in a mature-but-not-wildly-successful state. Afterwards, it seemed as if they would only keep things that maintained a trajectory to become as successful as their core products.<p>Again, this was not entirely unpredictable. While I don&#x27;t remember the details of that lecture, I remember the professor calling out these sorts of big shifts in cultural values as being typical of startups transforming into large companies. And Larry himself was part of the transformation, turning into (presumably, what he believed to be) what was needed to lead Google into its next stage as a large company.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;googleblog.blogspot.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;07&#x2F;more-wood-behind-fewer-arrows.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;googleblog.blogspot.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;07&#x2F;more-wood-behind-few...</a></div><br/><div id="38388227" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38388227" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">leoc</span><span>|</span><a href="#38382406">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38387279">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38388775">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38388227">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38388227">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Whatâs remarkable is that that phrase was already, at that time, notorious for having been a portent of doom at Sun Microsystems.</div><br/><div id="38389820" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38389820" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ChrisArchitect</span><span>|</span><a href="#38382406">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38388227">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38388405">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38389820">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38389820">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">..and now all that&#x27;s left of Sun is the wood on the back of the Meta sign.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38388405" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38388405" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jmcguckin</span><span>|</span><a href="#38382406">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38388227">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38389820">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38388775">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38388405">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38388405">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">All the wood behind one arrowâ¦</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38388775" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38388775" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacquesm</span><span>|</span><a href="#38382406">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38384916">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38387279">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38385479">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38388775">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38388775">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They made - and still make - one crucial error: you need to spin those projects that are simply viable out immediately after they take root.

One annoying captcha session later, I can search. (and ofc Google wants to know my location, despite knowing my address as part of my Google ID).<p>I tried &quot;El Dorado&quot; because I happened to have that boardgame on a shelf in front of me. Actually the results were pretty good - wikipedia, national geographic, IMDB, no ads. But yeah, not something there&#x27;s going to be many ads on, so let&#x27;s try something more adworthy.<p>So I switched to an Incognito window (many, many captchas) and tried &quot;erectile dysfunction&quot;.

As these things grow, the incentives change and the ability to understand what the organization even is becomes impossible.<p>A startup starts at the bottom. It begs investors, customers, and employees from a position of optimism and humility. The organization enthusiastically changes itself to find a good balance between those three or it dies. As the organization grows, it starts demanding everyone else change for them instead. Google&#x27;s interviews are an example. Its famous customer service is an example.<p>Then we get to size and complexity. Thanks to Dunbar&#x27;s numbers, we know that there are numerical limits to a human&#x27;s ability to know people. This makes sense. I can know everything about 6 people, most things about 50, and keep track of about 250 well enough. As the organization grows, your ability to know it disappears. You begin making abstractions. Instead of knowing exactly what Susan does, you say she works in X Department, for Y Initiative, doing Z position.<p>Google is so big that one person can&#x27;t understand it anymore. The inevitable reduction to a corporate abstraction occurs and then people treat it like the X Company, which is just like Y Company but makes X instead of Y. Short term revenue and expenses are the only measures at the end.<p>And in this faceless abstraction, the professional parasite class infests and extracts resources and morale. Eventually the C-suite stops fighting it and joins in on it until only the sheer size and momentum of the company keeps it going. Maybe an investor group will come and force a rework of the company, but not before the company is just a shadow of the shadow of its former self.</div><br/><div id="38389870" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38389870" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ytoawwhra92</span><span>|</span><a href="#38382406">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38386484">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38386538">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38389870">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38389870">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Thanks to Dunbar&#x27;s numbers, we know that<p>That dude just made the number up.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38386538" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38386538" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">whoknowsidont</span><span>|</span><a href="#38382406">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38386484">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38389870">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38383284">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38386538">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38386538">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;and the ability to understand what the organization even is becomes impossible.<p>What makes it impossible?</div><br/><div id="38386630" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38386630" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">obviouslynotme</span><span>|</span><a href="#38382406">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38386538">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38386836">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38386630">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38386630">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I explain it in the third paragraph but to illustrate it further: Consider a function.

Talents are not something easy to scale out. Transparency is inherently in tension against confidentiality, and when you have lots of eyes then the latter tends to win unless you&#x27;re comfortable of spending your daily life with all those media outlets.

Unless Google decide to shrink its business significantly, I&#x27;m not sure if going back in time is a viable option. The problem could be remedied by aggressive reduction of business&#x2F;operational complexity but it won&#x27;t solve the root issue. I don&#x27;t know the solution as well.<p>But I still agree with the point that Google generally lacks of clear organizational goal&#x2F;visions. This sort of inter-personal alignment is critical for scaling out any organizations, but Google lost it during its aggressive expansion period in Sundar&#x27;s tenure. Many teams usually fail to find clear causal, logical connections between their daily works and company-wide OKR. Then mid-level managements tend to develop bad organization signal such as entirely metric driven projects since they don&#x27;t know what to rely on.

I founded the first search intelligence business in 2005 as a side business. Again, Google engineers were awesome to work with.<p>Then in 2009 or so, they began to get territorial. Some outsider sales person was brought in and IIRC, he bought a boat and named it, &quot;AdSense&quot;. The engineering help disappeared. Within another year, some engineer in India told us our API access was going to be rescinded. We had extensive crawling capabilities but needed to correlate it to API data to give a holistic picture of the competitive AdWords landscape.<p>We spent the next two years gaming the system. We had 100 API accounts. We launched our own bare metal &quot;cloud&quot; with 1300 distinct IP addresses which we throttled to hit Google no more than once per minute.<p>This worked. We monitored Google in over 50 countries. Clients loved us because we could tell them exactly how they were doing on AdWords, both good and bad. Any intelligent person could use our data to improve their ads and excel. Our IPs would occasionally get banned but we would just temporarily shut them off and use one of our reserves. And even then, we eventually developed a crowd sourced solution to solve captchas which got them reinstated.<p>Another three years of the cat and mouse game passed. We were acquired by the world&#x27;s largest advertising company.<p>Guess what? A call from the CEO to Matt Cutts ended the war. No promises were made but our access was simply restored.

I might quibble about a few things, but I largely agree with his overall conclusions.<p>In the early days Google really was an amazing place to work. I agree wholeheartedly that for years nearly all Google products focused on just building awesome products for users, not maximizing revenue. The bean counters took over very, very slowly.<p>To the extent that Google&#x27;s culture is still &quot;good&quot;, it&#x27;s for the most part no longer remarkable. Most of the other tech companies have caught up to the best parts of Google&#x27;s culture, and exceeded it in many ways.<p>I totally relate to his experience with middle management. Towards the last few years at Google, my experience was that directors who moved on from a team were replaced with new middle-managers who knew how to play the game, but seemed to have little interest in the actual product they were managing. There will still plenty of fantastic people, but they had to spend way too much of their time just playing politics to do any good.<p>There&#x27;s one way that Google is still leading, and that&#x27;s in employee benefits. While they have been cut back somewhat, Google still offers one of the most generous free food &#x2F; meal benefits in Silicon Valley. I sincerely missed Google&#x27;s Vision plan that let me purchase both a brand-new pair of glasses and contact lenses annually with just a modest copay; since leaving Google it typically costs me over $350 to get just one pair of glasses.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38382816" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38382816" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">paxys</span><span>|</span><a href="#38387713">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38386089">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38382816">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38382816">[19 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Every bit of innovation in the AI space today originated at Google.

Google&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;Amazon and the like have zero incentive to continue to be the companies they were 20 years ago. They don&#x27;t need to take risks.

Certainly once they&#x27;re perceived as winning, they benefit from a compounding effect.<p>Really, &quot;innovation&quot; is a matter of hard work, timing, and luck. You need to work hard to ship a product or publish a theory. You need to recognize the opportunity and execute on it at the right time. And you probably need some luck to get your initial boosts.

It didnât work out. In fact, we ended up spinning more specs out of the W3C! The WHATWG has about 12 specs spread amongst eight or so editors now.<p>&gt; Bruce
The spec now known as HTML 5 began with a &quot;guerilla&quot; group called WHATWG. How and why did the WHATWG begin?<p>&gt; Hixie
The short answer is the W3C told us to.
The long answer: Back in 2003, when XForms was going through its final
stages (the &quot;Proposed Recommendation&quot; vote stage), the browser vendors
were concerned that it wouldnât take off on the Web without being made a
part of HTML, and out of that big discussion (which unfortunately is
mostly hidden behind the W3Câs confidentiality walls) came a proof of
concept showing that it was possible to take some of XFormsâ ideas and put
then into HTML 4. We originally called it &quot;XForms Basic&quot;, and later renamed
it &quot;WebForms 2.0&quot;. This formed the basis of what is now HTML 5.
In 2004, the W3C had a workshop, the &quot;The W3C Workshop on Web Applications
and Compound Documents&quot;, where we (the browser vendors) argued that it was
imperative that HTML be extended in a backwards-compatible way. It was a
turning point in the W3Câs historyâyou could tell because at one point
RedHat, Sun, and Microsoft, arch-rivals all, actually agreed on something,
and that never happens.
The outcome of that workshop was that the W3C concluded that HTML was
still dead, as had been decided in a workshop in 1998, and that if we
wanted to do something like HTML 5, we should go elsewhere. So we announced
a mailing list, and did it there.
At the time I was working for Opera Software, but &quot;we&quot; in this case was
Opera and Mozilla acting together (with Apple cheering us from the
sidelines).<p>W3C declared html dead and now you are mad on whatwg for html5?</div><br/><div id="38387487" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38387487" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lapcat</span><span>|</span><a href="#38383327">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38387099">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38387721">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38387487">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38387487">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; W3C got what it deserved.<p>This is an unnecessarily &quot;team&quot;-oriented spin. The question is what the web and the users of the web deserve, and I don&#x27;t believe they deserve to be dominated by a few giant tech corporations who have a monopoly not only on web browsers but also on operating systems.<p>&gt; Now that the W3C has come to its senses, is it time for the WHATWG to hang up its spurs and for its participants to work inside W3C to continue the development of the web platform?<p>Yes.<p>Here&#x27;s the major problem: the tech world of 2003 was a lot different than the tech world of 2023. Back then, iOS didn&#x27;t exist, Android didn&#x27;t exist, Google Chrome didn&#x27;t exist, Safari barely existed. The WHATWG members are infinitely more dangerous and monopolistic now than they were back then. Maybe, arguably, HTML5 was the better outcome at the time of the dispute at that time, but the dominance of the major browser vendors now is not the better outcome.<p>The irony is that Mozilla and Opera inadvertently handed over great power to the BigCos who would come to overshadow and virtually annihilate them. You won the battle but lost the war. Opera even had to switch to Chromium.<p>&gt; So we announced a mailing list, and did it there.<p>It seems to me that more time could have been taken and more lobbying done.<p>&gt; W3C declared html dead and now you are mad on whatwg for html5?<p>Well, I personally think HTML5 &lt;video&gt; was completely botched and became a nightmare, but that&#x27;s a bit of a digression.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38387721" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38387721" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kccqzy</span><span>|</span><a href="#38383327">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38387099">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38382020">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38387721">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38387721">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I disagree.

Google has been in obvious, uncontrolled freefall for several years now. Search barely works anymore, they squandered a massive lead in AI, they are losing in cloud services, Android is so awful it kills me when I have to use it for more than a few minutes. I can&#x27;t think of any good new projects or services that were created under Sundar&#x27;s tenure (maybe Colab was cool when it came out, but it hasn&#x27;t improved at all in years and is now badly lagging). And their propensity to kill services without a thought has made it so that any new service they introduce is met with eye rolls from people who have been burned way too many times.<p>The solution seems clear to me: they should acquire a really well run, innovative smaller company and then replace all the top executives with the new team. Sundar should be removed immediately before he destroys even more value. And then they need to do relentless cleaning up, quickly getting rid of unproductive middle managers like the person described in this post. That should give a burst of energy to demoralized devs.<p>Then they need to desperately work to fix search so that it doesn&#x27;t suck so much that you need to add &quot;reddit&quot; to every query to not get 100% blog spam.

In fact, so much that two weeks ago I put my money where my mouth is by selling $1M worth of GOOG I was given as part of a stock grant when I was hired by Google in 2014. (I promptly reinvested this capital in a generic S&amp;P 500 index fund.)<p>From 2014 to mid 2015, when I quit, I found Google had a great engineering culture and I loved my time at the company, but I was having gut feelings of the start of a decline. I saw engineering hires who weren&#x27;t so skilled. I saw Larry and Sergei seemingly lack the spark in their eyes when giving candid answers at our TGIF meetings. I saw a buildup of red tape and overhead. Then, long after quitting Google, more problems crop up. In the last year or so I saw a noticeable decline in the quality of Google search engine results. In the last 2 months I saw an even more noticeable decrease of the quality of Gmail&#x27;s spam filters (today I get ~10 spams daily out of ~50 legitimate emails.) I keep stumbling on more and more annoying bugs in Google&#x27;s Android apps that remain unfixed for years.<p>No one knows how long this stagnancy or decline is going to last. In the case of Microsoft they have stagnated (IMHO because of Ballmer) roughly between 2005 and 2017 (6% annual revenue growth on average). Since 2017, thanks to Satya Nadella&#x27;s turnaround, their annual revenue growth was 13% on average. I think Google needs to see leadership change to whip the company back into shape. But this probably won&#x27;t happen for another few years. There is so much inertia in market forces of a huge mastodon like Google that it will take another couple years for such sub-par products and services quality to start noticeably affecting revenue growth. That inertia is the same reason it took 3 years of Nadella as CEO before Microsoft saw revenue growth starting to bounce back up.</div><br/><div id="38389069" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38389069" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gen220</span><span>|</span><a href="#38385920">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38383071">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38389069">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38389069">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Disclaimer that I also sold my GOOG recently, also largely in compliance with my biases as an engineer.<p>As an investor, though, calling the âtopâ for a company like Google (or Microsoft) is so challenging â not âtopâ in terms of all time high valuation, but âtopâ in terms of differential forward-looking, annualized, and adjusted-for-tax returns vs VGT or VOO (i.e. a more challenging target).<p>These are some of the most entrenched and profitable companies in modern history.

It&#x27;s more of a difference of opinion.<p>For example, I mentioned the other day that it&#x27;s sad that the lawsuits around Google Books left the Web deprived of important content, but I don&#x27;t view that as unfair.  I think the publishing industry&#x2F;authors had a reason to want to maintain control.  Reasonable people can disagree on that one.<p>---<p>I also think there are many issues that Google hasn&#x27;t gotten ENOUGH flack for.<p>The privacy stance of the company has been terrible from the beginning.  I remember TGIF questions going back to 2005 about privacy, and they were more or less brushed off by Larry Page.<p>Google has REPEATEDLY paid out huge settlements in violation of the law.  There was the one about circumventing a Safari change to deliver ads, the early one about the &quot;war driving&quot; and the SSISD database.<p>A hilarious thing is I just searched for &quot;list of settlements paid out by Google&quot;, and there was a pretty big one in 2022, which I had no idea about.  Apparently Android would still track your location irrespective of user settings?  Didn&#x27;t know that, but it&#x27;s unsurprising.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;google-location-tracking-data-william-tong-392-million-settlement&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;google-location-tracking-data-w...</a><p>Would people argue that there was some misunderstanding there, or the company was unfairly prosecuted?<p>I don&#x27;t know the details of that case, but I&#x27;ve seen a VERY consistent pattern from Google.  The line in terms of &quot;dark patterns&quot; has been pushed for 15+ years, to the point where current employees don&#x27;t even understand what a dark pattern is.  It&#x27;s just cultural now.<p>There are so many of these lawsuits and settlements that people don&#x27;t even pay attention anymore.  They just assume Google has bad intentions, and I think that&#x27;s approximately correct.<p>If you were there in the early days, you remember when Google Toolbar collected an unprecedented amount of data (IIRC, Windows hooks for what you typed, plus what you clicked on), but it was NEITHER opt-in or opt-out.  The user had to choose explicitly.<p>That culture is completely gone.  It&#x27;s not even close to that.  IMO the company deserves its erosion of trust, and the public hasn&#x27;t been unfair.<p>(There was also the product manager who coined &quot;default opt-in&quot; -- I repeatedly encountered such fuzzy and &quot;interested&quot; thinking in my time at Google.  Some people weren&#x27;t even aware they were doing it.  They were just doing what was in the culture -- what&#x27;s rewarded.)<p>Another early one was when Google had a &quot;Windows deskbar&quot;, and it would ignore your setting to turn it off.  It will continually appear on reboot, even when you asked it not to.  There was an additional &quot;dark pattern&quot; checkbox -- you had to find 2 places to turn it off, not 1.  I filed an internal bug on that one, and got a response from the product manager.  They didn&#x27;t change anything.<p>---<p>When I compare early Google to say OpenAI, I think Google was at least 10x better.  The products were better, it made way more money, and the working environment was better.   (And I made that comparison 3 months ago, before last weekend&#x27;s OpenAI drama - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37399239">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37399239</a> )<p>But I don&#x27;t think the public has been unfair to Google overall.<p>Google created amazing things, and got credit for them plus even more.  But it also had both bad outcomes and bad intentions on many products.  
You can say that&#x27;s one Vic Gundotra in the company, but there were multiple Vic Gundotras.  And Vic had a mandate from the top.<p>Products that were poorly executed, violated the law, dishonestly marketed, predictably shut down despite early promises, etc.<p>There&#x27;s a very clear pattern, going back more than 10 years at this point, but you can see it from 15 years ago too.  The company simply isn&#x27;t user-centric, full stop.  I can&#x27;t see anyone argue otherwise.<p>What&#x27;s the most user-centric improvement from Google in the last 5 years?  (honest question)  As a user, I honestly stopped paying attention to any new product launches over 10 years ago.  My favorite product is probably YouTube, with a lot of great content, and I pay for it.  Other than that, I just kinda get by with GMail, Maps, and search.  The latter has deteriorated rapidly.<p>In general, I do not look forward to new Google products.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38383368" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38383368" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ThrowawayB7</span><span>|</span><a href="#38382007">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38382752">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38383103">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38383368">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38383368">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; &quot;<i>It&#x27;s frustrating to continue to see both the level of genuinely well-intentioned work that the public is unfairly (and often viciously) critical of the motives of...</i>&quot;<p>It&#x27;s inevitable that the top business in any sector gets loads of uninformed and&#x2F;or just plain dumb haters.

Thankfully I was grown up enough to be polite, but really I was such a techno-determinist that I figured user problems came from ignorance.*<p>To be fair, I was not the only one: the insights described in this book draft surprised a lot of people, not just how they improved the copiers but how those two even approached the problem (starting with the sociology of the repair workers).  It sure surprised Xerox management.  But I’ve heard it said many times that this work led to restructuring the paper path in a way that justified (paid for) everything spent on PARC.<p>I did grow up of course and now do see my work (machines, chemistry, etc) as a small part of a large social system.  A successful company has to base its product plans starting this way.<p>To choose an example of failure to appreciate the social scope (but not pick on it) the crypto folks spend their time on technology, based on a social model they <i>want to exist</i> rather than the one that currently does.  I think it’s a big reason why it’s barely impacted the world in, what, 15 years?  Xerox was the same, and it helped them sell a lot of copiers, but didn’t make them as ubiquitous as they could have been. Another example: everybody laughs at Google for launching “products” that go nowhere and are quickly forgotten.  We all know it’s because of a screwed-up, internally-focused culture.  But sometimes a product succeeds without marketing (e.g. gmail, at the time) because it happened to be matched to the actual, external need.  It makes this kind of continuous failure even more damning.<p>* TBH, 40 years later I have not 100% shed this view — e.g. my attitude towards complaints about git.

They were always finicky, messy and dirty, but this is a really great piece and three things stand out for me.<p>The article claims that PARC paid for itself (1) through the anthropological sociological studies of copier repair technicians which revealed shortcomings in the engineering of the copiers and resulted in changes to the paper path and handling in newer designs and significantly reduced maintenance cost and difficulty. Two, enabling information sharing between repair technicians over radios and technician created and maintained documentation, saved the company 5-8% of service cost and these innovations were resisted by services management which was invested in the idea that copier repair technicians should be cheap, interchangable monkeys. Three, Xerox management likely left significant money on the table because they fundamentally and willfully misunderstood copier repair and copier repair technicians and the value they were creating for the company. Likely, mostly because repair was seen as a cost center which in an ideal world would be eliminated entirely.<p>1.

You would basically either have a crap one you could operate yourself, or take your stuff to the printery to have professionals (a subset of librarians I think, or the logical join over librarians and computer operations staff) do it for you. Printing machines had a fleet of maintainers, craft unions who walked off the job if you touched a dial.<p>They were amazing at doing things which really mattered: shrinking an A0 architectural drawing down but maintaining aspect ratio. Adjusting offsets for the print for binding signatures, so the 1st and 16th page was not too far out because of wrapping around the other 8 pairs of pages. Even just working out how to rotate the pages for N-up printing. But the GUI sucked. I think they called ours &quot;the bindery&quot; because it&#x27;s main gig was doing PHD from soup to nuts, binding included.<p>The repair techs had the most amazing flight cases, packed with tools which served  one specific purpose.Like, A doohickey to adjust the corona wire, without dismantling the imaging and toner roller, with a tonne of equipment hovering over your head on a gas-lift. Screwdrivers with very very carefully chosen lengths. Torque wrenches. It was high tech meets motor racing meets.. IBM.<p>I am told they were paid better than many computer techs. The IBM guy was paid IBM scale to fix it on IBMs timescales. the xerox guy did more random shit, with more devices, more often.<p>They had a very corporate look. that amazing briefcase or six. Suit, tie. Very acceptable.<p>I know a guy who worked for a paper-folding-and-envelope-stuffing company and it was very similar culturally: can-do, fix anything, but working on giant multi-million dollar machines which were used twice a year to do tax mailouts, and election materials, and the rest of the time rented to the original spam merchants for 10c per thousand mailouts. The secondhand value of these machines were like photocopiers: Really significant. He was brought out of retirement to help take one apart into TEU equivalent chunks to be shipped to Singapore from Brisbane. His retirement gig at one point was repairing Espresso machines, he said it made him feel familiar and useful.<p>The era which was the end of the typing pool was fascinating.

If you look at a modern mainframe CPU it becomes pretty clear where the differences lie.

There&#x27;s a lot more focus on parallelization and horizontal scaling.<p>Mainframe overall compute is nowhere near a supercomputer, and you probably shouldn&#x27;t be running a massive physics simulation on a mainframe, but you may get more consistency and reliability for well defined tasks.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41177668" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41177668" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Taniwha</span><span>|</span><a href="#41167663">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41170227">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41170956">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41175278">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41177668">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41177668">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes exactly, core cycle times were ~1uS so around 1Mhz clock for our old B6700</div><br/></div></div><div id="41175278" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41175278" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kragen</span><span>|</span><a href="#41167663">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41170227">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41177668">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41168616">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41175278">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41175278">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">your phone is 5–10 billion instructions per second, a thousand times faster.  it&#x27;s probably a quad-core in-order arm running at 1–2 gigahertz, not 1–2 terahertz</div><br/><div id="41175300" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41175300" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dmd</span><span>|</span><a href="#41167663">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41175278">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41168616">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41175300">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41175300">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Instructions and hertz have not been equivalent for almost a quarter of a century now, though.</div><br/><div id="41175336" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41175336" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kragen</span><span>|</span><a href="#41167663">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41175300">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41168616">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41175336">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41175336">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">not equivalent, but close enough in this case; even my laptop only manages less than 2 ipc per core, and the error in your earlier comment is a factor of 1000</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41168616" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41168616" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bruce511</span><span>|</span><a href="#41167663">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41167940">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41169189">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41168616">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41168616">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We still have an old printing machine.

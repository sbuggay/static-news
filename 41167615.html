You would basically either have a crap one you could operate yourself, or take your stuff to the printery to have professionals (a subset of librarians I think, or the logical join over librarians and computer operations staff) do it for you. Printing machines had a fleet of maintainers, craft unions who walked off the job if you touched a dial.<p>They were amazing at doing things which really mattered: shrinking an A0 architectural drawing down but maintaining aspect ratio. Adjusting offsets for the print for binding signatures, so the 1st and 16th page was not too far out because of wrapping around the other 8 pairs of pages. Even just working out how to rotate the pages for N-up printing. But the GUI sucked. I think they called ours &quot;the bindery&quot; because it&#x27;s main gig was doing PHD from soup to nuts, binding included.<p>The repair techs had the most amazing flight cases, packed with tools which served  one specific purpose.Like, A doohickey to adjust the corona wire, without dismantling the imaging and toner roller, with a tonne of equipment hovering over your head on a gas-lift. Screwdrivers with very very carefully chosen lengths. Torque wrenches. It was high tech meets motor racing meets.. IBM.<p>I am told they were paid better than many computer techs. The IBM guy was paid IBM scale to fix it on IBMs timescales. the xerox guy did more random shit, with more devices, more often.<p>They had a very corporate look. that amazing briefcase or six. Suit, tie. Very acceptable.<p>I know a guy who worked for a paper-folding-and-envelope-stuffing company and it was very similar culturally: can-do, fix anything, but working on giant multi-million dollar machines which were used twice a year to do tax mailouts, and election materials, and the rest of the time rented to the original spam merchants for 10c per thousand mailouts. The secondhand value of these machines were like photocopiers: Really significant. He was brought out of retirement to help take one apart into TEU equivalent chunks to be shipped to Singapore from Brisbane. His retirement gig at one point was repairing Espresso machines, he said it made him feel familiar and useful.<p>The era which was the end of the typing pool was fascinating. All kinds of arcane roles which only make sense in the absence of email and tiny printers everywhere. Some of those jobs had been there from the days of hand-copying, Dickens-era and before.</div><br/><div id="41167940" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41167940" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Taniwha</span><span>|</span><a href="#41167663">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41168616">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41167940">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41167940">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Back in my mainframe days (late 70s) we ran a large mainframe, the only one in the local uni - way slower than your phone, a couple of Mb of core, ran payroll and 30 terminals. We had a dedicated local engineer who had his own onsite office. In the south of NZ we were a really long long way away from his home office in the US, he was expected to be able to fix anything, and mostly he could.<p>But one time the machine started writing crap on random things - screens, printers, worst of all disks - could take a day or to to recover after it scribbled across the equivalent of the root file system (giant head-per-track coffee table sized platters). The poor engineers couldn&#x27;t figure it out, it happened so in frequently eventually they flew a guy out from head office in the US - he came with a wooden stick - he ran it down a card cagore in the IO process, nothing happened, he tried the next row bang! it crashed, after we were back up he continued with his wooden stick doing a binary search for the source, eventually he pulled a card and 3 little solder balls fell into his hand, they&#x27;d been sitting there loose against IC pins since it was installed<p>As you point out sometimes it just takes having the correct tool and knowing how to use it</div><br/></div></div><div id="41168616" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41168616" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bruce511</span><span>|</span><a href="#41167663">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41167940">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41168616">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41168616">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We still have an old printing machine. It came as part of an acquisition and took a truck to move. We rent a small unit in an industrial complex to house it.<p>Nobody knows how old it is. It predated the folk who came with it (all of whom were close to retirement.)<p>It&#x27;s still running (looked after by one of the retirees on a part time basis.) He does print runs a couple times a week. To seem him with an oil can in his hands is to step back in time.<p>It&#x27;s more or less neutral profit-wise, but pays his wage and keeps some old customers happy. When he gives up the machine goes too (likely for scrap I guess).</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

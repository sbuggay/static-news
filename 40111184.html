The block separation by single characters is ok. Using (), [] and {} to separate things makes things easier on the compiler, but it’s probably down to personal preference whether you like that syntax or not. I certainly vastly prefer the more simplistic approach where you don’t have to wrap everything in brackets. Like a loop… why does it really have to be inside a () denotion? Similarly I prefer Pythons indent to {}’s. Which can technically make your code harder to read, but if your Python code is hard to read it’s likely bad. Not always, but most of the time. I guess {} is better than BEGIN END, but maybe not in terms of readability.<p>The end of line character, ; is also sort of unnecessary for the most parts. Again it’s mostly a relic which helps the compiler, and some people like it while others don’t.<p>Modern loops look nothing like they did in C. Neither does variables or properties.<p>The use of English for a lot of things, or the use of western character sets, is also sort of bad in the modern world. Which is part of the reason behind the huge popularity of Go in Asia. Not that it’s so bad as it’s just how it is and everyone has adopted.<p>Anyway. Modern C style syntax like you’ll finds in C# or Java is rather cumbersome in my opinion. Rust sort of falls into this category but at least with Rust it’s very easy to define ownership of your stored data as you pass it around in your code. But almost all of it is exactly that… modern. Almost none of it is from C and a lot of it would not have existed without languages like Ruby.<p>You also have to keep in mind that Ruby predates the modern C syntax. As others have mentioned it’s been influential on the modern C syntax, but it was also made in a world where they modern syntax simply didn’t exist.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40111957" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40111957" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stouset</span><span>|</span><a href="#40111431">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40111833">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40112114">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40112127">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40111957">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40111957">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What exactly do you think the purpose of having different programming languages <i>is</i>?<p>The popularity and usefulness of Ruby’s block-based control flow, which you seem to take issue with, is almost certainly largely responsible for the adoption of lambdas in… basically every modern language, not to mention being backported to existing languages like C# and Java.<p>Frankly your hot take is terrible. C was an amazing language, but there are an infinite number of practical and effective ways to improve upon it. Particularly having just admitted that you’ve <i>never actually used the syntax in question</i> it’s honestly astonishing that your first instinct is to jump straight to posting about how much better the C approach is.<p>Hell, you’d be hard-pressed these days to find a modern language that uses C-style `for` loops. They might say `for` on the tin, but they’re <i>much</i> closer to Ruby-style enumerators than they are to C-style setup-condition-increment control flow. With, of course, the caveat that that’s all they ever can be since they’re keyword syntax rather than just a method.<p>What a sad world this would be if everything interesting in programming was discovered by K&amp;R in the 1970s.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40112127" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40112127" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">saurik</span><span>|</span><a href="#40111431">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40111833">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40111957">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40112010">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40112127">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40112127">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Smalltalk and C both came out in 1972 and it really isn&#x27;t clear to me that C&#x27;s crazy for-loop design -- one that actually isn&#x27;t used by many programming languages -- is somehow better than the one used by Algol, so I am struggling to find even a single thing you said which is making any sense to me :(.</div><br/><div id="40112276" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40112276" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vidarh</span><span>|</span><a href="#40111431">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40112127">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40112210">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40112276">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40112276">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have programmed C since the 1980&#x27;s, and I still avoid C for loops when writing C because they&#x27;re hideous.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40112210" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40112210" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pjmlp</span><span>|</span><a href="#40111431">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40112127">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40112276">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40112010">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40112210">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40112210">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It really isn&#x27;t, as I have lost count of how many get clever uses out of that loop.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40112010" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40112010" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">krainboltgreene</span><span>|</span><a href="#40111431">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40111833">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40112127">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40111939">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40112010">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40112010">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I feel like each new language absolutely needs to reinvent existing standards that have proven effective, just so that it feels unique.

One could argue about my use of &quot;...&quot; and endless def, but one certainly would not typically implement each when forwarding to an Array by using a for loop to iterate over it other than to make it relatable to Python developers...<p>And, more controversially perhaps, the last three lines can be reduced to:<p><pre><code>    Stuff.new.each { puts _1 }
    puts Stuff.new.map.to_a
    puts Stuff.new.select(&amp;:even?)
</code></pre>
The first one is one that will cause arguments. The second just showcases that map is pointless here other than as an example - map here effectively just a slow way of duplicating the array, but notably first when forcible evaluated as map without a block will return an Enumerator, and &quot;&amp;:even?&quot; is fairly idiomatic for &quot;call to_proc on this symbol and apply it to the argument&quot;, but some might still not be familiar with it.</div><br/><div id="40112466" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40112466" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">re</span><span>|</span><a href="#40111383">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40112341">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40111602">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40112466">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40112466">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; his &quot;Stuff&quot; example can be reduced to [...]<p>The Python example is similarly unidiomatic, reduceable, and flawed for the sake of simplicity (the example doesn&#x27;t allow multiple independent Stuff iterators), so it&#x27;s not like Ruby is really at a disadvantage in the article.

Prussia, under Bismarck, was very much on its way to form a proper Nation. It fought multiple wars, including against Austria-Hungary. Also true, Bismarck saw the risk of a global, and disastrous conflict if the European powers were not balanced well, hence his, IMHO, ingenious system of mutual alliances, non-aggression pacts and the like that was designed to isolate whatever nation started to declare war on others. This is something especially Americans seem to totally miss, the same way Brits have a biased view on Napoleon.<p>What allowed WW1 to happen, among a lot of other reasons, was Wilhelm II&#x27;s dismanzling of Bismarks alliances and treaties.<p>Also true, despite giving Prussia its first social insurance system, Bismarck was an aristocrate through and through, and by no means a democrat.<p>But drawing a direct line from Bismarck, to the war of 1870, ober WW1 to WW2 goes to far. Heck, that lone is already sketchy if one tries to link the Nazis <i>directly</i> to WW1, going even further back is somewhat misleading.<p>Edit: To emphasize, my comment is related to the article, explicitly not the book discussed in said article which I didn&#x27;t read. Overall, I like it when wars are looked at and analyzed from different perspectives than battles and the like.

He also seems to have understood that fast, quick wars, like the war of 1870, was the only kind of war Germany could win. And that those wars were a thing of the past. hence his well balanced system of treaties, including secret ones, to reduce the likelihood of that happening.<p>And France getting out of isolation was actually a good thing, or at least not a bad one. Or was France, after 1870, on the attacking side of any war? It wasn&#x27;t. it wasn&#x27;t even involved in a lot of wars not forced upon it by others until the futile attempts to hold on to the colonies post WW2.<p>And no, Bismarck did not set-up the pre-WW1 alliances, the alliances in place leading up to WW2 were not designed by Bismarck. Those alliances were the result of Wilhelm 2&#x27;s actions in <i>dissolving</i> the rather ambiguous Bismarck system, which led to the building of the Prusso-German-Austrian block on one side and the British-French-Russian one on the other. Exactly what Bismarck wanted to avoid, and did as long as he had a say.<p>EDIT: Prussia, and Germany general, was only able to win quick wars. Everything else required allies, and that fact was already by Frederick the Great and driven home clearly by the Napoleonic wars. The reasons are, in a nutshell, the fact any prolonged war will inevitably be a two front one. That Prussia didn&#x27;t have the necessary resources for a prolonged war. And that without secured access to the sea, any colonies Prussia &#x2F; Germany had were basically useless. And that access was a non-started as soon as the Royal navy, or even the French one later, got involved. So in the end, either Prussia &#x2F; Germany won quick and decisively, or it was outgunned, outnumbered and outresourced on two fronts. Bismarck had nothing to do with that, that is caused by geography.<p>And history showed us the Germany was well able to win on <i>one</i> front: The Eastern one in WW1 and the Western one, initially, in WW2. Throw in a second one, and the war is lost. Or rather not winning quickly on the second one, and the war is lost (as shown by Barbarossa&#x27;s failure to defeat the USSR at Moscow, and even then it is doubtful the USSR would just have rolled over). Funny side effect of that: the German armed forces, and as an extent, but to a lesser degree, German industry suck at logistics and supply chain management to this very day.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37411845" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37411845" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AlbertCory</span><span>|</span><a href="#37414153">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37411299">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37411845">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37411845">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There aren&#x27;t many books on that war, for sure.

Most of the battles in that war were &quot;battles of encounter,&quot; where some units just happened to fight, and then the local commanders escalated it. The Germans always devolved more power to their commanders to act based on local conditions, while the French had a sluggish, top-down organization.

And he was <i>very</i> opposed to risking Germany getting caught in a two-front war.<p>But then Germany&#x27;s Kaiser Wilhelm I got old and died, and was soon succeeded by his grandson, Wilhelm II - who didn&#x27;t like Bismark&#x27;s cautious foreign policy.  Wilhelm II wanted vigorous &amp; rapid expansion, to enlarge Germany&#x27;s (and his) place in the sun.  Bismark, who was getting a bit old &amp; unsteady himself, was replaced in 1890 with a new German Chancellor, more to the young Kaiser&#x27;s liking.<p>Note that both WWI and WWII stuck Germany in large, long, two-front European wars.

My hunch is no mis-alignement with England and a very different looking world today if that happened.<p>I don&#x27;t think so. The biggest mistake Germany made was letting its alliance with Russia lapse in 1891, in favor of trying to snag an alliance with the UK, which wasn&#x27;t interested in one (Britain favored a policy of neutrality on the continent). This leads France to seize the opportunity and ally with Russia in 1894. A series of colonial issues leads the UK to realize around 1900 or so that not having any allies wasn&#x27;t exactly a good thing, especially when you&#x27;ve got lots of people you&#x27;re butting heads against.<p>Wilhelm was an absolute wrecking ball when it came to diplomacy. His tendency to show support for anyone fighting the British in colonial ventures in the late 1890s (especially the Boer War) couldn&#x27;t have helped any chance for a UK-German alliance. It&#x27;s only after tentative attempts to come to an agreement break down in 1901 that the naval arms race actually becomes an issue in UK-Germany relations: indeed, it&#x27;s not really until dreadnoughts make the <i>existing</i> fleets (lopsidedly in favor of the UK) obsolete that German navy buildup actually poses a threat to the UK. The treaties the UK does enter into are less military alliances than they are colonial tension defusing, and Wilhelm&#x27;s tendency to do the opposite would have likely made any formal UK-Germany treaty rather short-lived.<p>The naval arms race mostly takes place after the UK-German treaty attempts ended, and redirecting that money to a larger army would probably have pushed UK even harder into the Franco-Russian camp: during its period of continental isolation, its greatest fear is that of a second Napoleon, who conquers most of Europe and shuts the British out of it. A stronger German army makes that look more plausible, and aligning against Germany helps avert that catastrophe.</div><br/><div id="37416052" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37416052" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pyrale</span><span>|</span><a href="#37410670">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37413625">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37412213">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37416052">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37416052">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I don&#x27;t think so.

However, just about everybody from the Kaiser and central command down to the rank and file believed that a war against other Europeans would (and should) be fought differently from those colonial wars.

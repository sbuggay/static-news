Is it something like &quot;you now <i>also</i> need tools that can do soft-wrapping&quot;? Even if that&#x27;s the case, I think it is easier to wrap a text than to unwrap it (programmatically). So, if you need hard-wrapping, you can just do it.<p>Wrapping is just as simple as; `fold -s -w 80 input.txt`<p>Unwrapping usually turns out to be harder according to my experiences. [1]<p>&gt; You also can&#x27;t grep for things &quot;at the beginning of the line&quot;, which is often an important indicator. When I did a lot of plain C programming, I would put function names at the start of a line, below their return type to make it easy to grep for a function definition, rather than just uses.<p>I see what you mean. But I don’t think your approach conflicts with my recommendation for soft-wrapping. You can still soft-wrap regular text files while choosing to separate certain lines of code for clarity. What you’re doing might not even be considered &quot;hard-wrapping&quot; in the typical sense—it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re breaking a 240-character line into multiple lines. You&#x27;re simply formatting the definition in a way that suits your style, and it&#x27;s perfectly ok!<p>For the last one, you can simply use `git diff --word-diff`. Also, platforms like GitHub already highlight word-based diffs, so it usually is very easy to spot the changes.<p>[1]. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39227848">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39227848</a></div><br/><div id="41820975" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41820975" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bediger4000</span><span>|</span><a href="#41810817">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41818367">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41825857">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41820975">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41820975">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Extraneous material in my example would be potentially the rest of a large paragraph if I change one word. The example would be the diffs of a &quot;Word&quot; doc: the whole paragraph shows as a diff. Folding after the &quot;git diff&quot; would just mean visually picking the diff out of a lot of text.<p>I do a lot of Go programming these days, and there&#x27;s a conventional format for code that ends up with a lot of hard wrapped lines, so my C example is just that, an example.<p>Maybe Markdown would be a better example. When I edit markdown, I move around phrases, clauses and sentences. It&#x27;s certainly possible to do this with a gigantic soft wrapped chunk of text, but it&#x27;s much easier with one clause or even phrase per hard wrapped (at 74 characters or less) line. Grepability and diffability and even running text through sed or awk are easier. You&#x27;re not relying on text coloring. Editing with vim is easier, it has commands to move the cursor to next word, previous paragraph etc etc.<p>This is one of those things like tabs or spaces and byte order marks.

Presumably &quot;just use soft-wrapping&quot; only applies to <i>long lines</i>. It isn&#x27;t banning you from using linebreaks before function definitions. The next section is about linebreaks!

It can&#x27;t be advising you to write entire programs on one line.<p>But anyway, don&#x27;t you have a code editor with a sidebar with function names, that you can click on to go to the definitions? Sounds like choosing to navigate via grep is the nature of the problem with grepability. And other search tools that aren&#x27;t regex based can search for multi-line text. This isn&#x27;t about plain text, it&#x27;s about Vim.

But, there was a time when I was a young man in college (circa 1997) where professors and the industry would push Tabs as a standard.

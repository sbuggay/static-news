Backdoors aren&#x27;t too hard to find and add even if you&#x27;re not super technical. This means that the volume of such attacks is likely to increase and also be harder to defend against.<p>I&#x27;m really hoping that the XZ attack makes folks more wary though given enough time, the feeling of urgency will pass and folks may become more lax again.<p>Major vendors like GitHub can have a good impact here in adding detection and tools to enable detection and prevention of bad actors in this manner, though a lot of OS doesn&#x27;t work around centralised tools like this and requires people to keep being vigilant.<p>I kinda feel that it&#x27;s inevitable for such an attack to take place in the future and have similarly devastating consequences. Things are just too decentralised and independent (which is a good thing) to cover all bases effectively.<p>We can hope that maintainers of very commonly-used packages&#x2F;tools are vigilant but people are people.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40061579" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40061579" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vintagedave</span><span>|</span><a href="#40061840">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40062075">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40061579">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40061579">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The report, which is phrased as a press release, buries the lede. Some good quotes:<p>&gt; I&#x27;m wondering if perhaps the Linux ecosystem is actually a bunch of aging infrastructure. If so, that fact might be obscured by seemingly healthy contributions to the Linux kernel. There&#x27;s a ton of other &quot;basic infrastructure&quot; that gets shipped alongside the kernel, though: coreutils, binutils, gcc, make, autotools, cmake, zlib, xz, etc etc etc. -- Camdon Cady<p>&gt; Our team at Socket catches 100+ software supply chain attacks in npm, PyPI, and Go <i>every week.</i><p>&gt; Software engineer Andrew Nesbitt has been playing around with the concept of a &quot;blast radius&quot; for open source security advisories on Ecosyste.ms. He uses the CVSS score of a security advisory multiplied by the number of repositories that depend upon that package to determine the “blast radius.”</div><br/></div></div><div id="40062075" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40062075" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dist-epoch</span><span>|</span><a href="#40061579">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40060675">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40062075">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40062075">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A vulnerability like this one sells for $1 mil.<p>At this point is cheaper to hire 5 full time programmers for a year to just introduce a vulnerability in an open-source project.

They don&#x27;t even need login access. Instead of sharing secret values directly, you wrap the secret which generates a one-time unwrapping token with a TTL. You share this unwrapping token over a traditional communication method like Slack or e-mail or whatever, and the recipient uses Vault&#x27;s unwrap tool to retrieve the secret. Since the unwrapping token is one time use, you can easily detect if someone intercepted the token and unwrapped the secret (by virtue of the unwrapping token no longer working). This hint tells you the secret was compromised and needs to be rotated (you just need to follow-up with the person to confirm they were able to retrieve the secret). And since you can set a TTL, you can place an expectation on the recipient too -- for example, that you expect them to retrieve the secret within 10 minutes or else the unwrapping token expires.<p>All of this has the added benefit that you&#x27;re not sharing ciphertext over open channels (which could be intercepted and stored for future decryption by adversaries).</div><br/><div id="42896407" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42896407" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nejsjsjsbsb</span><span>|</span><a href="#42895832">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42896016">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42896407">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42896407">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I like this.

If everyone was too scared to work with cryptographic constructs than none of the innovation that took place around smart contracts would be possible.<p>I see no problem with it if your work gets peer reviewed.

So then, what do you expect people to do? OpenSSL is hugely over complicated and hard to use. Having it as a dep almost certainly means breaking your software at some point, too. Libsodium is damn good but you still have to go out of your way to work with it if you&#x27;re not using its baby-tier box design.<p>There are safe &#x2F; standard ways to use certain primitives.

E.g. lets say you want to use RSA (for x509 certs or something like that.) You&#x27;ll get access to RSA but no algorithm to handle padding and no mention of it. So the dev uses RSA as-is and then gets a lecture for padding.<p>Point is: I don&#x27;t see many &quot;cryptography experts&quot; putting effort into improving developer documentation resources for libraries. But plenty of them ranting and acting butthurt that developers aren&#x27;t educated enough to use the primitives. The same crypto experts will also release these libraries and then cry that people use them.

It&#x27;s a <i>what libraries get bundled into the &quot;crypto&quot; module for your programming language</i> problem, and that&#x27;s largely a political decision rather than a technical one.<p>For example: Node&#x27;s crypto module will always be a thin wrapper around OpenSSL, due to backwards compatibility. I cannot change that reality. There will always be a way to shoot yourself in the foot with Node.js&#x27;s crypto module, and that is what most developers will reach for.<p>Even if I introduce new APIs for Node crypto and update the official docs to recommend the newer, safer ways of doing things, I won&#x27;t be able to update the long tail of Stack Overflow answers with 10+ years of incumbency and hundreds of upvotes. This was tried years ago in the PHP community, and you still find bad PHP code everywhere.<p>Updating the developer documentation only serves to blame the poor user when they fuck up, so you can dismiss their pain with &quot;RTFM&quot;.<p>&gt; But plenty of them ranting and acting butthurt that developers aren&#x27;t educated enough to use the primitives. The same crypto experts will also release these libraries and then cry that people use them.<p>I have never contributed a line of code to OpenSSL. You do not hear Eric A Young &quot;ranting and acting butthurt&quot;. What empirical evidence do you have for this assertion?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

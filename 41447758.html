And it&#x27;s all because Brewster Kahle decided that an overly broad interpretation of the Internet Archive&#x27;s mission trumped the rights of authors and publishers, and the laws of the United States.<p>When IA was asked to stop CDL - many times - he continued. The National Writers Union tried to open a dialogue as early as 2010 but was ignored:<p><i>The Internet Archive says it would rather talk with writers individually than talk to the NWU or other writers’ organizations. But requests by NWU members to talk to or meet with the Internet Archive have been ignored or rebuffed.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nwu.org&#x2F;nwu-denounces-cdl&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nwu.org&#x2F;nwu-denounces-cdl&#x2F;</a><p>When the requests to abandon CDL turned into demands, Kahle dug in his heels. When the inevitable lawsuits followed, and IA lost, he insisted that he was still in the right and plowed ahead with appeals.<p>He also opened a new front in the court of public opinion. In his blog posts and interviews with U.S. media, Kahle portrays the court cases and legal judgements as a crusade against the Internet Archive and all librarians (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.archive.org&#x2F;2023&#x2F;12&#x2F;15&#x2F;brewster-kahle-appeal-statement&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.archive.org&#x2F;2023&#x2F;12&#x2F;15&#x2F;brewster-kahle-appeal-st...</a>). It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s the logical outcome of one man&#x27;s seemingly fanatical conviction against the law and the people who work very hard to bring new books into being.<p>In addition, there has been real collateral damage to the many noble aspects of the Internet Archive. Legal fees and judgements have diverted resources away from the Wayback Machine, the library of public domain works, and other IA programs that provide real value to society. I truly hope the organization can survive.</div><br/><div id="41450153" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41450153" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">teruakohatu</span><span>|</span><a href="#41449965">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41451166">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41450153">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41450153">[143 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; In his many interviews with U.S. media, he portrays the court cases and legal judgements as a crusade against the Internet Archive and all librarians.

When first sale was put into (case)law, ebooks didn&#x27;t exist. First sale doesn&#x27;t exist because &quot;oh, well, the book wears out eventually&quot;. It exists because you have an ownership interest in that copy of the book and copyright law has to respect your physical ownership of that property. Once you have sold a copy, your rights as a copyright owner are exhausted.<p>With digital distribution, the law decided that, no, there is no rights exhaustion whatsoever. And this is mainly because the technology was made after the law was horrifically unbalanced (or <i>re</i>-balanced) in favor of large publishers. CDL absolutely has no leg to stand on in the courts, but it is the sort of thing that would make sense as the legal basis for a new rights exhaustion regime that was properly legislated in Congress.<p>&gt; As an aside, when I see authors speaking for themselves on these sorts of issues they will typically point out that editors and typesetters and cover artists and all the other folks who work on a book also deserve to get paid.

The headline artist on a work is most likely to be able to survive off non-royalty income because they have social capital that the creative working class does not. On the other hand, publishing firms don&#x27;t give a shit about the creative working class either! A lot of media companies are run by people who think generative AI is going to let them eliminate entire classes of creative labor and replace it with ChatGPT prompts.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure referencing the opinions of headline artists helps either. In contrast to (but not negating) what you&#x27;ve said, I&#x27;ve heard authors complain endlessly about publishers, too. Things like, oh, we don&#x27;t want to fund the third book in your trilogy, but we also aren&#x27;t going to let you trip the rights reversion clause in your contract, so you just can&#x27;t finish the story.

The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the prior 2023 ruling against IA, the case stemming from the IA&#x27;s National Emergency Library (NEL) initiative during the COVID-19 pandemic, which allowed users to access digitized books without the usual lending caps.
This prompted the lawsuit from several major publishers, who argued that this violated copyright law.
The appeals court rejected the IA&#x27;s argument that its activities fell under the &quot;fair use&quot; doctrine, specifically noting that the IA digital library acted as a substitute for original books, depriving publishers and authors of revenue. 
While the court acknowledged that the Internet Archive&#x27;s activities were non-commercial in nature, it still concluded that the wide availability of digitized books due to unregulated replication harmed the market for the original works.
This decision has significant implications for the IA’s future operations, potentially limiting its ability to continue its broad digitization efforts without publisher consent. 
The ruling reinforces the legal rights of publishers and authors to control the reproduction and distribution of their works, even in digital formats. 
The Internet Archive has few remaining legal options, with the Supreme Court being one of its last possible avenues for appeal. 
Meanwhile, the organization faces additional lawsuits related to its music digitization efforts, those litigations are ongoing.
The ruling today highlights a broader conflict between the rights of creators and the push for wider public access to information, with the court siding firmly with the former. The case sets a strong precedent for how copyright law is applied to digital libraries in the U.S. moving forward.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41451999" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41451999" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">boomboomsubban</span><span>|</span><a href="#41449965">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41451874">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41451941">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41451185">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41451999">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41451999">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No. The lawsuit was over the CDL, the NEL was barely mentioned in the judgment or really the arguments.<p>If it was over the NEL, the case would have been over ~4 years ago when they shut down the NEL.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41451185" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41451185" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">healsdata</span><span>|</span><a href="#41449965">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41450896">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41451062">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41451054">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41451185">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41451185">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Because other libraries have licensing agreements that benefit authors on a different basis than &quot;you sold one book to one library&quot;.<p>You may argue that that shouldn&#x27;t be the paradigm, but one library unilaterally changing it denies the authors their say on the change, either through licensing or legislation.</div><br/><div id="41452128" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41452128" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">codedokode</span><span>|</span><a href="#41449965">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41451185">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41453288">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41452128">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41452128">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">With physical books the library doesn&#x27;t need to pay anything to lend it; with digital books it has to pay for every view.

If you haven&#x27;t read the lawsuit [1] I suggest you look through it.<p>Basically, there is an established practice for lending printed books: the library buys a book and lends it to patrons without permission from the copyright owner.<p>However, publishers believe that digital books are different from physical books and established practice doesn&#x27;t apply to them; they believe that lending should be made at publishers&#x27; terms, to be specific:<p>- only &quot;academic libraries&quot; (chosen by publishers) may lend digital books<p>- they may lend them only to the members, for example, only students of the university, not to random people<p>- library must buy a special &quot;library license&quot;, which might have arbitrary price and arbitrary terms<p>- the license has a limited term: sometimes it is 1-2 years, sometimes it is 26 lendings, after which the library must purchase a new license<p>- the library must use publishers-approved DRM which might not work on some devices<p>To enforce these rules publishers use DRM that prevents anyone from buying a digital book and lending it to other person (which was possible with digital books). So, in publishers view new technology means new rules and new opportunities.<p>The IA found a workaround: they bought physical books, scanned them and lent those digital copies instead of a physical book, provided that only one user can read the same book at the same time. They acted like a library but using remote access to a digital copy. The lender might read the book on IA&#x27;s website enforcing the terms of use or download a DRM-protected PDF.<p>The lawsuit is about whether IA actions are legal or not (i.e. if digital books may be lent like physical books). Given that in future there will be less and less physical books, if publishers win, it will mean that libraries will not be able to lend contemporary books at the same terms and costs they lent physical books.<p>There are several complications: dubious partnerships by IA with libraries to increase the number of lent simultaneously copies; dubious decision to remove limits during COVID pandemic. However, there are facts that play in IA favour: there are precedents when making digital copies was considered legal (by Google Books), and there are a 17 US Code 108 [2] and 109 [3], which allows some exemptions from copyright for libraries and archives.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;23723923-hachette-v-internet-archive-ruling" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;23723923-hachette-v-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;17&#x2F;108" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;17&#x2F;108</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;17&#x2F;109" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;17&#x2F;109</a></div><br/><div id="41452704" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41452704" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pie_flavor</span><span>|</span><a href="#41449965">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41451739">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41451297">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41452704">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41452704">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What you describe as lending a digital copy, is making new copies.

And before you start telling me all the reasons why “beefs” aren’t a central part of the character of judges and therefore law in this country, you should maybe read more about guys like Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.</div><br/><div id="41450684" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41450684" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tptacek</span><span>|</span><a href="#41449965">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41450632">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41451425">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41450684">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41450684">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Judges aren&#x27;t anti-library.

The only real question is how many trillions dollars will the judgment be.  Preserving history is at odds with the profit motive, and lawmakers care a lot more about the latter than the former.</div><br/><div id="41454352" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41454352" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mhuffman</span><span>|</span><a href="#41449806">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41454689">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41454352">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41454352">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;The only real question is how many trillions dollars will the judgment be.<p>Calling it now.

The judges get to basically make up an opinion about the matter, which could be anything.  And they can support basically any opinion using whatever they want, and it can be made to sound ok.<p>The whole point is that the judges are forming a judgement.  It&#x27;s, like, their opinion on the matter.  The judges don&#x27;t have to find out mathematically what the law says.  They&#x27;re making (case) law, by making an opinion, based on how they feel about it all, trying to be well-informed on the matter and its background, but really just putting down their feeling on it.  Here&#x27;s the most essential thing they wrote IMO:<p>From Page 2: &quot;&quot;&quot;Is it “fair use” for a nonprofit organization to scan copyright-protected print books in their entirety, and distribute those digital copies online, in full, for free, subject to a one-to-one owned-to-loaned ratio between its print copies and the digital copies it makes available at any given time, all without authorization from the copyright-holding publishers or authors? Applying the relevant provisions of the Copyright Act as well as binding Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedent, we conclude the answer is no.&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>They justify it in a series of points.  We can disagree with the points all we want, like whether or not it is transformative, or commercial, or all the other things.  But at the end of the day, these judges said, nah, we&#x27;re going to say that we don&#x27;t think this is fair.<p>I mean, I can see their point.  But this would have been a chance for them to see the point in what the IA was doing and to say, &quot;oh, you know what, that is actually fair in our view&quot;.  Only, they didn&#x27;t, it looks like.<p>I guess the next step is to see if the Supreme Court is interested in weighing in on the topic.</div><br/><div id="41449650" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41449650" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">indigovole</span><span>|</span><a href="#41448371">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41448561">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41449114">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41449650">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41449650">[15 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It is ultimately judgment calls by human beings that make the determinations. However, I don&#x27;t see how you can read this opinion and think that the judges are just making their minds up on the spot. Every single decision point in this opinion goes back to prior cases and either explains why they apply or distinguishes this case from them to explain why they don&#x27;t.<p>- It&#x27;s not like Campbell&#x2F;Rose-Acuff (2 Live Crew v Roy Orbison, the &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; case) because IA&#x27;s ebooks are not parodies of the original works. They _are_ the original works.<p>- It&#x27;s not like Sony (the Betamax case in which whole-work copying was found fair because it enabled time-shifting), because there&#x27;s no sufficiently different use that&#x27;s not supported by the original copy. You read the book, you read the IA scanned copy.<p>Courts have judgment, but within parameters. The Copyright Act itself spells out four factors for evaluating whether a use is fair, and both courts found that it failed on every factor. The judge can&#x27;t say, &quot;well, but I still believe that the use should be fair anyway&quot;; that would be an instant reversal and remand, with instructions amounting to &quot;follow what the law says, dummy.&quot;<p>This was never really a close call based on prior cases. Transformative use has almost never been &quot;exactly the same work used exactly the same way, but digital.&quot; Cases that have tried to make that argument have failed again and again. The &quot;our enforcement ensures that only one person is using the copy at a time&quot; has been tried before as well, and has consistently failed. Back in 2020, my heart sank when I saw IA&#x27;s announcement that they were doing this, because I was certain that they would be sued for it, and that they would lose if they were. I can&#x27;t stress enough how obvious these rulings have been if you expect the courts to do what they ordinarily do-- find similarly in similar cases.<p>The Supreme Court can discard all that precedent - they&#x27;ve certainly made a habit of that lately - and create new case law, along with an explanation of the way that they evaluate the factors to find that way. They may in fact do so; they&#x27;ve done that a couple of times in recent decades.

Amazon&#x27;s Kindle Unlimited is an alternate model, but Amazon already has enormous control over publisher fortunes. &quot;Should the current publishers exist&quot; is a really interesting question. I&#x27;m just not sure I want to find out by handing all compensated book publishing to Amazon.<p>So why am I on the fence? Well, I have paid for 2000+ ebooks. I wouldn&#x27;t mind being able to transfer them to my children without limitation, or to friends. If there were a resale mechanism no more disruptive than used paper books, I would probably have sold some of them already. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t appreciate the value or convenience of resale, but that I consider the side effects.<p>The second question is, &quot;Does current law support digital first sale?&quot; First off, I am not a lawyer, and I&#x27;m not giving legal advice. However, the words of the law are pretty damn clear, to be honest, that it does not. You found section 109, which is correct, but you&#x27;re relying on the colloquial meaning of the word &quot;copy.&quot; You need to look up the words &quot;copy&quot; and &quot;phonorecord&quot; in the definitions, section 101, so that you can see that in this law both words refer to _material objects_ in which a work is fixed.<p>A paper book is a material object. You can sell the book. The buyer owns the physical book - the stack of paper and binding - and can read it.<p>A CD or DVD is a material object. You can sell the flashy mirror thing. The buyer owns the flashy mirror thing and can listen to the album or play the movie.<p>An ebook is just not a material object. In most cases, they are not with a single physical object, but licensed as downloads according to fairly restrictive terms. If you have a physical object with a duly licensed ebook on it, you&#x27;re probably allowed to sell that physical object (unless it&#x27;s a Cybertruck, I guess.) However, the license on that download is still going to be what controls. Your Kindle has Kindle software tied to your Amazon account that allows you to read the books you&#x27;ve bought, and I&#x27;m really pretty certain you can&#x27;t sell your Amazon account and all your individual access rights.<p>Various entrepreneurs have tried to convince courts that some variant of &quot;one-copy-at-a-time&quot; digital first sale tech fits under 109, and courts look for the material object and note that it is not there.<p>So, anyway, the law is not written so that ingenious digital technology that ensures that a digital copy is only possessed by one person at time can fall under first sale. It&#x27;s written so that physical objects that contain or embody copyright-protected works can be sold.</div><br/><div id="41454811" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41454811" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Y_Y</span><span>|</span><a href="#41448371">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41452285">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41452856">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41454811">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41454811">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So would it be ok if I stored my ebook on a CD, or printed it?

A work consisting of sounds, images, or both, that are being transmitted, is “fixed” for purposes of this title if a fixation of the work is being made simultaneously with its transmission.<p>And definition of &quot;display&quot;:<p>&gt; To “display” a work means to show a copy of it ...<p>So does it mean that if we have, let&#x27;s say, a hard drive with legally obtained ebook (a copy fixed in a tangible medium), and somehow transmit the book (show it to somebody) over the Internet from it without &quot;fixing&quot; (permanently storing) then it doesn&#x27;t fall under &quot;making a copy&quot; or &quot;display&quot; and is perfectly legal?

Google&#x27;s claimed that these images constituted fair use, and the circuit court agreed. This was because they were &quot;highly transformative.&quot; The court did not define what size a thumbnail should be but the examples the court cited was only 3% of the size of the original images. Most other major sites use a size not longer than 150 pixels on the long side. Specifically, the court ruled that Google transformed the images from a use of entertainment and artistic expression to one of retrieving information, citing the precedent Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corporation. The court reached this conclusion despite the fact that Perfect 10 was attempting to market thumbnail images for cell phones, with the court quipping that the &quot;potential harm to Perfect 10&#x27;s market remains hypothetical.&quot;<p>&gt; The court pointed out that Google made available to the public the new and highly beneficial function of &quot;improving access to [pictorial] information on the Internet.&quot; This had the effect of recognizing that &quot;search engine technology provides an astoundingly valuable public benefit, which should not be jeopardized just because it might be used in a way that could affect somebody&#x27;s sales.<p>If resizing an image to a fraction of the size of the original is sufficiently transformative and useful for a different thing (image search rather than selling thumbnails for cellphone porn) is considered fair use, then direct parallels could be drawn from that ruling to OpenAI&#x27;s use of copyrighted material being sufficiently transformative and irrespective of someone selling summaries of a copyrighted work.<p>---<p>If you believe that OpenAI and other LLMs are infringing and not covered by fair use, it would be helpful if you could write a bit on how they fail at the four tests of fair use described in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fairuse.stanford.edu&#x2F;overview&#x2F;fair-use&#x2F;four-factors&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fairuse.stanford.edu&#x2F;overview&#x2F;fair-use&#x2F;four-factors&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41453114" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41453114" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tourmalinetaco</span><span>|</span><a href="#41453010">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41453130">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41453144">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41453114">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41453114">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Because they are not distributing the work, which is how the law currently works.

nonprofit organization to scan copyright-protected print books in their
entirety, and distribute those digital copies online, in full, for free, subject to
a one-to-one owned-to-loaned ratio between its print copies and the digital
copies it makes available at any given time, all without authorization from
the copyright-holding publishers or authors? Applying the relevant
provisions of the Copyright Act as well as binding Supreme Court and
Second Circuit precedent, we conclude the answer is no.<p>When the conclusion is so obviously incorrect, we should examine the underlying precedent that leads us to such an erroneous conclusion. This precedent should give us pause. They&#x27;re restricting a NONPROFITs to distribute legally purchased print media in a way that the publishers don&#x27;t want.<p>And this seems to be the justification:<p>&gt; In addition to selling traditional print books, Publishers collectively invest
millions of dollars in developing new formats and markets suited for the digital
age, including the eBook market.<p>&gt; Here, by contrast, IA’s Free Digital Library offers few efficiencies beyond
those already offered by Publishers’ own eBooks. IA argues that its use is more
efficient because it “replace[s] the burdens of physical transportation with the
benefits of digital technology,” but this ignores the fact that IA’s digital books
compete directly with Publishers’ eBooks―works derivative of the original print
books.<p>This is an assault on free-use, libraries, and collective sharing of knowledge. If I buy a physical book, I can give it to anyone I want because the laws of yore did not see societal benefit to prohibiting this. I&#x27;m quite certain that these companies would prohibit the practice, if they could.

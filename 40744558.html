As native Russian speaker I find these things absolutely normal and easy to understand, but I can image this must be a nightmare after English.<p>Slavic languages you mention are very curious in how different yet how similar they all are. One of the most impressive thing I saw with respect to learning languages is the Interslavic language [1]. Apparently if you speak any of Slavic languages you can understand it quite well, even though you usually are completely lost with most of the other Slavic languages. You still need to learn to speak it, but the fact that you understand foreigners with zero training just blows my mind.

After a few days it suddenly &quot;clicked&quot; and I realized how the most common sounds and word endings relate between Polish and Ukrainian - and since that moment I basically got all the words with the same roots for free (which is like half the language).

My wife strings together Dutch words with English grammar (we&#x27;re both American) and it&#x27;s a common &quot;mistake&quot; that I experience when visiting a taalcafe.<p>Our brains are all extremely capable of moving a few words so we can understand things in context. When speaking Dutch, I&#x27;m spending a lot of time thinking about a verb, then attempting to string it together into something comprehensible.<p>What I also found to be almost universally true, is that if you are learning a less &quot;popular&quot; language (like Dutch or Ukrainian), just actually give a shit enough to learn more than &quot;yes&#x2F;no&#x2F;please&#x2F;thank you&#x2F;my name is&quot; will garner you a lot of good will from native speakers. Some countries get so many tourists that hearing the same 10 words butchered over and over and over and over and over again eventually starts to wear down on locals, making them jaded.<p>When you can walk into a room and somewhat confidently hold your ground, you become interesting and a novelty that people want to interact with. I went to a block party last weekend and spoke to most of the people there throughout the evening. Sure, everyone knew I was &quot;foreign&quot; and occasionally I had to ask someone to repeat something or re-word it, but that&#x27;s a minor complaint for them considering the other option is to speak back to me in a language they don&#x27;t have as good of control over. Despite popular belief, even in many &quot;English friendly&quot; countries, the normal citizens aren&#x27;t actually that comfortable speaking unless they work in an environment that demands they speak English every day. This goes doubly so for older people. My next door neighbor is about 75 years old and speaks English pretty well (worked at Philips for 20+ years), but the _quality_ of our conversations went up 3x when I could understand enough Dutch for them to speak naturally to me.<p>All that to say, I agree with you!

You get better at listening by listening <i>a lot</i>.<p>Most people just severely underestimate the amount of work it is. You probably need 1,000 hours of listening to be decent, and 2,000 to be strong. If you practice 30 minutes a day, that will take 11 years.<p>So the only “trick” is that you need to find things that you genuinely enjoy doing in French. So  that you can practice for multiple hours each day without burning out.<p>I’m a native English speaker who has a very high level in Spanish. It takes a long time for your brain to figure out how to decode the type of mumbling people use in casual speech.<p>Yes, practice vocabulary, practice grammar, read. But you’re probably already doing this. You just need to listen to a <i>ton</i> of stuff right at the edge of your abilities and you’ll notice improvements every few months.<p>My one final tip would be to not get in your head so much. Literally everyone who has learned a language will tell you that if you review vocab, do grammar exercises, and listen to the language for 1-3 hours every day, you’ll learn it.<p>But it happens so slowly that it doesn’t feel like it will work while you’re on the journey.

Perhaps the only thing I could recognize was the total at the end that I needed to pay.<p>We take for granted regional dialects when speaking our own language and in some languages, dialects can be a huge component of the language. Being able to just go outside and sit on a bench and listen to people speak in the language you want to learn is a huge advantage. Every day, you will passively pick up some words from the context of passers-by. You&#x27;ll also start to subconsciously figure out what words are &quot;common&quot; in a different way that the lists of &quot;1000 most common words in X langauge&quot; can convey. You also learn how to put them together in context and how some words travel together within a certain context.<p>If I was tasked with learning a language abroad, I would spend 2-4 hours a day consuming native content and make it a priority to speak with a coach online 1-2 times a week, trying to work my way up to holding a conversation for an hour straight.<p>After living here for almost 2 years now, I can just barely get to 1 hour when speaking to my boss (super grateful btw!) but I&#x27;m really drained mentally by the end of it. With each meeting it gets easier though and now I can somewhat even make out the local dialect. Learning a language is a numbers game and the reason we often attribute superior language learning skills to kids is simply due to the fact that they have so much free time to listen, absorb, speak, and make mistakes without people judging them because they&#x27;re kids. I&#x27;m fully convinced that adults can learn just as fast or faster, but our own egos often get in the way to putting in the work to learn.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40746865" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40746865" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anal_reactor</span><span>|</span><a href="#40746008">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40746018">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40746091">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40746358">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40746865">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40746865">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Aside from my native language I speak three foreign languages, and I just started learning the fourth one. Besides that, I wasted a lot of time on another language that did not stick, so I kinda know what works and what doesn&#x27;t.<p>1. Consistency. Make sure you practice a little every day. For example, I use an app that tells me every day what vocabulary I should practice that day. It takes ten minutes of my day, and does wonders.<p>2. Communication. Start talking to someone as soon as possible. If you&#x27;re learning a Germanic or Romance language, after 6 months you should be able to find someone online to chat with. Of course it&#x27;s going to take you 15 minutes with a dictionary to understand the other person&#x27;s message and another 15 minutes to write the reply, but it truly does wonders because it allows your brain to see the language as a language.<p>3. Fun exercise: try vocalizing your internal monologue in foreign language. Don&#x27;t focus on correctness at all, it&#x27;s about familiarizing yourself with the language.<p>4. Find some interesting media in your target language. It&#x27;s going to be difficult because most important stuff is available in English, but for example you might try movies or YouTube channels. Especially the latter is great because YouTube videos rarely ever have English translation, so you know that either you watch it in your target language or not at all. There are apps that allow you to listen to foreign radio stations. Why not doomscroll in your target language.<p>5. Don&#x27;t give up until you reach level B2 and you can talk without consciously thinking about it.<p>6. Understanding native speakers talking naturally to each other is literally the hardest part, so don&#x27;t treat it as a benchmark until you reach fluency.<p>7.

I feel that gives a false impression. Parents usually teach their children a lot about language. They give them visual cues, speak at varying rates, change their own tone in some situations, and so on.<p>The babies are soaking up the world on their own using one set of mechanisms. They also often receive highly-supervised training from a trusted source. Later, they get formal training on top of that. Even when not training, much of the content they see and hear is presented in a structured way that helps connect ideas. For instance, listening to the radio or TV with their parents would let them hear a lot of structured speech.<p>Babies are highly trained. They might also do the statistical learning.

A great phonetic example is &quot;choo choo chrain&quot;: we often pronounce words very differently from how we think we&#x27;re pronouncing them. There are also plenty of grammatical facets that are similar—cases where there&#x27;s a stark difference the real rule and the rule as formally taught or where a rule is picked up that the parent doesn&#x27;t even know exists (such as the order of adjectives).<p>As for the formal training, schools don&#x27;t generally teach any natural dialect of spoken English (at least in the US), they teach a formal written dialect of English that differs in many respects from the language that we pick up as infants. This dialect is the source of many of the misunderstandings mentioned above, and yet children will learn natural language as spoken <i>regardless</i> of the attempts of well-meaning teachers to correct them.<p>To me this all suggests that supervised learning for the natural spoken language is unnecessary. Children assimilate their native language from the way it is spoken around them. The main purpose of the formal instruction is to teach children to speak a special dialect in formal settings that will mark them as educated precisely <i>because</i> it is distinct from the one that they&#x27;d have picked up naturally.</div><br/><div id="40746278" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40746278" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">skeledrew</span><span>|</span><a href="#40745213">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40745785">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40745259">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40746278">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40746278">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more a matter of setting standards so that drift is reduced and ESL learners don&#x27;t go bonkers with a dialect that doesn&#x27;t generalize well, than as a mark of education.

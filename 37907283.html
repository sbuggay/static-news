You can even remove passkeys from an account if you really don&#x27;t want to use it.<p>The worst thing about passkey support on Amazon is they didn&#x27;t embrace it completely so you still have to go through all of the login form bullshit instead of being a one step biometric unlock that passkeys can enable.</div><br/><div id="37912155" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37912155" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kalleboo</span><span>|</span><a href="#37910710">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37911155">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37911690">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37912155">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37912155">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>That&#x27;s not as I understand it.

Each cloud service account can only have one passkey for Amazon.&quot; is what I see in Firefox, for example – what on earth does that mean? Firefox doesn&#x27;t synchronize passkeys with either of these accounts. The issue is that they don&#x27;t support platform authenticators on macOS. That error message does not make sense!<p>- Ok, I get it now, so Firefox does not support passkeys, hence the button is greyed out, fair enough. But, wait... 1Password does provide passkey support through their Firefox extension. It works on every other WebAuthN&#x2F;passkey-supporting site. And 1Password&#x27;s passkeys do work on Amazon using Chrome! Do they just sniff the user agent here and grey out the button on Firefox? What&#x27;s going on?<p>- The only option to manage passkeys in my Amazon account is to... <i>delete ALL of them</i>. I guess adding a list of passkeys and the dates they were added, like almost every other service I know supports, was just too much to ask from Amazon.<p>- &quot;If you didn&#x27;t set up this passkey, please go to your account settings to delete the passkey.&quot;. – Oh, right, let me quickly go through the literal <i>dozens of options</i> in my Amazon account page. I get that Amazon does not want to train users to click links from emails (although that ship has arguably sailed, which is why we are getting WebAuthN in the first place: It&#x27;s phishing-resistant!). But Is it too much to ask to simply reference the path there, i.e. &quot;Your Account -&gt; Login &amp; security -&gt; Passkey&quot; in that message?<p>On the other hand, this is completely in line with my user experience on any Amazon site or product.

Meanwhile, Amazon botching its rollout is a symptom of the specification not requiring standardized implementations. It&#x27;s a symptom of the FIDO Alliance just assuming companies will do a good job and won&#x27;t break everything.<p>Ideally, this would be the point where the Alliance would step in and say, &quot;okay clearly we need to standardize a lot more because y&#x27;all can&#x27;t handle this much leeway in how you implement the standard.&quot; Ideally it would give the Alliance pause about other parts of the standard like attestation where they&#x27;re also being painfully naive about how corporate implementations will go. But instead, the industry seems intent on barrelling forward with passkeys in their current state anyway.<p>Passkeys aren&#x27;t ready to recommend to normal consumers yet. We still have yet to see any proof that the portability and lock-out problems are actually going to be addressed. Words are cheap, talk to me when there is an official spec for transferring passkeys between ecosystems and when adherence to that spec and allowing export is a requirement for certification. Talk to me when the services that allow only linking one passkey are barred from official certification until they fix the problem.<p>And people say fixes are coming, but nobody in the industry is waiting for them to come. It&#x27;s not a priority for them. The major companies are showing that they are perfectly willing to recommend a product to consumers in a half-finished state at a point where there is literally no major implementation that allows transferring passkeys between ecosystems and where there serious caveats around linking passkeys to accounts. So what trust am I supposed to have in that? Don&#x27;t tell me the FIDO Alliance cares about portability or ease of access; the companies involved do not consider lack of portability and access to be a blocker.<p>I consider it irresponsible to recommend passkeys in their current state and irresponsible for companies to be rolling out wide support based on the current state of the ecosystem. I&#x27;ve lost a ton of faith in the entire standard because of how advocates have glossed over issues and because of how the industry is currently showing that actual universal access and universal support and real Open implementations are not a requirement and that they&#x27;re willing to try pushing consumers onto passkeys before those critical problems are fixed. The whole thing up to this point has felt dishonest and pushy and weird.<p>If the intent from advocates was to build support by papering over the problems, the effect has been the opposite. I&#x27;m still aware of the problems, but now I also don&#x27;t trust the advocates to be honest when talking about the problems. At some point I need to sit down and write up something more detailed about what the timeline has looked like, because I really feel like the conversation around passkeys and the way companies have moved forward with them is a really good example of how to just completely kill consumer trust in a standard that could have theoretically been good.</div><br/><div id="37911101" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37911101" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lxgr</span><span>|</span><a href="#37911020">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37911480">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37911101">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37911101">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Unfortunately, I largely have to agree.<p>I was really excited about WebAuthN, but even as somebody having read the specification several times and having done a lot of experimentation, it&#x27;s now more or less a mystery to me when I can add which type of passkey to a given website.<p>Sometimes I get 1Password jumping in; as of lately, Chrome sometimes realizes that I have a native passkey stored in iCloud(!); until recently, there was also Chrome&#x27;s local&#x2F;non-synchronized passkeys on macOS; very often, nothing happens and I realize I&#x27;m just on the wrong browser for any of it to work (e.g. Firefox on macOS).<p>I can&#x27;t realistically recommend this to non-technical friends and family at this point.</div><br/><div id="37911153" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37911153" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">danShumway</span><span>|</span><a href="#37911020">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37911101">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37911480">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37911153">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37911153">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was so excited about WebAuthN.

It prevents hackers from leveraging other exploits to extract private keys.<p>The only &quot;transfer&quot; process I want is one where I can use the passkey on one hardware device to authorize in real-time the login on a new device, so that I can then set up a separate passkey on that device.

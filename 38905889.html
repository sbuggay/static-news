Zero deaths, no injuries, ever.<p>Sure, the expenses&#x2F;value argument can be made, too, but that&#x27;s not ultimately what makes it nonzero.  Even if you had limitless resources to apply to the anti-fraud, the only way you&#x27;re getting nonzero fraud is if a large amount of legitimate customers are inconvenienced or outright denied as well.  This is due to how easily fraudsters can still find processes and marks to make it worth their time, and regulations + policies are ever evolving to keep up, but a lot of it comes down to a cost&#x2F;benefit analysis by the business.

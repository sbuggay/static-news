If a slow request hits, that machine gets less traffic than the others and gets some room to recover and burn off its queue.<p>Where we found weird problems was at the extremes: very low concurrency and exceptionally high concurrency.<p>Low concurrency meant that one host consistently had 2 connections and another consistently had 3. That&#x27;s 50% more load on one host. I believe AWS has fixed this and now tie-breakers are resolved randomly, but it was kinda painful to deal with. Our solution was to scale vertically and run fewer hosts. 19 on one host vs 20 on another was less jarring.<p>The other extreme was 1k+ websocket connections per host. When we autoscaled, it would add a new host. That host would have 0 connections and so the next 1k connections would all go to the new host. For that system, we changed it back to round robin.</div><br/><div id="37333441" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37333441" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">saghm</span><span>|</span><a href="#37332914">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37332890">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37333441">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37333441">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Low concurrency meant that one host consistently had 2 connections and another consistently had 3.

Some LB situations take some approximation to load&#x2F;responsiveness, and back off the counts as a function of observed pace of response. TCP RTT will do, size of the pending Queue for async responses too, time in queue, there&#x27;s lots of measures. Your liveness check to the backends probably provides this simply by how responsive to heartbeat it is.<p>Given tasks do not run in identical time, there&#x27;s going to be variance come what may.<p>I would suggest a pool of 3 should tend to be more stable. But, your platform people may be recommending that 3 and below need to be sized to work as 1, only 4 and above can start to assume a minimum cohort (2?) exist.<p>Sharding is not LB. It&#x27;s just a hash approximation to grouping things. Maybe you&#x27;re telling a story about using a random() to emulate how far out of 50&#x2F;50 a 2 part sharding story can get?<p>Routers doing LB may well do simple prefix triage.

To some of you youngsters now you&#x27;d be amazed at the primitiveness of the hardware. It was still in the &quot;first adopter&quot; stage from a commercial point of view.<p>CPU speed was measured in Mhz not Ghz. CPUs had one core. Memory was measured in MB (not GB) and machines with memory of 32MB or less was the norm. A big-screen was 1024x768 (and most folk didn&#x27;t have that) and lots-of-color meant 256 colors.<p>The publically-accessable internet was in its infancy. Connection was through dial ip modem. There was no Google, no social media, no news media.<p>Most of the businesses we sold software to, we had to source the hardware for them as well. Computers in the home were &quot;common&quot; (but not really used for much apart from games.) And by common I&#x27;m thinking 10% or so, not 50%.<p>So yeah, still very nerdy. You still needed a good grasp of the command line, config of new machines was tricky, IRQ numbers were a thing. My best work was in Assembly language.<p>And very optimistic. It was clear the best was still to come, and the flaws were seen, but improving all the time. Every year brought new hardware, new software, and new &quot;I didn&#x27;t know a computer could do that).<p>Plus we were younger, so much younger than today. The world was our oyster.

Five years later? Six? It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era—the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant. . . .<p>History is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of “history” it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time—and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.<p>My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nights—or very early mornings—when I left the Fillmore half-crazy and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder&#x27;s jacket . . . booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond, not quite sure which turn-off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the toll-gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .<p>There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .<p>And that, I think, was the handle—that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn’t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting—on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. . . .<p>So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark—that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.”</div><br/></div></div><div id="42428606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42428606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">schoen</span><span>|</span><a href="#42427844">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42427901">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42428938">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42428207">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42428606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42428606">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My friend Nick, with whom I worked on Linux stuff in this era, actually quoted that speech in reference to the free software scene sometime around the year 2000!

It was delayed over and over again. By the time it existed, it was no longer a pure X11 based Linux distribution and more of an (too) early take on Wayland.

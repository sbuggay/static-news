John Milton was a talented diplomat who spoke multiple languages and was very well respected by his peers who admired him for his intelligence and good character. He supported a popular uprising against the incompetent king of England out of a sense idealism. The revolution was initially a success but the democratic government that should have replaced the king turned into an even more unpopular dictatorship. The monarchy was restored, most revolutionaries where executed and Milton was banished to the country side where he lived out his final years in poverty going blind due to cataracts growing in his eyes. He dictated the story of Paradise Lost to a scribe to explain how hard it is to change the word for the better, &quot;To serve in heaven or to rule in hell&quot; as he would put it. This was his final act of rebellion, to cast satan as a personable anti hero.</div><br/><div id="38906234" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38906234" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Jun8</span><span>|</span><a href="#38905458">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38907952">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38906234">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38906234">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; He dictated the story of Paradise Lost to a scribe<p>He had many aides, including his daughters, Anne, Mary, and Deborah.

This is a popular topic and have been painted a number of times.<p>In reality his relationship with his daughters was very strained, it is reported that he forced them to read to him works in languages they didn’t understand and their education was not a priority for him.

When they heard the news from a servant, Mary replied, according to A. N. Wilson&#x27;s 1983 biography, &quot;that was no news to hear of his wedding but if she could hear of his death that was something.”<p>The household was volatile at best, unbearable when the girls were in full fury against their father and his new wife. Milton&#x27;s daughters complained that their stepmother was a termagant. One early biographer noted that Milton suffered &quot;the Affront and Scorn of a Wife he Lov&#x27;d.&quot;<p>Anne and Mary never forgave their father for whatever sins they believed he committed against them. But Deborah, the youngest, and the daughter who most resembled Milton, seems to have made peace with his memory. After his death, she even came to serve as a source for early scholars seeking information about the famous man of letters.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38907952" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38907952" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">joshuahedlund</span><span>|</span><a href="#38905458">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38906234">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38906165">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38907952">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38907952">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; It only becomes better when you know the backstory of the author and the context in which it was written<p>Fully agree, but I do think it’s reductionist to think that he<p>&gt; cast satan as a personable anti hero<p>C S Lewis has a pretty scathing rebuttal of this particular theory in his “A Preface to Paradise Lost”.

It was OK, but what I discovered was that what really works is an <i>alliterative verse</i> translation!

Man&#x27;s first folly,    the fateful fruit&#x27;s taste,
     From forbidden tree&#x27;s    tempting twig it came,
     Death and doom dealt,    despair in our world,
     Eden erased,    exalted man to mend,
     Restoring realms    of radiant bliss, sing,
     Sacred muse,    who soared on secret summits,
     Oreb, Sinai,    sharing whispered wisdom,
     With shepherds,    teaching truths to chosen kin,
     Heavens and earth    hewn from harrowing haze,
     Sion&#x27;s slopes,    Siloa&#x27;s silver stream,
     Flowing fast    by God&#x27;s grand guiding hand,
     Grant thy aid    to my aspiring anthem,
     Aiming high    above Aonian heights,
     Pursuing paths    untried in prose or rhyme.
     
     2. Man&#x27;s fatal first taste, the forbidden fruit
     Whose bitter bloom brought bale and sorrow bleak
     With paradise perished, till One more mighty restores   what was lost
     Reclaims the radiant seats—O sacred Muse,
     Who on Sinai&#x27;s summit secret
     And Horeb&#x27;s height inspired
     Chosen seers to teach the tribes since time first woke,
     How heavens and earth arose from Chaos hoar,
     Or if thou rather tread Sion&#x27;s summit steep,
     And Siloa&#x27;s silvern stream that rushed thereby
     Where dwelt the oracle and rock of God,
     That poured forth fates—now lend thy light, that I
     May soar on song&#x27;s ambitious wings
     Above Parnassus&#x27; peaks, pursuing lofty themes...
     Great matters meet for grandest strains of lore.
     Thee chiefly, thee, heart&#x27;s truth, soul&#x27;s purest shine,
     O Spirit blest, who scorneth shrine and show
     Inspire my strain; for thou, who knowest all,
     Hast known since earth&#x27;s first sunrise. Mighty wings
     Did brood with wings outspread upon the formless void
     Kindling Chaos into teeming, shaping flame;
     To attain the epic theme, this lofty matter,
     In hymns that hallow Heaven&#x27;s eternal ways.</code></pre></div><br/><div id="38905963" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38905963" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DrStormyDaniels</span><span>|</span><a href="#38904818">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38905356">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38906185">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38905963">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38905963">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It takes less time than you might think to get aquatinted with older English spellings, especially if you start at the deep end with Chaucer; it’s plain sailing after.

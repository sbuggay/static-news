It was an oral exam, and I prepared a syllabus and gave it to my three examiners ahead of time. At the actual exam, we all showed up and they took turns asking me their questions that they had prepared relating to my syllabus.<p>I was expected to solve the problems at the board. They didn&#x27;t necessarily expect me to solve them immediately, but they wanted to hear me think out loud and communicate my ideas. There were around 5-10 questions total over the course of I think a few hours, ranging in complexity from trivia (i.e. memorized facts) to computations to proofs. Some of them I found solutions for and some of them I didn&#x27;t, and they assigned me some to solve later as &quot;homework&quot; (though they did pass me without it being conditioned on the homework).<p>In hindsight, it was very similar to white-board coding interviews, but I didn&#x27;t know anything about coding interviews at the time. I can&#x27;t really think of any other place such a format would be appropriate as a math exam. When else would a paper math exam not be sufficient.</div><br/><div id="39083484" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39083484" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sdenton4</span><span>|</span><a href="#39083318">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39086624">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39083484">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39083484">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, my math grad student time ws an excellent preparation for coding interviews. In addition to the oral exams, I found TA&#x27;ing was also an excellent preparation. Students show up with lots of questions, which you get to solve on your toes at a board...<p>Classes and competitions also generally have an allowed &#x27;bag of tricks&#x27; from which you build your solutions. White-board coding interviews are the same. If you want to do well, you get to know what the &#x27;atomic&#x27; operations are in your bag of tricks, how they combine into useful tools, and how to spot when they might be useful in the &#x27;wild.&#x27;<p>Restating&#x2F;reworking a problem into a form where some tricks are more obviously applicable is also a useful skill. These are general problem solving skills, which are pretty independent of what&#x27;s actually in the bag of tricks... Draw a picture, try a concrete example, identify the pen-ultimate step, etc.<p>When I give whiteboard interviews, I have a favorite question with about four reasonable stopping points. My general approach is to work with the candidate until they get stuck, and then see how handle being stuck and getting un-stuck. So, even if you have trouble with the &#x27;easiest&#x27; part of the problem, I can still get a good read on the general problem solving skills. (And if you sail through to the hardest level solution without getting stuck, you&#x27;re probably worth hiring anyway...)</div><br/><div id="39086167" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39086167" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">selecsosi</span><span>|</span><a href="#39083318">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39083484">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39086624">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39086167">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39086167">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your experience matches my own with TA&#x27;ing being a fertile training ground for solving problems from a variety of perspectives on your toes.

Scholars who might&#x27;ve considered studying literature and philisophy might have a hard time competing on the global stage, as the Soviet state didn&#x27;t take kindly to the idea of promoting anything that could be perceived as anti-Soviet ideals, even if it&#x27;s for the sake of an academic exercise. Not that the Soviet Union was alone in this practice, but this practice in particular affected their academic community to the extent that many who might&#x27;ve considered literature or philosophy changed their minds.<p>2. Trade restrictions between the 50s and 60s with large portions of the West created a large demand for semiconductor products on behalf of the state, as the USSR understood the strategic importance of this technology early on. While trade restrictions were gradually relaxed in the decades leading up to Perestroika, the domestic industry for computer products had been established, similar to China&#x27;s own semiconductor industry and Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s economic reforms which opened the country to global trade.<p>This is mostly just the verbal account of one person followed by my own personal research, so this is by no means an authoritative take.

My use of the phrase &quot;passion&quot; was referring to what appeared to be the observed success of these countries in the fields of mathematics, statistics, and computer science I thought were disproportionate to other measures of human developent. For example, the OECD data indicates that Hungary invests a lesser proportion of its budget into education compared to other countries mentioned in the article, or even other OECD countries[1]. However, Hungary is clearly established itself as a creator of serious mathematical talent based on the IMO stats shared by the author of the post (even thought the math skills used to win gold at the IMO are very different from what&#x27;s needed to advance the field as a whole[2]).<p>At a very superficial level, the question is akin to, &quot;Why does Argentina have such a successful national soccer team, when there are other countries with a strong cultural link to soccer and much more capable of pouring money into building a good team?&quot;.

I went to one of the ones mentioned, and had a mix of good and bad teachers (including an awful math teacher one year, and an awful informatics teacher in another year - two of the supposedly most important subjects for that HS).<p>However, having an entire class that actually is at the bar for which the curriculum is designed, and having an entire class of students who generally want to learn, does allow teachers to actually spend most of their time teaching the curriculum as intended. We had no problem being up to date with the Bacalaureat matter, for example. No one in the entire HS flunked their exam either.<p>The general state of high schools in the country is terrible though. Teachers don&#x27;t care to know the curriculum, they don&#x27;t have time to go through it if they want anyone in the class to actually be listening, many poor kids don&#x27;t have time or energy for school among their many other chores (especially in the more rural areas of the country, children are a big part of house and field work) etc. Many children who nominally finish high school probably haven&#x27;t even heard of a quarter of the questions they&#x27;d get on the Bacalaureat.<p>It&#x27;s also important to note that there is a massive cheating culture in Romanian schools, all the way up and down. There was some push ~10 years ago to stop cheating at the national exams, installing cameras and such, and the Bacalaureat results dropped from ~80% pass rates to ~40% nation wide in that year; there was one case of an HS where the previous year 90+% of the students had gotten a 10&#x2F;10 on their exam, and after the anti-cheating measures the following year, not one child got the 5&#x2F;10 required to pass.<p>The Capacitate&#x2F;National Tests exams that you take at 14 were even worse, with all sorts of advanced questions that were either cheated through or at the very best rotely memorized. In my time, we were required to do literary analysis on one of these exams, writing a 2 page essay on things like &quot;the characterization of &lt;female heroine in major novel&gt;&quot;. After some reform, today you get questions like &quot;here is a newspaper article about a meteor. How large is the meteor? What is it made of?&quot; and still many many children don&#x27;t pass - because those are the actual results when you take cheating out.<p>Not to mention, Romania consistently ranks last in the EU at PISA tests. And around 50%+ of the country is functionally illiterate (that is, they technically know the letters and words, but can&#x27;t actually read an article and tell you what it means).</div><br/></div></div><div id="39084229" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39084229" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bsdpufferfish</span><span>|</span><a href="#39083383">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39087159">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39084186">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39084229">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39084229">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Being selective means they can start further, go faster, and expect motivation.<p>Even if the value is coming entirely from your fellow students, that has no effect on deciding which school you want to go to.

It is extremely hard to shift as things grow, and without careful thought, it’ll turn into a horrifying miasma of JSONB columns, duplicated data, orphaned rows, and garbage performance.<p>Customers are going to store surprisingly large items in Docs, where you’d be tempted to inline them instead of offloading to S3 et al.<p>Chat practically needs to be its own DB. Discord runs on Scylla, Slack runs on Vitess over MySQL. The needs of chat access are wildly different from other types of storage.<p>If you’re doing any kind of active-active, have a plan for how to move off of that, because it does not scale (at least, not without breath-takingly expensive hardware).<p>Source: DBRE at one of your competitors.<p>EDIT: The fact that you’re doing offline saves (which is very cool!) makes me think that you may be using something like Ditto [0], which IIRC is MyRocksDB under the hood.

IMO, the single biggest thing is focus and clarity in their communication. If people without a working mental model of software development can’t instantly understand the tangible problem it solves in their existing business process, they won’t even scroll past the break, let alone pay for it. Consolidation and modularity are solutions, but people don’t go shopping for solutions without a problem. Have you ever gone out looking for a better commercial version of work-related software you didn’t have any problem with? “App chaos” is way too abstract of a problem for most people to grasp. Do people have trouble sharing google docs over slack? Do companies have trouble with sharepoint and teams not being integrated enough? Does your tool do it better? Does your tool do it approximately as well, but cheaper? More reliably? If so, do people find the existing solutions too pricy or unreliable, or does that not impact them enough to care?<p>Unless they define, upfront, specific problems people really have, that their unified solution solves, then nobody is going to pay attention.<p>The second biggest problem is having an interface design team that makes all of those disparate apps consistent enough to be more usable than individual solutions. The fact that nearly no popular user-facing applications are developer-managed FOSS (as opposed to Firefox&#x2F;blender&#x2F;signal&#x2F;et al which are managed by a company that hires professional designers) despite being free, tells you everything you need to know about dev-driven UI&#x2F;UX. This is coming from someone that worked as a full time developer for years and contributed many thousands of hours of coding to FOSS projects before switching to design.</div><br/><div id="38906853" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38906853" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sgarland</span><span>|</span><a href="#38904107">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38906681">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38906883">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38906853">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38906853">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Fair point.

It has just enough modernity to appeal to people who might expect that, but it quickly gets out of the way and tells you what it is, why it matters, and how much it costs.<p>At the other end of the spectrum, there’s tarsnap.com, which is probably a turnoff for anyone who doesn’t like text.

There’s a reason most designers you work with have relevant degrees, and the ones that don’t that are in high level positions in good organizations might as well have them— it’s just a lot more complex than most developers assume. When they realize that, great! When they’re swinging around giant Dunning-Krueger derived overconfident declarations about something you’re designing… not so great.<p>As a full-time developer for a decade, and in other technical roles for a decade before that, I had a few similar experiences with designers. One repeatedly <i>insisted</i> that Wordpress along with their ramshackle loopdy-looped spaghetti php plugin (still including comments from the tutorials they copied tidbits of code from) was robust enough to enough to replace our very tight Django-based code base that did a hell of a lot more than serve up our website… but they insisted it would take half as long to reimplement it all in php. There wasn’t even a good reason for it– they learned everything they knew about development by osmosis from working on web projects, and a mishmash of articles they read on the topic over the years, and after getting one piece of code to work in a low volume application, thought they were a dual-field specialist. That’s actually pretty rare among designers, but developers that feel that way about design are the norm.

This is the massive appeal of Mongo et al., or just JSON[B] columns in an RDBMS.<p>Unfortunately, at a very deep level, that’s simply not how RDBMS works. The tuples are a B+tree, and in some (MySQL [InnoDB], SQL Server) cases everything is clustered around the PK. If you don’t create a data model that’s easily exploitable for optimizations designed around that data structure, you’re gonna have a bad time. It’s no different than if you decided to use strings to store ints – you _can_, but it’s a bad idea for a variety of reasons.<p>What you can do is give yourself as much leeway as possible, by following some basic best practices. For example, it’s a hell of a lot easier to update a tiny reference table than to update billions of rows when you decide that column `region` should say `European Union` instead of `EU`.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38908554" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38908554" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dataflow</span><span>|</span><a href="#38904107">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38906942">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38905973">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38908554">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38908554">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you know people at Ditto, let them know their website looks completely obnoxious if fonts are not loaded.

I think you have a good opportunity here to do what nothing else does quite well, and that is to implement a vertically integrated document management system for use cases such as ISO 9001 etc.<p>Use case 1, document management:
This basically just means that you need to implement the capability to “publish” a document version, permanently view that document version (think tag), and auto generate a document “identifier” using the companies naming convention (and allow this to be embedded automatically in the document so the client can use it too). The document ID might look something like SOP-2401001.<p>Once a document is published it should be read-only, and you should be able to put artifacts a long with published documents … ie exported PDF copies, or signed copies or something.<p>Use case 2, document siloing:
One of the most difficult parts of document management is creating forms for procedures, and then teaching everyone how to not ruin the document management of these forms once they are filled. I have always wanted a silo that automatically copies a form when you start to fill it out, allocates it a brand new document ID, and collects it together with all the other forms of the same kind.<p>This could be integrated with an automation platform so that ie if you fill out a form it sends someone an email or something like that. Or if you wanted to get really fancy, you could allow people to define “workflows” for documents and actually visually show a business process alongside a document.</div><br/><div id="38905812" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38905812" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">squeezebees</span><span>|</span><a href="#38905299">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38904609">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38905812">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38905812">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is indeed a clear market gap.

In contrast it makes people undervalue the importance of a structured plan of execution for projects with a significant number of collaborators. There are practically no polished, in-between, git-like experience in mainstream tools. The outcome of real-time for users is always remembered as messy and frustrating. I don’t even agree with the premise of shared control as being an effective basis for creative or productive process at large, it is useful for brainstorming and exploration in some specific cases, or highly specialized and niche settings like pair programming. IMHO this is super valued by developers and marketers because it’s challenging, cool and it makes for a good pitch. Not rare to see people who conflate digital collaboration with shared control, thinking they’re synonymous – such is the influence of these modern workflows.

This led people to constantly refresh jira both before and after adding a comment. I still remember two people adding the same comment, refreshing together and both deleting their own comments after refreshing and seeing the duplicate. (Found this out after the incident during one of those &quot;what could have gone better?&quot; conversations). We switched very quickly to using Google Docs for documenting the live incident and simply attached that doc to the jira ticket at the end. It sucked badly and made a lot of people hate jira.<p>As soon as Slack became a thing at our company we immediately switched to using it for realtime incident updates, because Google Docs was unsuitable for a bunch of other reasons. And we wrote some automation around creating a jira ticket, creating a slack channel using the ticket name, and updating the jira ticket with a link to the ongoing incident).

Or at the very least, the results always reek of design-by-committee - inconsistencies and compromises. This is independent of tech, and I would say the same about the 2000s white boarding and mindmapping. Sometimes, there are cases where it works, like an 1:1 session with someone you can really vibe with. But even in those cases, it’s usually better with single-control (ie only one person editing at a time).<p>I’m perfectly fine talking about work on a high level, but when it gets too gritty it’s usually better to sit down in quiet and solve the problem or improve the design on your own. (Needless to say, I did not exactly thrive in a corporate environment.)<p>So to me realtime collab can be very neat, but it’s not a common enough use-case to be a dealbreaker. That said, there’s tremendous value in being able to easily <i>view, comment, duplicate, copy</i> the latest version that others publish, in read-only mode.

It looks super interesting. Some questions from the top of my head: 
- Where is the data stored geographically? (US, EU, or a specific country) 
- Do you plan on having multiple options for the web version (cloud vs self-hosted)<p>I find that data sovereignty is very important to me (it might not be for everyone), which is why I ask about those points specifically ;)</div><br/><div id="38901972" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38901972" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">harrisonlo</span><span>|</span><a href="#38901826">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38909561">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38901972">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38901972">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks! Data sovereignty is also top of my mind, but I think we should approach it not with the physical location of the servers&#x2F;databases, but with the ability to encrypt, thus own, your data.<p>Currently it uses GCP with data centers in the US, but when E2EE is rolled out, I don&#x27;t think it would matter where it&#x27;s located? There might be legal complications so I&#x27;m also thinking of moving the physical databases to jurisdictions like Switzerland, if it comes to that.<p>Given the complexity of the backend, I think a self-hosted version might not be possible in the short term. However, single tenant versions (like GitLab dedicated) is definitely doable.</div><br/><div id="38902013" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38902013" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Vermyndax</span><span>|</span><a href="#38901826">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38901972">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38909561">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38902013">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38902013">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Unfortunately, it <i>always</i> matters.

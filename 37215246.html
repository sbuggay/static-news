Finally a HN topic I can contribute to.<p>I&#x27;ve spent last few years trying to build out my solar shed mainly to have auxilary power to charge weed whacker, leaf blower, power lights, power a camera, etc. Just basic 12v power.<p>The number one lesson is to 4x your power needs. 4x your watts and 4x your battery amp hours. Don&#x27;t cheap out on charge controllers.<p>There&#x27;s never enough sun light to fully charge your batteries and your panels are never at the right angle to maximize sunlight. Especially in less solar friendly areas like Michigan.<p>Lead acid is fine if you over compensate with panels. Lead acid will last longer in the cold than LiFEP04. Die hards will say you cant charge LiFEP04 in winter but I do. I accept the fact that my batteries will degrade faster. When you can build your own packs, its a lot easier to find which single set of cells went out and cheaper to replace. Its a risk I accept.<p>If you are starting out, get a 200 Ah&#x2F;hr LiFEP04 battery and 400 watts solar. Its a very good starting point for 12v and gives room for expandability.<p>Avoid foldables. Avoid Harbor Freight. Avoid Jackery Solar Panels. You need Quality Panels.<p>If you wanna learn more, check out Will Prowse <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@WillProwse">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@WillProwse</a></div><br/><div id="37219966" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37219966" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rambambram</span><span>|</span><a href="#37217025">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37219731">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37219966">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37219966">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Avoid Jackery Solar Panels.<p>Can you explain?

It worked &quot;well&quot; until there were cloudy days that the charge controller couldn&#x27;t simply provide enough output to charge the battery. We used a normal car battery for that.<p>After a few days the battery was dead because it wasn&#x27;t being charged, so we decided to scrape it and run our hydroponics connected to the grid instead.<p>If you&#x27;re feeling adventurous, there is a MPPT chip that you can use for your electronics projects (though the only time I tried it I managed to burn the chip and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in local stores, buying from AliExpress would take months to arrive) is the LT3652, though it&#x27;s rated for 2A only. I believe you can find bulkier chips for higher PV wattage.<p>EDIT: 
&gt; The number one lesson is to 4x your power needs. 4x your watts and 4x your battery amp hours. Don&#x27;t cheap out on charge controllers.<p>I have installed a PV system on my home back in 2019 and the rule of thumb we found out as well is, if you&#x27;re building a PV system for a house and use inverters, you should also not go cheap on inverters (i.e. go for cheap chinese brands).<p>We have a Fronius inverter and it works wonders, much better than the other cheap brands and it has a lot of interfaces you can use it to retrieve data from.<p>Another useful thing, if you buy an inverter rated for, say, 2kWp, you can safely overdesign your system to provide at least 20% (I don&#x27;t remember the exact percentage) more power than the peak wattage your inverter supports. Reason for this is that because you can&#x27;t predict clouds and bad weather, having a few extra panels will compensate the performance loss and will make sure you&#x27;re always running at peak performance. It will also help a lot during off-peak hours. Of course, the extra panels won&#x27;t magically bring you to peak performance if you have a very cloudy, dark day. But if you have some clouds, you can get a very big performance hit and you can compensate that by having more panels than your inverter is designed for.<p>So, for example, if the inverter is designed for 2kW, you can build your system to produce 2.4kW.<p>Another suggestion is to split your arrays in as many strings as your inverter suggests. They will operate like if they were independent systems, so if you have cloud covering one string, bringing its output power down, it won&#x27;t affect the other string (assuming the cloud is only covering one of the strings). If they were under the same string, any shade on any of the solar panels would severely affect the output of that string.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37218078" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37218078" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">VygmraMGVl</span><span>|</span><a href="#37217025">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37220067">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37217639">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37218078">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37218078">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Heads up, the danger with charging LFP at low temperature is that you will begin lithium plating.

IMO, buy a professional AC-&gt;DC converter, probably at 19V or some other suitable voltage and then get a DC-DC buck converter to go from 19V to 14.35V, and then a diode (0.7V dropoff) to hook up to your batteries in parallel.

Sure, you&#x27;ve got to discharge when the sun goes down but I don&#x27;t expect a properly-sized battery to be deeply discharged (especially when we&#x27;re aiming for multiple days worth of &quot;worst-case&quot; power, like multiple days of clouds&#x2F;rain to reduce our power-collection).<p>Lets just be dumb with napkin math for a second: 12-hours of charge, 12-hours of discharge on a &quot;typical&quot; day, with a 3-day &#x2F; 72-hour period of worst-case charge. Where does this leave us?<p>12-hours of typical discharge &#x2F; 72-hours of worst-case discharge == DoD of 100% to 83% on your typical day-to-day basis.<p>Hardly anything that considers a &quot;deep discharge&quot;. And if we really need deep-discharges, most Lead-Acids can survive something on the order of 300x to 500x deep discharges right? So its not like the 5 to 10 times a year where you need all 72-hours of battery are significantly hampering your lifespan?<p>&gt; And even then is longevity of lifepo4 so much better itâs not funny.<p>Measured in deep cycle-counts (ie: cell phones or laptop usage), sure. (like 3000 cycles on LiFePo4 vs 500 on Lead Acid). But years of sitting on a float-charge, I don&#x27;t think its that much better than Lead-Acid.<p>----------<p>That being said, LiFePo4 is a &quot;superior&quot; battery for sure, and its much cheaper than I remember. But Lead Acid remains significantly lower-priced than LiFePo4 as far as I can tell (2-to-1 or less)<p>I think you have a point about Lead-Acid charging slower when its near full (and keeping it full is key to keeping Lead-Acid long-lasting). So I admit to not recognizing that (LiFePo4 also charges slower when near full, its just that it charges like 3x to 4x faster than Lead Acid so its less of a concern)<p>&gt; Please spend the extra money on lifepo4, save yourself some headaches.<p>We&#x27;re at the hobbyist level where the original post decided that MPPT solar charge controllers weren&#x27;t needed (at least, in an earlier version of this project)<p>Clearly no one here is talking about the strictly most optimal design, but are instead talking about simpler and cheaper solutions.<p>--------<p>Simplicity here is key. LiFePo4 does _NOT_ like topping charges or staying at 100% charge for long periods of time. Lead Acid however, prefers 100% charge and UPS use Lead Acids for this reason.<p>LiFePo4, in UPS&#x2F;Standby like systems, need to stop charging, and wait for the battery to be used before engaging in a new charge cycle.<p>Lead-Acid on the other hand, can just have a constant voltage applied (ex: 13.5V or so) and you can just hold that indefinitely, for incredibly simple standby circuits.</div><br/><div id="37218439" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37218439" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">daotoad</span><span>|</span><a href="#37215781">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37217524">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37218864">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37218439">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37218439">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I may be full of crap, it&#x27;s been over 15 years since I worked on this stuff.

One of the things I did was help spec out solar systems for remote installations in Alaska and Canada.<p>The basic issue was &quot;How much sun will there be in a typical summer?&quot; combined with &quot;How much power can we store in our batteries?&quot; and &quot;How much power can we draw from the lead acid batteries without them freezing?&quot; (who knew that a discharged battery freezes at a lower temperature than a charged one?  I sure didn&#x27;t).<p>It&#x27;s a pretty straightforward process, actually.  The company I worked for had a pretty detailed spreadsheet to help with bids, but essentially you:
1. look up the insolation data for the install site in one of the databases with that info (like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nsrdb.nrel.gov&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nsrdb.nrel.gov&#x2F;</a>)
2. compute rate of loss over time for your installation (power consumption +_self-discharge)
3. look at the battery datasheets to determine how much you can discharge the battery at any given time based on anticipated temperature ranges
4. work out what your tolerances are for temperature and insolation variability<p>Usually there would be a couple of options that were in the cost sweet spot where you had a bit more solar and bit less battery or vice versa.  Some of these sites were up around the arctic circle, so battery was pretty important in those cases, since you&#x27;re looking at months without appreciable sun combined with low temperatures.<p>This wasn&#x27;t even the major part of my job, but it was a small company and I wore a lot of hats.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37216571" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37216571" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">roughly</span><span>|</span><a href="#37218361">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37215558">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37216571">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37216571">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I did a similar project a while back with a Pi Zero W, which has the perk of maxing at like 1w.

Pi is all the rage these days, but if I were to make a solar-server, it&#x27;d be off of Beaglebone Black instead.<p>* Beaglebone Black uses slightly less power and is slower than Rasp. Pi. Lower power is a big benefit however.<p>* Beaglebone has the &quot;Programmable Realtime Unit&quot; (a microcontroller-like hard-realtime subsystem with GPIO pins).<p>* These PRU subsystems can probably (???) be utilized for the battery-state-of-charge and possibly even provide a software-control for mppt solar chargers. Theoretically of course, but... I have to imagine that a Cortex M4 has enough MHz to handle these kinds of calculations.<p>* If not, the Beaglebone Black has a built in ADC that could be used as the basis of power calculations.

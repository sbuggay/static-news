IIRC Harper cites hamsters or gerbils as the prior host species to humans.<p>James Burke, of <i>Connections</i> fame, stated in a later interview &quot;ReConnections* of how he&#x27;d extend the episodes of the original series that a key consequence of jet air travel would be an increased spread of global pandemics.  This occurs toward the end of this video:<p>&lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;JamesBurkeReConnections_0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;JamesBurkeReConnections_0</a>&gt;<p>More broadly, it seems to me that <i>any</i> network will co-evolve parasite or pathogenic entities, whether we&#x27;re talking human cities (look at the long list of urban vices, online abuse, network issues, and the like).  One factor contributing to the &quot;golden age&quot; effect is that such ages exist <i>before</i> the parasites &#x2F; pathogens evolve.  As such, the sense that &quot;something went wrong&quot; seems to me misled, and a better formulation would be that such golden ages were living on borrowed time in the first place.<p>Podcast episode of Harper addressing a similar theme from <i>Plagues Upon the Earth</i>:  &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;traffic.megaphone.fm&#x2F;NBN2511895438.mp3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;traffic.megaphone.fm&#x2F;NBN2511895438.mp3</a>&gt;.</div><br/><div id="40374634" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40374634" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Terr_</span><span>|</span><a href="#40372531">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40374430">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40374634">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40374634">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; More broadly, it seems to me that any network will co-evolve parasite or pathogenic entities<p>For a non-biology example: Scams are shaped by the economies they exist in, and vice-versa.</div><br/><div id="40375161" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40375161" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dredmorbius</span><span>|</span><a href="#40372531">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40374634">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40374430">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40375161">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40375161">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, and rely highly on anonymity whether through large populations (cities) or distance (telecommunications and&#x2F;or transportation).<p>The term &quot;confidence man&quot; came into general usage following publication of a novel by that title by Herman Melville (of <i>Moby Dick</i> fame).  It is set on the first great interstate highway of the United States:  the steamboat-plied Mississippi River.  Harking back to Roman (and Greek) times, I find it quite telling that Mercury (or Hermes) is the god of messages, travel, roads, merchants, thieves, and cunning, amongst others.  There&#x27;s something inherent in <i>travel</i> that gives rise to <i>trickery</i>.<p>(It&#x27;s difficult to be fooled by those one lives closely with in small communities for long periods of time.  Those may be <i>scoundrels</i> or be known to be <i>untrustworthy</i> but rarely gain <i>confidence</i> in Melville&#x27;s sense.)<p>Another curious relationship I suspect about telecommunications is that they effectively <i>reduce reliance on social factors of trust</i>.  Mind that this may increase <i>overall</i> societal trustworthiness in many cases, but it&#x27;s through the replacement of, well, just plain raw trust (unevidenced belief) through monitoring, assessments, and independent validation.  In an age before telegraph and jet airlines (or even steamships and railroads), once someone was out of eyesight and earshot, they were lost to direct control or monitoring until either they returned or an emissary could reach them, whether for hours, days, weeks, months, or years.  Merchants, diplomats, ships&#x27; captains, colonial governors, and the like all operated autonomously for periods of time which would strike us as utterly alien today.  Many of the practices, and much of the language used in communications, seems to me to have arisen to express, reinforce, or establish trust in such circumstances.  Post-telegraphic language became, well, <i>telegraphic</i> (short, abbreviated, costing or paid by the word) not only due to the expense of the medium, but, carrying over to even non-telegraphic correspondence, because long sustained absences or periods of <i>incommunicado</i> no longer occurred.<p>(This is one topic touched on in <i>The Control Revolution</i> by James Beniger (1986):  &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openlibrary.org&#x2F;books&#x2F;OL2549490M&#x2F;The_control_revolution" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openlibrary.org&#x2F;books&#x2F;OL2549490M&#x2F;The_control_revolut...</a>&gt;  Not to be confused with another excellent book of the same title by Andrew Shapiro, addressing the nascent Internet and World Wide Web.

It&#x27;s worth noting that the Western Roman Empire at the time of its collapse was <i>not</i> generally in a state of pervasive famine.<p>And Harper isn&#x27;t giving a One True Way response, he <i>is</i> carefully, with a great deal of historigraphic <i>and</i> scientific evidence building the case that, as I noted above, civilisations and pathogens co-evolve.  (My expansion of that to networks or systems and pathologies generally is my own armchair contribution, though based on my own observations of numerous examples at first hand myself.)<p>As much as I appreciate and respect Socrates, he (as with virtually all pre-Baconian philosophers) relied strongly on reason and extremely unsystematic chosen exemplars to posit hypotheses, many of which have since proven greatly mistaken.  (His student&#x27;s student Aristotle polished this to a fine art.)  Baconian science is <i>empirical</i>, Socrates is best known for an <i>interrogative</i> technique.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that some of the suggestions made by Socrates and other philosophers are <i>necessarily</i> wrong.

It&#x27;s useful to keep this in mind as contrasted to several major famines of the past roughly 50--60 years, including Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Somalia, Rwanda, and the like, which dire as they&#x27;ve been, pale by comparison.<p>As Communist China&#x27;s Great Leap Forward and ensuing Great Famine are often mentioned in this context, it&#x27;s worth noting that a roughly comparable famine had occurred only about 20 years earlier, under the Republic of China, not to mention several similarly-scoped famines in the 19th century.  The incidence of famine seems somewhat independent of political structure, and has arguably <i>stopped</i> under Communist Chinese rule.  (I draw no causal inference here, just note the fact.)<p>Ireland saw its population fall by half during the Great Potato Famine of ~1840--1850, through a combination of direct deaths and migration, and only matched its pre-famine population within the past decade.  (I&#x27;ve had to consciously note that this fact has changed recently, the fact that the population <i>hadn&#x27;t</i> recovered was so profound.)<p>As to impacts:  past civilisations were often far less complex and hence less dependent on highly specialised technical skills.  We live in a world in which a relatively modest pandemic resulted in <i>global</i> disruptions of trade, commerce, finance, and governance.  The global &quot;bus factor&quot; seems to be quite low.  In a world in which 90%+ of the population tended farms or herds, and interdependence between towns and villages, let alone nation-states, tended to be fairly low, gave for somewhat greater redundancy.  Ironically, the combined impacts of reducing populations (and hence pulling back from the famine frontier itself), as well as increased labour bargaining power and the liberation of property ownership often meant a comparative <i>flourishing</i> of civilisations following a major famine or plague.  This is much discussed in the context of Europe&#x27;s Black Death (25%--50% population reduction over roughly a decade).</div><br/><div id="40376268" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40376268" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mike_hearn</span><span>|</span><a href="#40372531">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40375588">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40374902">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40376268">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40376268">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Both the Great Famine and the 1942-1943 famines were politically caused, the first by communism and the latter by Japanese invasion.<p><i>&gt; a relatively modest pandemic resulted in global disruptions of trade, commerce, finance, and governance</i><p>The pandemic didn&#x27;t result in that directly.

Slave labor is vastly less efficient than having serfs that can keep (part of) what they produce and have incentives to +-work harder. That allowed producing more food with less workforce so many people were free to do other things and bigger cities could develop which in turn would set the foundation for making the industrial revolution possible.<p>Everything else is just some weird romanticism of the antique when in reality many things got better in the medieval period. There wasn&#x27;t a sudden fall of the Roman Empire. It was a gradual process and the structures coming after it saw themselves not as a replacement but as a continuation of Roman traditions.<p>Edit: As people misunderstand. The important difference between serfdom and slavery is not freedom. The important part is incentives to work harder. Slaves only have the incentives to avoid the whip. They do not own what they produce. They need to be closely supervised and micromanaged. In contrast many forms of serfdom allowed to the serfs to keep some of the stuff they produced so they had incentives to work more efficiently.</div><br/><div id="40373259" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40373259" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Calavar</span><span>|</span><a href="#40372464">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40372990">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40373259">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40373259">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">1. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s accurate to call Rome a slave based economy. Most people in Rome were freemen. Slaves served certain functions that would have been hard to replace with freemen, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that makes Rome a slave based economy. For example, migrant laborers can&#x27;t be easily replaced in the modern US economy, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that the US economy based on migrant labor.<p>2. Relating incentives to productivity is an anachronistic grafting of industrial and post-industrial economic thought onto a subsistence farming economy where it doesn&#x27;t apply. If a serf works harder and produces more crop, what are they going to do with it? Sell it to their neighbor, who is also a farmer and grows all the same things? To the best of my knowledge, there was not a significant cash crop economy in medieval Europe.<p>3. As others have pointed out, slavery continued long after the Roman Empire.  It was much more prevalent in the encomienda system and the antebellum South than it ever was in Rome. The proportion of enslaved people in mid 1700s South Carolina about 3 to 5x that of ancient Rome. And even that&#x27;s nothing compared to the Caribbean.</div><br/><div id="40373601" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40373601" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cardanome</span><span>|</span><a href="#40372464">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40373259">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40375329">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40373601">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40373601">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">1. Rome is commonly characterized as a slave holding society. I think it is fair to say that it was based on slavery as getting new slaves was a big enough concern that it was willing to wage wars over it. It is hard to get estimates but something like 15% percent might have been slaves which is pretty huge. Of course saying it was only based on slavery would be too far.<p>2. 
Cities can not sustain themselves but need the existence of villages that would sell them the food.<p>In the late medieval period farmers absolute would sell the surplus for money on the market. We also see also traveling merchants that would go from village to village to offer wares.<p>&gt; Sell it to their neighbor, who is also a farmer and grows all the same things?<p>Some people in a village did not have land but were craftsmen like the iconic blacksmith.<p>An yes it was a development and early medieval period ages the serf was probably just happy to have slightly more to eat.

Once again in Roman Italy our situation is perhaps a touch better, although not particularly good. Because we have better demographic data for the rest of the free population and a better grasp on the mechanics of Roman agriculture, we can do something a bit better than blind guessing here (though blind guessing there has been in abundance), but not much better. Walter Scheidel walked through much of this math, guesstimating the urban enslaved population under Augustus (r. 31BC-14AD) at around 600,000 (based on an estimated breakdown of Roman social classes and estimates of how many enslaved persons each elite household might have) and another c. 600,000 in the countryside (based on rather more confident agricultural modeling showing the figure can’t be much higher than this without pushing out all of the small farmers and tenants we know from our sources there were) for a total of 1.2m probably representing the height of the enslaved population in Italy, coming as it does at the explosive conclusion of Rome’s long streak of rapid expansion in warfare.12 For an Italy under August between perhaps 5.7m and 7.0m that would imply an enslaved population of very roughly 15-20%, with a bit of wiggle room on both sides.13 This, we can be quite sure, is a significant increase from the earlier period so the figure for 225 BC and the Middle Republic must be lower, perhaps very roughly around 10%. Again, those figures are very rough, but I think Scheidel14 does a good job showing that something much higher, say, 30+% simply doesn’t make much sense given our evidence.<p>That actually is a useful conclusion, by the by, the full import of which I think has not been fully observed: while Rome has a reputation as the slaveholding society – and it certainly was a slaveholding society, make no mistake – those rates are probably rather lower than what we see in Greece, suggestive of an Italy countryside in particular that had more freeholding citizen small farmers than a comparable Greek polis.

This was also mostly unheard of in Rome, and would have led to legal punishments against the slave killers if it could be proven.<p>Of course, this started gradually changing, and the exact conditions for serfs varied greatly between regions. But by-and-large, Medieval Europe was much worse off then many areas of the Roman Empire.<p>And in regards to efficiency, this all makes no sense. The Roman Empire was <i>vastly</i> more economically efficient than medieval Europe, particularly when it came to food production.

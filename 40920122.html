My understanding is that DG was the only publisher routinely using them. That required some manual intervention to convert the indices to separate tracks.

Players seek to index 01 as the start point of the track. There is no separate pregap designation. I&#x27;ve paid special attention to this because it is a difficult problem to solve as many discs have space between tracks stored in index 00-01 but rarely is there anything audible in there after the first track. The only example I have of this is a specialty music sample disc, Rarefaction&#x27;s A Poke In The Ear With A Sharp Stick, that has over 500 samples on the disc accessed by track + index positions.<p>As a sidebar based on the later comments in the thread, I&#x27;ve made it a habit to rip and store every audio CD as BIN&#x2F;CUE+TOC using cdrdao. This allows me to go back and re-process discs I may have missed something on. But that is imprecise even because it usually breaks bluebook discs with multiple sessions to store data due to absolute LBA addressing. Also the ways different CD&#x2F;DVD drives handle reading data between index 00-01 on track 1 is maddening.

Tracks are added on top of this via the Q subcode channel that gives information about the current location and the ToC stored in the lead-in area (also using the Q subcode channel). In the ToC, each track will have one more indexes that points at a specific location on the disc by minute, second and &quot;frame&quot; (represents 1&#x2F;75 of a second, basically a sector).<p>If a CD is properly following the Red Book standard, index 0 will point to a 2 second pre-gap of silentce and index 1 will point to the actual start of audio of the track (additional indices are allowed, but not common). The purpose of the pregap is to make life easier for less sophisticated players that aren&#x27;t able to seek to a precise frame on the disc. They just have to be able to hit a 150 frame region. However, just because the standard says the pregap is supposed to be 2 seconds and silent doesn&#x27;t mean it actually has to be. Players generally don&#x27;t care and by the time the format was popular, even inexpensive players could seek precisely. This allows you to stick audio data before a track that will be skipped by the player when it&#x27;s trying to seek to that track. If you stick it before track 01, it will be skipped even when just playing the disc through unless you rewind.</div><br/><div id="40923110" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40923110" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kevin_thibedeau</span><span>|</span><a href="#40921888">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40922856">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40925147">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40923110">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40923110">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The key for a hidden track at the beginning is that players usually start playing track 1 from index mark 1 (1.1) rather than index 0 as with continuous play through all subsequent tracks.

It&#x27;s a way for the primitive hardware of early CD players to acquire the start of the data stream in a safe area that doesn&#x27;t have to be faithfully reproduced.<p>Some players permitted you to skip back from 1.1 to 1.0 to hear the lead-in as a hidden pseudo-track. Typically this was only possible with hardware index nav. buttons rather than the track nav. buttons, further obfuscating the presence of the hidden track.<p>The other means of &quot;hiding&quot; tracks is to have a bunch of short silent tracks until you get to track 99 (inconvenient to reach on a player without numeric track entry) or to have a long section of silence starting on the last track from index 1.</div><br/><div id="40923429" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40923429" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crtasm</span><span>|</span><a href="#40921888">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40923110">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40925147">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40923429">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40923429">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Typically this was only possible with hardware index nav<p>Holding the previous track button would &quot;rewind&quot; playback and get you into the pregap on all the CD players I remember using, but these would have been late 80s models onwards.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40925147" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40925147" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">barrkel</span><span>|</span><a href="#40921888">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40922856">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40922074">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40925147">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40925147">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The writing is not good; I gave up part way through.

Unlike floppy disks, where you tell the drive to seek and get back raw magnetic pulses (so you can produce raw flux images), or hard disks where you tell the drive to read an arbitrary sector and get a blob of data (so you can produce sector-level images), the protocol for talking to a CD ROM involves asking for track&#x2F;sector addresses, which means you have to trust the drive to interpret all the track metadata and error-correction for you - you generally can&#x27;t just dump the &quot;raw&quot; data and do the interpretation yourself.<p>That&#x27;s why the most robust CD image format is the BIN&#x2F;CUE format. The BIN file contains all the sectors the drive allows us to read, the CUE file contains the disc metadata as interpreted for us by the drive firmware.<p>There are some drives which support extra &quot;raw read&quot; commands, but they&#x27;re incredibly rare and consequently in great demand by CD preservation projects like redump.org.<p>Some people have used the contents of BIN&#x2F;CUE data to <i>reconstruct</i> what should actually be on the disk, but that&#x27;s not quite the same thing.

The pits and lands vary in length, and there are 9 valid variations in their lengths.

(There&#x27;s also room for tricks like CD+G to live in the background, and certainly what may seem like an inordinate amount of data used just for clocking:  CDs are CLV, so playing them happens at a continuously-varying rotational speed in a tightly closed loop because buffer RAM was expensive to buy, and expensive to manage, and tight speed control was cheaper to implement.

I may wake up tomorrow and decide that the above is all bullshit and wish I could erase all of it.

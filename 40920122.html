Track navigation then works just like a real CD without having to listen to an incongruous section of audio meant to link the previous track on sequential play or, even worse, missing it altogether.<p>I have a classical CD from the 80&#x27;s with index marks for different movements within within the individual compositions represented by a handful of tracks. My understanding is that DG was the only publisher routinely using them. That required some manual intervention to convert the indices to separate tracks.

Players seek to index 01 as the start point of the track. There is no separate pregap designation. I&#x27;ve paid special attention to this because it is a difficult problem to solve as many discs have space between tracks stored in index 00-01 but rarely is there anything audible in there after the first track. The only example I have of this is a specialty music sample disc, Rarefaction&#x27;s A Poke In The Ear With A Sharp Stick, that has over 500 samples on the disc accessed by track + index positions.<p>As a sidebar based on the later comments in the thread, I&#x27;ve made it a habit to rip and store every audio CD as BIN&#x2F;CUE+TOC using cdrdao. This allows me to go back and re-process discs I may have missed something on. But that is imprecise even because it usually breaks bluebook discs with multiple sessions to store data due to absolute LBA addressing. Also the ways different CD&#x2F;DVD drives handle reading data between index 00-01 on track 1 is maddening.

Tracks are added on top of this via the Q subcode channel that gives information about the current location and the ToC stored in the lead-in area (also using the Q subcode channel). In the ToC, each track will have one more indexes that points at a specific location on the disc by minute, second and &quot;frame&quot; (represents 1&#x2F;75 of a second, basically a sector).<p>If a CD is properly following the Red Book standard, index 0 will point to a 2 second pre-gap of silentce and index 1 will point to the actual start of audio of the track (additional indices are allowed, but not common). The purpose of the pregap is to make life easier for less sophisticated players that aren&#x27;t able to seek to a precise frame on the disc. They just have to be able to hit a 150 frame region. However, just because the standard says the pregap is supposed to be 2 seconds and silent doesn&#x27;t mean it actually has to be. Players generally don&#x27;t care and by the time the format was popular, even inexpensive players could seek precisely. This allows you to stick audio data before a track that will be skipped by the player when it&#x27;s trying to seek to that track. If you stick it before track 01, it will be skipped even when just playing the disc through unless you rewind.</div><br/><div id="40923110" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40923110" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kevin_thibedeau</span><span>|</span><a href="#40921888">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40922856">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40925147">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40923110">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40923110">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The key for a hidden track at the beginning is that players usually start playing track 1 from index mark 1 (1.1) rather than index 0 as with continuous play through all subsequent tracks.

It&#x27;s a way for the primitive hardware of early CD players to acquire the start of the data stream in a safe area that doesn&#x27;t have to be faithfully reproduced.<p>Some players permitted you to skip back from 1.1 to 1.0 to hear the lead-in as a hidden pseudo-track. Typically this was only possible with hardware index nav. buttons rather than the track nav. buttons, further obfuscating the presence of the hidden track.<p>The other means of &quot;hiding&quot; tracks is to have a bunch of short silent tracks until you get to track 99 (inconvenient to reach on a player without numeric track entry) or to have a long section of silence starting on the last track from index 1.</div><br/><div id="40923429" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40923429" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crtasm</span><span>|</span><a href="#40921888">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40923110">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40925147">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40923429">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40923429">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Typically this was only possible with hardware index nav<p>Holding the previous track button would &quot;rewind&quot; playback and get you into the pregap on all the CD players I remember using, but these would have been late 80s models onwards.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40925147" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40925147" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">barrkel</span><span>|</span><a href="#40921888">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40922856">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40922074">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40925147">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40925147">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The writing is not good; I gave up part way through.

Unlike floppy disks, where you tell the drive to seek and get back raw magnetic pulses (so you can produce raw flux images), or hard disks where you tell the drive to read an arbitrary sector and get a blob of data (so you can produce sector-level images), the protocol for talking to a CD ROM involves asking for track&#x2F;sector addresses, which means you have to trust the drive to interpret all the track metadata and error-correction for you - you generally can&#x27;t just dump the &quot;raw&quot; data and do the interpretation yourself.<p>That&#x27;s why the most robust CD image format is the BIN&#x2F;CUE format. The BIN file contains all the sectors the drive allows us to read, the CUE file contains the disc metadata as interpreted for us by the drive firmware.<p>There are some drives which support extra &quot;raw read&quot; commands, but they&#x27;re incredibly rare and consequently in great demand by CD preservation projects like redump.org.<p>Some people have used the contents of BIN&#x2F;CUE data to <i>reconstruct</i> what should actually be on the disk, but that&#x27;s not quite the same thing.

The pits and lands vary in length, and there are 9 valid variations in their lengths.  This combined phase&#x2F;temporal situation eventually (thanks, science folks from 1970-something!) turns into a serial binary electrical signal inside of a CD player.<p>This binary electrical signal can be recorded.<p>Recorded with what, you asked?<p>CDs have a lot more going on than just audio data:  Remember, there&#x27;s forward error correction at play and (by spec, IIRC) a player is supposed to be able to <i>completely</i> recover data even if there is a gap of 1mm due to a scratch or other interruption.  (There&#x27;s also room for tricks like CD+G to live in the background, and certainly what may seem like an inordinate amount of data used just for clocking:  CDs are CLV, so playing them happens at a continuously-varying rotational speed in a tightly closed loop because buffer RAM was expensive to buy, and expensive to manage, and tight speed control was cheaper to implement.  Remember, this was a finished digital product that was released in 1981.)<p>I find old references[0] that suggest that the raw data rate of a CD (it does not matter what kind) is 4.3218 Mbps.<p>So, to posit some example hardware:  With careful loops and decent wiring, accurately capturing this seems like it would be well within the purvey of an RP2040&#x27;s PIO&#x27;s DMA modes to get that data into RAM, and also well within one of its 133MHz 32-bit ARM core&#x27;s ability to package up and deliver that data over USB 2 to a host machine that can store it for later analysis -- plus or minus a transistor or two, or maybe a pullup resistor in just the right spot.<p>(But that&#x27;s just my opinion as a home hacker who has dabbled in RP2040 PIO assembler, and who is at or a bit beyond their knowledge of compact discs.  I may wake up tomorrow and decide that the above is all bullshit and wish I could erase all of it.

It&#x27;s a bit of a different game.<p>Floppies (most of them, anyway) have fixed track widths, and these tracks are arranged cylindrically, and these cylinders align with the steps of the stepper motor that is used to actuate the head assembly.<p>It&#x27;s relatively easy, with the right ratio betwixt step advancement and track width, to get the head moving properly on a new implementation of a floppy controller.  Want to read track 1?  Step to the head N times to reach track 1 from wherever it started, and read it.  Next, want to read track 33?  Step the head N times to track 33, and read that.<p>But tracking the spiral groove of a CD is a very different problem to solve.  Steps tend to lose their meaning.  Instead of electromagnetic steps, it involves 3 different laser beams:  Two to continuously keep the head centered where it needs to be on the ever-changing groove using a servo feedback loop, and a third to read the data from the pits and lands from the middle of that groove.<p>Is it do-able?  Sure!  People with far less advanced tech than we on HN might have laying around did it 40+ years ago.<p>It&#x27;s just a very different nut to crack than reading a floppy is, even if the mechanical and optical bits are recycled.<p>(And that&#x27;s just head positioning.  The pits and lands still needs to be read, and those reflect back from the disc as optical phase shifts, not as changes in magnetic polarity and&#x2F;or amplitude.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="40924262" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40924262" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">banish-m4</span><span>|</span><a href="#40922663">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40923936">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40924081">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40922214">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40924262">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40924262">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why?

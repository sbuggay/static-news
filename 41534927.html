It matches what we do as people. I think there probably needs to be research into how to tell it when it doesn&#x27;t know something, however.<p>I think if you remember that LLMs are not databases, but they do contain a super lossy-compressed version of (it&#x27;s training) knowledge, this feels less like a hack. If you ask someone, &quot;who won the World Cup in 2000?&quot;, they may say &quot;I think it was X, but let me google it first&quot;. That person isn&#x27;t screwed up, using tools isn&#x27;t a failure.<p>If the context is a work setting, or somewhere that is data-centric, it totally makes sense to check it. Like a Chat Bot for a store, or company that is helping someone troubleshoot or research. Anything where it really obvious answers that are easy to learn from volumes of data (&quot;what company makes the corolla?&quot;), probably don&#x27;t need fact checking as often, but why not have the system check its work?<p>Meanwhile, programming, writing prose, etc are not things you generally fact-check mid-way, and are things that can be &quot;learned&quot; well from statistical volume. Most programmers can get &quot;pretty good&quot; syntax on first try, and any dedicated syntax tool will get to basically 100%, and the same makes sense for an LLM.</div><br/><div id="41538435" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41538435" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">exe34</span><span>|</span><a href="#41536536">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41537396">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41538361">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41538435">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41538435">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think a better way would be to just use it as a text to search interface in the first place?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41538361" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41538361" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">taneq</span><span>|</span><a href="#41536536">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41536968">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41537396">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41538361">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41538361">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Like, two layers of duct tape are better than one.<p>Uh... they <i>are</i>?

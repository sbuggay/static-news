The entire thing was heavy handed and dumb, but branded just well enough to capture the passions of NYC city people who <i>really really really</i> hate cars (and New Jersey) and don&#x27;t think too deeply about it beyond that.<p>The plan was structured in a way that it would affect every resident of the city via higher prices on goods and services, surcharges on delivery, taxis, construction, etc. Setting aside the issue of local residents with cars (which I could care less about), the planners refused to make sensible carve-outs for things like cargo trucks, construction vehicles, and so on. They <i>could have done it</i>, they just didn&#x27;t. It was about maximizing revenue for the MTA, not about making sensible policy.<p>Maybe the fees would be small when amortized over a truck full of groceries or a tanker full of oil, but that didn&#x27;t change the fact that it was a regressive tax on <i>everyone who lives here</i>, and taxes here are already amongst the highest in the country.

So, for urban areas that are organically becoming denser, mass transit becomes ever more important, which was partially the article&#x27;s point in the section you quoted.<p>Also, to generously read the article, it seems to be making two related points, but not actually imposing a &quot;one should follow the other&quot; ordering that you read into it. The full paragraph:<p>&gt; Globally, that is nothing notableâin most urban cores a majority of workers take public transportation for work and daily activities. Increasing the density of jobs, hospitals, restaurants, homes, schools, and more is key to the agglomeration effects that make cities such economic powerhouses, and as density grows mass transit becomes essential since it can far surpass the maximum throughput capacity of even the largest roadways.<p>It is saying two things: 1) high density is critical to be an economic powerhouse and 2) mass transit becomes even more essential as density increases. That paragraph isn&#x27;t inherently saying mass transit should follow densification (vs preceding densification). Ideally you build out mass transit in anticipation of densification vs playing catch up.<p>Anyway, to your point, it&#x27;s absolutely true that building out mass transit is critical in attracting more high-density development (especially very high-density development), and critical in enabling high density development in places that otherwise might not attract that sort of investment.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40817951" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40817951" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tsimionescu</span><span>|</span><a href="#40817418">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40817652">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40817530">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40817951">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40817951">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not living in the USA, but I have never heard of the idea of a city drawing transportation lines to an empty area in anticipation of new buildings.

It&#x27;s really 5+ independent transport systems folded into one big, unwieldy authority. Some of those systems (particularly the LIRR and MNRR, but <i>not</i> NYCT) are famous for overtime fraud[1].<p>2. NYCT runs 24&#x2F;7, which means that maintenance operations need to happen at night or other overtime periods. That means higher baseline costs for labor.<p>3. The MTA intentionally under-hires, under the financial theory that overtime pay is more sustainable than more heads on the 20-year pension pipeline.<p>4. Any amount of capital development on the subway is fundamentally expensive, both due to the age of the system, the complexity of the infrastructure that&#x27;s developed around it, the need to minimize disruption to the rest of the system and city, etc. The MTA has repeatedly opted for bigger, more expensive capital programs that minimize disruption throughout the city, with the SAS&#x27;s extremely deep tunnels being a good example of this.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;usao-sdny&#x2F;pr&#x2F;highest-paid-mta-employee-2018-sentenced-8-months-overtime-fraud-scheme" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;usao-sdny&#x2F;pr&#x2F;highest-paid-mta-employ...</a></div><br/><div id="40818324" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40818324" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gorbachev</span><span>|</span><a href="#40817459">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40817495">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40817551">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40818324">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40818324">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One additional reason is that a not insignificant amount of the funding comes from New York State.

It would have helped transit riders across the city. I donât see how you can sensibly claim otherwise. To pick the most direct and obvious example that I can: the MTA has announced that in light of the loss of funding they would have gotten from the congestion charge theyâre cancelling plans to add accessible entrances to a whole bunch of subway stations in the city. So right there we have a group that would have been helped.<p>The âreal peopleâ in NYC are the ones that take public transit. They vastly, vastly outnumber car drivers (who are disproportionately wealthy). As you yourself assert the roads are a mess. There are simply too many cars for the city to accommodate.<p>I think itâs valid to criticize the congestion charging plan but itâs notable that no one is proposing an alternative. The current situation is clearly not tenable but everyone opposing congestion charging just shrugs their shoulders. Why?

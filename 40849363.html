In the early &#x27;00s, I had contributed a minor amount of code to TortoiseCVS. (Stuff like improving the installer and adding a way to call a tool that could provide a reasonable display for diffs of `.doc` and `.rtf` files.) I had a new, very niche, piece of hardware that I was excited about and wanted to add support for in the Linux kernel. Having read the terms of his license agreement for Bitkeeper, and intending to maintain my patches for TortoiseCVS, I sent him an email asking if it was OK for me to use Bitkeeper anyway. He told me that it did not look like I was in the business of version control software (I wasn&#x27;t!) and said to go ahead, but let him know if that changed.<p>I use git all the time now, because thankfully, it&#x27;s good enough that I shouldn&#x27;t spend any of my &quot;innovation tokens&quot; in this domain.

The following is a guess on my part.<p>One way to interpret this is that Google tends to publish their projects under Apache, and there is no need to demand that people transfer copyright to Google. By releasing your work under Apache, you are already giving Google (or anyone else) all the rights it needs.<p>AFAIK, the main purpose of the Google Individual CLA is to have you sign a statement claiming that you own the rights to your own work and didn&#x27;t give up those rights to your employer.</div><br/><div id="40871141" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40871141" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JoshTriplett</span><span>|</span><a href="#40850866">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40870676">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40857925">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40871141">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40871141">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Grant of Copyright License.

That term means that Google can <i>ignore</i> the terms of Apache-2.0 and instead use the work under this much more permissive license, while everyone <i>else</i> is bound by Apache-2.0. In other words, they can do whatever they want with the code. Others could ship it in a proprietary product, sure, but they can&#x27;t ignore the terms of the license while doing so.<p>&quot;Permissive license&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;do whatever you want&quot;.

I went with git because that was clearly what the world liked best, and because bringing new team members up to speed would require less from me that way.<p>All that goes to say... my direct comparison of git and bitkeeper came from when bitkeeper was mature and git decidedly was not. Then I lumped it in with mercurial (which I really would still prefer, right now) and fossil (ditto).

Without going into a lot of detail, suppose someone adds N bytes on a branch and then that branch is merged.  The N bytes are copied into the merge node (yeah, I know, git looks for that and dedups it but that is a slow bandaid on the problem).<p>- annotations are wrong, if I added the N bytes on the branch and you merged it, it will (unless this is somehow fixed now) show you as the author of the N bytes in the merge node.<p>- only one graph for the whole repository.  This causes multiple problems:
  A) the GCA is the repository GCA, it can be miles away from the file GCA if there was a graph per file like BitKeeper has.
  B) Debugging is upside down, you start at the changeset and drill down.  In BitKeeper, because there is a graph per file, let&#x27;s say I had an assert() pop.  You run bk revtool on that file, find the assert and look around to see what has changed before that assert.  Hover over a line, it will show you the commit comments to the file and then the changeset.  You find the likely line, double click on it, now you are looking at the changeset.  We were a tiny company, we never hit the claimed 25 people, and we supported tons of users.  This form of debugging was a huge, HUGE, part of why we could support so many people.
  C) commit comments are per changeset, not per file.  We had a graphic check in tool that walked you through the list of files, showed you the diffs for that file and asked you to comment.  When you got the the ChangeSet file, now it is asking you for what Git asks for comments but the diffs are all the file names followed by what you just wrote.  It made people sort of uplevel their commit comments.  We had big customers that insisted the engineers use that tool rather a command line that checked in everything with the same comment.<p>- submodules turned Git into CVS.  Maybe that&#x27;s been redone but the last time I looked at it, you couldn&#x27;t do sideways pulls if you had submodules.  BK got this MUCH closer to correct, the repository produced identical results to a mono repository if all the modules were present (and identical less whatever isn&#x27;t populated in the sparse case).  All with exactly the same semantics, same functionality mono or many repos.<p>- Performance.  Git gets really slow in large repositories, we put a ton of work into that in BitKeeper and we were orders of magnitude faster for things like annotate.<p>In summary, Git isn&#x27;t really a version control system and Linus has admitted it to me years ago.  A version control system needs to faithfully record everything that happened, no more or less.  Git doesn&#x27;t record renames, it passes content across branches by value, not by reference.  To me, it feels like a giant step backwards.<p>Here&#x27;s another thing.  We made a bk fast-export and a bk fast-import that are compatible with Git.  You can have a tree in BK, have it updated constantly, and no matter where in the history you run bk fast-export, you will get the same repository.  Our fast-export is idempotent.  Git can&#x27;t do that, it doesn&#x27;t send the rename info because it doesn&#x27;t record that.  That means we have to make it up when doing a bk fast-import which means Git -&gt; BK is not idempotent.<p>I don&#x27;t expect to convince anyone of anything at this point, someone nudged, I tried.  I don&#x27;t read hackernews any more so don&#x27;t expect me to defend what I said, I really don&#x27;t care at this point.

Switching from GitHub, feasible.  From Git?  That&#x27;s much harder.</div><br/><div id="40853539" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40853539" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fragmede</span><span>|</span><a href="#40851424">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40872916">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40853539">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40853539">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Git shortcomings are well known by this point, so &quot;all&quot; a successor project has to do is solve those problems. Git scales to Linux kernel sized projects, but it turns out there are bigger, even more complex projects out there, so it doesn&#x27;t scale to Google-sized organizations. You would want to support centralized and decentralized operation, but be aware of both, so it would support multiple remotes, while making it easier to keep them straight. Is the copy on Github up to date with gitlab, the CI system, and my laptop and my desktop? It would have to handle binaries well, and natively, so I can check-in my 100 MiB jpeg and not stuff things up. You&#x27;d want to use it both as a monorepo and as multirepos, by allowing you to checkout just a subtree of the monorepo. Locally, the workflow would need to both support git&#x27;s complexity, while also being easier to use than git.<p>Anyway, those are the four things you&#x27;d have to hit in order to replace git, as I see them.<p>If you had such a system, getting people off git wouldn&#x27;t be the issue - offer git compatibility and if they don&#x27;t want to use the advanced features, they can just keep using their existing workflow with git. The problem with that though, is that then why use your new system.<p>Which gets to the point of, how do you make this exist as a global worldwide product? FAANG-sized companies have their own internal tools team to manage source code. Anywhere smaller doesn&#x27;t have the budget to create such a thing from scratch but<p>You can&#x27;t go off and make this product and then sell it to someone because how many companies are gonna go with an unproven new workflow tool that their engineers want? What&#x27;s the TAM of companies for whom &quot;git&#x27;s not good enough&quot;, and have large enough pocketbooks?</div><br/><div id="40854665" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40854665" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Borg3</span><span>|</span><a href="#40851424">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40853539">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40857952">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40854665">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40854665">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You are right. GIT is not DVFS, its DVCS. It was made to track source code, not binary data. If you are putting binary to DVCS, you are doing something wrong.<p>But, there are industries that need it, like game industry. So they should use tool that allow that. I heard that Plastic-SCM is pretty decent at it. Never used it so cant tell personally.<p>Replacing GIT is such a stupid idea. There is no ONE tool to handle all cases. Just use right one for your workflows. I, for example, have a need to version binary files. I know GIT handles them badly, but I really like the tool. Solution? I wrote my own simple DVFS tool for that usecase: dot.exe (138KB)<p>Its very simple DVFS for personal use, peer to peer syncing (local, TCP, SSH). Data and Metadata are SHA-1 checksumed. Its pretty speedy for my needs :)

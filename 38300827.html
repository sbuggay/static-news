But there is also the correlation of that if some artist gets famous in art circles because of the quality buyers will want to play cool and buy stuff. Another complication is that there are two types of artists, a very small percentage that sells well, and then there are the ones that just live from the next art residence, to the next Biennial.

Because artists’ income is very unstable, so people won’t apply if they had a bad previous year.<p>2. And because it’s not life changing.

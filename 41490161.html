  2. The company decides to compete with that thing, but it&#x27;s not part of their mission, so they make it free.
  3. Because the new thing is free, and run by a major company, lots of people come to depend on it, even though it&#x27;s intentionally not the best.
  4. Another company builds more competition and works to actually be the best.
  5. The major company sees that their original objective of replacing the bad version is fulfilled, so they sunset the thing.

The highly technical founders, I think, did mean it with &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Evil&quot;. PageRank wasn&#x27;t designed from the start to be a universal panopticon. After all, the global crash hadn&#x27;t happened, rates weren&#x27;t zero yet, no one had smartphones, social media wasn&#x27;t a word, mobile meant J2EE and Symbian, and the now-familiar all-pervasive Silicon Valley financialisation MBA cancer was yet to come. That said, the realisation that &quot;all the data&quot; wasn&#x27;t <i>just</i> about search index data and book scans did clearly hit for them (or, if that was the plan since 1998, surface) by the mid 00s.<p>DoubleClick was the year after Google Code. They had a good few years of being considered cool and, well, Not Evil. Google Earth was 2001, Gmail, Scholar and Books was 2004, Reader and Gtalk (RIP x 2) 2005, Patents in 2006 and dropping 1.65 billion plus (which sounds trivial now that everyone and their mum&#x27;s are worth billions for whatever dog-walking app, but not then) on YouTube that year, even though it was only a year old. Mad times, you could barely sign up for a beta before another one landed. The search engine itself was of course revolutionary and peerless. And you could use it on your WAP phone until something called the &quot;iPhone&quot; happened.<p>For those of us who were young and, yes, naive, and who weren&#x27;t paying attention in the first dot com crash in those newspapers adults read while we played (8 year olds in the 90s rarely using IRC to get the lowdown on Silicon Valley), it seemed like it was possibly a new age. &quot;Going public&quot; in 2004 wasn&#x27;t yet another obvious &quot;oh here we go again&quot; moments, because they were among the first in the generation, with the pervious generation mostly fizzling before pervasive internet access (Amazon made it, but it was a slower burn).<p>Chrome and Android was 2008, and I remember first hearing around then the phrase &quot;Google Mothership&quot;. Though I never stopped using Firefox (and Opera, I don&#x27;t remember when I switched to Firefox), Chrome was undeniably a technical coup at the time. Being cool and shiny and actually good at being a browser, while kicking that evil Microsoft in the teeth helped too. It took time to burn though that goodwill.

You&#x27;d get the source tarball for a project, make some changes, and then e-mail the author&#x2F;maintainer witch a patch. Despite the post&#x27;s claim Open Source existed long before 1998.<p>Rarely did Internet randos have any access to a project&#x27;s VCS. A lot of &quot;projects&quot; (really just a program written by a single person) didn&#x27;t even have meaningful VCS, running CVS or RVS were skills unto themselves. There was also the issue that a lot of Open Source was written by students and hosted on school servers or an old Linux box in a dorm.<p>SourceForge came along riding the first Internet bubble. They let a lot of small FOSS projects go legit by giving them a project homepage without a .edu domain or tilde in it. They also got a managed VCS (CVS at first then Subversion later) and contact e-Mail addresses, forums, and other bits that made the lives of Linux distro and BSD ports maintainers much easier. They also had a number of mirror sites which enabled a level of high availability most projects could never have had previously.<p>Then SourceForge&#x27;s enshitification began as bubble money ran out. The free tier of features was decreased and then they started bundling AdWare into Windows installers. SourceForge would literally repackage a Windows installer to install the FOSS application <i>and</i> some bullshit AdWare, IIRC a browser toolbar was a major one.<p>As the officially upstream source for FOSS projects bundled for package managers the AdWare wasn&#x27;t much of a problem. But SourceForge was the distribution channel for a significant amount of Windows FOSS apps like VLC, MirandaIM, and a bunch of P2P apps which were impacted by the AdWare bundling at various points.<p>A GitHub founder patting themselves on the back for the success of GitHub is sort of funny because GitHub followed a similar track to SourceForge but got bought by Microsoft instead of a company coasting on VC money. I can easily imagine a world where an independent GitHub enshittified had they not been bought by a money fountain.</div><br/><div id="41496379" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41496379" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">progmetaldev</span><span>|</span><a href="#41490357">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41491790">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41492327">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41496379">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41496379">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">GitHub was not on the same track as SourceForge, and I would hazard they were in a completely different world than then one SourceForge developed in. For instance, GitHub is far less likely to host an executable for any software, which is where you&#x27;re going to get bundled installers with AdWare or malware. I know that GitHub allows installers to be uploaded, but if we&#x27;re going to compare the time period before Microsoft purchased GitHub, I really don&#x27;t think this is fair. I understand the history of not trusting Microsoft, and even as someone who is deeply involved in using GitHub and Microsoft software and features, can understand a level of distrust. Everything you said about SourceForge is correct, so I don&#x27;t mean to put down your entire comment here.<p>I believe GitHub&#x27;s underlying use of the Git SCM, as well as the interface that allowed web users to look at &quot;pull requests&quot; as a concept was the real value in GitHub, far before hosting binaries or attracting the attention of Microsoft. The attraction to Microsoft was the ability to pull in the growing network of git users, the popularity of GitHub to a growing number of developers, and the ability to integrate the service into their developer offerings (this was the key that would have made the other two &quot;positives&quot; worthless to them).<p>I think any tool or technology you should have an &quot;out&quot;, in case another corporation&#x2F;company takes over and doesn&#x27;t align with your values. Being stuck on SourceForge, Google Code, GitHub, Bitbucket, etc. is a recipe to lock yourself into being put down to pasture because you couldn&#x27;t adapt and realize that there is a huge world out there, and tools and tech come and go. Always have something as an alternative for whatever you do, because things change too quickly, plus you get another point of view with solving problems (if that&#x27;s your thing, and you aren&#x27;t just developing for the money, which is fine if you can admit it to yourself). The fact that you are able to dive back into time with SourceForge tells me you are one of those people that have been into technology since pre-dot com bust, but probably got burned by Microsoft in some form. I&#x27;m not defending Microsoft for their past practices, only coming at this from what they have done with GitHub to this point. Hopefully I&#x27;m not wrong, but I do have a plan in place in case I am, and I think that&#x27;s the most important thing in software.</div><br/><div id="41496791" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41496791" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">giantrobot</span><span>|</span><a href="#41490357">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41496379">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41492327">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41496791">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41496791">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think GitHub&#x27;s situation is completely analogous to SourceForge.

They made a good product and a very good alternative to SourceForge. I think they just got lucky getting bought by Microsoft when they did. By 2018 I think they&#x27;d gotten to the point where their costs would have required to start chasing revenue.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41492327" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41492327" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PaulHoule</span><span>|</span><a href="#41490357">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41491790">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41496379">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41495930">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41492327">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41492327">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree w&#x2F; the analysis in the article and yours.  âGood tasteâ for them must have been influenced by âletâs not be SourceForgeâ.<p>Part of the enshittification story is the tragedy of the non-profitable site that has a large user base.

Darcs was actually the best in this era, IMO, because it was far simpler than both Hg and Git -- a Darcs repository was just a directory, and it supported HTTP as the primary pull&#x2F;patch sharing mechanic. So, you could just put any repository in any public directory on a web server and pull over HTTP. Done. This was working back in like 2006 as the primary method of use.<p>In any case, the premise is still wrong because as mentioned elsewhere, the distribution of repository sizes and their compute requirements are not smooth or homogonous. The cost of hosting one popular mirror of the Linux kernel, or a project like Rails, for 1 year is equivalent to hosting 10,000 small projects for 100 years, in either SVN or Git. The whole comparison is flawed unless this dynamic is taken into account. GitHub in 2024 still has to carve out special restrictions and exemptions for certain repositories because of this (the Chromium mirror for example gets extended size limits other repos can&#x27;t have.)<p>Git also lacked a lot of techniques to improve clones or repo sizes of big repos until fairly late in its life (shallow + partial clones) because 99% of the time their answer was &quot;make more repositories&quot;, and the data model still just falls over fast once you start throwing nearly any raw binary data in a repository at any reasonable clip (not GiB, low hundreds of MiB, and it doesn&#x27;t become totally unusable but degrades pretty badly).

But not entirely. My take on this is that 1) Github fixed the one problem that Git had: terrible UX. Github made it more like subversion. Enough so to consider switching. Indeed a lot of small companies treat it like a central repository with commit rights for everyone. 2) It fixed a big problem OSS projects had: it was very hard to contribute to them.<p>The first reason was why Git became interesting, the second one is why it won.<p>Prior to Github the way to contribute to OSS projects was a protracted process of engaging with very busy people via mailing lists, issue trackers, and what not and jumping through a lot of hoops to get your patches considered, scrutinized, and maybe merged. If you got good at this, you might eventually earn commit privileges against some remote, centralized repository. This actively discouraged committing stuff. OSS was somewhat elitist. Most programmers never contributed a single line of OSS code or even considered doing so.<p>Github changed all that. You could trivially fork any project and start tinkering with it. And then you could contribute your changes back with a simple button push: create pull request. It actively encouraged the notion. And lots of people did.<p>Github enabled a bunch of kids that were into Ruby to rapidly scale a huge OSS community that otherwise would not have existed. That success was later replicated by the Javascript community; which pretty much bootstrapped on Github as well. What did those two communities have in common: young people who were mostly not that sophisticated with their command line tooling. This crowd was never going to be exchanging patches via some mailing list, like the Linux crowd still does today. But they could fork and create pull requests. And they did. Both communities had a wild growth of projects. And some of them got big.<p>Github gave them a platform to share code so they all used it. And the rest is just exponential growth. Github rapidly became the one place to share code. Even projects with their own repositories got forked there. Because it was just easier. A lot of those projects eventually gave up on their own central infrastructure. Accepting contributions via Github was easier. In 2005 Git was new and obscure; very elitist. In 2008 Github popped up. By 2012 it hosted most of the OSS community. Game over by around 2010 I would guestimate. By 2015 even the most conservative shops were either using it or considering it at least.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41490673" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41490673" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SenHeng</span><span>|</span><a href="#41498150">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41490354">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41490673">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41490673">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I used both GitHub and BitBucket during the early days.

The big thing about git over subversion at the time (at least before everyone started putting their repos up on github with pull requests and all) is that it was truly distributed i.e everyone maintained their copy of a repo and no repo was the &#x27;master&#x27; or privileged source of truth. And merging changes was&#x2F;is relatively seamless with fine grained control over what you want to merge in to your copy that svn simply didn&#x27;t provide. Svn on the other hand is a server&#x2F;client architecture. Although you could have multiple servers, it was kind of pointless as keeping them in sync was more trouble than it was worth. For most workflows there was the  server or master repo and your local copy is not under source control. And if that master&#x2F;server should go offline for any reason you were not able to &#x27;check-in&#x27; code. I remember this being such a pain point because if the master was offline for a significant amount of time you essentially had no way to track changes you made and it would all just be one big commit at the end (which was also a major pain for the administrator&#x2F;repo maintainer who would have to merge in a whole bunch of big breaking changes all at once). Maybe git vs mercurial was a close fight with no immediately obvious winner, but subversion&#x27;s days were pretty much numbered once git showed up.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41493095" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41493095" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">HerrMonnezza</span><span>|</span><a href="#41490354">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41490589">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41496751">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41493456">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41493095">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41493095">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One thing that Git and the other DVCS&#x27;s massively improved over Subversion is that commits are local, and you only need to talk to a remote endpoint when you push&#x2F;pull.

And git won because, for complex sociological factors, the software engineers were able to argue that their needs were more important than the needs of other parts of the companies for which they worked.<p>For a counter-point (which I&#x27;ve made many times before) from 2005 to 2012 we used Subversion. The important thing about Subversion was that it was fun to use, and it was simple, so everyone in the organization enjoyed using it: the graphic designers, the product visionaries, the financial controllers, the operations people, the artists and musicians, the CEO, the CMO, etc. And we threw everything into Subversion: docs about marketing, rough drafts of advertising copy, new artwork, new design ideas, todo lists, software code, etc.<p>The whole company lived in Subversion and Subversion unified every part of the company. Indeed, many products that grew up later, after 2010 and especially after 2014, grew up because companies turned away from Subversion. Google Sheets became a common way to share spreadsheets, but Google Sheets wasn&#x27;t necessary back when all spreadsheets lived in Subversion and everyone in the company used Subversion. Likewise, Google Docs. Likewise some design tools. Arguably stuff like Miro would now have a smaller market niche if companies still used Subversion.<p>At some point between 2008 and 2015 most companies switched over to git. The thing about git is that it is complex and therefore only software engineers can use it. Using git shattered the idea of having a central version control for everything in the company.<p>Software engineers made several arguments in favor of git.<p>A somewhat silly argument was that software developers, at corporations, needed the ability to do decentralized development. I&#x27;m sure this actually happens somewhere, but I have not seen it. At every company that I&#x27;ve worked, the code is as centralized as it was when we used Subversion.<p>A stronger argument in favor of git was that branches were expensive in Subversion but cheap in git. I believe this is the main reason that software developers preferred git over Subversion. For my part, during the years that we used Subversion, we almost never used branches, mostly we just developed separate code and then merged it back to main. Our devops guy typically ran 20 or 30 test servers for us, so we could test our changes on some machine that we &quot;owned&quot;. For work that would take several weeks, before being merged back to main, we sometimes did setup a branch, and other times we created a new Subversion repo. Starting new repos was reasonably cheap and easy with Subversion, so that was one way to go when some work would take weeks or months of effort. But as ever, with any version control system, merge conflicts become more serious the longer you are away from the main branch, so we tried to avoid the kind of side projects that would take several weeks. Instead, we thought carefully about how to do such work in smaller batches, or how to spin off the work into a separate app, with its own repo.<p>A few times we had a side project that lasted several months and so we would save it (every day, once a day) to the main branch in Subversion, just to have it in Subversion, and then we would immediately save the &quot;real&quot; main branch as the next version, so it was as if the main branch was still the same main branch as before, unchanged, but in-between versions 984 and 986 there was a version 985 that had the other project that was being worked on. This also worked for us perfectly well.<p>The point is that the system worked reasonably well, and we built fairly complex software. We also deployed changes several times a day, something which is till rare now, in 2024, at most companies, despite extravagant investments in complex devops setups. I read a study last week that suggested only 18% of companies could deploy multiple times a day. But we were doing that back in 2009.<p>The non-technical people, the artists and product visionaries and CFOs and and CMOs, would often use folders, when they wanted to track variations of an idea. That was one of the advantages of having something as simple as Subversion: the whole team could work with idioms that they understood. Folders will always be popular with non-technical people.<p>But software developers preferred git, and they made the argument that they needed cheap branches, needed to run the software in whole, locally on their machines, with multiple variations and easy switching between branches, and needed a smooth path through the CI&#x2F;CD tools towards deployment to production.<p>I&#x27;ve two criticisms with this argument:<p>1. software developers never took seriously how much they were damaging the companies they worked for when they ended the era of unified version control.<p>2. When using Subversion, we still had reasonably good systems for deployment. For awhile we used Capistrano scripts, and later (after 2010) I wrote some custom deployment code in Jenkins. The whole system could be made to work and it was much simpler than most CI&#x2F;CD systems that I see now. Simplicity had benefits. In particular, it was possible to hire a junior level engineer and within 6 months have them understand the whole system. That is no longer possible, as devops has become complex, and has evolved into its own specialty. And while there are certainly a few large companies that need the complexity of modern devops, I&#x27;ve seen very few cases myself. I mostly see just the opposite: small startups that get overwhelmed with the cost of implementing modern devops &quot;best practices&quot;, small startups that would benefit if they went back to the simplicity that we had 10 to 15 years ago.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41494072" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41494072" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">asnyder</span><span>|</span><a href="#41498375">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41491007">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41494072">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41494072">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Personally I really liked darcs, always felt more natural and intuitive to me.<p>Though fortunately was compatible and natively convertible to git and made the git takeover mostly smoothless.<p>At the time it felt that github and the rapid tooling and integrations developed in response cemented git&#x27;s rise and downfall of everything else including darcs.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41491007" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41491007" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">amtamt</span><span>|</span><a href="#41494072">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41491002">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41491007">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41491007">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">vi: 1976

At the time, it had over 3 million Git repositories â a nearly invincible position.. if I ever have to choose between a group of professional business managers or a talented group of passionate developers with amazing product-market fit like GitHub, I am investing in GitHub every time.</code></pre></div><br/><div id="41491030" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41491030" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">schacon</span><span>|</span><a href="#41491002">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41492779">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41491030">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41491030">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What is the point you&#x27;re trying to make here?</div><br/><div id="41491060" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41491060" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">transpute</span><span>|</span><a href="#41491002">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41491030">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41492779">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41491060">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41491060">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Did $100M investment help Github to win, or had Github already won in 2012 with profitability and 3M git repos?</div><br/><div id="41491090" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41491090" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">schacon</span><span>|</span><a href="#41491002">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41491060">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41492779">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41491090">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41491090">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would argue that GitHub already won in 2012.

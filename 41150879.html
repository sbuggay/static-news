For example, in Germany beer was only brewed in winter to avoid spoiling it during the warmer months, and stored in underground beer cellars which were kept cool using ice &quot;harvested&quot; during the winter. To help keep the cellars cool, chestnut trees were planted over them. And from there it was just a small step to also serving the cool beer on benches under the shady chestnut trees (only the beer was provided, food was BYO) - and thus the traditional German beer garden was born.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Beer_garden#History" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Beer_garden#History</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41176726" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41176726" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gumby</span><span>|</span><a href="#41179342">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41178348">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41176726">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41176726">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I remember from visiting my grandparents in the 1960s there was one cold store in the town.  I believe that my grandfather (a doctor) kept some things there, like insulin.  I never heard of anyone having a fridge of their own, which is the kind of thing that would have been told to a kid.<p>I only remember going there for ice cream which was made in a bicycle inner tube.  They cut the tube into segments; the ice cream tasted of rubber of course.<p>In the 70s there was a huge wave of modernization in SE Asia and suddenly people had scooters and cars, girls had miniskirts, and A&#x2F;C appeared in saree shops at least.  I don’t remember if my GPs ever bought a fridge or not, though.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41178348" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41178348" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Scoundreller</span><span>|</span><a href="#41176726">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41176721">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41178348">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41178348">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When&#x27;s the Controlled Atmosphere Banquet?<p>(I guess nobody noticed when New York apples were still sold &#x27;fresh&#x27; in February)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;thesalt&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;26&#x2F;668256349&#x2F;thanks-to-science-you-can-eat-an-apple-every-day" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;thesalt&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;26&#x2F;668256349&#x2F;th...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41176721" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41176721" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lbourdages</span><span>|</span><a href="#41178348">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41179337">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41176721">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41176721">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The article talks about the loss of seasonality in the taste of our foods, which is something I can directly relate to even though I am not that old.<p>When I was a kid (in the 90s), we got our milk from a local dairy. I distinctly remember the taste of milk changing around May, when the cows started to go outside and switched from dry feed to grass. That does not happen anymore... I wonder what they changed since then.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

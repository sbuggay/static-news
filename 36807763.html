I don&#x27;t think the problem with those fields is that we need more amateur cooks in the kitchen.<p>However, this post was written by a post-doc in social psychology, and is employed in the management division of a business school. I&#x27;m ready to believe that a rank amateur could walk into his field and do science just as well as anyone else, and this post makes a lot more sense.</div><br/><div id="36808887" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36808887" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">iamhamm</span><span>|</span><a href="#36808608">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36809511">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36808887">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36808887">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had a similar thought about the hard sciences (physics graduate dropout) and the inaccessibility of hard sciences to amateurs. Then I moved to the desert and got interested in geology and much to my surprise learned there&#x27;s all sort of stuff in geology that is available. It&#x27;s the result of the need to physically go look at rocks (at least for structural). I&#x27;m currently working on a new description of the strata at the end of my street because the highest resolution stratigraphic map fails to correctly delineate at least two units of bedrock - eg the map does not show them, but they appear to be present. To figure it out, I&#x27;ve had to take several road trips to compare my neighborhood rock to the exposed units in those locations. I find it quite fun and entertaining.<p>Meanwhile, a colleague of mine found a new species of dinosaur using a radiometric detector he designed and got a patent on (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ktar.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;4298984&#x2F;arizona-volunteers-unearth-75-million-year-old-dinosaur-in-new-mexico&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ktar.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;4298984&#x2F;arizona-volunteers-unearth-75...</a>).<p>There&#x27;s still some real science out there if you want it. :)</div><br/><div id="36809402" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36809402" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">godelski</span><span>|</span><a href="#36808608">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36808887">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36810801">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36809402">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36809402">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d put geology on the same level as say physics. Similarly I wouldn&#x27;t put astronomy and astrophysics at the same level. This is not to say that there aren&#x27;t many problems that can be solved by amateurs, but that the utility is quite disproportionate.  I also wouldn&#x27;t say that soft sciences aren&#x27;t &quot;real&quot;, but rather that they have higher rates of error due to the lack of precision and mathematical theory.<p>But I also wouldn&#x27;t say that you need a degree to contribute to any of the hard sciences. The formal education&#x27;s utilities mainly lie in guidance, structure, connections, and probably most importantly, the ability to dedicate your full time to your education. Being able to ask someone for help is a significant accelerator. All the math you need to get through a bachelor&#x27;s, and generally even a masters, is available via 20+ year old textbooks. The PhD is a lot of self study too, and a lot of isolation. But at that point you should have a reasonable idea of direction, although getting lost is common and not necessarily a bad thing. It&#x27;s probably becoming much easier to do this too given that not only are lectures and piratable textbooks are online, but so are the whole educational structure of a degree, which prevents the amateur from getting lost.<p>Honestly, I think one of the biggest leaps our species will make will happen when we reach post scarcity. Either we&#x27;ll be glued to the screens or we&#x27;ll all have the freedom to pursue our passions. Having the ability to dedicate all your time to your education, art, or whatever without worry about your basic needs is quite liberating (even more than school). Maybe even a large social split between the groups.

Science requires a substantial amount of creativity. In fact, they are necessary. The nature of breakthroughs requisite thinking outside the box and breaking from convention.<p>What I would say are real limits to creativity are the arbitrary and absurd evaluation metrics we use. Publish or perish paradigm encourages quick work rather than good work, which correlates with a decrease of novelty and substance. Makes the process more incremental. It also encourages railroading as exploration requires more time.<p>The review process also exacerbates these problems, as the system is not actually aligned with the goals. They are arbitrary noisy filters rather than quality filters, and we have substantial evidence that, putting it nicely, reviewers are good at identifying bad works but not good at identifying good works (i.e. default to reject). This causes one to continually rework a project rather than moving on or even making it better, as the feedback generally isn&#x27;t about how to make the work better and each set of reviewers wants to add more and more.<p>The pursuit of novelty is also not only fundamentally anti-scientific but the basis of an existential crisis. To get funding or to pass review, we must be creative in convincing reviewers that we are clever while ideas generally far more obvious after they are revealed to you (regardless of lack of prior works). The need to innovate also prevents replication, which is the basis of science! It is far more difficult, often nearly impossible, to get funding or even approval to replicate works. Science is the process of ruling things out, not confirming things. Each replication has its own set of noise and biases, and this stochastic nature helps reveal hidden confounders. It is also quite essential to the learning process and failing to perform this task results in information being passed like a game of telephone.<p>But by nature, science is anti-authority and highly creative. You _must_ challenge pre-existing notions (trust but verify) and you must think outside the box. Though I do not blame anyone for missing this given the structures and incentives (shackles) the bureaucratic system has imposed upon us.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36810801" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36810801" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rewmie</span><span>|</span><a href="#36808608">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36808887">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36809402">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36809511">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36810801">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36810801">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; There&#x27;s still some real science out there if you want it. :)<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a correct way of representing things.<p>Science is a process, and it does not depend on finding out something someone never saw before or bothered to look at it.<p>Scientific discovery is also not necessarily tied to the science.

We all know about professional software developers who are forced by their profession, that is, the fact that they do it under contract X for company Y managed by person Z, to do things that they know are complete crap. I mean, SAP is professional. Microsoft or Google lock-in? <i>Highly</i> professional! Shiny even. Supporting RSS? Not professional. A gimmick you&#x27;re allowed, like what you do outside of work. Or even more brutal: Ignaz Semmelweis. That he was a professional didn&#x27;t help him, the super mega <i>cereal</i> professionals undid his efforts without blinking, and without anyone even <i>realizing</i> it at the time.<p>At the same time, people just make stuff up without any rigor, just take climate change denial and whatnot. So it&#x27;s not that <i>not</i> being a professional is any positive indicator, either. I just think that if you do something others don&#x27;t already do, they cannot authorize you, by definition. They don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re even talking about, while thinking they do. Not their fault, not your fault, but if <i>you</i> don&#x27;t do you, &quot;you&quot; will not be done, and the world will never know.<p>Of course, in the end the results have to hold up, my point is not to give license to &quot;questioning everything&quot; as code for just spouting non-sequiturs. But I wouldn&#x27;t dissuade &quot;randoms&quot; from pursuing scientific fancies because the professionals got it, because frankly, they don&#x27;t.

IMO &quot;professionals&quot; <i>is</i> one single basket, the way everybody and their dog is streamlined and appropriate these days.<p>last but not least:<p>&gt; However these 3 years of work in isolation, when I was thrown onto my own resources, following guidelines which I myself had spontaneously invented, instilled in me a strong degree of confidence, unassuming yet enduring, in my ability to do mathematics, which owes nothing to any consensus or to the fashions which pass as law.<p>[..]<p>&gt; By this I mean to say: to reach out in my own way to the things I wished to learn, rather than relying on the notions of the consensus, overt or tacit, coming from a more or less extended clan of which I found myself a member, or which for any other reason laid claim to be taken as an authority. This silent consensus had informed me, both at the lyÃ© and at the university, that one shouldn&#x27;t bother worrying about what was really meant when using a term like &quot;volume&quot;, which was &quot;obviously self-evident&quot;, &quot;generally known&quot;, &quot;unproblematic&quot;, etc. I&#x27;d gone over their heads, almost as a matter of course, even as Lesbesgue himself had, several decades before, gone over their heads. It is in this gesture of &quot;going beyond&quot;, to be something in oneself rather than the pawn of a consensus, the refusal to stay within a rigid circle that others have drawn around one - it is in this <i>solitary</i> act that one finds <i>true creativity</i>.

Seriously, pick a paper at random and see how well it holds up.<p>This is utter BS.  Occasionally, a high-profile fraudster is found out, but the overwhelming majority of papers in most disciplines will hold up very well under scrutiny (not that there couldn&#x27;t be more scrutiny!).  Scientists are humans though, and a certain percentage are scumbags.  Given how scum rises to the top in private enterprise, I&#x27;m actually surprised we don&#x27;t see more fraud from top administrators at ivy league colleges.<p>Academia has always had to strike a balance between embracing new ideas and resisting quacks.  It&#x27;s not news that revolutionary ideas sometimes have a tough time gaining acceptance.  Science provides a framework that makes accepting ideas that work almost inevitable, but sometimes it takes time.<p>Can millions of backyard scientists really move things forward?  Only if they&#x27;re actually scientists in the sense that they keep careful notes and can reproduce their findings.  If you find something weird and can&#x27;t reproduce it, why should anyone take your word for it?  Science has to be replicable.  You can&#x27;t have some secret process that only works in your backyard.  You need to be able to write down how you produced your result in a way that someone else can read it and then replicate it in their own backyard.  Only then can it become useful.<p>Unfortunately, for some areas of science, there are certain requirements that are impossible to meet in your backyard.  You can&#x27;t experiment with creating anti-hydrogen in your backyard because you need a massive particle accelerator for that kind of work.<p>What is most direly needed is better lines of communication between academia and the public.  Currently, most university laboratories&#x27; communication with the public is carefully managed by PR departments.  You don&#x27;t just talk to anyone you like about your latest work.  The PR people <i>must</i> be involved, lest you say something embarrassing or fail to sufficiently puff up the university&#x27;s image.  This needs to end.  Scientists are sometimes awkward communicators.  Certain words sometimes mean very different things to them.  We need to get the public used to letting the occasional gaff slide and we need to get scientists out of the PR hustle sideshow.<p>We need scientists talking directly to the public, explaining what they&#x27;re doing, and listening to screwball ideas from the peanut gallery.  It lets the public know what&#x27;s being done with their tax dollars and gives amateur scientists a chance to get up to speed on cutting edge research.  It <i>also</i> bombards scientists with ideas.  Even bad ones can be valuable prods in novel directions.<p>We don&#x27;t need people saying that academia has failed and it&#x27;s time for unpaid enthusiasts to pick up the mantle of progress, because that&#x27;s not true and not how we move forward.

That&#x27;s by <i>design</i>. The purpose of publishing a paper is <i>not</i> to document a result that is already known for sure to be right. It is to push the boundaries of current knowledge. Many such pushes don&#x27;t pan out. We non-scientists don&#x27;t see that because we never hear about those papers. We only hear about the ones that <i>do</i> pan out--or the ones that somebody hyped and marketed even though they hadn&#x27;t panned out yet, and then got caught.<p>To take an example from a century ago: if you just look at Einstein&#x27;s published papers on General Relativity, it looks pretty straightforward. He made a few tries all tending in the same direction and finally ended up with the right field equation, the one that we now know, a century later, to have extensive experimental confirmation. What you <i>don&#x27;t</i> see is all the papers published by all the <i>other</i> physicists that were working on a relativistic theory of gravity--all of which were wrong and were dropped. But they were still published papers, because the standard of publication wasn&#x27;t &quot;this has to be right&quot;, but &quot;this is worth considering to see if <i>maybe</i> it&#x27;s right&quot;.<p><i>&gt; We need scientists talking directly to the public, explaining what they&#x27;re doing</i><p>We already have that. Scientists write books, do videos, have blogs. Unfortunately, scientists don&#x27;t do a good job at communicating with the public, because they don&#x27;t take care to distinguish what is actually established--by experimental confirmation and replication--from their own pet hypotheses that haven&#x27;t yet been confirmed. (String theory in physics is a prime example: string theory makes <i>no</i> testable predictions at all, yet string theorists routinely talk about it as if it were proven fact.)<p><i>&gt; and listening to screwball ideas from the peanut gallery.</i><p>No, we don&#x27;t need that, because <i>nobody</i> from the &quot;peanut gallery&quot; (meaning people who are interested in science but don&#x27;t have a good understanding of our best current theories) has <i>ever</i>, in the history of science, come up with an idea worth pursuing. Tales to the contrary are myths. For example, Einstein is often given as an example of a &quot;peanut gallery&quot; person who came up with a great theory; in fact he was nothing of the kind. He got a doctorate in physics right around the time he published his classic 1905 papers. He had a thorough understanding of the best current theories of the time in physics, and that was recognized by the top physicists of the time. He had close connections with top experimental physicists who kept him up to speed on the latest discoveries, and he worked with them to develop theoretical models for them (for example his work on Brownian motion and on specific heats). He was no &quot;peanut gallery&quot; person; he was a working scientist.</div><br/><div id="36809415" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36809415" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">autoexec</span><span>|</span><a href="#36808434">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36808740">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36807991">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36809415">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36809415">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; No, we don&#x27;t need that, because nobody from the &quot;peanut gallery&quot; (meaning people who are interested in science but don&#x27;t have a good understanding of our best current theories) has ever, in the history of science, come up with an idea worth pursuing.<p>That&#x27;s clearly not true (as you&#x27;d expect from such a broad  absolute) and it&#x27;s apparent in the countless scientists who were inspired to pursue research because of ideas taken from art or science fiction.<p>Even really fringe ideas about things like ghosts, telepathy, or remote viewing, have been considered ideas worth pursuing by scientists and all kinds of paranormal concepts have been widely studied as a result.<p>Not only has the &quot;peanut gallery&quot; come up with some amazing possibilities, but some of their concepts have later turned out to be surprisingly right (for example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eureka:_A_Prose_Poem#Influence_and_significance" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eureka:_A_Prose_Poem#Influence...</a>)<p>You might also count as peanut gallery types scientists whose interests were mainly in one area, but who came  up with some amazing ideas in others.

Even for the undergrad level this feels naÃ¯ve. There&#x27;s much more learning going on outside the lecture and I&#x27;d wager that&#x27;s where most of it is happening. For grad school this is definitely true. You learn the most when you stop taking classes and that period is generally associated with extremely unhealthy work life balances. I&#x27;m in my 5th year of grad school and I read probably a few papers in depth and a dozen or more at lighter levels every week. This is not including all the time I&#x27;m writing code, reading other people&#x27;s implementations, or reading math books and blogs on the subjects. The people I know that research that have graduated also do a lot of similar things, just not at as high of a rate, and they have a healthier (but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d call healthy) work life balance.<p>This inane kind of thinking only promotes the absurd armchair expertise we see where people think a few YouTube videos by communicators gives them sufficient knowledge to arrogantly argue with domain experts. I&#x27;ll take pretentiousness over arrogance any day. The Internet is dominated with these armchair experts who group together in their bubbles and push out any who disagree with the &quot;obvious&quot; answers. They commonly criticize experts for not seeing something &quot;obvious&quot; which the experts actually accounted for but would require reading their actual publication rather than the telephone game that is science communicators.<p>No one is stopping you from getting domain expertise. No degree required. PhDs demonstrate self learning every day. But if you can&#x27;t walk the walk then don&#x27;t talk the talk. Shits a lot more complicated than you think.

Not all molecules have much of a magnetic moment themselves either so even if they were to align that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;d exhibit much of an overall field. Water falls into this bucket. It takes super strong magnets and super sensitive detectors to make MRIs work precisely because water&#x27;s ability to be magnetized is so insanely small.<p>Also crystal is an arrangement of solid matter, not a thing unto itself.

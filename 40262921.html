They always seemed very &quot;1984&quot; to me, and almost designed to engender resentment in a way that would ultimately backfire. So perhaps I&#x27;m in a like-minded echo chamber, but is there <i>anyone</i> that actually defends these DEI statements with a coherent argument, or can you point me to one online? If so, I&#x27;d honestly love to hear it, and I mean this quite genuinely. I did some googling beforehand and found loads of &quot;how to write a good DEI statement&quot; articles, but literally every single one of them just took it at face value that these were a good thing to begin with (or, perhaps in their defense, that &quot;academic jobs require it&quot;, so you better learn how to write one in any case).</div><br/><div id="40272097" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40272097" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">KorematsuFredt</span><span>|</span><a href="#40267547">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40267935">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40272097">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40272097">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A lot of things have &quot;said purpose&quot; and the &quot;real purpose&quot; because of which such absolutely kafkaesque things survive in organizations.<p>The said purpose of-course is to make sure that the candidate is &quot;committed to diversity&quot;.  We can argue all day on whether a statement is in any way good measure of it. It really isn&#x27;t. I have helped people write such statements and we have always written it with cynicism and great contempt for the people who might actually read it.<p>But the &quot;real reason&quot; which such concept found a great foothold in modern American universities is that it kind of acts as top kill to get rid of potential people who might actually ask questions critical of various ideological positions that the university&#x27;s internal bodies might have. You either want a radical zealot or at least someone who is willing to play along for his own career-maxing goals. What you don&#x27;t want is someone who can call the emperor naked. Diversity statements are excellent way to achieve this as I have seen people write one line diversity statements such as &#x27;I don&#x27;t have one as I do not think diversity is important&#x27;. Such person IMO is more intellectually honest and would be a good addition to faculty position but will not be hired.<p>You are right that there is tons of resentment around the DEI BS that people have to go through.

Doing it based on guesswork is probably worse than useless. So that&#x27;s the non-ideological part.<p>If you actually care enough to study it and propose hiring processes that encourage it then that&#x27;s an actual worthwhile education process. It can be little stuff... like I hide names on resumes and obscure gender to avoid that very well known bias. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s actually a net win all around to do that kind of thing, and you wouldn&#x27;t know how big a deal it is and how much benefit it is for your team without reading. It&#x27;s a complicated topic, and I think many of the concepts applied earnestly but scientifically testing them is a good idea.

As I understand it, the DEI statement is supposed to go along with the last two.<p>Much of what is said about DEI statements can also be said about the teaching statement. At R1 universities like MIT, people are hired for tenure track positions based on their past (and future) research, and many teaching statements can be recitations of current hot topics (“flipped classrooms” “active learning” etc). But good ones (with evidence in letters of rec and CV) indicate that the candidate really has practiced what they propose to do in the future. To be clear, at MIT I’m sure a stellar teaching statement won’t get someone hired, but a patently false or over the top “I don’t care” one might give people pause.<p>As I understand, DEI statements are the same. If someone wrote “my philosophy is that we should perpetuate the structures of power and mediocrity created by focusing on wealthy pedigreed individuals rather than ability and potential found by looking in unusual places” that would raise eyebrows. Conversely, if they instead said “I TA’d for an international computational neuroscience summer school that gave opportunity to impoverished students from Africa and Asia”, people might think “That’s cool!”<p>But I think that most academics who are motivated by equity are not interesting in reading a ChatGPT DEI statement.<p>I do think that the conversation around this is really unfortunate. I find little philosophical difference between what people are looking for with DEI statements and what goes into college applications from HS students, but I hear fewer people advocating for getting rid of those essays.</div><br/><div id="40270640" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40270640" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bpodgursky</span><span>|</span><a href="#40267547">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40270629">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40271779">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40270640">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40270640">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">UC Berkeley rejected 76% of applicants based on the DEI statement alone[1].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;education&#x2F;480603-what-is-uc-davis-hiding-about-its-use-of-diversity-statements&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;education&#x2F;480603-what-is-uc-davi...</a></div><br/><div id="40270692" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40270692" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ckemere</span><span>|</span><a href="#40267547">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40270640">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40271779">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40270692">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40270692">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think that’s consistent with the example that I gave.

In other words, the Aboriginals that white men largely wiped out over 200 years ago. See, e.g.: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indigenous.unsw.edu.au&#x2F;strategy&#x2F;culture-and-country&#x2F;acknowledgement-country-and-welcome-country" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indigenous.unsw.edu.au&#x2F;strategy&#x2F;culture-and-coun...</a><p>So now, the descendants of those white men feel guilty and have to make a little speech before each meeting.

I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a specific term for it, but it happens roughly like this:<p>First, someone identifies an opportunity to improve diversity, equity, or inclusion in some way. DEI statements in academia, codes of conduct in open source projects, some rules around topics or specific language on a social media site, I&#x27;m sure you can name some other examples.<p>Now, this new thing may be a way to address the problem, or not. The problem it&#x27;s trying to address might have been well understood or not. One way or another the idea gets some momentum.<p>Next, bigots get wind of the thing and start concern trolling and spreading FUD about it. Everything they say is carefully crafted with a veneer of respectability and plausibility. Any accusations are re-directed. There are people who are motivated and very skilled at making plausible sounding bad-faith arguments. The plausibility of course also convinces people might not intend to be making a bad faith argument, and so are authentic in their indignant responses to accusations of acting in bad faith. Still, the entire point of the arguments was ultimately to disrupt efforts to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion, and to uphold inequality. In some cases these bad faith arguments can end up being a vast majority of the discussion. They make up maybe 80% (not an exact figure) of the comments in any given HN thread about anything tangentially related to DEI for example.<p>The people trying to make a positive change who have been at it for a while are generally exhausted with trying to deal with the torrent of bad faith arguments, quickly recognize the pattern of them, and ultimately often end up serving as fuel for further bad-faith arguments.<p>In the end, it becomes nearly impossible to have a productive good faith discussion about whether the original idea is good or not, or how to improve it, because nobody can disentangle legitimate contributors and arguments from the torrent of bad faith actors who are ultimately just trying to disrupt the process. Meanwhile, communities that ought to be served by the initiative are often left standing around watching their value as people or rights to participate equally being thrown around as an abstract subject of ideological argument.<p>Without any better options, people double down on the original idea because it was at least made in good faith.<p>It might sound like all of that is an argument against DEI statements- after all, I just spent several paragraphs talking about why it would be hard to have a reasonable good faith debate about it. Still, I think that in this situation they serve a couple of useful purposes. First, I think that it moves discussions around concrete improvements away from a forum where they can be undermined by bad faith arguments and toward a form where individual authors of DEI statements can focus on concrete actions. It incentivizes action over getting mired in these bad faith arguments. If one is to write specifically about how they have or will work to improve DEI, then they necessarily must move past the bad faith and concern trolling arguments and pick some specific actions. Second, I think that it acts as a useful honeypot for people who simply can&#x27;t act in good faith. If you can&#x27;t identify any dimension at all along which you will work to improve DEI for any group, then it&#x27;s hard to see how you can further that part of the mission of an organization.

I imagine that some of that is direct benefit when someone is able to pull on their experiences to directly benefit a project, and some of it is simply that teams who hire the best people without artificial barriers will both be better and tend to be more diverse.<p>That’s observational rather than prescriptive though. When it comes to individual teams and individual hiring decisions I’d never advocate for anything other than hiring the best available candidate. Similarly, while you can say that across the population having diversity is good, you shouldn’t assume any specific part of an individual’s background or experience should manifest in any particular way.<p>All that said, I do think understanding the general ways that different aspects of a persons background impacts their work experience is a necessary part of building an effective workforce.

You&#x27;ve correlated this with your Bangladeshi heritage and upbringing, and you&#x27;ve said (again paraphrasing) that you adamantly seek to instill the same values in your own kids.<p>Perhaps some teams would find your values a useful addition to their mix.

The chair wanted me to meet a third-year law student who was at the firm for interviews. The recruiting chair said that the law student, like me, was a former Navy &quot;nuke&quot; officer. We shook hands; I asked, &quot;<i>[chief]</i> engineer-qualified?&quot; He smiled and nodded. &quot;Surface-warfare qualified?&quot; The same. I turned to the recruiting chair and said &quot;that&#x27;s all I need to know; I&#x27;m good.&quot; I had both quals myself, so I immediately concluded — provisionally — that the student was very likely to have personal qualities (work ethic, leadership, etc.) that I knew law firms found to be valuable. (I did stick around to chat for a while longer, and I knew the student wouldn&#x27;t even have been invited for an interview if he wasn&#x27;t already a good candidate.) We hired the student, who turned out to be a fine lawyer.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Walter_E._Williams" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Walter_E._Williams</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.victoriaadvocate.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;walter-williams-our-reasoning-about-race-is-faulty&#x2F;article_c752625c-bc2b-11e8-a6c0-27852eda144b.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.victoriaadvocate.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;walter-williams-our...</a></div><br/><div id="40269388" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40269388" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rayiner</span><span>|</span><a href="#40267547">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40269086">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40269019">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40269388">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40269388">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You’ve accurately described the differences, but none of those things are relevant to the workplace.

Ask Google Gemini to make pictures of the Founding Fathers or Nazi soldiers and you will understand.</div><br/><div id="40271847" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40271847" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kristopolous</span><span>|</span><a href="#40269724">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40270599">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40272216">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40271847">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40271847">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">have any citations or specific examples?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40272216" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40272216" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">philwelch</span><span>|</span><a href="#40269724">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40270599">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40271140">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40272216">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40272216">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">During the red scare, there was a movement to try and force professors to sign loyalty oaths stating that they weren’t communist.

The Handicapper General&#x27;s agents enforce the equality laws, forcing citizens to wear &quot;handicaps&quot;: masks for those who are too beautiful, earpiece radios for the intelligent that broadcast loud noises meant to disrupt thoughts, and heavy weights for the strong or athletic.
George and Hazel Bergeron have a 14-year old son named Harrison. He takes after his father, who is highly intelligent and physically strong. The government removes Harrison from his home. His parents are barely aware because of Hazel&#x27;s low intelligence and George&#x27;s mandated handicaps.
George and Hazel watch a ballet on TV. Some dancers are weighed down to counteract their gracefulness and masked to hide their attractiveness. George&#x27;s thoughts are continually interrupted by the different noises emitted by his handicap radio. Hazel urges George to lie down and rest his &quot;handicap bag&quot;, 47 pounds (21 kg) of weights locked around his neck. She suggests taking a few of the weights out of the bag, but George resists because it is against the law.
On TV, a reporter struggles to read a bulletin and hands it to the ballerina wearing the most grotesque mask and heaviest weights. She begins reading in her natural, beautiful voice before switching to a more unpleasant one. Harrison&#x27;s escape from prison is announced, and a full-body photograph of him is shown. He is seven feet (2.1 m) tall and burdened by three hundred pounds (140 kg) of handicaps.
George recognizes his son for a moment, before having the thought eliminated by his radio. Harrison storms the TV studio in an attempt to overthrow the government. He declares himself Emperor and rips off both his own handicaps and those of a ballerina, whom he chooses as his Empress.
Diana Moon Glampers, the Handicapper General, enters the studio and kills Harrison and the Empress with two shotgun blasts. She threatens the musicians at gunpoint to put on their handicaps again. The TV goes dark. George, who left to get a beer and has returned, asks Hazel why she is crying, to which she replies that something sad happened on television that she cannot remember.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40268702" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40268702" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wiseowise</span><span>|</span><a href="#40267840">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40269386">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40268473">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40268702">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40268702">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Jesus Christ.

I personally never have one.<p>On top of that, I&#x27;m not sure IQ tests themselves are really relevant to select people in the academic sector. They already have demonstrated they master their subject with their grades, so we already know they are smart enough, and it is not because someone score higher in an IQ test that this person will be more valuable for the academic sector, where collaboration and mentoring are as valuable as the holywood cliché of the genius solving all the problems. IQ does not tell much about laziness or motivation or willingness to follow the good scientific process, ...<p>Also, at this level, you are selecting people amongst a set of candidates that are all already very very close in IQ, to the point that choosing on IQ alone is not making scientific sense: if the IQ questions would have been randomly different, or if they would have passed the test a different day, the scores would have been slightly different and the selection would have been different. The scores would not have been totally different, of course, but slightly different, and because the candidates are all very close, it would have changed the winner.<p>For having been part of it, the selection process in the academic sector is very very very difficult and is very very prone to unconscious bias. When you have 5 very good candidates and you need to pick one, how do you decide? At the end, it is very often &quot;on feeling&quot;: &quot;for this person, I feel they will be a good match&quot;. It&#x27;s a fair way of choosing, because choosing someone that you &quot;don&#x27;t feel it&quot; over someone that you &quot;feel it&quot; is just very counter-intuitive. But it means that between two persons, it is often the one that &quot;looks superficially the best for the job&quot; that gets it, which is easily affected by unconscious bias (for example, you will &quot;feel it&quot; more easily with someone of your own culture), or can easily be gamed (for example, to progress, you need to build a professional network and manage your reputation, and some very good candidates are just not interested to play these silly games).</div><br/></div></div><div id="40266184" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40266184" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">6312783123</span><span>|</span><a href="#40263304">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40265738">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40268000">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40263546">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40266184">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40266184">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the authoritarian Woke subtype are against meritocracy as a concept. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postmeritocracy.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postmeritocracy.org&#x2F;</a><p>By the way, the author of the Post-Meritocracy Manifesto is known as &quot;Bantik&quot; on 1990s Usenet, there is high quality evidence on the Web that that&#x27;s correct, some of it has been removed from Google.

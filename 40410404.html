(The early flights didn&#x27;t need that because the ICBMs that launched the first people into space did so on a ballistic trajectory – they never achieved orbit.)<p>- With Gemini we figured out things like endurance (what is it like to have humans in space for weeks), rendezvous and docking (incredibly difficult), and extravehicular activities (preparation for walking on another astronomical body.)<p>- Early Apollo was focused entirely on solving multi-stage flights without humans on board.<p>- With Apollo 7 we verified the command module was good enough to attempt to send a few laps around the moon, which happened with Apollo 8, while we were still waiting for a fully functioning lander.<p>- Apollo 9 was a dry run of the entire moon landing sequence – except in low Earth orbit.<p>- Apollo 10 repeated the same exercise from Apollo 9 except in Lunar orbit.<p>- Apollo 11 is often considered the first moon landing, but from the perspective of the program, it was really just another experiment: can we repeat Apollo 10 except also make a brief touch-and-go anywhere on the lunar surface?<p>- Even Apollo 12 isn&#x27;t really a moon landing proper, but another experiment: can we repeat Apollo 11 but now also make a precision touchdown?<p>It wasn&#x27;t until somewhere around Apollo 14&#x2F;15 where the main purpose of the missions started becoming scientifically exploring the moon.<p>That&#x27;s something like 25 crewed flights at various stages of development that had as their purpose to explore&#x2F;learn about just one or two new aspects of the future moon missions, pushing the envelope a little further.<p>Granted, many of these things we have fresh practise in thanks to the space station, but also many of them we don&#x27;t.

Who wants to go back to the moon just because we can? Nobody. Assuming best intentions:<p>- People at NASA want to go to the moon to build a permanent base there. Maybe this is just to beat China, maybe it will actually be very useful to have a moon base. But that is the stated goal.<p>- People at SpaceX want to go to the moon as a way to fund Starship development, so that they can go to Mars.<p>- People at Lockheed Martin &#x2F; Aerojet Rocketdyne &#x2F; etc just want to get paid. I am going to ignore this cohort for the purposes of my argument.<p>These motivations are not served by doing what the Apollo missions did. Can you get to the moon and back on a Saturn V with a single rocket launch, making for a much simpler mission plan? Absolutely, we did it 6 times. Can you build a moon base using a series of Saturn V launches? Absolutely not. Would SpaceX (clearly the most competent launch provider available in 2024) get anything out of building a much smaller HLS &#x2F; not using methalox &#x2F; anything else that would be more practical if your only purpose was to go to the moon? Also no – SpaceX doesn&#x27;t really care about the moon. So a mission profile that is actually optimized for the moon does little for them.<p>So while I think overall Artemis is a dumpster fire of spending, I don&#x27;t think pointing at the Apollo missions is the gotcha that critics seem to think it is.</div><br/><div id="40413134" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40413134" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bayindirh</span><span>|</span><a href="#40411324">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40413039">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40413423">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40413134">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40413134">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">From my understanding, nobody is telling that &quot;We should use Apollo as-is&quot;, but &quot;why don&#x27;t we use the same spirit when we were building these back then?&quot;.<p>Everything made&#x2F;designed in Apollo are no short of marvels.

There&#x27;s less of an urgency to get to the moon, which can explain that difference in spirit that you mention.<p>FWIW I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a bad thing. Space exploration is the most difficult human endeavour, and taking the time to do it right seems like the optimal way to go. The fact world superpowers achieved what they did in a couple of decades of the last century, a mere 60 years after flying machines were invented, is nothing short of extraordinary. But it was a special time, and we shouldn&#x27;t feel pressured to repeat it.<p>&gt; Instead Artemis feels like &quot;let&#x27;s dig the parts pile and put what we have together, and invent the glue required for the missing parts&quot;, akin to today&#x27;s Docker based development ecosystem.<p>That doesn&#x27;t seem like a bad approach to me. There is a lot of value to be gained by gluing existing technology together, and if anything, Docker is proof of how wildly successful that can be. Most scientific breakthroughs are effectively a repurposing or combination of previous ideas, after all. I don&#x27;t think this is a valid criticism of Docker, nor of this approach.</div><br/><div id="40413466" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40413466" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">coldtea</span><span>|</span><a href="#40411324">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40413397">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40413506">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40413466">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40413466">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;<i>The political climate in the 1960s was far more tense than it is today, which fueled the space race in ways that forced both sides to give their absolute best efforts to move space exploration forward.</i><p>Well, money wise they now spend much more budget (inflation adjusted) it seems.

2. Learn from the past. Apollo kept excruciating notes (I&#x27;m still discovering new notes. For example, the lunar rover&#x27;s manual is publicly online).

And to me that&#x27;s related to the spread of managerialism and MBA thinking. One of the fundamental beliefs in that paradigm is that management is universal; an expert manager can manage anything. (This is in the contrast to the view that you need domain expertise to be effectively in charge of something.) I think this falls down because, not understanding the substance of the work, pure managers have to go by proxy indicators, like the polish of the presentations, the amount of confidence expressed, and the general wow factor.<p>People with a lot of engineering experience are suspicious of complex solutions to complex problems. They know the value in iteration and testing. So even if an engineer is pushing a complex solution (for resume reasons or just love of the fancy stuff), they can be reined in by senior engineers. But in the MBA mindset, a complicated solution is an opportunity to have big budgets and lots of excitement. Slow feedback loops are even better, because they can produce shiny documents, get promoted, and move on before the problems become obvious.</div><br/><div id="40413270" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40413270" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">marcus_holmes</span><span>|</span><a href="#40411147">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40411865">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40411565">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40413270">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40413270">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Agree completely.

It&#x27;s straight up invalid. The Apollo program was a national prestige program, so successful we stopped going to the moon for ~49 years and counting. At it&#x27;s peak it consumed 2.5% of US national GDP. We will never, <i>ever</i>, <i>nor should we</i> run a program like the Apollo program ever again.<p>The second problem is, it&#x27;s thoroughly dismissive of the political concerns which are the essence of the entire problem. NASA&#x27;s budget changes every 4 years. It&#x27;s priorities in fact change every year because the US has struggled to pass a yearly budget that didn&#x27;t go to a government shutdown for multiple years at this point.<p>In that view then, you get weird statements which are essentially arguments from increduality: i.e. the concern over how many launches you&#x27;d need to refuel an HLS in orbit. But it straight up doesn&#x27;t matter how many, what matters is whether you can do it. SpaceX can launch multiple Falcons in a week, is there a reason to think scaling to the required number of launches is prohibitive? - who knows, because no one ever includes a failure expectation or cost expectation, they just throw the number out and gesticulate at it a bit.<p>And that is the core problem of the arguments about the mission itself, because again, what is the goal? Getting to the moon with an Apollo style fully expendable, <i>enormously expensive</i> rocket is obviously possible because it was done. We absolutely should not do it that way again. If we don&#x27;t get there with a more sustainable approach, then there&#x27;s no point going.<p>The SLS&#x27;s deficiencies are accurately identified, but the reason for them is pretty obvious - NASA was ordered to build the SLS that way by Congress. NASA would <i>really</i> rather pay SpaceX or Blue Origin to build them the rocket they need instead, but they&#x27;re not allowed to do that - by Congress.</div><br/><div id="40411316" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40411316" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pdonis</span><span>|</span><a href="#40410872">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40411827">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40411316">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40411316">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; it&#x27;s thoroughly dismissive of the political concerns which are the essence of the entire problem</i><p>No, it is quite correctly pointing out that political concerns are <i>creating</i> a lot of problems that <i>shouldn&#x27;t even exist</i>.<p><i>&gt; If we don&#x27;t get there with a more sustainable approach, then there&#x27;s no point going.</i><p>But the article&#x27;s whole point is that this is <i>not</i> a &quot;more sustainable approach&quot;.

With the invention of home recording and all the attendant production tools, the lower barriers to entry, broader exposure due to the internet, etc., there was always going to be a vastly larger amount of music than there was 30 years ago. If the old  model had not changed, we&#x27;d still be in a world with a glancingly small number of slots on the radio charts for each genre—those are the people the average person knows about, and spends money on—and most other musicians would be broke.<p>I assume. I could be wrong. But my two points are that it&#x27;s not like the old model was friendly to artists either, and that it&#x27;s not actually very easy for me to imagine a coherent model for music that would work be equitable for all artists in the world today, given the other changes that&#x27;ve taken place.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just to pretend that if there are 4-5x more people releasing music today, we would all would be spending 4-5x more on records and concerts than we did in 1996.

The percent of the sale price going to the artist was tiny.<p>Today the distribution cost is you send it over the internet, the cost of which rounds to zero. The dominant cost ought to be the 3% the credit card companies take. And if you give the cost savings to the artists instead of the record companies, they could very easily be getting 4-5x more of every dollar customers spend.<p>The problem is, the record companies would prefer that <i>they</i> get the cost savings from digital distribution, and we need a system that ensures that they <i>don&#x27;t</i>.<p>There is also the question of what it means to make it. The artist at the top of the charts is making many millions of dollars, but suppose we didn&#x27;t have a system that props up superstars.

If the argument that it&#x27;s the promotion that makes them successful, then the argument is less correct today than ever before - the advent of the internet means there&#x27;s no more strict radio slots etc, which is unavailable to an amateur or starting musician.<p>Even if you reset today&#x27;s system - for argument&#x27;s sake, we make everybody forget all previous musicians, and start from scratch - what would happen is that those musicians that are &quot;good&quot;, measured in popularity, will garner more and more audience and popularity, leading to what looks like today&#x27;s system (but just with perhaps a different person).<p>That&#x27;s why my condition, if you wanted to equally distribute the profits of music making, is to segregate markets into small, non-overlapping segments. You will not be allowed to pay for or listen to music from another market segment. This way, no matter how good or popular a musician is, they only ever earn the maximal of their own (small) market.

Production costs are low due to advances in PC and audio tech.  Distribution costs are at the floor where the actual distribution is practically free and it is only the legal concerns that are a cost.  The whole industry currently doesn&#x27;t have a better physical value-add than the guy playing on the street corner with a money hat.  If anyone can make music then music has demeaned itself, and maybe it simply wasn&#x27;t ever a big deal in the first place.<p>Many say the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s were the best years in music, and this was the heyday of the time where if you wanted to listen to someone&#x27;s song, you had to buy their record and you didn&#x27;t really have any other choice unless you fooled around with expensive and bulky reel-to-reel tape decks[1].  Was that all it was - inability for the masses to create and distribute media without a middleman?  Not that the middleman didn&#x27;t perform a valuable function, but it was performing it for everyone who would buy records in the whole market.  Now we get to choose or be our own middlemen, and people who don&#x27;t want to do that kinda get what they deserve.<p>[1] I don&#x27;t know when the compact cassette started becoming popular - did people make mixtapes in the 70&#x27;s?</div><br/><div id="41165465" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41165465" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kmeisthax</span><span>|</span><a href="#41163440">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41163788">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41165151">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41165465">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41165465">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The actual distribution is not free, management companies take a huge cut both formally or informally. For some reason[0], you can&#x27;t just upload your music to Spotify or Apple Music directly, you have to have a middleman, and that market of &quot;middlemen for unsigned artists&quot; is just three companies[1]. They all suck in different ways, but there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of creative-class wage theft going on, even beyond Spotify just underpaying indies on rights.<p>You <i>can</i> upload music directly on YouTube, but they pay very little on short videos and music streams. And there&#x27;s also sketchy management companies and MCNs there <i>anyway</i>.<p>We also have to keep in mind that the music industry loves complicated and unclear ownership structures over the music being produced. Nobody completely <i>owns</i> a music track; there&#x27;s separate copyrights for melody and recordings, both of which get separated and broken down in extremely opaque ways. Remixes and sampling make the rights situation even more complicated, and at best, mean that the person who made the remix or used the samples has to share revenue. At worst, you get to deal with all sorts of bullshit claims (or lawsuits) from people who think they own more than they do.<p>Insamuch as cheap distribution <i>has</i> flooded the market, it&#x27;s often either in the form of attempts to launder money through Spotify[2], or online advertising style click fraud of some kind. The problem is not that there are too many honest artists, but that nobody does proper KYC on indies. Either they don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re legit or they don&#x27;t want to work with people at the small end.<p>[0] In the case of Apple, long-standing trademark disputes with The Beatles prohibit them from representing artists directly, which is how management companies got their start for self-published acts.

It was also a strongly gate-kept industry, while this isn&#x27;t the case anymore.
The main reason for gate-keeping is supposedly to &quot;keep the financial equation fair for everybody&quot;.
The problem is nobody knows most of the parameter in the equation, not even the gate-keepers themselves.
Why? Because the basis for how payments should be done, the mythical &quot;play&quot;, is gamed by bot networks.
The bot networks are used by small and big artists.
Officially, the gate-keepers (Spotify) do not releases official numbers of real data, officially to not give better tools to the bad guys (bot networks).
Of course, we know how well security by obscurity works, and it makes everyone dependent on trusting the gate-keeper, now Spotify rather than the music labels.<p>Another point is while the revolution in the distribution model happened, another one happened which is that the gate-keeping essentially disappeared.
In any case, the industry has embraced that through for example DistroKid being targeted at making a small revenue from any aspiring musician without any musical barrier. Note that Spotify has shares in Distrokid, even though they have pinky-sweared this special relationship does not give either to Spotify nor Distrokid any advantage regarding access to data from other involved third parties (other marketplaces, labels, etc).<p>To round it up, even if the parameters of the financial equations are partly released, the creative industry is known for its &quot;creative accounting&quot; (also known as Hollywood accounting).
The creative accounting lets the industry take advantage of the tax breaks that are offered to the music industry in basically all countries on some conditions, and stretch these conditions to situations that the spirit of the law normally excludes.<p>There is another incentive to lie about the numbers. It gives the possibility to undercut any viable competition to consolidate a monopoly (the Amazon method).<p>I believe that the only thing that can really improve the situation is way more transparency than we have.
The complaints from musicians are often unrealistic, but it is not their fault as they cannot have a realistic view of what things really cost.
So all they have is to try to strengthen their side in the tug of war.
Ideally we would move away from that process towards a cooperative model, but this is possible only through trust, which cannot be obtained by obscurity.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41164142" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41164142" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pelagicAustral</span><span>|</span><a href="#41168730">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41163693">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41164142">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41164142">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When I was a teen I used to download all my stuff from torrent, or DDL sites.

From those exploitative bloodsucking parasites?! Pardon my French but fuck the music industry. Do you know that, here in France, when you buy <i>ANY</i> hardware that can potentially store digital music (a hard drive, a USB key, an mobile phone, whatever) you pay a tax that goes to the fucktards of the music industry? Today, in 2024, when pretty much everybody turned to streaming. Yep. I sincerely hope they all end up unemployed.<p>I vividly remember the moment when I turned on them: as soon as I started to have income during the 90&#x27;s I used it on music. I was buying at least 5 or 6 CDs a week, I was tracking new releases obsessively and was making it a principle to pay for music. When MP3 exploded I started to encode the music I was buying, because that&#x27;s pretty much how and where I was listening to it: on my various devices. But when the music industry started to feel the heat from the Napster and Limewire alike they reacted in the stupidest possible way: being user hostile and considering their own clients as potential thieves. The various copy protection systems they came up with started to be annoying but the nail in the coffin for me was a Jay Jay Johanson album that I simply could not play on <i>any</i> of my devices because of this. I gave them the middle finger and started to download, right this moment, without remorse. I only came back to paying when streaming started to be easier and better than downloading.<p>The music industry is mostly just disgusting pigs only worthy of contempt and disdain.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41164282" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41164282" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bubblebeard</span><span>|</span><a href="#41164142">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41168818">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41164242">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41164282">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41164282">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I can relate, and I think this is a great sentiment.

But this isn&#x27;t a collapse of anything more than it&#x27;s a regression to the mean - the marginal value of a copy of something approaches to 0 over time.<p>When you hear about artists complaining about royalties from streaming, it was a very, very, very elite group of musicians who ever made money just from dropping albums. You are only hearing from the winners of the Label system. Most bands ended up &quot;owing&quot; money to their record labels.<p>(The way record deals worked, you got paid an advance for songs&#x2F;albums. But you only kept ~10% of album sales.

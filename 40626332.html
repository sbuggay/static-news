Only when there had been a single kind of ions, it would have been possible to describe the state using the electric potential.<p>All the ions move continuously through very complex circuits comprising a network of pores through the cellular membranes. Through some of the pores the movement is &quot;passive&quot; i.e. for each kind of ion that may pass through a given kind of pore the ionic current is determined by both the local gradient of the concentration of that kind of ion and the local gradient of the electric potential. This is the only place where the electric potential matters. Through other kinds of pores, the ion transport is &quot;active&quot;, i.e. the so-called ionic pumps move certain kinds of ions regardless of the gradients of the ionic concentrations and of the electric potential (within certain limits, too large gradients can block an ionic pump).<p>If you want to simulate the ionic current network of an entire organism, you must compute the electric potential inside the simulation. When you observe a living organism, measuring the electric potential is much easier than measuring directly any kind of ion concentration and in many cases one can estimate the ionic concentrations of interest from the measured electric potential and from additional information.<p>While accounting for the electric interactions inside an organism is essential, talking about a &quot;bioelectric&quot; state of an organism that would determine its development is just meaningless pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo. &quot;Bioelectricity&quot; is an appropriate term when discussing the electric sense organs or the electric weapons of various animals, where the side-effect of the generation of electric potential differences by differences in ion concentrations is exploited in such a way that the effect is cumulative over large ensembles of cells.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40627267" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40627267" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RivieraKid</span><span>|</span><a href="#40627416">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40627032">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40627267">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40627267">[31 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s incredible that the information necessary to create a human is just about 750 MB uncompressed.

So, it&#x27;s trivial to observe that you can&#x27;t recreate a cell fully knowing just its DNA, you also need the mitochondrial DNA but also other bits.<p>But there is even more than that. Imagine you had a program that explained exactly how to build a PC that can run this same program, starting from raw sand and ending up with a fully powered PC. So, if you boot a PC and give it access to a smart factory, this program will create a new smart factory from scratch that is a near perfect copy of the original smart factory. The question is: if you don&#x27;t have a smart factory at all, you just found this program on printed paper, would you be able to use it to build a smart factory?<p>Most likely, no, because the program can easily depend on certain details of the original smart factory that it was used to copy. Let&#x27;s say, it could have instructions like &quot;measure the length of original.robot_arm_7 and cut this piece of metal to the same length&quot;, or, &quot;combine the liquid in original.vat3 with two parts &quot;water&quot; and 1 part liquid from original.vat7, and pour the result in copy.vat3&quot;. This is how life works: it uses DNA to build copies of itself, but DNA can&#x27;t help you build the original base cell, that was arrived at by an entirely different process.<p>Edit: for another simple example, consider that, if some ultra-advanced alien species found a population of living mammals, but they were all female, they would be fully able to create more females of the same species. But, it would be completely impossible for them to create a male of the original species, because there is no DNA whatsoever in a female mammal that explains how to build a testicle or a sperm cell.

It has no causal power. It doesn&#x27;t generate or explain life or cells. You need an existing cell, an existing organism, to make use of the DNA, as it were. Of course, without DNA, the cell cannot proceed. So this mutual dependence tells you that they&#x27;re a package deal, and neither can be reduced to the other.<p>The second is that you really cannot get away from telos. The ostensible banishment of telos is not a scientific conclusion, but a metaphysical choice, and one that is incoherent. Telos isn&#x27;t will or desire or planning or intent per se, though these are examples. Telos is what explains why an effect follows from a cause, and does so with regularity. That striking a match (efficient cause) results in fire (effect) is a question of telos, of the match being ordered toward the effect of fire, effected and actualized by striking. The match obviously is not planning to produce fire, it doesn&#x27;t will it or want it. But it is causally ordered toward that end or effect. Otherwise, you could not explain why striking it actualizes this potential for fire. You could not make sense of any phenomena, why striking a match results in fire instead of, say, nothing or the appearance of an elephant or whatever.<p>Biology is no different, but here we can speak of higher order telos. And as biology progresses, the more difficult it is to maintain the crude mechanistic view of life reaching back to the 17th century, that is, one modeled on the machine metaphor.

A trivial example is the mother&#x27;s hormones affecting her child&#x27;s development in utero. To cause a shift away from genes would require showing that the bioelectric network is not itself caused by genetic factors. Otherwise while it may be useful as a tool to develop treatments for developmental diseases it does not change that genes are the ultimate cause of the bioelectric network itself (except as when directly manipulated by scientists).<p>Quoting Levin himself:<p>&gt;Evolution was using bioelectric signaling long before neurons and muscles appeared, to solve the problem of creating and repairing complex bodies.[0]<p>It sounds like to me from this quote that bioelectric networks are not something outside of genetics but just another important biological system.<p>It&#x27;s hard to pin down what the author is really getting at in the first place. For example these two lines:<p>&gt;genes are great, and they do contain much of the necessary information for building our bodies. But they don’t contain all of it
&gt;[...]
&gt;Levin’s point is that genes are like machine code, and modern-day programmers never think about machine code—they think about higher-level software constructs like objects, modules, and applications.<p>Yet machine code really is what is being executed by the computer. Nobody would say that the computer is really running c++, for example, or that c++ is a new &quot;determinant of structure&quot; of the program. It is completely subsumed by machine code.<p>The author is the entire time equating a set of instructions (the genome) to a biological system (the &quot;bioelectric network&quot;). However it does not make sense to equate these things in the way the author has done it (at least not without a lot more elaboration). The genes do not really <i>do</i> anything except get copied and transcribed into mRNA while the bioelectric network clearly is doing something. So it really seems more like the author should be comparing proteins with the bioelectric network. But I think here the problem becomes much more obvious – there is no other way besides proteins for biological organisms to do work. So it is obvious that the bioelectric network is somehow formed by the work of proteins, and the proteins are themselves caused by genes. The human body has within it many systems: the circulatory system, the respiratory system,  the endocrine system, the nervous system, the muscular system etc. These all exist at &quot;higher levels of abstraction&quot; than genes and some of them, like the endocrine system, play a role in development. But it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to say that these system are &quot;in competition&quot; with the genome. Even though we can use the circulatory system to transport a drug to the body that changes the structure of the body.<p>Another major difference is that genetics are continually showing their influence because the body is continually creating proteins from the genome. It sounds from the article that this bioelectric network is really only relevant at the developmental stage (if I am wrong here then I feel the article should have made that more explicit).<p>Ultimately I feel the article is arguing a bit against a strawman of &quot;genes as the only determinant of structure&quot; and is also making too vague of a claim about genes having a new competitor, so to speak.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s10071-023-01780-3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s10071-023-01780-3</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40626905" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40626905" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">webnrrd2k</span><span>|</span><a href="#40628180">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40626905">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40626905">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m about 55 now, and if I was high school or college age again, this is what I&#x27;d study.

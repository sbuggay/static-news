It&#x27;s often repeated that forging is just stronger, but just squishing steel does NOT make it stronger.  Forging a part is so much more than just smashing it into a shape.<p>Steel cable is made of pretty ordinary steel which is stretched 100s of times its original length.  That process alone makes it <i>2-4x stronger</i> in that direction. You stretch steel and it gets stronger in that direction.<p>Do you see how complicated that optimization process becomes?  The process steps are not just trying to take it to the final shape. Your piston rod needs to be strong lengthwise, so you actually want to start with a short fat ingot and stretch it out instead of one that is near-final size.<p>Think of making an I-beam.  You could hammer out the middle, making it thinner.  That would give you a bit of strength there but very little on the edges. If you instead pull the edges out, you create a long continuous stretch that will be very strong against bending.  Where, how, and in what order you stretch makes all the difference. You may want to leave extra material and cut it off later, so that your grains are all oriented together instead of tapering to a point.<p>For any moderately complex part, this process is as complicated as modern engineering problems.  With poor steel you genuinely need to understand how to foster and bring out those continuous lines or your corkscrew will unwind like playdough.

I&#x27;ve seen &quot;grain flow&quot; claiming big gains for years in various enthusiast magazines (bike, motorcycles, cars, etc) as to why components are forged.<p>Then I started working in engineering, and I can&#x27;t find any support for these claims.  For sure when a steel bar is worked down to become wire for a steel rope, it cannot be pulled to an elongation of 100x increasing strength.  A36 steel which is a basic structural steel has an elongation at break of 23% in a 2&quot; gauge length [1].  In every rolling mill I&#x27;ve been in, there is a limited amount of reduction per pass through the mill, after which the metal needs to go for thermal treatment to be annealed to remove all the cold work.  Every time you anneal the material, you completely resets the elongation (internal plastic strain) and strengthening due to work hardening.  If they do too much reduction in one pass or at too low of a temperature, it cracks the material and makes it weaker.<p>For sheet metal, there is lore about the material being stronger in the rolling direction as that is the direction of grain flow.  I have yet to find a source that can point to any large difference.  In papers like this [2] there are claims of certain orientations of samples relative to rolling direction have different tensile properties, but when you look at the tensile charts, there is minimal difference.  The yield strength in these charts isn&#x27;t reported, but all three orientations look to yield at the same point.  In this test the across the grain (90 degree to rolling direction) orientation had the highest tensile strength which is the opposite of the expectation of the forging &quot;grain flow&quot; promoters.  But the magnitude of the difference isn&#x27;t large, and is small relative to normal factors of safety in a reasonable design.<p>When designing automotive components, I&#x27;ve only ever seen forging methods selected for efficiency of production.  If a part mostly fills the envelope of a bar or plate, it is cut from bar or plate in all cases.  If there is a lot of void volume in the part, the calculation will be made to determine if the cost of developing forging tooling and development will get paid back in reduced material and machining cost.  I have yet to see the dimensions of the part change with manufacturing method, which would be needed if the non-forged part was significantly weaker.<p>And finally, a lot of forged parts are subsequently heat treated.  When heat treating steel all of the grains in the steel have to be destroyed and recrystallized. That is the mechanism by which heat treatment works.  Depending on the exact process and part geometry, this process removes or reduces the grain flow in the finished parts.<p>Having said that, the claim of superiority of forging persists, and I&#x27;d love to see a technical reference that shows the magnitude of the change from someone who has plausibly actually tested the effect.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matweb.com&#x2F;search&#x2F;DataSheet.aspx?MatGUID=d1844977c5c8440cb9a3a967f8909c3a" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matweb.com&#x2F;search&#x2F;DataSheet.aspx?MatGUID=d1844977c5c...</a>

(peening is the exception; it inhibits crack initiation by a different method.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Work_hardening" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Work_hardening</a> has an overview that talks about how this phenomenon can be either desirable or undesirable<p>the change in yield strength from cold working can be quite large, a factor of 4 or so.  it doesn&#x27;t change the ultimate tensile strength much (or at all in the case of your wire rope), but there are a lot of cases where what you care about is the yield strength, not the uts, because if the part yields by more than a tiny amount, it is out of tolerance and has therefore failed<p>(with respect to a36 steel, elongation at break, and wire rope, this is a minor detail, but it&#x27;s possible to elongate it somewhat more through rolling than you can through wire-drawing. but you are certainly correct that you cannot elongate it 100×, and wire rope is mostly made by drawing, not by rolling.)<p>there are different kinds of heat treatment, but the most common kind for steel involves a phase transition to austenite and back, which does indeed destroy the entire grain structure of the steel, losing any potential advantage of forging, precisely as you say.  i&#x27;d think this would also be mostly true for hot-forging, where steel is forged while still austenitic; the relevant grain structure for strength will be the one that the steel acquires when it leaves the austenite phase.  there are other kinds of heat treatment (more commonly used with things like aluminum) that don&#x27;t involve fully recrystallizing the metal, and i would expect some grain structure to survive those<p>probably none of that is telling you anything you don&#x27;t already know, but perhaps it&#x27;s a different way of thinking about the things you know that explains the apparent contradictions<p>as for which direction i would expect grain orientation to make things strongest in, i really have no idea at all<p>______<p>† last night, for example, i read <a

The overpressure generated by the explosive can be equivalent or maybe even greater than heavy press forgings (a 50,000 US short ton force press exerts ≈500 MN force; peak overpressure close to detonating TNT or PETN explosives can be MPa or higher [2] so depending on the geometry of the part they may be comparable) and it has the added &quot;fun&quot; fact that complex cylindrical or spherical shapes can be made very easily and accurately.<p>The only people I know who have worked with this have used it to make superconducting magnets, explosively forming either titanium or high grades of nonmagnetic stainless (A4, which has µr ≈ 1) without causing marsenite formation due to machining. This includes a major international MRI scanner manufacturer, for one relatively niche product.

It was built by adapting old USSR projects from the 1980s, and is currently underused due to competition from the other giants we mentioned.</i><p>either this derives from this longer post from 02022, or they both derive from a common source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;pulse&#x2F;worlds-largest-hydraulic-press-machines-mohammad-ali-nekahi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;pulse&#x2F;worlds-largest-hydraulic-pres...</a><p>the owner was at risk of bankruptcy in 02015: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20160809080032&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.france-metallurgie.com&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;2015&#x2F;09&#x2F;21&#x2F;erzhong-under-the-threat-of-bankruptcy-us&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20160809080032&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.france...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41312995" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41312995" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ckemere</span><span>|</span><a href="#41313095">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41311948">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41312995">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41312995">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Was reading this NYT op ed - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;08&#x2F;19&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;chris-murphy-democrats.html?smid=url-share" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;08&#x2F;19&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;chris-murphy-demo...</a> - and reflecting that the people talking don’t get that the secret sauce for meaningful labor is not just that it pays, but also the sense that it is “special” somehow, in the sense that manufacturing parts with 50000 ton press is manual labor but also remarkable because of the uniqueness of the machine being used.<p>Most discussions about trying to build industrial capacity in the US seem to focus on either our high labor costs or on the disinterest in capital to invest in low margin places. I would love to understand what time frame of guaranteed business the government provided these companies to convince them to participate, and also what other industrial processes the government invested in which failed to take off.

It&#x27;s an unfortunate legacy term for very high carbon steel (&gt;2% by weight, or &lt;11 iron atoms per carbon atom). For reference &quot;standard&quot; steel is ~.08-.18% carbon, and high-carbon steel is ~.8% carbon.<p>The &gt;1% carbon precipitates out into graphite within the steel, causing it to behave totally differently.  Less rusting, but weaker and much more brittle when solid.  Less viscous when liquid, so you can cast long and thin parts.<p>&gt; Are there different, higher quality casting processes, and I’ve only seen the bargain bin results?<p>There are, but it mostly is independent of the material.  Some turbine blades are cast as single crystals for heat stability; you can&#x27;t really cut a single crystal without introducing cracks and issues.  There&#x27;s also vacuum casting and spin casting (using a centrifuge to force liquid into the mold), which lets you cast metals that react with air or cool too quickly for normal methods.<p>Most of the variation in process is about the final form you cast into, though.  Engine blocks are sometimes cast into a one-off ceramic shell that is sprayed onto a sand form.  It&#x27;s an expensive process but it lets you do the whole thing in one step.<p>&gt; is it all very complicated and material specific?<p>It is very material specific.  Fundamentally its all about shaping the grains.  In many steels you can physically alter grains.  In others, like precipitation grains (aluminum alloys, some steels) the structure is determined by the cooling and you can&#x27;t physically shape them.  In that case you may often get a better structure by casting since you can choose how to cool parts down, while a billet will have a homogenous structure that is usually worse towards the center.</div><br/><div id="41311858" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41311858" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hedgehog</span><span>|</span><a href="#41311345">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41311790">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41312439">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41311858">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41311858">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Monocrystalline turbine blades are one of those things that make me appreciate how deep the state of the art is for a lot of &quot;simple&quot; things when you look closely.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41312439" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41312439" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pfdietz</span><span>|</span><a href="#41311345">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41311790">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41311858">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41311897">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41312439">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41312439">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The &gt;1% carbon precipitates out into graphite within the steel, causing it to behave totally differently.

Most people don&#x27;t directly see (or buy) the stuff manufactured in the US these days.  Normal people don&#x27;t buy nuclear power plants, aircraft engines, commercial aircraft, etc., and certainly not military hardware which the US makes a lot of.  They do buy clothes and various consumer electronics, and they see &quot;Made in China&quot; (or for some clothes, places like Bangladesh or Vietnam or Cambodia) printed on all those, when 50 years ago all that stuff had &quot;Made in USA&quot; printed on it, or for the nicer consumer electronics 30-40 years ago, &quot;Made in Japan&quot;.  People still might be getting a CPU for their laptop computer manufactured in the USA, but the chip will probably say &quot;Made in Malaysia&quot; because only the silicon was made in the US, and was then shipped somewhere else for packaging.<p>&gt;However, manufacturing does represent a lower percentage of our GDP with each passing year, despite the absolute value increasing.<p>I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s probably a bad sign: what other sectors are increasing?  Likely they&#x27;re things that aren&#x27;t actually productive, such as healthcare (the value received does not represent the price paid in the US by a long shot, compared to other advanced economies; most of the money goes to insurance companies and waste), legal services, ever-increasing real estate valuations, etc.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41312848" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41312848" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bradford</span><span>|</span><a href="#41312672">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41314205">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41312894">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41312848">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41312848">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  Does the US invest in manufacturing like this anymore?<p>It might be easy to argue over the exact degree of similiarity, but I&#x27;d argue that the US has repeatedly made manufacturing investments since the 1950s.

Additionally what we do have is highly capable and extremely specialized, in my opinion, leading to not really needing as many (quality over quantity). Take for example, an F35, which doesn&#x27;t really have an equal in the skies, we have over 630 of them, with the goal of having around 2500. China only has 300 J-20s which are basically a copy of the older F22. Russia only has 22 non-test Su-57s. Would we have a realistic need to build 1000 of them within a year?<p>Due to many factors, but primarily free trade and globalization, it&#x27;s unlikely that we ever see that non-automated manufacturing capacity return, though if needed we could probably mobilize the economy via the defense act to force more manufacturing capacity, though it&#x27;s hard to imagine we would currently need to.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41313856" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41313856" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bluGill</span><span>|</span><a href="#41312672">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41312894">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41312531">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41313856">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41313856">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  Does the US invest in manufacturing like this anymore?<p>No, but that is different from not investing.

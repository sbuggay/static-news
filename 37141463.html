Especially if you started at a very different stage in your life.<p>One of the toughest things that happens (speaking from experience) is that you grow an audience and that audience starts having ideas and expectations. The audience starts to feel like an insatiable beast that just wants wants wants. What used to be the joy of sharing interesting stuff turns into an obligation.<p>What’s worse, you may have new ideas, new directions you want to explore, but your audience doesn’t care. They’ve come to expect certain topics from you and they care about nowt else.  Some may even share mean words if you dare go off topic.<p>At that point you have to make a choice. Feed the beast, do your own thing and ignore the haters, stop and reclaim a bunch of time and mindspace.</div><br/><div id="37142437" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37142437" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dmix</span><span>|</span><a href="#37141968">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37142275">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37142328">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37142437">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37142437">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Or you know, you start a blog documenting a couple T72s in Syria then the first modern war happens involving thousands of tanks and suddenly Russia and Ukraine are losing hundreds of every variety of vehicle<p>An unexpected explosion in scope creep combined with a similar explosion in the pissing contest that your losses numbers are having on thousands of conversations across Twitter, Telegram, and Reddit daily.<p>That sort of commitment needs to be a very well paid job with a team of helpers.

He publicly supported Corbyn, which is absolutely not something you expect an Atlantic Council fellow to do. And as I said, he refused to defend a certain political movement in Ukraine (I seemed to get flagged for calling them what they are, and what Higgins has called them too...), right when most of the press got busy &quot;nuancing&quot; what they&#x27;d written earlier on then.

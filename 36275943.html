Other details, if they didn’t relate to her or her interests, were forgotten: once, she was asked to close her eyes and recall what her two interviewers, who she’d spent several hours with that day, were wearing – she couldn’t.”<p>This is very interesting.

Aside from ruining intimate, family, professional, and casual relationships by trivially quoting and correcting hypocrisy verbatim, and having an encyclopedia of cringe that keeps me from sleeping in peace and being a wreck when I get to address a crowd or do anything else that can make me the center of attention, I have to say that the most intense way in which you have a sense of loss and mortality comes from the realization that you are losing your gift and your mind is always filling in the memory gaps and you have a lifetime of knowing that you will find the perfect answer to the question of how you remember the past and instead of the answers you seek being unknown to you, you have invented a particular piece of history that never happened. It hurts and you have to be careful not to make a mistake and writing down important things is something that I started doing in my 40s. For all of my education, I remembered everything and never relied on notes. I finished a bachelor&#x27;s degree and I never had a notebook. Just a calender. Fun fact: calendars are like an table of contents that point me to information. Another fun fact: I don&#x27;t make a clear distinction between me and other people speaking, and have an easy time extracting and storing meaning from conversation or lecture or videos with info.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36278627" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36278627" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dang</span><span>|</span><a href="#36279262">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36278627">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36278627">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Related:<p><i>Total recall: the people who never forget</i> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30391218">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30391218</a> - Feb 2022 (2 comments)</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

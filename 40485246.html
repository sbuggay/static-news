Sorry to welcome you to the club nobody wants to join. And congratulations for making it this far. And bravo for setting such an example fighting on others&#x27; behalf. I&#x27;d like to do more of that myself. My prognosis was similarly grim: median life expectancy of 18 months, 5-year survival rate of 10%. That was more than 11 years ago. My point is that nobody knows what will happen. 
If hearing more about my story might be helpful, or if I could send you one or two books that helped me the most, please just let me know. No pressure. In any case, know you&#x27;re not alone, you&#x27;re loved, and you&#x27;re profoundly connected to the broader family of cancer survivors. It&#x27;s a strange and terrible gift, to be confronted with your mortality.

Probably someone else&#x27;s comprehensive essay and guide exists <i>somewhere</i>, given how big the Internet is, but I&#x27;ve never seen it.<p>Without having had this kind of experience, I think it&#x27;s difficult to understand just how difficult and not-user-friendly the clinical-trial process is. If we can help move the needle on that, we might dramatically reduce the number of people who are in a position like mine.

My understanding is an underage teen who takes a nude selfie and sends it can be charged with distributing &quot;child porn.&quot; This is a serious problem and should not be true. If other people forward it, they should be charged, but a teenager should not get in legal trouble for making a nude selfie and sending it privately.<p>B. We need to culturally get over a lot of our hangups about certain things. His girlfriend was attending church. The church should be telling kids &quot;This is not worth killing yourself over.&quot;<p>C. We somehow need to come up with reasonable accommodation for the reality that teens have phones and budding sexualities and these two things are colliding horrifically in a legal and cultural system strongly rooted in assuming &quot;child porn&quot; is made solely by abusive adults and not willingly by underage teens who don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big deal at the time the photo is snapped.<p>Taking a nude selfie should be safer than baring your body in person. No risk of STDs or pregnancy are involved. And yet we&#x27;ve turned it into this hugely dangerous thing for anyone who hasn&#x27;t spent years thinking about sexual morality who isn&#x27;t prepared to say to law enforcement and the world &quot;Nudes of me? Big fucking deal.&quot;<p>No idea how to further any of those things, but this is hardly the first article I&#x27;ve read about teen selfies being involved in extreme levels of harsh consequences that I just think morally should not happen and I think have roots in cultural and legal stuff going bad places in part because we aren&#x27;t keeping up with the times.</div><br/><div id="40062061" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40062061" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">orthoxerox</span><span>|</span><a href="#40060862">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40061312">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40062061">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40062061">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; C.

It&#x27;s like the difference between saying &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t have sex until you are a responsible adult&quot; vs &quot;I honestly don&#x27;t recommend that you have sex at this age, but if you do, here&#x27;s how to do it safely and responsibly&quot;.<p>Teaching kids &quot;don&#x27;t send naked pictures of yourself to other people&quot; is one thing, but if they look around and see their peers sext with each other with no real repercussions, this warning will fall on deaf ears. They will file it next to &quot;don&#x27;t drink until you&#x27;re 21&quot;.<p>On the other hand, if you start tailoring this message into something like, &quot;sexting is a bad idea, don&#x27;t do it, especially if you don&#x27;t know the other person or don&#x27;t trust them 100%; if you do sext, here&#x27;s how to minimize the impact of cyberbullying or blackmail: ...&quot;, then people will loudly complain that schools are teaching their children how to sext.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40061312" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40061312" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anal_reactor</span><span>|</span><a href="#40060862">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40062061">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40061148">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40061312">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40061312">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve noticed that the so-called &quot;public opinion&quot; is only getting more prude, and the denial about teenagers having sex drive is only getting worse.

Sanctions are effectively an act of war, just instead of shooting people and risking your own troops, you have your enemy&#x27;s civilian population starve and shoot each other. This can be justified in some situations, possibly like the one you refer to; but it&#x27;s definitely not an action to take lightly.<p>Ironically, in the originally proposed case of blocking Facebook, this is a bit of a &quot;cut off your nose to spite your face&quot; situation. How many small and medium businesses rely on Facebook as their main, or only, customer acquisition, communication and&#x2F;or sales channel? For many countries, banning Facebook out of the blue would cause some serious economic issues and lead to plenty of actual suffering of innocent people.<p>(And yes, businesses will adapt, but let&#x27;s not forget that adaptation in nature only ever means that the survivors of a mass die-off have more resources to use to bounce back.

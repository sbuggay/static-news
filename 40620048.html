Insurance, assuming the fee isn&#x27;t too high, increases your utility of money while gambling decrease it.<p>If there is an event that happens 1 time in 100 that costs you $100k and you pay  $1.05k to insure against that would have a negative expected value in money terms but positive expected value in utility of money terms. It&#x27;s hard to model utility of money curve, economists often use logarithm for convenience (it&#x27;s easy to do math on logarithms) but whatever the specifics we know the function is concave. No one rational is going to flip a coin for their net worth or any significant part of it for example.<p>With this in mind insurance is a service worth paying for as long as the fee is lower than utility you gain from it. In a theoretical case that the fee is 0, that is expected value of money when taking the insurance is 0 you should always take it. In the opening example of 1 in 100 event that would be $1k USD fee.<p>Gambling is the opposite: you voluntarily stake money on event that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise affect your financial situation. This decreases combined utility of you and your counter-party. Utility is higher if you both have $1000 than if one of you have $0 and the other $2000 for example.<p>Gambling, like excessive drinking or other activities that hurt the population as a whole is viewed as immoral by many moral systems. I think it&#x27;s hard to argue against that - the more gambling there is the worse off the population is going to be. Not so with insurance.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40620236" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40620236" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Almondsetat</span><span>|</span><a href="#40622803">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40622626">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40620236">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40620236">[98 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Insurance is different from gambling because if you pay and things go well, things go well. If you pay and things go badly, things go a lot less badly.<p>In fact, insurance is the exact opposite of gambling. Gambling is all about risking it all. It&#x27;s an activity that sits at the extremes of the bell curve. You win it all, you lose it all. Insurance on the other hand is a small price you pay that, through statistics, allows you move your odds from the ends of the bell curve towards the center. If you win, you win a bit less because you have to take into account the Insurance money you spent. If you lose, you lose less because the insurance premiums will kick in.<p>Basically, insurance is a PID controller.</div><br/><div id="40621938" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40621938" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sholladay</span><span>|</span><a href="#40620236">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40620683">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40621938">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40621938">[14 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So far, I have made use of my car insurance policy two times. Each time I regretted it. First was for a rodent that somehow got into the space between the roof and the headliner, then died and made a mess. The second was for hitting a pothole at highway speed, which damaged a wheel and its control arm.<p>In both cases, the insurance company paid the minimum they had to. For the rodent, sure they paid for the ceiling to be disassembled, fixed up, and reassembled. But did they pay for the interior detail that was necessary because of the rodent guts that had dripped from the ceiling? No, of course not.<p>For the pothole, they paid for the wheel and control arm replacement and even one new tire. But did they help me pay for a tire on the other side so the wear could be reasonably symmetrical? No, of course not. How about the alignment I obviously  got, which isn’t strictly necessary but really should be done after such an incident and installing a new drive wheel? No, of course not.<p>Oh and they categorically consider hitting a pothole to be the driver’s fault, no matter the circumstances, so they raised the insurance premium on me. They made all of their money back within 18 months and now I’m still paying the higher rate.<p>Insurance is such a scam. The company makes a profit despite their team of employees because they always price the premium above your level of risk. If the math made any sense for the customer, the company would break even or go bankrupt.<p>I wouldn’t have insurance but it’s required in my state.<p>The one good thing I can say about it is it helps ensure victims of car accidents get their medical bills paid for regardless of the financial status of the driver.</div><br/><div id="40622989" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40622989" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">infecto</span><span>|</span><a href="#40620236">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40621938">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40622100">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40622989">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40622989">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Of course insurance companies need to make a profit.

A casino game, on the other hand, would not be acceptable as someone may gain (over and above the fun value) while having fun.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40622626" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40622626" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ccppurcell</span><span>|</span><a href="#40620236">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40622788">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40622626">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40622626">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This article is really interesting and explains the common origins of gambling and insurance, I had no idea that Lloyds of London began as essentially a gambling ring (and before that a coffee shop, another fascinating topic in the history of London and Paris especially and the world in general).

If the risk is incorrect then it is garbage-in garbage-out. Due to this uncertainty, people tend to use fractional Kelly criterion.<p>For a car example, my current car price is a significant proportion of my total wealth and the risk of totalling it is perceived by me to be high, so I pay insurance. I say perceived because in 15 years of driving I never totalled a car.<p>But now that I understand the Kelly criterion I will account for how expensive it is proportionately to my wealth and figure the cutoff price where I need to get total coverage insurance and how much it costs.

Maybe. But it&#x27;s quite different from gambling in a US casino (and I presume UK casino).<p>In the US, &quot;gambling&quot; refers to wagers placed at known odds, sometimes against other players; legal gambling has limitations on how much money the House can take: e.g. if a casino &quot;wins&quot; $100, they must also pay $80 to someone.<p>Again in the US, &quot;insurance&quot; (excepting health &quot;insurance&quot;, which is mostly not insurance) is someone paying a regular premium and the insurer promising to pay if certain events happening to the person, with the government requiring that the insurer keep financial reserves to pay out claims. If you stop paying your premiums, you lose your insurance. If the insured events never happen, the insurer keeps your money.<p>In a sense, insurance is a type of gambling, but closer to buying an umbrella in the morning in case it rains in the afternoon.<p>Financial derivatives were portrayed as insurance but were not regulated as such, and the banks did not keep reserves to pay them out; because folks were also taking &quot;insurance&quot; against events that happened to third-parties (i.e. not themselves) it looks a lot like gambling (though they weren&#x27;t regulated as that, either).<p>I highly recommend the film &quot;The Big Short&quot; to explain the 2008 financial crisis in fairly plain terms. (I finally picked up the book but it&#x27;s in the queue on my shelf.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="40620528" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40620528" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anonbanker</span><span>|</span><a href="#40620922">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40620528">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40620528">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you know what a Tontine[1] is, you&#x27;ll understand there really is no difference between Insurance and Gambling.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tontine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tontine</a></div><br/><div id="40621054" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40621054" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rundmc</span><span>|</span><a href="#40620528">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40621054">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40621054">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well insurance is in case something you don&#x27;t want happens (die young) whereas a tontine is in case something you do want (live long) happens.<p>I&#x27;d call that a major difference but then again I&#x27;m biased.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

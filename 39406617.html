Like I just woke up in a movie.<p>I&#x27;ve learned to accept the situation, and realize that we can&#x27;t really predict what will happen so I just try be the best, happiest parent I can to my kids that I can. But I never anticipated the &quot;along for the ride&quot; feeling I have now. Financially planning for 3 years ahead seems quite impossible as I have no idea what type of employment will or will not exist then.<p>It <i>seems</i> like our careers could just be snuffed out instantly with little recourse available.

Nature gives us a world in which &quot;he who does not work, does not eat&quot; is a rule of law.<p>Human beings--especially modern ones--assign worth quite differently, and I think that you and I would agree that morally, the way we refer to &quot;worth&quot; in our modern context is the correct framing. But you cannot deny your own biology, no matter how much the modern world insists that you can. You are evaluated according to nature&#x27;s standards of &quot;worth,&quot; (the worth that it imposes onto our psyche) and then secondarily, according to our own set of invented standards.

Right now we have LLMs and they&#x27;re a very far cry from any form of AI that could replace a software engineer wholesale. In my little corner of the software engineering universe I have not seen any credible hiring manager say they were going to fire developers and replace them with LLMs (I have seen this threat from one or two of the <i>least</i> credible and <i>least</i> successful hiring managers I know, which I think speaks volumes).<p>Here is what I would worry about, as a software engineer if you are not using an LLM as part of your workflow and using it well, yeah you may ultimately lose your job and you may even deserve to lose it. Despite their flaws they&#x27;re immensely powerful simply because they represent a whole new class of tooling. The tools in this industry change all the time and you never get to stop learning, this is just another example.<p>But how someone could look at all this and have it factor into their decisions about whether to have children... is beyond me. I think that person has to be living in the realm of speculative fiction, not in the present material universe. We don&#x27;t have AI. We don&#x27;t really have a clear path to the general AI that would be a thing you could just swap in for a random employee. I don&#x27;t know who this chick is who wrote this article, I hate to throw shade but she&#x27;s like a young mother who thinks about things and is worried? What is her specific experience with hiring and with AI? &quot;Fire and replace with AI&quot; is not a real hiring trend.<p>I don&#x27;t even think the software industry as we know it is under threat... I think LLMs might 10x our productivity when we iron out the kinks but the demand for more software in the world will simply grow with them. I am referring to Marc Andreessen&#x27;s observation about a decade ago that &quot;software is eating the world,&quot; this is still the case, there is no sign that the demand for software is declining, if anything it&#x27;s increasing, so if we learn to make software cheaper with robot helpers it&#x27;s unlikely the dev job market is going to be decimated (sure maybe it could stagnate but a job market in the doldrums is hardly a reason to not have a kid or the start of the apocalypse).</div><br/><div id="39407558" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39407558" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">j7ake</span><span>|</span><a href="#39407091">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39407307">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39407383">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39407558">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39407558">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">LLMs do not need to replace a software engineer wholesale for engineers to be worried.<p>Even if half of the junior software engineering positions become obsolete because of LLMs, it’s already a huge issue for the entire profession.<p>Of course if you’re in the top of your profession, there’s nothing to worry.

It&#x27;s us who will suffer most from it. Remember when you were young and had to explain your parents over and over again how the remote worked? Your kid is going to do that to you. Not explaining remote, but explaining the new world, which is going to be completely foreign to you but native to them. I already see these dynamics, and I&#x27;m someone who is in tech.

He is already actively undermining Article 5 of the NATO charter. Casting any doubt on Article 5 pretty much makes it worthless. Once that happens, dominos might start to fall. With the US out, Putin will try poking at some countries that are hard to defend (Baltic states) or countries that people in Western Europe might not want to sacrifice their lives for because they feel less connected (Bulgaria, Romania). A bewildered Europe that will feel deserted by the US will be too occupied with its own issues or even strengthen ties to China (who still have Russia on a leash to some extend). China might feel more emboldened about the collapse of traditional pacts and try to attack Taiwan, etc.<p>Not saying that this is the way it will play out, but there is a very large risk of slipping into a world war, especially if the US becomes more isolationist.

You’ve likely heard this sentiment before but it’s the right one so I’ll be the one to post it today: your job is not your purpose, and the economy is not the society. Obviously your whole comment is well founded and relatable, but I think this is the only cure for your anxieties. The world is a beautiful, beautiful place, with many more wonders to offer than the typical laborer is accustomed to. If we eventually have a society where everyone is happy with what they have and there’s no work left to do, that would be a cause for celebration IMO.<p>This is all assuming that the intelligence explosion people are wrong.

The jobs at most risk from AI are “anonymous” ones in which the creator of the work is unknown to its consumer. Writing, in a professional context, is a good example. Do you know who wrote the text on Amazon product pages? Probably not.<p>What is less at risk are charisma-based occupations, like actors or YouTubers.

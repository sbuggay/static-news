Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom is to the written works of Lewis Carroll and J.M. Barrie as the command-line interface is to the GUI. The message of one medium is audiovisual spectacle and immersive experience; the other, cold intellectualism demanding participation from the reader to paint a picture in his mind&#x27;s eye through the interpretation of raw text, words on a screen, or a piece of paper.<p>&gt; But this is precisely the same as what is lost in the transition from the command-line interface to the GUI.<p>&gt; Why are we rejecting explicit word-based interfaces, and embracing graphical or sensorial ones--a trend that accounts for the success of both Microsoft and Disney?<p>&gt; But we have lost touch with those intellectuals, and with anything like intellectualism, even to the point of not reading books any more, though we are literate.<p>Elsewhere [0] I have called this concept &quot;post-literacy,&quot; and this theme pervades much of Stephenson&#x27;s work - highly technologically advanced societies outfitted with molecular assemblers and metaverses, populated by illiterate masses who mostly get by through the use of pictographs and hieroglyphic languages (emoji, anyone?). Literacy is for the monks who, cloistered away in their monasteries, still scribble ink scratchings on dead trees and ponder &quot;useless&quot; philosophical quandaries.<p>The structure of modern audiovisual media lends itself to the immediate application of implicit bias. On IRC, in the days of 56k before bandwidth and computer networks had developed to the point of being able to deliver low-latency, high definition audio and video, perhaps even for &quot;real-time&quot; videoconferencing, most of your interactions with others online was mediated through the written word. Nowhere here, unless some party chooses to disclose it, do race, gender, accent, physical appearance, or otherwise, enter into the picture and possibly cloud your judgment of who a person is - or, more importantly, the import of their words, and whether or not they are correct, or at least insightful; consider Turing&#x27;s &quot;Computing Machinery and Intelligence&quot; paper which first introduced what is now called the &quot;Turing test,&quot; and how it was designed to be conducted purely over textual media as a written conversation, so as to avoid clouding the interrogator&#x27;s judgment of who is the man, and who is the machine.<p>&gt; The only real problem is that anyone who has no culture, other than this global monoculture, is completely screwed. Anyone who grows up watching TV, never sees any religion or philosophy, is raised in an atmosphere of moral relativism, learns about civics from watching bimbo eruptions on network TV news, and attends a university where postmodernists vie to outdo each other in demolishing traditional notions of truth and quality, is going to come out into the world as one pretty feckless human being.<p>Moreover, the confusion of symbols for reality, the precession of digitized, audiovisual content from a mere representation to more-than-real, digital hyperreality (since truth and God are all dead and mere hallucinations of large-scale societal structures), leads people to mistake pixels on a screen for actual objects; influencers, videos, and YouTube personalities for actual people; or words from ChatGPT as real wisdom and insight - much in the same way that Searle&#x27;s so-called &quot;Chinese room&quot; masquerades as an actual native speaker of Mandarin or Cantonese.<p>&gt; So many ignorant people could be dangerous if they got pointed in the wrong direction, and so we&#x27;ve evolved a popular culture that is (a) almost unbelievably infectious and (b) neuters every person who gets infected by it, by rendering them unwilling to make judgments and incapable of taking stands.<p>&gt; It simply is the case that we are way too busy, nowadays, to comprehend everything in detail.<p>Moreover, the structure of modern short-form, upvote-driven media, lends itself to the production of short-form messages and takes with laughably small upper bounds on the amount of information they can contain. In a similar manner to &quot;you are what you eat,&quot; you think similarly to the forms of media you consume - and one who consumes primarily short-form media will produce short-form thoughts bereft of nuance and critical thinking, and additionally suffer from all the deficits in attention span we have heard of as the next 10-second short or reel robs you of our concentration, and the next, and the next...<p>Beyond the infectious slot machine-like dopamine gratification of the pull-to-refresh and the infinite doomscroll, the downvote has become a frighteningly effective means of squashing heterodoxy and dissent; it is only those messages that are approved of and given assent to by the masses that become visible on the medium. Those who take a principled stand are immediately squashed down by the downvote mob, or worse, suffer from severe censure and invective by the hands of those zealous enforcers of orthodoxy.<p>The message of modern social media is bias based on the way people look or sound, and short-form takes that genuflect to the orthodox thought clergy. To achieve a real shift in the way people communicate and the kind of thoughts they can have will require a complete overhaul of our media and interfaces - and preferably one that again elevates literacy and the written word as paramount.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39990133">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39990133</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41085326" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41085326" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">willguest</span><span>|</span><a href="#41085341">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084948">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41085326">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41085326">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Shouldn&#x27;t this be written in Latin?</div><br/></div></div><div id="41084948" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41084948" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yetihehe</span><span>|</span><a href="#41085326">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084966">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41084948">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41084948">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My favourite part explaining how unix&#x2F;linux users feel regarding windows: &#x27;THE HOLE HAWG OF OPERATING SYSTEMS&#x27;.<p>This essay should be a mandatory reading for all CS students and anyone wanting to call himself hacker.</div><br/><div id="41085029" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41085029" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">raldi</span><span>|</span><a href="#41084948">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084966">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41085029">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41085029">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, and the part about Reagan.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41084966" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41084966" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hgyjnbdet</span><span>|</span><a href="#41084948">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41085258">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41084966">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41084966">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Me: seems like my sort of thing.<p>Me: navigate to linked website, see wall of text.<p>Me: <i>clicks reading mode</i><p>Me: *193 - 245 minutes*<p>Me: <i>bookmark to read later; probably not</i></div><br/><div id="41085026" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41085026" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sshine</span><span>|</span><a href="#41084966">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41085005">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41085026">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41085026">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It’s a short novel.<p>Putting it in a browser window gives it bad odds.

The mass of the proton, the strength of gravity, the range of the weak nuclear force, and a few dozen other fundamental constants completely determine what sort of universe will emerge from a Big Bang. If these values had been even slightly different, the universe would have been a vast ocean of tepid gas or a hot knot of plasma or some other basically uninteresting thing--a dud, in other words. The only way to get a universe that&#x27;s not a dud--that has stars, heavy elements, planets, and life--is to get the basic numbers just right. If there were some machine, somewhere, that could spit out universes with randomly chosen values for their fundamental constants, then for every universe like ours it would produce 10^229 duds.<p>Though I haven&#x27;t sat down and run the numbers on it, to me this seems comparable to the probability of making a Unix computer do something useful by logging into a tty and typing in command lines when you have forgotten all of the little options and keywords. Every time your right pinky slams that ENTER key, you are making another try. In some cases the operating system does nothing. In other cases it wipes out all of your files. In most cases it just gives you an error message. In other words, you get many duds. But sometimes, if you have it all just right, the computer grinds away for a while and then produces something like emacs. It actually generates complexity, which is Smolin&#x27;s criterion for interestingness.<p>Not only that, but it&#x27;s beginning to look as if, once you get below a certain size--way below the level of quarks, down into the realm of string theory--the universe can&#x27;t be described very well by physics as it has been practiced since the days of Newton. If you look at a small enough scale, you see processes that look almost computational in nature.<p>I think that the message is very clear here: somewhere outside of and beyond our universe is an operating system, coded up over incalculable spans of time by some kind of hacker-demiurge. The cosmic operating system uses a command-line interface. It runs on something like a teletype, with lots of noise and heat; punched-out bits flutter down into its hopper like drifting stars. The demiurge sits at his teletype, pounding out one command line after another, specifying the values of fundamental constants of physics:<p>universe -G 6.672e-11 -e 1.602e-19 -h 6.626e-34 -protonmass 1.673e-27....<p>and when he&#x27;s finished typing out the command line, his right pinky hesitates above the ENTER key for an aeon or two, wondering what&#x27;s going to happen; then down it comes--and the WHACK you hear is another Big Bang.</i></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41085258" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41085258" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">KingOfCoders</span><span>|</span><a href="#41084966">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41085049">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41085258">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41085258">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In the beginning was a switch.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41085049" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41085049" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">inciampati</span><span>|</span><a href="#41085258">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41085082">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41085049">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41085049">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I read this during my university graduation ceremonies.

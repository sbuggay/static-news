Of course we take away the devices, but that just leads to them bemoaning their screen less state. One of the problems is, this is taught in the schools. Pretty much every class is using screens constantly. Our local school district recently experienced a hack that made it so they couldn’t use chromebooks for a few days. All the teachers lesson plans were completely centered around devices, so the kids just watched movies all day instead.</div><br/><div id="38371336" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38371336" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thebradbain</span><span>|</span><a href="#38370797">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38370961">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38371336">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38371336">[23 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But would you let them?

As for friend&#x27;s parents, we live in a walkable urban neighborhood (we chose this), and yes, kids do this all the time.<p>&gt; My guess is probably not. And that’s not the kids’ doing— that’s OUR doing.<p>It&#x27;s parent&#x27;s doing both because of their regulations. It&#x27;s also parent&#x27;s doing because parents choose to live in suburbia &#x2F; pay a premium to do so. If parents paid premiums to live in dense urban neighborhoods, more would be built &#x2F; development patterns would change.<p>It&#x27;s weird. As I said... we live in an inner city (we&#x27;re 1.5 miles from downtown core of our west coast city). You&#x27;d think our streets were busy, but ... they&#x27;re less busy than the suburban street I grew up in. Here&#x27;s the difference.. in a city. Few people drive. There are certainly main thoroughfares that are very crowded (my kids are not allowed to cross the large streets themselves). But within our neighborhood, bounded by large streets, the streets are really tiny and there&#x27;s few drivers. My house is actually quieter than the suburban street I grew up on. It&#x27;s silent at night. Cars are the noise, not people. People are quiet.<p>So that is to say... Yes it&#x27;s parents fault.

Contrast with reading on an app like Libby (free, no bookshelves), playing Minecraft (cheap, no pack-up), or digital art&#x2F;puzzles.<p>Digital equivalents are pushed in every workspace. Scrawling unnecessarily on paper would be frowned on as wasteful in the average office.

In nearby Oregon, though, the law states the child must be at least 10 years old to be home alone.<p>Or California, which has alot of people:<p>&gt; In the state of California, there is no legal age stipulated on when a child can be left home alone or allowed to walk outside alone. There is a law, however, that children 6 years old and younger cannot be left alone in a car.<p>So for the west continental coast we have Oregon until 10...and in California if a car isn&#x27;t involved no constraint. Oregon is just one of three states with actual laws on the books:<p>&gt; Three states legally require kids to be of a certain minimum age to be left on their own for some time: Illinois (14 years old) Oregon (10 years old) Maryland (8 years old)<p>I&#x27;m not sure Maryland is being unreasonable here, but Illinois and Oregon probably are.</div><br/><div id="38375784" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38375784" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">novok</span><span>|</span><a href="#38370797">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38374342">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38374016">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38375784">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38375784">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s about being effectively illegal or illegal &#x27;enough&#x27;.

I was born, raised, and still live in Fremont.<p>Fremont has begun doing some of these trendy concepts that are mentioned in the article, but when I grew up none of these ideas had been implemented. I socialized with other kids and rode bike around the neighborhood. As a pre-teen, we socialized in the street and at each other&#x27;s houses. As a teen I was not really restricted in where to go and there are plenty of neighborhood parks and libraries to hang out at.<p>None of the article&#x27;s critiques of suburbia ring true to me with respect to Fremont. If you are seeking nightlife as an adult, you might feel it is a wasteland. But for children growing up I&#x27;m not seeing a problem. Part of that is that most of the city can be navigated without ever being on an arterial. Part of that is that most of the city was developed during an era where neighborhood parks could be mandated. Part of that is the city was master planned when it was small and they foresaw today&#x27;s population.<p>It is true children spend less time outside than they used to. Part of that is fear; when my kids were young, I didn&#x27;t trust that strangers wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if they were outside the house.

My childhood was to wake up at 6ish, watch some cartoons, and then get locked outside the house except for lunch or a snack. I rode my bike, played sports, played in makeshift forts, went fishing, and went hunting. I would show up again when the sun started going down. That was my day, every day that the weather wasn&#x27;t bad.<p>My dad usually dominated the TV during the evenings, and so my time was spent playing or reading or doing homework. We didn&#x27;t have a lot of money, but I did have a bunch of hand-me-down lego sets, and I would create Transformers and other toys with the lego pieces. My dad had old military blankets which I would use to create forts, or alternatively, mountains to drive my Hot Wheels cars through. I would just pile them up and shove my arms through them to create tunnels. And I&#x27;d play video games, but that time was limited and on a 13 inch black and white TV.<p>Was it perfect? No. My parents were emotionally abusive at times. But I had to meet my friends every day in person and I had to learn how to get along with them and their parents and families. I couldn&#x27;t just toss a tablet on a bed when I had an issue with GoatHumper666. Sometimes that was arguments. Sometimes that was fights. But we were all we had and we would make up at the end of the day.<p>Go talk to a teacher. Ask them how the kids are doing today. They&#x27;re all ultra-self-entitled.

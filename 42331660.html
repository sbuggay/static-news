And it is also pretty simple — if you don&#x27;t so anything that requires that you get informed consent from your users you don&#x27;t need to ask them.<p>Each <i>combination</i> of personal datum and purpose requires such consent if it isn&#x27;t a strictly needed purpose (legitimate interest). Example: If you have an online shop you can e.g. collect someones address for the purpose of shipping — if they order and enter there address the user <i>implicitly</i> gave you their informed consent that they agree to you using that address to ship the product to them. Logical: when they order and pay money it can be assumed they want to give their address for that purpose.<p>They did <i>not</i> give you consent to sell that same address off to the highest bidder. If that is what you need to do,  you would have to <i>explicitly</i> ask them to whom you want to sell that data and what they plan to do with it — same data, but different purpose. Not legitimate interest since you don&#x27;t strictly need to do that to sell a product. And you better have a clear wording describing that purpose otherwise you collected uninformed consent and that is worth zlich. If you feel like you need to trick users into agreeing, that is what the law aims to prevent.<p>IP adresses and such have also been ruled personal data. Server side logging for technical purposes is legitimate interest, but storing the same data anywhere (not only cookies!) for the purpose of ad tracking requires you to get the users informed consent <i>before collecting the data</i>. You can assume that if it can be used to personally identify a user in a sea of users, it is personal data, even if it needs to be used in conjunction with other data to reach that identifiability.<p>Also: if there is a million &quot;No&quot; switches with two menu layers and one green &quot;Accept&quot; button: you created a nice toy there, but it didn&#x27;t gather informed concent from your user and is therefore utterly useless. Informed consent must be given <i>freely</i>. If you make one easier than the other it hasn&#x27;t been given freely. If you visually code one as the good&#x2F;default and the other as the bad&#x2F;meaningless&#x2F;complicated choice, the choice was not made freely. Play stupid games, win stupid prices.<p>The law is pretty clear on all that, lived reality hasn&#x27;t cought up yet and people pay real money for that. I recommend that you just read the law, it is probably worth to read instead of copying what everybody else (including the big ones) are doing.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42337111" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42337111" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">qwertox</span><span>|</span><a href="#42333808">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42337606">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42337111">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42337111">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I just watched the power phone on &#x2F; off preview, and it has the issues which I assumed it would have.<p>Long-press to turn on a powered-off phone is not a standard.

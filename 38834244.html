Quite the Herculean effort (600 pages!). It just seems to me like they&#x27;re putting the emphasis on the stuff that is more straightforward to formalize rather than the stuff that would be interesting to understand.<p>Look eg at the SGD chapter. I picked this because I think optimization is one of the areas where mathematicians actually can and do make impactful contributions to ML. But then look at the chapter in the book: most of the proofs are fairly elementary (like bias-variance decompositions or Jensen inequalities), some more interesting theorems (on convergence) are cited from the literature and do not build on the lemmata, and the sub-chapters on the actually interesting methods like ADAM,... are completely free of proofs or theory. It seems to me that after reading the chapter, a reader will have a good understanding of modern SGD methods and how we got there, but they won&#x27;t necessarily be much wiser about why those methods work, other than having a good intuition confirmed by numerical experiments. If that&#x27;s the outcome, then I wonder what the fuss proving all the basic stuff was all for. Wouldn&#x27;t it be more useful to dedicate the space to convergence proofs for ADAM (which do exist) rather than showing lots of stuff like E(XY) = E(X)E(Y) for independent random variables?<p>That&#x27;s just one chapter, I may not be doing them full justice here, although I did read through a few others as well. I first got this impression from the ANN chapter, which is ripe with long proofs for rather basic and uninteresting stuff, and from the physics-informed neural networks paper (which I actually find really nice, although it suffers a bit from the same problem as the SGD chapter). I don&#x27;t want to be too critical here, it is nice in general to move towards a more rigorous and unified exposition of ML methods, and their approach should extend to the more technical results as well, just questioning where they drew the line of what to include and what not.</div><br/><div id="38839118" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38839118" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">modeless</span><span>|</span><a href="#38836345">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38837556">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38839118">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38839118">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; they won&#x27;t necessarily be much wiser about why those methods work, other than having a good intuition confirmed by numerical experiments.<p>This is the state of the field as a whole, isn&#x27;t it?<p>&gt; Wouldn&#x27;t it be more useful to dedicate the space to convergence proofs for ADAM (which do exist)<p>Convergence proofs don&#x27;t really explain why Adam tends to work better than other methods.<p>It&#x27;s hard to blame them for not being able to explain things that, currently, nobody understands.

My background is in math (Ph.D. and a couple of postdoc years) before switching to practitioner in deep learning. This year I taught a class at university (as invited prof) in deep learning for students doing a masters in math and statistics (but with some programming knowledge, too).<p>I tried to present concepts in an as reasonably accurate mathematical way as possible, and in the end I cut through a lot of math in part to avoid the heavy notation which seems to be present in this book (and in part to make sure students could spend what they learnt in the industry). My actual classes had way more code than formulas.<p>If you want to write everything very accurately, things get messy, quickly. Finding a good notation for new concepts in math is very hard, something that gets sometimes done by bright minds only, even though afterwards everybody recognizes it was “clear” (think about Einstein notation, Feynman diagrams, etc., or even just matrix notation, which Gauss was unaware of). If you just take domain A and write in notations from domain B, it’s hard to get something useful (translating quantum mechanics to math with C* algebras and co. was a big endeavour, still an open research field to some extent).<p>So I’ll disagree with some of the comments below and claim that the effort of writing down this book was huge but probably scarcely useful. Who can read comfortably these equations probably won’t need them (if you know what an affine transformation is, you hardly need to see all its ijkl indices written down explicitly for a 4-dimensional tensor), and the others will just be scared off. There might be a middle ground where it helps some, but at least I haven’t encountered such people…</div><br/></div></div><div id="38836057" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38836057" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tnecniv</span><span>|</span><a href="#38835172">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38836097">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38835301">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38836057">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38836057">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So this is a book written by applied mathematicians for applied mathematics (they state in the preface it’s for scientists, but some theoretical scientists and engineers are essentially applied mathematics). As a result, both the topics and the presentation are biased towards those types of people. For example, I’ve never seen in practice worry about the existence and uniqueness conditions for their gradient-based optimization algorithm in deep learning. However, that’s the kind of result those people do care about and academic papers are written on the topic. The title does say that this is a book on the theoretical underpinnings of the subject, so I am not surprised that it is written this way. People also don’t necessarily read these books cover-to-cover, but drill into the few chapters that use techniques relevant to what they themselves are researching. There was a similarly verbose monograph I used to use in my research, but only about 20-30 pages had the meat I was interested in.<p>This kind of book is more verbose than my liking both in terms of rigor and content. For example, they include Gronwall’s inequality as a lemma and prove it. The version that they use is a bit more general than the one I normally see, but Gronwall’s inequality is a very standard tool in analyzing ODEs and I have rigorous control theory books that state it without proof to avoid clutter (they do provide a reference to a proof). A lot of this verbosity comes about when your standard of proof is high and the assumptions you make are small.</div><br/><div id="38838874" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38838874" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aurareturn</span><span>|</span><a href="#38835172">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38836057">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38835301">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38838874">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38838874">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are there any books you recommend for deep learning that are written for developers who don&#x27;t use math every day?<p>I suppose the goal would be to understand deep learning so that we know enough of what&#x27;s going on but not to get stuck in math concepts that we probably don&#x27;t know and won&#x27;t use.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38835301" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38835301" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">layer8</span><span>|</span><a href="#38835172">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38836057">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38835286">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38835301">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38835301">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Mathematical notation is more concise, which may take some getting used to. One reason is that it is optimized for handwriting. Handwriting program code would be very tedious, so you can see why mathematical notation is the way it is.<p>Apart from that, there is no “the code” equivalent. Mathematical notation is for stating mathematical facts or propositions. That’s different from the purpose of the code you would write to implement deep-learning algorithms.</div><br/><div id="38836661" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38836661" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tnecniv</span><span>|</span><a href="#38835172">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38835301">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38836681">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38836661">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38836661">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The last part was a big hurdle for me as an early undergrad. I was a fairly strong programmer toward the end of high school, and was trying to think of math as programming. That worked for the fairly algorithmic high school stuff and I got good grades, but it made I was awful at writing proofs. I also went through a phase where I used all the logical notation and rules to manipulate it possible in order to make proofs more algorithmic to me, but that both didn’t work well for me and produced some downright unreadable results.<p>Mathematical notation is really a shorthand for words, like you’d read text. The equals sign is literally short for equals. The added benefit, as others have pointed out, is that a good notation can sometimes be clearer than words because it makes certain conclusions almost obvious. You’ve done the hard part in finding a notation that captures exactly the idea to be demonstrated in its encoding, and the result is a very clean manipulation of your notation.</div><br/><div id="38837027" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38837027" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">HybridCurve</span><span>|</span><a href="#38835172">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38836661">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38837192">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38837027">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38837027">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is essentially my problem.

The push to find the most general &quot;math&quot; setting has been an ongoing topic since the 50&#x27;s and so you can probably find what you are looking for. It&#x27;s not part of undergraduate textbooks since adding generality gives better proofs but often adds &quot;not that much&quot; to insight.
Nevertheless, the standard micro&#x2F;macro models are just applications of optimization theory (lattice theory typically for micro, dynamical systems for macro). Game theory (especially mechanism design) is a bit of different topic, but I suppose that&#x27;s not what you are looking for.<p>E.g., micro models are just constrained optimization based on the idea of representing preference relations over abstract sets with continuous functions. So obviously, the math is then very simple. This is considered a feature. You can also use more complex math, which helps with certain proofs (especially existence and representation).<p>You could grab some higher level math for econ textbooks, which typically include the models as examples, where you skip over the math.<p>For example, for micro, you can get the following:
<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;press.princeton.edu&#x2F;books&#x2F;hardcover&#x2F;9780691118673&#x2F;an-introduction-to-mathematical-analysis-for-economic-theory-and" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;press.princeton.edu&#x2F;books&#x2F;hardcover&#x2F;9780691118673&#x2F;an...</a>

There are some very minor errors but nothing that changes the overall meaning. But you even seem to agree with me in your followup: don&#x27;t rely on it, but use it. I&#x27;m only slightly stronger than you.<p>And stop all this 3.5 vs 4 nonesense. We all know 4 is much better. But there&#x27;s plenty of literature that shows its limits, especially around memorization. You also don&#x27;t understand stochastic parrots, but in fairness, seems like most people don&#x27;t. LLMs start from compression algorithms and they are that at their core. But this doesn&#x27;t mean it is a copy machine despite the NYT article but it also doesn&#x27;t mean it is a thinking machine like the baby AGI people. Truth is in between but we can&#x27;t have a real conversation because hype primed us to just bundle people into two camps and make us all true believers. Just please stop gaslighting people when they say they have run into issues. The machine is sensitive to prompts, so that can be a key difference or sometimes they might just see mistakes you don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not an oracle so don&#x27;t treat it like one. And don&#x27;t confuse this criticism as saying LLMs suck, because I use them almost every day and love them. I just don&#x27;t get why we can&#x27;t be realistic about their limits and can only believe they are a golden goose or pile of shit.

Of the such books I&#x27;ve seen, this one seems like actively the worst one.

I first off should say that by no means do I think any of these people (at least those publishing) are dumb. You can also be a genius in one direction and a fucking idiot in another, and that&#x27;s okay. Certainly describes me haha (well less on the genius side and more on the functioning idiot side. So take everything I say with a grain of salt). Don&#x27;t get me wrong, scale is incredibly important and is certainly the reason for our recent advancements. But scale taking us to AGI is fairly naive to me. The idea here has a few clear assumptions being made. First is that the data can accurately explain all phenomena if the machine is capable of sufficient imputation. I just don&#x27;t even know how to tackle this one because it is so well established as false in the statistics literature. Another is that RLHF is enough for alignment. I like to say that RLHF is like Justice Stewart&#x27;s definition of porn: I know it when I see it. This is certainly a useful tool, but we shouldn&#x27;t be naive about its limitations. Just go on any reddit discussion on what constitutes NSFW and you&#x27;ll find tons of disagreement or even the HN discussions of &quot;Is This A Vehicle&quot;[0]. Those comments are just beautiful and crazygringo (top comment) demonstrates this all perfectly. There&#x27;s a powerful inference and imputation game going hand in hand and this is the issue. There needs to be more time spent thinking about one&#x27;s brain and questioning assumptions we&#x27;ve made. As you advance, details become more and more important. We get tricked because you can often get away without nuance in the beginning of studying something but with sufficient expertise nuance ends up dominating the discussion and you might often actually see that naivety doesn&#x27;t take a step in the right direction but rather can take you a step in the wrong direction (but often moving is more important). I&#x27;ll reference Judea Pearl and Ilya on this one[1]. Pearl is absolutely correct, even if not conveyed well (it is Twitter after all). His book will give a good understanding of this though.<p>&gt; What math would you use to describe the limitations of deep learning?<p>This is hard, because there isn&#x27;t as much research in it as there is in demonstrations. I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as saying that there&#x27;s no work, but it is just far less popular and advancements are slower. Some optimal transport people really get into this stuff as well as people that work on Normalizing Flows. Aapo Hyvarinen is a really good person to read and you&#x27;ll find foundations for many things like diffusion in his works that far predate the boom. I&#x27;d also really suggest looking at Max Welling and any&#x2F;all of his students. If you go down that path you&#x27;ll find many more people but this is a good place to enter that network.<p>But honestly, the best math to get started on to learn this stuff isn&#x27;t &quot;ML math&quot;. It&#x27;s statistics, probability, metric theory, topology, linear algebra, and many specialized domains within these. I&#x27;d even go as far to say that category theory and set theory are very useful. It&#x27;s all that math that you learn for a lot of other things, but you just need to have the correct lens. There is a problem in math education that we&#x27;re often either far too application focused or too abstract focused that we forget to be generalist and have that deeper understanding[2]. But this is a lot and I&#x27;m not sure of a good single resource that pulls it all together in a way good for introductions (this paper certainly has many of the things I&#x27;d mention but it is not introductory). After all, things are simpler after they are understood.<p>I&#x27;ve written a lot and feel like I may have not given a sufficient answer. There&#x27;s a lot to say and it is hard to convey in general language to general audiences. But I think I have given enough to find the path you&#x27;re asking about but just wouldn&#x27;t suggest you&#x27;re going to get a complete answer in a comment, unfortunately (maybe someone is a better communicator than me)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36453856">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36453856</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;yudapearl&#x2F;status&#x2F;1735211875191910550" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;yudapearl&#x2F;status&#x2F;1735211875191910550</a><p>[2] I think the theory focused people do often understand this more, but that&#x27;s usually after going through the gauntlet and likely isn&#x27;t even seen by them along that journey and especially prior to the point where many people stop. Certainly Terry Tao understands how math is just models and something like &quot;the wave equation&quot; isn&#x27;t specifically about waves and far more general. You&#x27;ll also find a lot of breaktroughs where the key ingredient is taking something from one domain and shoving it into another. Patchwork is often needed but sometimes it gets more generalized (or they derive a generalization, then show that the two are specific instances of that general form).</div><br/><div id="38838289" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38838289" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">armoredtech</span><span>|</span><a href="#38834655">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38836180">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38836997">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38838289">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38838289">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">ML researchers saying they need &quot;category theory&quot; sounds like a way to try to convince mathematicians that their work is cool.

This expectation combined with a lack of understanding is what leads to cognitive dissonance. And that cognitive dissonance is what leads to the complaints about notation.<p>The notation isn&#x27;t the problem. Every field has its own notation, jargon, and conventions. Mathematics notation is very simple and terse but the underlying concepts can be very abstract. Understanding comes from a lot of mathematical practice, not a glossary of terms.

I can also jump to the middle of the document and see some notation that was defined earlier and guess what it is. Different authors might denote the space of continuous functions in a few different ways but they tend to be very similar for common objects.<p>That said, there’s a lot of poorly written theory publications out there in my opinion.

You might be looking for a different kind of book, which is fine, but I think the content matches the title.<p>Also, a book on theory is going to lag quite a bit in terms of topics. The general process is that people discover something new and interesting empirically and publish articles on it. Other people develop theory explaining why that things work and publish articles on it. Once the theory gets crystallized, big ideas get distilled into a book.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38837800" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38837800" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fourier456</span><span>|</span><a href="#38837742">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38838765">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38838626">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38837800">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38837800">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This just isn’t really a good book.

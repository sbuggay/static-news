After considering several options for anonymizing both Postgres and ClickHouse data, I&#x27;ve been evaluating clickhouse-obfuscator[1] for a few weeks now. The idea in principle is great, since ClickHouse allows you to export both its data and Postgres data (via their named collections feature) into Parquet format (or a bunch of others, but we settled on Parquet), and then using clickhouse-obfuscator to anonymize the data and store it in Parquet as well, which can then be imported where needed.<p>The problem I&#x27;m running into is referential integrity, as importing the anonymized data is raising unique and foreign key violations. The obfuscator tool is pretty minimal and has few knobs to tweak its output, so it&#x27;s difficult to work around this, and I&#x27;m considering other options at this point.<p>Your tool looks interesting, and it seems that you directly address the referential integrity issue, which is great.<p>I have a couple of questions:<p>1. Does Neosync ensure that anonymized data has the same statistical significance (distribution, cardinality, etc.) as source data? This is something that clickhouse-obfuscator put quite a lot of effort in addressing, as you can see from their README. Generating synthetic data doesn&#x27;t solve this, and some anonymization tools aren&#x27;t this sophisticated either.<p>2. How does it differ from existing PG anonymization solutions, such as PostgreSQL Anonymizer[2]? Obviously you also handle MySQL, but I&#x27;m interested in PG specifically.<p>As a side note, I&#x27;m not sure I understand what the value proposition of your Cloud service would be. If the original data needs to be exported and sent to your Cloud for anonymization, it defeats the entire purpose of this process, and only adds more risk. I don&#x27;t think that most companies looking for a solution like this would choose to rely on an external service.

Although today just PG and Mysql.<p>To answer your questions:<p>1. We don&#x27;t support this quite yet although we&#x27;re working on it for both anonymization and synthetic data. For anonymization, that typically means having deterministic anonymizers that output the same value for the same input (like a hash). For synthetic data that means using a model to be able maintain those same statistical characteristics. We&#x27;ll have support for both of these within the next quarter. It also depends on what you want to anonymize. If the values that you want to anonymize wouldn&#x27;t meaningfully change the distribution of the data (think like a name or an address and you&#x27;re not doing any analytics or queries on those fields) then the statistical distribution of the data stays the same.<p>2. A few big differences. PG Anonymizer doesn&#x27;t handle referential integrity, pretty much everything has to be defined in sql and it doesn&#x27;t have a GUI and it doesn&#x27;t have any orchestration across environments or databases. Neosync supports all of those.<p>Folks use the cloud service because they don&#x27;t have the resource or time to deploy&#x2F;run the OSS offering themselves. These are usually startups who are okay with us streaming their data and anonymizing it and sending it back to them. We&#x27;re SOC2 type 2 compliant and usually got through a security review for these deployments. Conversely, they can also just run our managed version and keep all of their data on their infra while we host the control plane.</div><br/><div id="40447728" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40447728" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">imiric</span><span>|</span><a href="#40446843">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40447065">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40446590">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40447728">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40447728">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for the answers! Good to know that ClickHouse support might be on the roadmap.<p>Re 1: Yeah, it&#x27;s a hard problem, from what I understand. I recommend reading that clickhouse-obfuscator README, in case it helps with your implementation. The tool works similarly to what you mention: it first generates a Markov model, which is then used for deterministic output with a given seed. My only problem is the referential integrity, so solving that as well would be ideal.<p>Re 2: Gotcha, makes sense. I kind of assumed that it did maintain integrity, but it&#x27;s not clear from their docs. It&#x27;s definitely more difficult to setup as well, and while I appreciate its simplicity, a better user experience never hurts.<p>Sounds good about your service then. I can&#x27;t say that I would personally want to rely on it, but I can see how it would be useful for others.

These tools were developed while used in parallel with clients that had a large number of database.<p>Referential constraint refer to ensuring some coherence &#x2F; basic logic in the output data (ie. the anonymized street name must exist in the anonymized city).
This was the most time consuming phase of the pseudonymization process. They were working on introducing pseudonymization with cross-referential constraint which is a mess as constraint were often strongly intertwined. Also, a lot of the time client had no proper idea of what the field were and what they were truly containing (what format of phone number, we did find a lot of unusual things).<p>[0] (LINO, PIMO, SIGO, etc.) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CGI-FR&#x2F;PIMO">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CGI-FR&#x2F;PIMO</a></div><br/><div id="40446813" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40446813" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">edrenova</span><span>|</span><a href="#40446590">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40448743">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40446813">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40446813">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">yeah the referential integrity and constraints part is usually the most complicated part and everyone does things differently which adds another layer of complexity on it</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40448743" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40448743" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pitah1</span><span>|</span><a href="#40446590">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40447452">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40448743">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40448743">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for sharing. Happy to see another solution that doesn&#x27;t just slap on AI&#x2F;ML to try to solve it.<p>I am also among the many people who have created a solution similar[0] to this :). The approach I took though is being metadata-driven (given most anonymisation solutions cannot guarantee sensitive data not leaking and also open up network access from prod to test envs, security teams did not accept it whilst I was working at a bank), offering the option to validate based on the generated data (i.e. check if your service or job has consumed the data correctly) and ability to clean up the generated or consumed data.<p>Being metadata-driven opened up the possibility of linking to existing metadata services like data catalogs (OpenMetadata, Amundsen), data quality (Great Expectations, Soda), specification files (OpenAPI&#x2F;Swagger), etc., which are often underutilized.<p>The other part that I found whilst building and getting feedback from customers, was having referential integrity across data sources. For example, account create events coming through Kafka, consumed and stored in Postgres whilst, at the end of the day, a CSV file of the same accounts would also be consumed by a job.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if you have come across similar thoughts or feedback from your users?<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;data-catering&#x2F;data-caterer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;data-catering&#x2F;data-caterer</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40447452" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40447452" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kjuulh</span><span>|</span><a href="#40448743">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40444727">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40447452">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40447452">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I just published our approach to pseudo anonymization and sort of anonymization.<p>We&#x27;d built a tool which can traverse data extract the pii data and put back a token into the data.

The industrialists of yesteryear tended to care about what high society valued and subsequently funded cultural projects. Carnegie Hall (essentially the top destination for classical musicians) or the Carnegie Library system are prime examples.<p>Compare that to today, where many of the newly rich are from tech or finance. They don’t seem to care at all about supporting culture or the arts, instead focusing on politics, medicine, or their own pet causes.<p>This has to be a major factor, and also explains why Bezos Hall or Gates University of the Arts seem like completely implausible things to exist today.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41727513" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41727513" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">julianeon</span><span>|</span><a href="#41728619">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41727191">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41727513">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41727513">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m reading a book called Culture Crash, which is relevant here. I also read Sinykin&#x27;s Big Fiction a while back, so you could say I&#x27;ve been reading abou the culture industry.<p>Culture Crash makes this interesting point: Did you know there used to be widely read, culturally relevant, AND Nobel Prize worthy (like actual contenders to win), poets? Unimaginable now but true in living memory. They didn&#x27;t even have to be attached to a University, financially speaking. Like your male or female co-worker might hear that such an such a poet was coming out with a new book, and buy it, and then for a few weeks the cultural conversation would be dominated by this - a book of poetry. Which people 50 years from now would be reading in lit classes.<p>The general point of these books (summarizing a lot here) is that the cultural infrastructure has been falling away for decades now, and there isn&#x27;t much left. At this point literature has been &quot;captured&quot; by the University, but it&#x27;s for a good reason: you can&#x27;t survive as a fiction writer without it. People complain &quot;but they&#x27;re so insular&quot; but the truth is: they don&#x27;t have an alternative. You can work at a University or you can not be a full-time writer: that&#x27;s your choice.<p>This is true of other industries too. Music: you used to be able to support yourself as a studio musician. You might also be the guy who was the resident expert on classical music for the neighborhood at the store, who would recommend operas conducted by Karajan and the best recordings from Deutsche Grammophone (I remember those guys). Art: you could paint signs or design posters, back when there was a real demand. Writing: you could write for the alternative weeklies (I&#x27;d read those) or be a regular journalist, writing as little as one story a day. Movies: you could be a video clerk (I also remember this). And those &#x27;subcultures&#x27; were incubators. Quentin Tarantino graduated from the video store in a sense. Who can follow him, if there are no video stores anymore?<p>So this crisis in nonprofit funding really is coming at the end of a much longer crisis in the arts in general. It should be seen in that context.</div><br/><div id="41728642" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41728642" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shiroiushi</span><span>|</span><a href="#41727513">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41728515">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41728642">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41728642">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;and then for a few weeks the cultural conversation would be dominated by this - a book of poetry. Which people 50 years from now would be reading in lit classes.<p>I&#x27;m too young to remember this for poetry, but it certainly was true for music, TV shows, and movies for long after it was true for poetry.  People are still talking about The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, various highly-successful movies from the 60s-00s (Lord of the Rings for instance), TV shows like Game of Thrones, etc.  However, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s less true today, but TV for instance seems to have lot of this still going on with people talking about various high-caliber shows like The Expense, Silo, etc.  I think poetry simply went the way of theater: other art forms surpassed it in popularity, though it still has its niche audience: New York&#x27;s Broadway is still quite popular.  And people spend lots of money on music concerts.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41728515" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41728515" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jstummbillig</span><span>|</span><a href="#41727513">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41728642">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41727652">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41728515">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41728515">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Interesting. I have insight on this one:<p>&gt; you used to be able to support yourself as a studio musician.<p>That is still true and I am not sure if it&#x27;s any less true, than it ever was.<p>For one, a lot of musicians are playing more instruments (I suspect because instrument prices have fallen) so there&#x27;s less need for a dedicated musician.<p>Also experimentation has gotten a lot cheaper: You can do a lot of recording at home. When you don&#x27;t need to rent a studio at high rates, you don&#x27;t need someone who can deliver in an hour.<p>Then, of course, there&#x27;s the digitalization of music: You have virtual instruments and you have sample libraries at your disposal. Somebody makes and uses those – but usually not the studio musician.<p>What it comes down to is that more musicians can support themselves off of making music than ever before. This part is not a crises in the arts, not in general, or at all, but a shift in how the arts are created, where and who exactly a &quot;studio musician&quot; is today.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41727652" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41727652" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">noduerme</span><span>|</span><a href="#41727513">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41728515">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41728613">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41727652">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41727652">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think the bohemians you alluded to were so much funded by nonprofits, as by the public at large. 50 years ago we had Bob Dylan as the poet laureate, more or less, of his generation. Today we&#x27;ve got Taylor Swift. Both got big record contracts. No knock against her, but if you want to talk about cultural decay, I think it&#x27;s more of a demand-side problem. The market will elevate artists who the public are willing to pay for. Yes, a publisher or a producer can &quot;make a market&quot; for something, but Francis Ford Coppola can put $100M of his own money into an art piece and, evidently, no one currently will pay to see it.<p>The idea that nonprofits should prop up art has always been wrong, in a way. Artists since the Italian Renaissance have produced most of their greatest &#x2F; most famous works for wealthy patrons, not because governments paid them to do it. (Unless you count the Vatican as a government).<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is that all art arises from pop culture, and pop culture can engender the height of artistic excellence, if the culture itself has good taste and demands quality. Or, pop culture can be a pit of garbage if the culture has degraded. This is what is meant about the transition from &quot;Ideal&quot; Hellenistic art to art which embodied &quot;Pathos&quot; around the 4th Century BC.<p>We have transitioned in the past 50 years from a culture which strives for the ideal, to one which worships pathos. That may be the mark of a civilization in decline (based on a relatively limited number of historical examples). But the &quot;fix&quot; isn&#x27;t more public funding for art that no one looks at or listens to. All great art arose from popular desire for it; you can&#x27;t force it on a population, or keep it alive if there&#x27;s no audience.</div><br/><div id="41728443" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41728443" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lancebeet</span><span>|</span><a href="#41727513">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41727652">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41727999">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41728443">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41728443">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is this really a &quot;degradation&quot; in popular taste, or is it a change in the demographics that dominate the demand side? While there&#x27;s apparently been some studies on the demographics of Swifties, it&#x27;s much more difficult to produce the same for Bob Dylan 50 years ago. My impression though is that the initial core demographics (driving the fame) of Bob Dylan&#x27;s music were young adults of both sexes, while the initial demographics of Taylor Swift&#x27;s music were teenagers, overwhelmingly female. The demographics have different interests, with the interests preferred by Dylan&#x27;s demographics being considered deeper and more intellectual by the cultural zeitgeist. It makes sense that target demographics of popular music would have been older back in the day, since buying records required some sort of record player, which was a significant investment. Today, there&#x27;s practically no investment to listen to music via a streaming service.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41727999" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41727999" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gizajob</span><span>|</span><a href="#41727513">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41727652">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41728443">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41728613">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41727999">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41727999">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes but at the same time the music industry exists as a capitalistic machine that forms public taste and interest through sheer force of marketing - it’s easier to have one mega artist like Taylor performing one huge show in every city to capture all of the disposable income for music in one go, rather than have lots of competing artists and dilution and effort to create a range of cultural product. Competition is a sin remember? The music industry understands this nowadays. “The public wants what the public gets” in the words of Paul Weller &#x2F; The Jam. There isn’t a free market of music and ideas. The market is closed and offers only a small number of products, and everyone else has to stand outside of the market giving out their art for free.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41728613" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41728613" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ykonstant</span><span>|</span><a href="#41727513">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41727652">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41727617">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41728613">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41728613">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One day I will write the longest rant about &quot;the academization of the arts&quot;; today is not that day, but boy when it comes I will make lots and lots of enemies.

Why are there only three (four-ish) cell phone carriers in the US?  Why are there only two app stores?  Three (four-ish) major music platforms?  The internet should have brought a diversity of choice that has failed to materialize because enforcement of monopoly laws in this space has been nascent and aggressively fought against.<p>&gt; Local art gets outcompeted by whatever the top stuff is among a much greater national or international population.<p>It&#x27;s the lack of access to infrastructure.  Look at ticketmaster.  You have to be this giant internationally recognized act to be able to afford the grift they&#x27;re going to apply against you and your fans.  The mid teir acts just can&#x27;t access this space without financially or legally ruining themselves.<p>It&#x27;s similar to the labor market.  Monopolies _do_ make for more efficient consumer experiences.  They completely _destroy_ the labor market to do this.  Gains don&#x27;t come from nowhere.  It&#x27;s no different for communications.  Why are there only 6 major consumer ISPs?  And look at who we let own some of them.<p>&gt; there&#x27;s also less of a breeding ground for maturing artists<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true.  There are cities where the venue spaces have been bought out and there are few places where these artists could draw a paying audience.  It&#x27;s not true everywhere though,  and in those places,  local artistry still thrives,  but they run into the next problem...<p>&gt; There&#x27;s no place to go if you&#x27;re not the best.<p>I think back to the 70s to 90s period of music.  It was _incredibly rare_ that a new artist had a &quot;good first album.&quot;  It was usually barely tolerable,  but you could see the kernel of something,  something worth _investing_ in.  Bruce Springsteen famously didn&#x27;t make &quot;good music&quot; until his third album.  Like anything else it takes time,  experience,  a little assistance,  and long tours all across everywhere to build up the fan base.<p>Once the pipeline of Talent Agencies -&gt; Production Companies -&gt; Studio Companies -&gt; Venue Ticketing got built you didn&#x27;t need to do any of that anymore.  You could literally grab 5 guys from a mall and _force_ them to be a hit in a few months.  Being &quot;the best&quot; simply wasn&#x27;t a factor anymore,  they monopolized everything,  why would they bother?  Managing &quot;the best&quot; artists is a legal and marketing nightmare.  Scumming up pretty girls and boys from malls and locking them down in embarrassing contracts is so much easier.<p>Anyways there are viable talent pipelines that still exist,  but they need real investors,  which they can only get if we break up the monopolies that prevent them from functioning somewhat properly,  as they used to.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41728097" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41728097" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bryanrasmussen</span><span>|</span><a href="#41727513">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41727617">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41727191">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41728097">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41728097">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;You can work at a University or you can not be a full-time writer: that&#x27;s your choice.<p>If you work at a University are you really a full-time writer though, you do have classes to teach.<p>At any rate there is one other choice, which would be crime.

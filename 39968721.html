Take &quot;strong men&quot; and compare them to bodybuilders. When you see a bodybuilder on stage, they look like they can pick up a car but in reality they are typically at their weakest point, as most have to get massively dehydrated before the event so they can showoff their veins in their muscles. Compare those guys to &quot;strong men&quot; who aren&#x27;t training for looks but rather to see how much they can lift. Most of those guys look out of shape and overweight and you can&#x27;t really appreciate that physique until they go off and bench 700+lbs or squat over 1,000 pounds.</div><br/><div id="39970131" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39970131" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">somenameforme</span><span>|</span><a href="#39969757">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39969860">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39970131">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39970131">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think this is all 100% true.

In this picture three years ago I was the leanest I ever was, which like the article says, looks great, but doesn&#x27;t always feel great. I wasn&#x27;t even body builder lean which would have been a new level of suffering.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve put on fat again, not as much as before, but enough to be a point where I&#x27;m happy with where I look, I don&#x27;t need to track macros etc.<p>My suggestion is use the influencers as motivation, but unless you really want to sacrifice a lot don&#x27;t try to be them. But no matter how you look, exercising has a number of positive effects and I&#x27;m very happy to have reversed the trend in my late 20&#x27;s. Even though I don&#x27;t get paid to look good at my job, feeling great both inside and outside of my job has changed my life</div><br/></div></div><div id="39969807" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39969807" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">orthoxerox</span><span>|</span><a href="#39970141">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39969752">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39969807">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39969807">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There was an article that complained that the most financially successful college athletes actually looked like fitness influencers.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39969752" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39969752" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">josefresco</span><span>|</span><a href="#39969807">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39969808">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39969752">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39969752">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Two more examples of top athletes with so called &quot;dad bods&quot;: Tom Brady, Nikola Jokić<p>Granted Tom has becomes a lot more chiseled as of late, but his time as the football GOAT is done and his time as an influencer is now.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39969808" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39969808" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ketchupdebugger</span><span>|</span><a href="#39969752">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39969928">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39969808">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39969808">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Soccer players look like fitness influencers though...</div><br/></div></div><div id="39969928" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39969928" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">michaelt</span><span>|</span><a href="#39969808">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39969819">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39969928">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39969928">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I mean, athletes don&#x27;t even look like other athletes, usually.<p>Would you expect a champion shot putter, a champion marathon runner, a champion cycle sprinter, a champion gymnast, a champion table tennis player, a champion boxer and a champion jockey to look the same?<p>Of course you wouldn&#x27;t.

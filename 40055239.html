He shoots this down. “I need to know for myself what things mean and what’s going on. Sometimes I get ideas, and I don’t know exactly what they mean. So I think about it, and try to figure it out, so I have an answer for myself.”<p>&gt; Audiences, however, must do their own figuring out. “I don’t ever explain it. Because it’s not a word thing. It would reduce it, make it smaller.” These days he rarely gives interviews, not even during the hugely hyped return of Twin Peaks last year – a show that is still debated as either the best or worst TV of 2017. “When you finish anything, people want you to then talk about it. And I think it’s almost like a crime,” he explains. “A film or a painting – each thing is its own sort of language and it’s not right to try to say the same thing in words. The words are not there. The language of film, cinema, is the language it was put into, and the English language – it’s not going to translate.

&gt; I know some people who hate his works for this reason. They want a neatly packaged story that doesn&#x27;t require them to think.<p>As someone who isn&#x27;t particularly into his work, this feels like a false dichotomy to me. There&#x27;s a middle ground between dream-like sequences that are intentionally ambiguous to the point where the directory refuses to elaborate on a single definitive explanation and everything being blatant and obvious to the point where no thinking is required, and I&#x27;d argue that trying to figure something out that does have a single definitive explanation but isn&#x27;t obvious is far more similar to what a detective would need to figure out. This isn&#x27;t to say that there&#x27;s anything wrong with anything Lynch does or with the fact that people enjoy his work, but I think it&#x27;s unfair to dismiss people who don&#x27;t feel the same way as not wanting to think at all.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40059008" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40059008" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DEADMINCE</span><span>|</span><a href="#40056019">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40056235">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40058642">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40056461">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40059008">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40059008">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; They want a neatly packaged story that doesn&#x27;t require them to think.<p>Or they want something with substance, not just dreams-via-film where even the creator doesn&#x27;t have any answers or a plan.<p>Anyone can fill in the blanks.

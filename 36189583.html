I&#x27;ve struggled with timing in general. The fluctuations on tempo, playing precise (in like don&#x27;t playing flams unintentionally when playing two notes at unison with different limbs) and subdivisions.<p>And as said in this thing, mainstream music nowadays uses all sorts of things to &quot;perfect&quot; things - most notably autotune and the &quot;quantized&quot; rythm thing. Their effects are subtle but I am almost sure even the most untrained ear can feel modern music records just sound different than at least a couple of decades ago.<p>All in all it made me realize that while mastering time keeping is the main task of a drummer, another is the ability to play loose (I recall one video from the &#x27;youtuber&#x27; &quot;the 80&#x2F;20 drummer&quot; about that) and all that&#x27;s between those two ways to play time.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-RMVRLhAyhQ">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-RMVRLhAyhQ</a></div><br/><div id="36191068" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36191068" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LeonB</span><span>|</span><a href="#36190949">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36191225">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36191068">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36191068">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m still listening to that TEDX talk - but I can’t help thinking in a few places it’d be great to sample his voice and use it on a very drum heavy dance track.

To a large extent the to-the-cent precise vocal pitch and quantized beat is the &quot;sound&quot; of modern popular music. There are a huge number of tiny decisions that affect the final &quot;feel&quot; or sound of a recording and there have been since the beginning of recorded music. Each era&#x2F;genre combo in that matrix has a different set of norms and expectations around those decisions.<p>The median technical skill and musicianship of most mainstream musicians now is just unreal compared to any point in the past that I know of. Applying those tools in that way is not technically necessary and is essentially part of their artistic statement: &quot;I am part of this moment, I am influential within it.&quot; Musicians, even popular ones, still do release recordings with a different feel, but that is making another sort of statement.<p>I&#x27;m also not the biggest fan of this sound, I like a fair bit of sloppiness in my music. But it&#x27;s a mistake to consider this either a necessary or accidental tradeoff with these tools. It&#x27;s intentional, even if it may be one of those things that most producers wish they could just not do.<p>Another factor, minor in general but relevant to the current thread. The more you freak your relationship to the pulse the more you need to be precise elsewhere to keep the feeling of mastery over your instrument &amp; performance. Being late can be in a groove, being flat can be really feeling it, being both registers as sloppy etc.<p>In the style influenced by Dilla, the beats don&#x27;t land where you &quot;expect&quot; them to, and for that to feel intentional they need to be quantized precisely so they&#x27;re off by consistent amounts. There&#x27;s flexibility here for sure and good live percussionists can push both very far. But in a recording, there&#x27;s already other pressure to nail everything to the grid so why not play it safe.</div><br/><div id="36191323" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36191323" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pfffr</span><span>|</span><a href="#36190949">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36191225">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36190238">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36191323">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36191323">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Just fix it in protools&quot; is a common phrase uttered by too many musicians to count in the pages of TapeOp as well as their podcasts, to a degree that would seem to argue against your points raised here.

The best teachers are, in a sense, history professors. Their job is to show you how to imitate the masters. In that sense, Collier might be right, given one can objectively measure whether you&#x27;re close to, or far from, emulating a given artist. But imitation is only a means to an end.

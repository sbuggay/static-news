I have personal experience with ECMO.<p>Disclaimer: I have no medical training. But I have had two loved ones in ECMO in my life.<p>An adult age 48 and a premature infant that weighed a little over 600 grams at birth.<p>The adult died after a very successful month in ECMO during routine change of tubes. Bled to death after a ruptured artery.<p>The infant survived and is thriving today.<p>ECMO is highly specialised, very expensive, incredibly intrusive and also requires large amounts of blood plasma. Blood plasma is not an abundant resource.<p>Just the cost is almost twice that of a standard, expensive cancer treatment.<p>&quot;The mean estimated total hospital costs, including pre- and post-ECMO procedures, was 213,246 USD&quot;.

(I&#x27;m not <i>defending</i> US prices - needless to say if anything is cost effective at US prices it&#x27;s passed the hardest cost effectiveness test.)  It&#x27;s also cost effective (even at US prices) for the older patient.  Honestly the cited figure of $213,000 is nothing compared to the value of a statistical life (for the infant) or a bit under half of one (for the adult)<p>There should be more of these machines and they should be in wider use.  The possible impact on heart attack mortality alone is enough to justify wider investment and exploratory use more broadly, even if the precise effects end up being smaller than that&#x27;s cited in the article.<p>This is a great example of technological change pushing the boundaries of what&#x27;s possible in health care.  (And frankly... even though I am <i>not</i> defending US health care prices, a high price for this new technology is exactly the kind of signal you want to send to entrepreneurial types, several of whom appear in the article.  If ECMO can be taken out of the ICU (by some future version of the machine) that seems highly likely to generate huge benefits.)<p>Sure, there are some moral issues to be worked out.  Those issues would be much better worked out while a bunch of patients who would otherwise died are plugged into ECMO machines...</div><br/><div id="40218786" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40218786" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nradov</span><span>|</span><a href="#40216238">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40216424">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40218602">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40218786">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40218786">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If we want to look at this purely in terms of economics then we have to &quot;discount&quot; the life years saved with a quality adjustment.

They have this case study later in the article:<p>&gt; Around a decade ago, a teenager who couldn’t be saved was admitted to a New England hospital. Like Shania Arms, he had cystic fibrosis. A previous lung transplant was failing, and his only hope was another transplant. He was put on ecmo while he waited. Two months later, doctors discovered that he had developed an incurable cancer. Now there was no way for him to leave the I.C.U. His lungs were beyond recovery, and the cancer made him ineligible for transplant. He was caught on a bridge to nowhere.<p>&gt; Some members of the medical team thought that ecmo should be stopped. Transplant was no longer possible, and ecmo machines were scarce. As long as the patient was on the machine, it couldn’t be used to save someone else. It’s also expensive; according to a 2023 study, the median hospitalization charge for covid patients on ecmo was around eight hundred and seventy thousand dollars, and prolonged cases can exceed several million. These resources might be needed to help other patients, and the boy couldn’t live in the I.C.U. indefinitely.<p>&gt; But others on the team disagreed. “He was texting with his friends,” Robert Truog, a pediatrician and bioethicist who was involved with and wrote about the case in The Lancet, said. He was spending time with family, and doing homework online. Because he could be awake on ecmo, he could still engage in activities that were meaningful. Situations like this represent a “profound ethical dilemma,” Raghu Seethala, an intensivist and ecmo specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, told me. “The technology is ahead of the ethics,” another expert said.<p>The technology isn&#x27;t &quot;ahead of the ethics&quot; as the one quote indicates. This is a simple case of some people apparently advocating for killing a living, conscious, interacting-with-the-world teenager because he wouldn&#x27;t just hurry up and die, and they want to use his resources for something else.<p>I bet those same people would learn that over 80% of people aged 70-75 reside in a home they own, and immediately come up with a modest proposal for how to solve the housing crisis.</div><br/><div id="40216540" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40216540" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">datadrivenangel</span><span>|</span><a href="#40215894">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40216143">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40216897">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40216540">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40216540">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How much work should we expect a person to do to keep another person alive?<p>At a certain point, our obligations to another person have to end.

Our acceptance of death as inevitable is a learned helplessness. Modern medicine is not even 100 years old by some accounts, and every new decade brings new &quot;miraculous&quot; treatments that naysayers called completely unrealistic before. There&#x27;s no reason to believe that humanity will need to accept death as inevitable forever. Any theory of medicine that is based on accepting that people die is dooming itself to a primitive, barbaric existence.<p>The ethical dilemma goes away if these machines become more portable and 100x cheaper, a transformation we&#x27;ve seen many times. From keeping a cat alive for 30 minutes in 1934 to humans in 1952 to days in 1971 to months&#x2F;years in the 2010s-2020s to ... what, decades? Centuries? These people are having conversations and we&#x27;re saying &quot;well we should let them die because death is a part of life&quot; -- no, it clearly doesn&#x27;t have to be. Yes, there are cost concerns, triage concerns and quality of life concerns, but those are engineering problems that we know we could dramatically improve if we actually invested significantly in this technology. I do not accept that we should not be afraid of &quot;letting people die&quot; -- let&#x27;s be fucking terrified of it and do everything we can to stop it, please. Because everything we&#x27;ve seen from medicine over the last 100 years indicates that <i>we can</i>.<p>And to those who say that death must be a part of life or (insert societal problem with shaky justification here) will happen, I ask: what if the situation were reversed? What if everyone lived forever and we were facing overcrowding or whatever -- would your solution be to <i>kill everyone</i> nearing 100 years of age?</div><br/><div id="40219959" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40219959" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alexey-salmin</span><span>|</span><a href="#40215956">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40220167">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40219959">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40219959">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Excuse me, but I do want to live in a world where death is inevitable and will choose that option at any time.

It&#x27;s that we let them die. If we are truly, brutally honest with ourselves (and overcoming denial, social, religious, whatever conditioning here is a huge struggle), much of the time, the efforts we put in to keeping loved ones alive is really often more about us than it is about them.<p>The elderly (and I&#x27;m generalizing, I realize) are far more accepting of death. It&#x27;s easier to accept that when you feel you have lived a full and happy life. Contrarily, that full and happy life often involves having the presence of loved ones, who are NOT ready to accept that their life will be - or rather, will feel - less full and happy without that person.<p>Even just simple denial is a huge thing. One of my first experiences in emergency medicine was an older gentleman, family patriarch. The rest of his extended family had been able to gather at the hospital while he was in and out of arrest.<p>A provider and support person went to talk to the extended family, who was adamant about following his son, the &#x27;number two patriarch&#x27;, and his steadfast insistence, &quot;He is a good strong Christian man, and he is going to be okay.&quot; (I say this not to mock Christians, to be clear, and also to be clear, he didn&#x27;t mean in the &quot;eternal life&quot; sense, he and the family truly believed almost that divine intervention was going to take care of things).<p>After some discussion on this, a decision was made to bring the son into the ER where we were working on his father. Seeing the hopelessness and futility, seeing his father the shadow of the man he knew, and all of that assorted detail was no doubt traumatic, but it also made it viscerally real to his son. No matter the concerted efforts of nearly 10 medical professionals, drugs, defibrillation, ventilation, we were not going to be able to keep his father alive, and there was not going to be any divine intervention. He watched this silently for a few moments, and then asked us to discontinue CPR and if his father&#x27;s organs were suitable for donation.<p>My heart broke for him. But this is a struggle we have not figured out, recently. We had it figured out, historically, by necessity, but we are complacent now.<p>Leaving aside the separate issue of healthcare costs, you can still look at the ratios:<p>In the US, on average we spend more on healthcare keeping someone alive for the last year of their life than we do on the previous decade. And we spend more on that decade than we do on the rest of their life. Some of which seems obvious, given youth, but nonetheless.</div><br/><div id="40216516" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40216516" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">feoren</span><span>|</span><a href="#40215956">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40216290">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40219333">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40216516">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40216516">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s a powerful story, but it&#x27;s simply not relevant to my argument, and I suspect the reason you think it is relevant is because you&#x27;ve deeply internalized the inevitability of death. Of course you, and we all, have: it&#x27;s been inevitable for the entirety of human existence. But humans were never able to fly across the ocean for the vast majority of our existence either, nor were we able to orbit the Earth or communicate at near light speed with the other side of the Earth. People who say death is inevitable are putting it in a special category: it&#x27;s the <i>one thing</i> humanity will never be able to solve with technology? We can colonize other planets, split the atom, develop computers and AI, but keeping oxygen flowing to the cells is just <i>forever</i> beyond our reach? No.<p>Your story is about a man&#x27;s denial that his father, currently in critical condition, would die. Yes, the probability that humanity would solve death in the hour of life his father had remaining was low. I&#x27;m talking about humanity&#x27;s denial that death is just a giant bag of problems that we can, eventually, solve one by one. The probability that humanity will solve death in the next thousand years is nearly 100%; the probability that it will be solved in our lifetimes may be low, but it&#x27;s not 0. (Keep in mind, 1000 years is <i>ten times</i> the lifespan of an exponentially accelerating medical field, not simply 1% of the whole human history in which basically no progress was made.)<p>If we had a simple, maintainable, cheap machine that could keep people alive for 100 years without a working heart or lungs, there is no ethical dilemma, and the line between &quot;killing them&quot; and &quot;letting them die&quot; becomes pretty blurry.<p>The reason this matters is that once we actually start to realize that death is a problem that we can actually solve, then we can <i>get the fuck to work</i> on it! We could be investing so much more than we are in treatments like ECMO. There should be a national moon-landing-level initiative to make these machines available to everyone.

When most people may have believed it to be a priori impossible during his time, instead da Vinci probably believed it to be simply another (solvable) engineering problem.<p>That being said, even if da Vinci had absolute certainty that his viewpoint was correct, that heavier-than-air flying machines were a factual inevitability... what could da Vinci have done to capitalize on this knowledge? Other than draw some diagrams and hope future generations pick it up, but in his own contemporary timeframe, this knowledge of the inevitable future would still be generally useless to him. It would not affect his daily life, it likely would not change a single decision that he would make otherwise.<p>Likewise, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re right, that conquering death is an inevitably solvable engineering problem. So what would you do with that knowledge, right now? Of the cases called out in the article, of people who could not live off of ECMO, how does having this knowledge of inevitable immortality that&#x27;s coming 100s of years later, how would that change the decision-making rubric today for those patients or whether those ECMO machines are better used on someone else?<p>I venture to say that, even if you knew with absolute certainty that engineered-immortality would be achieved by a known future date, say 200 years from now (though it took ~400 years between da Vinci and heavier-than-air flight)... IMHO it shouldn&#x27;t make any difference at all to the present-day decisions of how those ECMO patients should be treated today. Only if you knew the date of pending immortality was let&#x27;s say, &lt;10 years away, would you make some kind of drastic push to try and keep everyone alive barely long enough to benefit from that breakthrough.<p>... In fact, I vaguely remember reading a short story about this very conceit, of generations of humans in a fictional setting, working towards immortality, and how at a certain point, they reached a stage of awareness that, achieving immortality was likely going to happen soon in the next generation, so what would they do with that &quot;last generation&quot; of humans to ever need to face death? How would people feel, how would they react, if they knew that they were just a little bit too early to benefit from the breakthrough that might come 20 years from now?

You assert it wouldn&#x27;t have made a difference. I assert it could have changed the course of human history.<p>Leonardo would have done what everyone like him did around that time: convinced a wealthy patron to fund his experiments. If he had gotten many very rich nobles convinced as well, he may have gotten tons of money to hire lots of people to build and test various designs. We might have had heavier-than-air flight 400 years earlier. Of course, without powered engines, they wouldn&#x27;t have had nearly the success they have today, but one can imagine some pretty elaborate gliders, or possibly hot air balloons, showing up hundreds of years earlier than they actually did.<p>So I absolutely reject your notion of &quot;it would never have made any difference.&quot; The fallacy that history must always have gone exactly as it did is a common one, but it is a fallacy nonetheless.<p>&gt; Likewise, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re right, that conquering death is an inevitably solvable engineering problem. So what would you do with that knowledge, right now?<p>I already told you: organize a nation-wide (or international) Moon-landing level effort to make ECMO machines 100x cheaper, more portable, and more widely available by the end of the decade.

But every year that we wait to start (and we <i>are</i> waiting, because of our belief that it&#x27;s not possible), is another year that people are needlessly dying.

I would go even further that those that sincerely imagine it is possible in the foreseeable future have no specialized knowledge of how it would actually work or be done (people like 4000 supplements and alkaline water Ray Kurzweil only prove out this point).

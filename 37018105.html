As a human though it extends to all aspects of life. I disagree with the assessment of the article too.<p>I’ve gone through burnout and mentored a few dozen people going through it. It’s nothing to do with relaxing, or is confined to work. It’s all encompassing, has strong parallels and likely includes depression and an anxiety disorder.  It has more of a sense of the inability to initiate anything rather than the inability to do nothing. Everything feels too hard, you feel too old, you see no prosperous future, and you yearn to end everything - not suicide, but to quit work, quit life, and disappear. These sounds like the appropriate mental response to unrelenting and uneasing stress to which you see no way out of. Most people suffering burn out spend an awful lot of time simply doing nothing.<p>However myself and the folks I’ve worked with as a mentor at work on burnout share the trait we lose the ability to identify things we enjoy - video games, music, travel, etc, lose their redeeming value and they can’t identify what music they like any more or a game they want to play. When they relax, it’s spent ruminating. To that extent maybe the articles point is true.<p>For me the way out was vipassana meditation and Buddhism. It taught me to master my rumination, detach myself from the stress, and discover the value of simply being rather than being someone or something. I recommend it to most people but only one or two have actually tried it.</div><br/><div id="37019604" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37019604" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">klipo</span><span>|</span><a href="#37018402">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37019202">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37019395">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37019604">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37019604">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Wow, this sounds so relatable. I went through most of what you describe, especially it being a mix of depression and anxiety disorder and not being able to identify anything I would enjoy, low energy, not feeling like starting or doing anything. Just wanting to disappear, and feel nothing. I felt loneliness was part of my problem too. The covid situation made me much more isolated than I was admitting at first.<p>I also found a lot of help in meditation and developing and practicing mindfulness. Recognising thoughts and emotions as they arise and to not identify with them was a big eye opener and relief. Just letting thoughts be or talking about it with someone when I noticed a pattern really helped.

It’s value is proportional to how much you practice meditation and take it seriously - but not mystically. There’s no magic or life after death or eternal happiness, it’s a very practical guide to being a human being in the way humans actually are rather than how we are taught to live by our society, culture, and instinct.<p>My suggestion to most is to start with Gil as a teacher -<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gil_Fronsdal" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gil_Fronsdal</a><p>He has an enormous amount of recorded teachings and does a daily mediation at 7am PST on YouTube. I would start with this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PLq_lRuaNj50Nm-SRxYPFSTyTtyvdq3QHm">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PLq_lRuaNj50Nm-SRxYPFSTyTt...</a><p>Regarding recovery I think most people do, but it does require dramatically changing your lifestyle in some way. You’re there mostly due to how you view life and your situation, as well as the situation. I think no one is ever the same and their limits in life are closer than before. You have to be more gentle with yourself, and more aware of yourself. A lot of vipassana meditation is learning to detach your “self,” or awareness from your thoughts and feelings and sensations and being able to observe them without becoming entangled in them. For instance I feel anxiety in my chest. By letting my thoughts and feelings be as they are but holding the tightness in my chest in awareness without judgement, the tightness eventually dissipates because it never really existed somatically. Concurrently my anxiety does as well, and I can then let the thoughts go as well as they’ve lost their power. It’s taken me two years but at this point I am fully engaged in my life, learning and loving more than I ever have all that life has to offer. I’ve got a great job at a late stage startup and switched from senior leadership roles to distinguished engineer roles.<p>Good luck man. Find friends too, friends are hard to engage with when burned out, but it is helpful.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37019686" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37019686" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">badpun</span><span>|</span><a href="#37018402">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37019202">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37019395">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37018830">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37019686">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37019686">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Everything feels too hard, you feel too old, you see no prosperous future, and you yearn to end everything - not suicide, but to quit work, quit life, and disappear.<p>I thought it&#x27;s not burn out, but just getting older and wiser :)<p>Very few people over say 40-45 year old are chipper and burst with energy and enthusiasm.

If you get banged up in a mental health hospital, you wont be eating processed food, so your sodium intake will likely fall, and they probably filter their water so its soft water, to reduce estate maintenance costs.<p>So yes the WHO has a very narrow definition of burn out, but in the absence of any other definition for the above possible factors, I think the populace apply their own definitions and interpretation of burn out, although needing a holiday could be applied to country&#x2F;location&#x2F;home burn out whilst not being recognised as burnt out, like I&#x27;ve described above, mainly because to quote Monty Python &quot;Always look on the bright side of life...&quot;<p>Also, considering the all encompassing nature of the DSM, I&#x27;d have thought they would have had some input on burnout, but it looks like they are still contemplating it as a mental disorder.[5]<p>&quot;Stemming from a lack of conceptual clarity, the current state of burnout research remains, unfortunately, largely circular and riddled with measurement issues.&quot;[5]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2269601&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2269601&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3060537&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3060537&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5635092&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5635092&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;15080493&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;15080493&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC8945132&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC8945132&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="37019176" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37019176" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway154</span><span>|</span><a href="#37018402">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37018830">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37019165">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37019176">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37019176">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not voting for Brexit may also be a function of it being a terrible idea.<p>I fail to see the need to have worked poorly backed political ideologies into an unrelated post unless the intention was to FUD or flame.<p>The core point<p>&gt; Yes it can be occupational, but it can also be applied to home, location, country or life.<p>Completely.</div><br/><div id="37019625" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37019625" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">antonvs</span><span>|</span><a href="#37018402">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37019176">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37020045">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37019625">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37019625">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was hoping they meant not voting in the brexit referendum, even though it was important.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37020045" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37020045" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">darkclouds</span><span>|</span><a href="#37018402">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37019176">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37019625">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37019165">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37020045">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37020045">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I personally didnt see anything wrong with the idea of brexit in a self deterministic way.

It is believed to be mostly chemical sensing, e.g. specific smells that they are remembering and returning to.<p>Salmon are not 100% effective at making it back to their birthplace, and some small fraction stray randomly- which is what allows them to populate new areas and re-populate others where they were wiped out.

I believe this is also the end of the oldest dam removal project. The Klamath and IIRC the local tribes were the original test for salmon restoration&#x2F;dam breach projects in the PNW, and subsequent programs are copying their success.<p>One of the things that makes salmon ladders more effective is introducing artificial noise of falling water. Turns out when salmon find themselves in still water they head for the sounds of the inflow, which dams either don&#x27;t have, or are from spillways that the salmon cannot navigate.<p>Most salmon want to go back exactly where they are born, and on a three year cycle (or at least, that&#x27;s the pattern on the Klamath). So if you were to introduce hatchery salmon in 2024, in 2027 and every three years after you&#x27;ll have a full run, and only a small number of fish in the remaining years. Which probably isn&#x27;t good for genetic diversity.

Some of it is cultural - with upstream tribal lands where people cannot practice traditional life or activities like fishing without returning fish each season. Some of it is practical - we donât do a good job maintaining old dams and new replacement projects are expensive. But I do worry that the new dam removal movement is sacrificing renewable energy and flood control and navigable rivers for little gain, when they could find solutions that keep the dams and help upstream environments.<p>Well designed ladders work efficiently. Fish donât have to over exert themselves, make jumps (actual leaps to the next step) no bigger than they would naturally (with no dam), and have lots of resting spaces across the ladder where they can regain energy in gentle waters before continuing swimming and jumping upstream. They slowly gain elevation moving across spacious concrete tiers until they reach either a natural release point upstream enough that the strong flow into the dam doesnât take them, or they end up in a hatchery.<p>I feel like hatcheries are underrated. Sure the upstream habitats are not the same without the fish and associated ecosystem. But if you have the right equipment, staffing, funding, and all that (basically a good government) the hatcheries could be made to churn out more fish than would be naturally possible.

People confuse their own values with science, and âfollow the scienceâ rhetoric only makes it worse. Science might say, âIf you take action X, thing A increases,â but deciding whether to take action X involves weighing A against everything else we care aboutâvalues, costs, benefits, and human experience.<p>COVID was a perfect example of this. Policies like isolating grandma in a nursing home or pulling kids out of school for two years were framed as âfollowing the science,â but they ignored entire fields of science and vast parts of the human experience. Loneliness has measurable health consequencesâscience shows it can kill. So do we isolate grandma to protect her from COVID, or risk her dying of loneliness? Similarly, the science of childhood education tells us that pulling kids from school harms them for life. These are real trade-offs, rooted in human values, not just science. And to be frank, that entire discussion was shut down completely. The entire decision making process was incredibly one-sided and myopic.<p>The same applies to dams. Decisions about whether to keep or remove them arenât just âscience versus activism.â Both sides are informed by science, but theyâre also driven by emotion, lived experience, and the values people hold. Science doesnât tell us what to doâit gives us information about potential outcomes. What we choose depends on how we weigh those outcomes and whose priorities matter most. When rhetoric like âkeep the dam = science, remove the dam = activismâ takes over, it oversimplifies these deeply human decisions and turns them into unnecessary battles. At the end of the day, itâs not âus vs. themââitâs all of us trying to navigate complex trade-offs in a way that reflects the full spectrum of what matters to humans.</div><br/><div id="42216986" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42216986" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">s1artibartfast</span><span>|</span><a href="#42214416">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42216066">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42216831">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42216986">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42216986">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That doesn&#x27;t negate the fact that one (or both) side can use bad or motivated science to justify their positions in a way that is falsifiable.<p>Questions of if (and how far) the salmon will go up the Klamath or if (and how many) homes will flood are example of this.

Most of them will never visit the river. These are pitted against a much smaller number of geographic locals, many of whom may suffer flooding and the loss of their jobs, businesses, and retirements. This is not to say one side is inherently right or wrong- it is still a matter of values.<p>I thought the article could have done a better job of explaining what the locals realistically stand to lose in this situation, and less time on the conspiracy talk. In my experience, the conspiracy theories come as secondary post-hoc justification for economic and cultural interests of their adherents.<p>&gt; Neither side is more âscientificâ than the other; theyâre both driven by values<p>This isnt always the case. With respect to the science, sometimes different sides claim different and conflicting outcomes. The extent of the salmon run when it returns is a factual prediction, where one side can be shown right or wrong, as is the number of people who will be flooded or lose their jobs.<p>Towards the end of the article, it talks about spotted owl conservation, where 9 million acres of Forrest were protected, causing 30,000 loggers to lose their job. The environmental activists overstated how much this would help the owls, while the objectors held the position that logging was not big impact and the real driver was out competition from the barred owl. The aftermath showed the position of one side to have more scientific merit, but that is little consolation to those who had their lives destroyed. Inversely, the bad science has no cost to the conservation activists, because they had nothing to lose from the regulation.<p>This is a bit of a pet issue for me, because I have family who lost their life&#x27;s work and life savings in similar situations.</div><br/><div id="42218881" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42218881" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SalmonSnarker</span><span>|</span><a href="#42214416">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42216831">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42217343">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42218881">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42218881">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It is striking to me that the only locals you seem to care about in your set of responses here are the <i>white</i> locals?

Rivers carry sediment. The dams slow the flow of water and the sediment is dropped. This fills up the reservoir behind the dam, eventually making the dam ineffective. In addition, ordinary mechanical stresses wear out dams and they&#x27;re components, so there is a maintenance cost to just keeping them running.<p>Many failure modes for dams are catastrophic: a release of water and silt all at once into downstream areas.<p>Worse, many of the dams that were built in the dam-building boom in the US West from circa 1930 to 1965 or so were not particularly well-thought-out, especially smaller privately planned dams.<p>In the mid-century American Bureau of Reclamation, building dams was like building new chat services is at Google today. While dams, as a concept, are completely critical to making the western united states survivable with mid-20th century technology, many of the actual dams were not good designs, they are the result of a generation or two of engineers responding to promotion incentives within a large bureaucracy, and they should no more be given the benefit of the doubt as good engineering projects than the last abandoned open source project you saw from Google, Facebook, Uber, etc.<p>Consider Matilija Dam (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Matilija_Dam" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Matilija_Dam</a>):<p>* &quot;In 1941 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers warned that the dam would not be economically effective, as the steep, erosive topography upstream would cause it to silt up quickly. However, the project moved forward and in 1945 the county issued $682,000 in revenue bonds to fund it. Construction began on 18 June 1946 and was completed on 14 March 1948 at a cost of nearly $4 million, six times the original estimate&quot;
* &quot;Almost immediately after construction, the dam began silting up.[7] The dam traps about 30% of the total sediment in the Ventura River system, depriving ocean beaches of replenishing sediment.[6] Initially, engineers had estimated it would take 39 years for the reservoir to fill with silt,[1] but within a few years it was clear that the siltation rate was much faster than anticipated. In 1964 a safety study was commissioned from Bechtel Corporation, which determined the dam was unsafe and recommended removal.&quot;
* The dam was notched twice, reducing its capacity and function, and the reservoir was useless by 2020.
* Ventura county started trying to remove the dam in 1998 (who knows what happened between 1964 and then), but the dam is still there.<p>Even the good dams don&#x27;t last forever, and there is no plan to deal with the sediment build up in the West&#x27;s dams.<p>However, the Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers dams are the good ones. The real corkers are the private dams. Consider Rindge Dam (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rindge_Dam" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rindge_Dam</a>) in Malibu, California, which was privately built by the Rindge family when they controlled the entire Mexican land grant rancho that is present-day Malibu:<p>* Built 1926
* Completely silted up by 1950, 24 years later. 24 years of &quot;useful&quot; life tops (&quot;useful&quot; is suspect because most Rindge family building projects were weird compliance dodges to preserve control of the ranch. They spent decades building and tearing down a railroad because the law on the books at the time prevented the state from using eminent domain to seize their land for road-building if there was a railroad under construction there)
* Congress authorized removal study in 1992.
* In 2014, dam considered so dangerous due to lack of repairs that the area, which is now in a state park, was closed to the public in 2014.
* The dam can&#x27;t just be knocked down, what would happen to the 600k cubic meters of sediment that are now trapped behind the dam, that should have flowed down the river for the last 100 years? The plan is to _truck the sediment out_. Some will be dumped in the ocean, the rest in _landfills_. 
* The currently scheduled goal to complete the removal project is _2033_. The dam was been functionally useless for its original purpose since 1950. It&#x27;s 83 year &quot;useless&#x2F;dangerous&quot; lifespan will surpass it&#x27;s 24 year &quot;useful&quot; lifespan by 3.5x! Surely _some_ of that is government beauracracy but not all: it&#x27;s very difficult to unbuild a silted up dam. It&#x27;s harder to undo things than it is to do them.<p>I think there is much more significant &quot;religious faith&quot; in the sanctity of dams than there is &quot;belief that dams are evil because they aren&#x27;t natural&quot; in the United States. Dams are a powerful symbol of America&#x27;s mid-century confidence in it&#x27;s ability to bend nature to its will. Hoover Dam is more than a tourist site, it&#x27;s something closer to a civic-religious site, like the Lincoln Monument. So is Glen Canyon. Grand Coulee Dam is known to a lot of people as &quot;The Dam That Won World War II&quot; for it&#x27;s role in powering the aluminum-smelting plants and nuclear material refinement sites in the Northwest. How many pieces of infrastructure are considered war heros in the US?<p>The sanctity of dams is way more obvious in the northeast. There&#x27;s hundreds and hundreds of abandoned dams on every trickle of water in the mid-Atlantic and New England, all to power mills that stopped milling 100 years ago, but the dams are still there, and the fish are not.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42215999" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42215999" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sophacles</span><span>|</span><a href="#42214416">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42214449">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42218093">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42215999">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42215999">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But why?

Fish ladders and weirs shouldnât be grouped together like this. Many hatcheries have a weir salmon cannot cross and a ladder as the alternative path the fish take by feeling the flow of water across the ladder and going upstream. The ladders lead to hatcheries where the fish reproduce. And new tiny fish are efficiently raised in protected tanks and later released to go back downstream. In other words, the weir and ladder are a combination to make the hatchery work, and not substitutes for each other. Also ladders can work very well.

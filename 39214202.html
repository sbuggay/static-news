No references, no article. The vast majority of deleted articles don&#x27;t have any references. If you have just a couple references, that article is likely to float around in some gray area for a long time. There are articles on the site only a couple sentences long, but they have notable references, so they can&#x27;t easily be deleted.<p>People mistakenly think that paying off an administrator is a golden ticket to getting on the site. They misunderstand that the majority of governance on the site is done in public, and often doesn&#x27;t involve administrators at all. For example, I&#x27;ve been involved in a couple requests for article deletion (sometimes as the person requesting the deletion, sometimes not). In all my experiences, no administrator was involved in the debate. If there are good reasons to delete an article, a bribed administrator will simply be outvoted by the public.<p>^1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Notability" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Notability</a><p>^2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Reliable_sources</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39238118" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39238118" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">palmfacehn</span><span>|</span><a href="#39237398">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39237600">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39238118">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39238118">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Wikipedia as an institution, their insider-only ways, byzantine guidelines and more all incentivize this kind of abuse.

Even asking questions about an uncited assertion on a talk page can be labeled as disruptive.<p>I feel bad for the victims of the scam. It can be hard to edit or correct basic facts. Most business owners don&#x27;t have time to specialize in Wikipedia lawfare. I have no sympathy for the WMF or the hard-core believers who wrote this expose&#x27;. Their policies created opportunities for these scammers to exploit.<p>The fact that they wrote this without an ounce of self-reflection or awareness of the problems is more troubling than the scam itself. Scams will come and go, but we&#x27;ve been stuck with Wikipedia as Google&#x27;s and therefore the Internet&#x27;s arbiter of &quot;truthiness&quot; for too long.</div><br/><div id="39238599" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39238599" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gurchik</span><span>|</span><a href="#39238118">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39237600">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39238599">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39238599">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Today correcting a typo might trigger a full-time editor to defend his turf. Even asking questions about an uncited assertion on a talk page can be labeled as disruptive.<p>This doesn&#x27;t align with my experience. From what I&#x27;ve seen, the consensus is that the majority of edits from an IP user are constructive, and they&#x27;re not reverted simply because they&#x27;re from an IP user. I&#x27;ve seen data about this[1], but for fun I looked at a page I&#x27;ve edited recently. Out of the last 50 edits, 13 were from IP users (26%), and only 4 of them were vandalism (30% of IP edits).<p>You are right that some people entrench into a &quot;turf&quot; and revert things for no reason. This is an old problem on Wikipedia. But this is pretty rare across the site from my experience. And I have seen people get warnings for this behavior. If someone was reverting simple typo fixes or discussions on a Talk page I would expect something to happen to that user, regardless if it was against an IP user or not.<p>That&#x27;s not to say there are no advantages to having an account. Creating new pages, uploading files, and editing semi-protected pages require an account. Some articles require pretty strict criteria to edit, your account has to be at least 30 days old with 500 edits (which is more than I have). This list is around 7000 articles[2] which is more than I expected.<p>^1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:IP_editors_are_human_too" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:IP_editors_are_human...</a><p>^2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Special:ProtectedPages&amp;level=extendedconfirmed" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Special:Protected...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39237600" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39237600" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Animats</span><span>|</span><a href="#39238118">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39238289">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39237600">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39237600">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s great to see an article about spam where the spammers are losing and their customers are victims.<p>I used to spend a lot of time working on the Wikipedia conflict of interest notice board, [WP:COIN].

A friend of mine knew I was looking to practice and sent me a photo on Wikipedia that was faked. It claimed to be of private military contractors in an outfit called GK Sierra in one country, but they were actually US soldiers in a different country.<p>I spent a while digging into this company and a couple of related companies. They had edited themselves into Wikipedia articles in small ways over the years, and gotten themselves included in click bait lists of military contractors. They made a half-assed effort to cover this up by 
 changing their Wikipedia user name, but that just creates a different record that was still searchable. There was a Wikipedia article mentioning a rumor they worked for Mossad, but I suspected they were also the source for that rumor. They claimed they worked for the CIA, and they had a real contracting number with the DoD. But I didn&#x27;t find any evidence these contracts were real, and when I sent a FOIA to the CIA they said the information either didn&#x27;t exist or was classified.<p>The weirdest thing I noticed was that it had bled into the culture to some extent. People who wanted to give themselves an edgy camo aesthetic would find these click bait articles and vandalized Wikipedia pages and not realize it was a sham. I saw an admin of some forum who took it as a handle. I saw someone present a military-themed outfit in GTA named after it.<p>Eventually I got to the point where I was gathering more and more evidence and none of it was making any sense, and I realized I was never going to make real headway without finding a way to interview these people. I could see pieces of what they were doing, but as far as why they were doing it, that information just didn&#x27;t seem to be written down on the Internet. The prospect of flying across the country to try and track down someone who was doing things I couldn&#x27;t understand wasn&#x27;t appealing, so I just let it go.<p>As a disclaimer, I&#x27;m working off of memory here, some of the details may be wrong.<p>---<p>Looking back at their deleted Wikipedia page on the Wayback machine, it&#x27;s all so outlandish that I have to imagine it was an elaborate prank. It&#x27;s a lot more paperwork than most pranks involve, but I just can&#x27;t imagine that whoever put this together intended anyone to believe it. Maybe they wanted to see if they could do enough legend building that the Wikipedia mods would have some doubt and keep up the page for a ridiculous hoax? If I was practicing a skill, maybe they were too?

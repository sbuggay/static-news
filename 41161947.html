Farming is generally something you (reluctantly?) inherit along with the farm. It&#x27;s insanely expensive to buy your way in. Even if you inherit the land, the cost of buying and upkeep of machinery is extremely expensive. Everything you invest after that point (in livestock, seed, fuel, time) is a risk. Bad luck or bad weather can ruin a crop. The hours are long. The stress is monumental - suddenly you <i>really</i> care about the weather. And unlike some small tech startups you absolutely have to employ people, but the people who end up working as farm labourers &quot;fall&quot; into it because they can&#x27;t do anything else (kinda like the building trade).

Just an npc, or a toaster. The company they work for does see them that way and treats them that way, but we have no excuse for doing the same.<p>As an employee, or a boss, I don&#x27;t find it ridiculous to thank or be thanked for random tasks occasionally, especially when they are a little out of order. No one needs to be worshiped for making fries, and it&#x27;s techically simply within the expected job description for the manager to tell you to go out back and wash the rubber floor mats or something slightly not your usual task, and yet never acknowledging anything ever is also just being an inconsiderate ingrateful assshole.<p>It&#x27;s worth it not to be that guy even if only for the purely self-interest reasons of having more and better choice of employees who do a better job on average and give you less grief when you need a favor like to cover someone else&#x27;s absense or a large job etc.<p>Asking instead of telling at least sometimes, and saying thanks at least sometimes, has to be genuine too. If it&#x27;s just bs noises that don&#x27;t actually mean you are being accomodating and flexible then don&#x27;t bother. Even though the boss is the boss, and has the right to just didctate, and even if the thing you&#x27;re asking is really all else being equal a command, the reason for asking is not just as a pacifier so someone feels respected when thy&#x27;re not, it&#x27;s to allow for the possibility that there actually is some problem. 99% of the time there should be no problem and thr answer is expected to be &quot;yep got it&quot;, by asking, the person is far less stressed on an ongoing constant level feeling that if there ever was some problem, they could just say so.<p>It turns dictation into cooperation. Can you restock that station later? I have to pick up my kid. Can you do it now if I take you off this other thing? ok. ok.

Yeah that might be somewhat typical for fast food wages depending on locale.<p>Minimum wage is a floor. It doesn&#x27;t mean you can hire at that rate.<p>Minimum wage in my state is the federal minimum ($7.25&#x2F;hr) but restaurants here have to pay about double that to get anyone.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41162786" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41162786" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wil421</span><span>|</span><a href="#41162600">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41163226">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41162621">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41162786">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41162786">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It says dotcom in the title so it must be around 1999&#x2F;2000 give or take a couple years.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41162621" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41162621" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hollywood_court</span><span>|</span><a href="#41162600">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41163810">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41162621">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41162621">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Reminds me of Armie Hammer selling timeshares in the Caribbean.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41163810" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41163810" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nunez</span><span>|</span><a href="#41162621">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41162874">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41163810">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41163810">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Honestly this is something I would like to do once I feel &quot;financially ready.&quot; I want to be a barista, at least for a little while.

You&#x27;re on the clock 100% until you clock out, no rest, no breaks, if a burger takes more than 60 seconds to land on the customer&#x27;s tray the boss is on your ass.  If you miscalculate how many patties to slap on the grill and either run out or you have to toss some because they&#x27;ve sat in the steamer for more than 15 minutes you are in for such a dressing down.  The machine tracks from the start of the order till it is closed out so he knows.  He has some bullshit regional contest thing with all of the other franchisees in the area that he has to win if he wants to make that boat payment.  If there are no customers you are cleaning, even if you just cleaned it.  Plus you had to spend like half of your time training new recruits or filling in for them when they stopped showing after like two days. I did one summer of that in college and it cemented me in my tech career path.  I couldn&#x27;t deal with the stress.</div><br/><div id="41177116" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41177116" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alaxhn</span><span>|</span><a href="#41162874">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41174214">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41175842">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41177116">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41177116">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My fast food experience<p>* Worked ~9 months at a dunkin donuts<p>* Start of shift generally 4 a.m.<p>* End of shift generally 1 p.m.<p>* 7 days per week although Sunday would only work 3 hr - this was because my boss could provide much more compensation because we were paid 1.5x hourly above 40 hours.

The work is repetitive so each individual step requires little thought. To make a sandwhich you put the bread in oven 1 and click button 2 then you put the patty in oven 2 and click button 7. When it comes out you wrap, bag, add napkins, and hand it to the customer. Crucially when your shift is done you go home and don&#x27;t care. There are no objectives that line employees care about at a quarterly level. You were able to move around the entire day and interact with people rather than being sedentary behind a screen. You didn&#x27;t have to have any education or work experience beyond completing ~9 grade (compared to CS where the most common path in the US is 3 years of highschool, 4 years of college). Most employees at my location were young, more social, less attached, and better looking than my colleagues in big tech (ok myself included).<p>I would trade my new line of work for my old in a heartbeat if the compensation and career prospects were comparable.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41175842" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41175842" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Apocryphon</span><span>|</span><a href="#41162874">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41174214">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41177116">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41174245">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41175842">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41175842">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You could work the night shift, though that of course has a huge trade-off.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41174245" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41174245" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sph</span><span>|</span><a href="#41162874">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41174214">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41176374">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41174245">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41174245">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Working in restaurants and hospitality is hell on Earth.

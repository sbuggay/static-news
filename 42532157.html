I don&#x27;t know anything else to say except that Forth is definitions. If you have a lot of small definitions you are writing Forth. In order to write a lot of small definitions you have to have a stack.<p>It seemed like apologetics and a making a virtue out of necessity, given the fact that I don&#x27;t have the capability to do stack acrobatics in my head live. The only way to be able to read a function in my head, without taking a pencil to paper _was_ small functions. But I found that clashed with the ways some algorithms and procedures naturally expressed themselves in longer multi-step style, and actually ending up being more verbose and tangled with multiple top-level definitions.<p>It turns out that local variables that compile to C-style indirect (SP + i) accesses are only mildly more expensive than stack acrobatics, but still gave the flexibility of Forth-style metaprogramming. [1]<p>Ultimately, the author&#x27;s points about the &quot;Forth philosophy&quot; but not Forth-the-language itself (and extremely spare code) ring true to me.<p>Given my limitations, life is too short to work to have as minimalist an implementation as you&#x27;d like, and to desire to have a interactive development environment in &lt;128k. For me, it&#x27;s hard enough to implement the &quot;subject&quot; that I&#x27;m programming algorithmically&#x2F;data-driven-ly&#x2F;amortizing-computation-ly efficiently.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.novabbs.com&#x2F;devel&#x2F;article-flat.php?id=26347&amp;group=comp.lang.forth#26347" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.novabbs.com&#x2F;devel&#x2F;article-flat.php?id=26347&amp;grou...</a></div><br/><div id="42534817" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42534817" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nalsirety</span><span>|</span><a href="#42533324">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42535904">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42534817">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42534817">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s easier to approach Forth as assembly-like than C-like.<p>That is, why are you factoring the code to use the stack when you have globals?<p>(Mumble mumble structured program, recursion, reuse)<p>If you move towards a global-first approach(which is what Chuck Moore seems to have moved towards, from anecdote), what changes is that you can substitute the word defining the variable for another word, later down the line, that adds the context, indirection and error handling you need. The mechanism can be added without changing how the word is being used, and you can still write a divide-and-conquer kind of algorithm in this way, it&#x27;s just more classically imperative in style, with more setting of mutable global temporaries and every byte of bookkeeping directly accounted for.<p>Part of the minimalist freedom in Forth is that it is agnostic to whether you&#x27;re using the stack or the dictionary. If you want the word to be unambiguously about a particular space in memory it makes sense to define it first in terms of &quot;it accesses this static location&quot; instead of &quot;it consumes three things on the stack and shuffles them around and indirects one to a memory location and adds the other two&quot;, because that inclines all the words to be about the stack. Take the primitive approach - the one that maps well to assembly - first and see how far it goes. You stay in control of how you&#x27;re extending the language that way. C preempts that because the compiler hides the stack manipulation, so the semantics of the function will default towards locals, and then further extension is guided around fitting it into that.<p>(And it&#x27;s true that the compiler gets you to an answer faster, and black-boxes the interface, so you can use code without reading code - and that is coming at the expense of precision around details like this. Forth is probably not the right way, if it&#x27;s Conway&#x27;s law that you&#x27;re up against.)</div><br/><div id="42536145" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42536145" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rep_lodsb</span><span>|</span><a href="#42533324">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42534817">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42535904">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42536145">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42536145">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In most assembly languages, accessing local variables on the stack is easy, plus you have multiple registers for temporary data. Forth feels extremely limiting compared to that.<p>On an architecture without those features, like the 6502, Forth <i>may</i> be a good idea, and possibly faster than C - but only if it&#x27;s compiled to machine code with some peephole optimizations, so that e.g. &quot;123 MY-VAR C!&quot; translates into &quot;LDA #123 ; STA MY-VAR&quot;, instead of a naive implementation where the address and constant would first be pushed onto the stack.<p>And any more complicated optimizations would probably require first &quot;decompiling&quot; the Forth code back into a higher level of abstraction. It&#x27;s practically the same as assembler macros otherwise.<p><i>edit:</i> fixed order of operands. I originally wrote &quot;MY-VAR 123 C!&quot;, but then remembered that the address to store to has to be on top of stack. IMHO, infix notation is less confusing, and writing a recursive-descent parser to handle it isn&#x27;t that hard compared to everything else in implementing a compiler. And of course in an infix language, &quot;123 := MYVAR&quot; would be a syntax error, instead of storing (the low byte of) the address of MYVAR into memory location 123.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42535904" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42535904" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">veltas</span><span>|</span><a href="#42533324">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42537527">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42535904">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42535904">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I appreciate Yossi&#x27;s plain honesty in this article, and it&#x27;s a fun and interesting read; I&#x27;ve read it before.<p>I can relate to, but not endorse, designing a CPU and dialect for an interesting language you&#x27;ve never properly used.  This turned out to be very painful, and Yossi argues convincingly that it is essentially not practical to use Forth at all, debating Jeff Fox&#x27;s position.  However, there is some evidence[1] that Forth actually might be practical, and it certainly seemed to have a niche in the 80&#x27;s.<p>Yossi made some errors I&#x27;ve seen among new Forth programmers.  A lot of people, before writing real programs, think Forth is like lisp from another universe.  They visualise Forth primarily as a sort-of functional, concatenative, highly refactor-focused language.  They likewise tend to throw out all the normal Forth defining words and use Forth as &#x27;lisp without parentheses&#x27;.  They try and put all their data on the stack, &#x27;point-free&#x27;, rather than using variables.  And often their projects eventually devolve into C envy, every line with stack comments and equivalent C code to help, as shown in the article.<p>But go look at real, working, classic Forth code, of which there is much, and you&#x27;ll see that there is a prevailing style that&#x27;s easy to read and not actually that &#x27;smart&#x27;, or &#x27;academic&#x27;.  No more than 1-2 stack items need to be mentally &#x27;juggled&#x27; for 99% of code, lots of variables and buffers are used whenever it&#x27;s easier.  Yes the classic variables are &#x27;global&#x27;, but it doesn&#x27;t matter if the relevant code isn&#x27;t recursing or touched in interrupts, and is only used by a cluster of related words.  Newer Forths do have local variables, in spite of Jeff Fox&#x27;s disapproval!<p>The classic code I&#x27;m talking about matches what I think Jeff Fox is trying to coerce you towards.  Ultimately I disagree with Yossi&#x27;s views because I think if he had actually tried to implement what Jeff Fox proposes, and got some practice first on a more realistic project, he would have had a much better shot.  It&#x27;s impressive how well the project turned out in spite of the approach, and how Yossi wrote a backend for his architecture in a week: a testament to both his skills and LLVM&#x27;s design; but it&#x27;s worth reflecting as engineers how arrogant (yet relatable) it is to make a CPU and compiler for a language you&#x27;ve never properly used.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hardware-x.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;S2468-0672(22)00025-6&#x2F;fulltext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hardware-x.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;S2468-0672(22)00025-6&#x2F;ful...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42537527" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42537527" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PaulHoule</span><span>|</span><a href="#42535904">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42536849">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42537527">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42537527">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Stack machines are a place where hardware goes to die.

To such people, programming languages, operating systems, libraries, even the chips that run all this stuff, they are all non-problems, to be reduced or eliminated. And to do that, it requires that the mind be able to compensate for all the comfort all of those layers would have afforded.<p>&gt; Why pay this cost? <i>[The cost of adding junk you don&#x27;t actually need]</i><p>&gt; Because I don&#x27;t do algorithms, other people do, so I have to trust them and respect their judgment to a large extent.<p>&gt; Because you need superhuman abilities to work without layers.<p>&gt; The Forth way of focusing on just the problem you need to solve seems to more or less require that the same person or a very tightly united group focus on all three of these things, and pick the right algorithms, the right computer architecture, the right language, the right word size, etc.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t know how to make this work.<p>&gt; having people being able to do what at least 3 people in their respective areas normally do, and concentrating on those 3 things at the same time<p>&gt; Doing the cross-layer global optimization.<p>A sufficiently smart person is capable of analyzing and optimizing the problem from the requirements all the way to the literal chip running the software. They come up with custom unconventional algorithms and implement weird chips with 18 bit words.<p>These are people who are smart enough to modify standard engineering equations. Those things weren&#x27;t sacred to them, they understood them to the point they felt confident enough to change them in such a way that they could be efficiently implemented in some weirdly minimal custom chips[1]. And this somehow yielded more efficient algorithms which were easy to implement in Forth.<p>I share their enthusiasm for minimalism and eliminating the dependencies and the &quot;junk&quot;. It always ends with me learning everything I can about the junk and doing it myself, maybe even reimagining it, hopefully better and smaller this time. I can only hope to one day be half as smart as some of these folks seem to be, though. Every time I try to get into hardware, I discover my limits.<p>[1]: The Yamaha DX7 is an example.

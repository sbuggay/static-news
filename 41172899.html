Using Game Theory here kind of complicates the analysis without bringing a lot to the table, unless you have some special conditions or requirements.<p>If you have an overall demand curve and a marginal cost curve for each seller, you can find the equilibrium where each producer is at their profit-maximization point. In the standard micro textbooks this is the point where each producer&#x27;s MR is equal to MC, i.e. a local maximum where the derivative of profit with respect to output is zero.

The equilibrium in that game is just the monopoly price, i.e. MR=MC for the producers&#x27; aggregated MC curve.<p>So you have the monopoly price at one end (infinitely repeated game, perfect monitoring, no antitrust risk) and the oligopoly price at the other. It&#x27;s a bit of a castle of cards that&#x27;s going to fail wildly depending on which assumption you break. If the game is finitely repeated, for instance, the equilibrium is the oligopoly price.<p>One variant that&#x27;s been in the news recently is rent-setting software. [1] Here the goal is not running afoul of antitrust. The problem is that it&#x27;s partly a transaction cost effect, because landlords are publishing rents rather than targeting 100% occupancy (which would make deviating a lot more appealing than colluding for any landlord with less than ~50% of the market.)<p>If antitrust is not an issue and compliance monitoring is the problem, look for OPEC research.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41163936">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41163936</a></div><br/><div id="41175427" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41175427" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">abdullahkhalids</span><span>|</span><a href="#41173349">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41174998">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41175935">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41175427">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41175427">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I understand what the standard econ calculus based models are. I am a physicist, and we do the same thing where we were really good at modelling systems with small number of particles, or very large number of particles.

In fact, there is a lot of work going on today in various branches of physics in this type of modelling and theory building, because we now have the computational power to understand such systems.<p>What I am saying about economics are not my original thoughts.

Planet money has a good piece on a related topic <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2023&#x2F;02&#x2F;06&#x2F;1154775118&#x2F;ice-cream-ben-jerrys-haagen-daz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2023&#x2F;02&#x2F;06&#x2F;1154775118&#x2F;ice-cream-ben-jerr...</a> .<p>This stuff really opened my eyes to the idea that old-school conceptions of things like collusion, and even classic game theoretic ideas of perfect and complete information, all seem to need radical updates for the tightly connected and algorithmic times and economies that we live in.<p>It seems almost unavoidable that all markets are generally going to move towards both complete and perfect information.  We see that this is still somewhat asymmetric, because sellers are more organized because they have more capital, and they can generally afford to hold rather than sell whenever they don&#x27;t like the market.  But in the limit, buyers do catch up a bit, because at least they can browse lots of listings for stuff like housing.  Meanwhile in the labor market, the (mostly American) taboo against discussing compensation with coworkers is slowly going away, and there&#x27;s stuff like glassdoor, and laws that require stating some kind of range for compensation, etc.  In terms of cards on the table, people generally can&#x27;t keep secrets, since we need to account for practically every expense over 10k.  Corporations might have an easier time in some cases, but large organizations leak, so I doubt whether they can really hide the fact that they are ramping up for a new chip factory or whatever.  So getting a fair price for anything seems likely to get harder, and prices for everything go up.<p>I&#x27;m not versed enough in the topics to really even articulate a good question here, but particularly with more things being algorithmically determined more of the time, perhaps open information is not as good for markets as we thought.  Even the relatively straightforward classical idea of a monopoly is starting to feel dated, because if I can own only 10% of 10 key industries and use that to meltdown the whole economy because of the interconnectedness, then focusing on monopolies has little effect on market stability and consumer choice anyway.<p>Back to the topic of collusion though, maybe the simplest thing is to remove the idea of intent when this stuff is getting litigated.  Do we even <i>care</i> that collusion should be some kind of conspiracy with intent?  Or do we just dislike the effects and so we want it to never happen?  Because in the future human &quot;intent&quot; is going to continue to disappear completely while everyone says &quot;look, the computers decided&quot;.  There&#x27;s no cigar-smoking cabal planning stuff in dark rooms anymore because those guys are out golfing.  No email chain with a smoking gun, because all that stuff is itself an inefficiency that profit-optimizing algorithms will increasingly be working around.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41173312" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41173312" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">artimis</span><span>|</span><a href="#41173349">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41175956">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41173312">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41173312">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why have you chosen to simulate players if Nash Equilibrium can be computed analytically (or at least numerically)?<p>I&#x27;ve used optimization of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lyapunov_function" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lyapunov_function</a> in my Bachelor thesis <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Artimi&#x2F;neng">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Artimi&#x2F;neng</a> to do that.</div><br/><div id="41173581" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41173581" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">0cf8612b2e1e</span><span>|</span><a href="#41173312">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41175956">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41173581">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41173581">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Simulation is fun and understandable by many more than a block of math.

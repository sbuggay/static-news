When I was young, I absolutely hated how I looked. I was bullied. Taunted. Tormented. I wanted a nose job. I wanted different hair. I wanted a different build. But as I got into my late 20s, I started to get a lot more attention, and I realized that a lot of people found me attractive. For reference, I look a lot more like Yehuda Amar (an Israeli chef) than Michael Aloni (Akiva on Schtisel).<p>It&#x27;s true that being conventionally attractive made my life 1000x easier - it&#x27;s almost like the trees lowered their branches to make the fruit easier to pick. I&#x27;m pretty sure it made it easier to get a mortgage and a job and definitely a partner. But I still think about what my life would be like if I had a different nose, different hair, different build.<p>Even in my late 40s, I still get a lot of attention from much younger women. A few weeks ago, a woman, maybe 25, openly flirted with me while she made my cappuccino. This has happened many times before, but I never make a move.<p>All I could think was how repulsed she would feel if she ever saw me naked. Or how fast she would disappear if she saw my crooked upper teeth. Or all my gray chest hair. Or my hairy back. Even if I played ball and gave her my number, even if she thinks I&#x27;m handsome, older-and-wiser, I just could never get past how I feel about myself, and see myself, relative to her.</div><br/><div id="36809865" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36809865" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DontchaKnowit</span><span>|</span><a href="#36808903">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36810835">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36809865">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36809865">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">you really really should work on that.</div><br/><div id="36809890" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36809890" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yowlingcat</span><span>|</span><a href="#36808903">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36809865">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36810835">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36809890">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36809890">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are you sure you&#x27;re saying GP should &quot;work on that&quot; out of a genuine desire for them to improve, rather than a way to puritanically assert a perceived lack of virtue that you think they should mediate?<p>Because if not, maybe there&#x27;s something &#x2F;you&#x2F; &quot;really really should work on.&quot;</div><br/><div id="36810168" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36810168" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nequo</span><span>|</span><a href="#36808903">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36809890">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36810835">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36810168">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36810168">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It did read like the former to me.<p>Maybe we all should just work on “that,” whatever it is that upsets us.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36810835" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36810835" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">atleastoptimal</span><span>|</span><a href="#36808903">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36810936">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36810835">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36810835">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The hierarchy of physical looks seems inexorably tied to the human social order.

That brand of Sufism really breaks down, both philosophically and psychologically, the &quot;meaning&quot; of painful beauty. For Rumi, the beauty that drives people insane is an infinitesimal ray of God&#x27;s beatific manifestation. Witnessing unattainable beauty is supposed be painful, and the pain is there for a reason, to draw one to what is Higher, and eventually drawing one to the Source of beauty to find that within oneself.<p>&gt; Since tresses and cheeks show a sign of that drop, kings keep licking the ground.<p>&gt; Delicate earth has received a drop of Beauty, so you kiss it night and day with a hundred hearts.<p>&gt; Though mixed with earth, a single drop can drive you mad—what then will that wine do to you when pure?<p>(Rumi M V 372-375)<p>Note &quot;earth&quot; here is a reference to human beings, as Muslims believe humans were created from earthly clay.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36809536" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36809536" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rushabh</span><span>|</span><a href="#36810936">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36811347">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36809536">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36809536">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My reading of Neapolitan quartet is completely different.

Not because the content reveals anything wrong or abnormal about the writer; rather because it is so commonplace and so very normal.<p>But embedded inside of its message is a deep, I think, and fundamental misunderstanding of beauty, as immutable, objective, so easy, obvious and self-evident to rank into an unambiguous ordering of things. But this kind of lowest common denominator simplification makes it possible for a society to create rules and structure, so it becomes a cultural default.<p>But I think that aesthetic beauty is multi-dimensional and temporal. A fine wine or a brandy; a sublime cheese and not a fresh glass of milk. There is a very specific kind of electric, youthful beauty which is ephemeral and fleeting. But there are other kinds of beauty which can be subdued and hard to miss, which can appreciate over time. I don&#x27;t even mean that in a subjective &quot;beauty is in the eye of the beholder&quot; but rather, that beauty objectively can come in more than one form.<p>Is a bombastic Wagner opera more or less beautiful than a simple, haunting, short song by The Cranberries? The question doesn&#x27;t even make sense, they&#x27;re apples and oranges. But if you ask me, I prefer the song by The Cranberries and for the kind of beauty it holds deep inside of itself, the Wagnerian opera would never come close.<p>I wish society would accept and circulate this truth rather than the other simpler, convenient, and yet so very wrong lie reflected by this article. I may not be a woman, but I&#x27;ve felt so many similar kinds of body dysmorphia of this sort living in NYC surrounded by conventionally attractive male models for so long until I stopped trying to be a conventional kind of attractive that would never sit right on my skin and instead embraced the one that felt like home to me.<p>I sometimes regret that I didn&#x27;t realize this sooner. But on the other hand, I&#x27;m glad that the experience taught me a lesson and imbued me with a confidence that now cannot be taken away from me by anyone or anything.</div><br/><div id="36809421" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36809421" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">formulathree</span><span>|</span><a href="#36809073">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36809688">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36809421">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36809421">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;But I think that aesthetic beauty is multi-dimensional and temporal.

I think the higher level ideal is the illusion. What our base instincts tell us is beauty is the actuality and it&#x27;s embedded in our biology.<p>For much of humanity woman have always been valued for their youthful beauty. Pregnancy is costly health-wise and men value youth and beauty because natural beauty conveys better physical genes and youthfulness conveys higher success to conceive a child.<p>Women are objectified for their beauty by men beauty for real biological reasons. And as a result women who obsess over their own physical beauty also end up being more successful in the mating game. Most of this behavior is the result of evolutionary psychology. This definition of beauty is cold, but it is reality and it is delusional to call it a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; of beauty.<p>The author writes this article and is drawing upon millions of years of evolutionary instinct and behavior.<p>&gt;I wish society would accept and circulate this truth rather than the other simpler, convenient, and yet so very wrong lie reflected by this article.<p>Society doesn&#x27;t need to circulate anything. Any person with a brain recognizes physical beauty and they know the meaning of the quote &quot;Don&#x27;t judge a book by it&#x27;s cover&quot;. What&#x27;s going on is just people are continuously lying to themselves when convenient.<p>You&#x27;re saying it here as if someone let&#x27;s me know of the &quot;truth&quot; and suddenly my instinctual definition of beauty will completely do a 180 and change? No. Unfortunately the cold hard truth is this: You have minimal choice in what you find beautiful. Culture and biological instincts shape your preferences far more than individual choice and you have little control over it.<p>It&#x27;s like choosing to find the female form beautiful or the male form beautiful. If I had that choice I can be gay at will. It&#x27;s convenient to define beauty on your terms when you encounter a woman lamenting the fact she&#x27;s not beautiful, but your definition of beauty completely flips when talking about sending homosexual people to training camps to train them to be straight... yeah as if they or anyone has a choice. Like I said, your definition is a lie we tell ourselves unconsciously when the situation is convenient.<p>Sorry to be a downer. But hacker news is a level up above other sites. I think we can handle the truth. In fact I think we prefer it. I prefer to talk about the actual science behind why she feels the way she does and how evolution and biology has shaped this behavior.<p>Keep in mind it&#x27;s not one sided. Women objectify men as objects of success and this no doubt shapes mens behavior as much as mens preferences shape women. I have more interest in the interplay of behaviors between men and women then I do idealistic re-definitions of beauty.<p>Beauty IS in the eye of the beholder, but that eye is built by DNA by which ALL humans share 99.9%.</div><br/><div id="36809779" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36809779" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yowlingcat</span><span>|</span><a href="#36809073">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36809421">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36809688">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36809779">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36809779">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I appreciate your simplistic argument and find it almost noble in its naiveté.

Why does what vary over time and wax and wane as certain looks go in and out of fashion?<p>Socioeconomic class is basically another culture in terms of influence. These two terms can be used interchangeably as they both have the same effect on the perception of beauty. Your question is something I can answer. It differs across cultures because the minds interpretation of beauty involves external experiences. That is why.<p>As for your comment about universal rules. Well that&#x27;s also easy. Universal rules involve symmetry and youth. Possibly more, but those are some of the biggest rules of beauty extend past &quot;culture&quot; so we know it&#x27;s part of biology.<p>&gt;Could you create such a rule which is consistent over time?<p>The answer is no. None of these rules are created by anyone or anything.<p>&gt;Do you think those rules would have been consistent by era, or would they have varied in times of famine versus times of surplus, and could you create anything consistent across civilization? How about by geographic areas which shaped the city states which served as centers of power in those civilizations, IE how feminine beauty may exist on the steppe vs on the coast, or in the mountains?<p>These rules vary by culture, culture varies by environmental circumstance and genetics. You&#x27;re getting into a redundancy here. I think you misinterpreted my post. I DID not say that culture does not influence beauty. Quite the opposite. I said Culture DOES influence someones perception of beauty. Read my post, it is there. However and this is a big &quot;However&quot; you do not have a choice in the matter. You do not choose your culture and you do not choose the ideals that are imprinted onto your brain by that culture. Once imprinted on your brain you cannot change it. If the culture values skinny bombshell models then that ideal will be seared into your brain. There are variations and anomalies but overall it is generally consistent.<p>It&#x27;s the same way that a baby bird imprints on the first thing it sees as it&#x27;s mother. It does not have a choice. Your brain is evolved to assimilate itself into it&#x27;s environment and culture without conscious choice from you.<p>That being said outside of this as I previously mentioned there are beauty standards that are universal that are not created by culture, two examples already mentioned are symmetry and youth (for women). We know this because surveys show that these ideals do not shift when observing different cultures. Additionally, quite obviously: men are generally attracted to women and women are generally attracted to men, there is some genetic influence making this opposite sex attraction preference generally consistent across all cultures.<p>Do not discount these universal rules. They are powerful biological instincts and overall... When in conflict they usually override cultural imprints of beauty.<p>&gt;Speaking about cold hard truth is challenging when working from a basis of archaeogenetic ignorance. You risk overestimating how universal your priors are.<p>Except this statement doesn&#x27;t make sense. If everything I say is logically correct and everything you say has issues with correctness, then who&#x27;s the ignorant one?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

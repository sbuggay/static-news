I like this one too, it&#x27;s even snappier.<p>A software engineer, a hardware engineer and a department manager were on their way to a meeting in Switzerland. They were driving down a steep mountain road when suddenly the brakes on their car failed. The car careened almost out of control down the road, bouncing off the crash barriers, until it miraculously ground to a halt scraping along the mountainside.<p>The car&#x27;s occupants, shaken but unhurt, now had a problem: they were stuck halfway down a mountain in a car with no brakes. What were they to do?<p>&quot;I know,&quot; said the department manager, &quot;Let&#x27;s have a meeting, propose a Vision, formulate a Mission Statement, define some Goals and by a process of Continuous Improvement find a solution to the Critical Problems, and we can be on our way.&quot;<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; said the hardware engineer, &quot;That will take far too long, and besides, that method has never worked before. I&#x27;ve got my Swiss Army knife with me, and in no time at all I can strip down the car&#x27;s braking system, isolate the fault, fix it and we can be on our way.&quot;<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the software engineer, &quot;Before we do anything, I think we should push the car back up the road and see if it happens again.&quot;</div><br/><div id="38138767" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38138767" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Elucalidavah</span><span>|</span><a href="#38129745">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38130989">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38138767">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38138767">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; and see if it happens again<p>The &quot;re-run to reproduce&quot; isn&#x27;t even the most peculiar part of software engineering; it&#x27;s &quot;we don&#x27;t look at what has been tried before&quot;.<p>In the OP story example, there&#x27;s this part: &quot;One time we added ventilation holes to reduce heat, but they were just big enough for wasps to nest in&quot;.
In a ideal world, the hardware engineers are supposed to know to not have any holes larger than a few millimeters, and other such things. Whereas the software engineers are (yet) not supposed to know much of anything like that. The most prominent example I can think of is &quot;remember to add an index to the database when adding a new type of query to the app&quot;, as load testing that would catch it tends not to be done on each and every release.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38130989" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38130989" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">s1artibartfast</span><span>|</span><a href="#38129745">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38138767">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38131846">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38130989">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38130989">[48 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is the moral of the story that the hardware engineer is simply correct?

The kinds of people who research new battery chemistries, or the techniques to unlock new semiconductor process nodes. Basically, scientists do hardcore research and expand the field, while engineers apply the techniques and formulas that the scientists have discovered, and craftsmen combine prepackaged modules built by engineers for a job.<p>So an applied physicist discovers the light-emitting diode. An electrical engineer designs an LED light panel. An electrician wires light panels into a home.<p>Likewise, a computer scientist discovers NFA reduction, an engineer uses it to build a regular expression compiler, and a developer writes a regex to validate email addresses.</div><br/><div id="38136946" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38136946" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fsckboy</span><span>|</span><a href="#38129745">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38136445">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38136497">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38136946">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38136946">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">An electrician who designs a complex light panel using 120VAC for use in a habitable or public building needs to submit the plans to the building department to get a permit and certify that it&#x27;s not a fire hazard. You need to be a Licensed Engineerâ¢ to do certain levels of certification.<p>People certified to be licensed engineers didn&#x27;t necessarily graduate from a School of Engineering at a famous university that is also filled with physicists and mathematicians and English literature. Instead they need to study, learn, and pass the tests that legally certify them as Licensed Engineersâ¢ to keep us all safe. It&#x27;s much of the same material, overlapping, but not the same. They&#x27;re less likely to consider themselves ready to move over to building rocketships to the moon on the basis of their bachelors degree.<p>This is the source of all the debate about who is an Engineer and who is not. Licensed Engineers don&#x27;t want to consider unlicensed engineers as engineers. People who went to universities and had to study a dose of liberal arts along with control theory to get their &quot;Engineering degree&quot; don&#x27;t want to consider the choo choo Train Engineerâ¢ as an engineer.<p>In the US there is a bit of academic snobbery around, it&#x27;s not universal but, University of Michigan is harder to get into academically, and a little more high falutin&#x27;. Michigan State is a bit more plebian but more practical. University of Washington vs. Washington State, same thing, and so on. The licensed engineers are more likely to come from the State school, the unlicensed engineers more likely from the University of. Both want recognition for their training, which makes sense.<p>I&#x27;m exaggerating for effect, but this is the issue. Whether software engineers are engineers is a minor skirmish on the flank of this larger war, both because there are no certifications for computer engineers, and because mathematicians are not engineers and programming languages can be studied from a mathematical perspective or from something closer to Electrical Engineering.</div><br/><div id="38137616" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38137616" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sterlind</span><span>|</span><a href="#38129745">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38136946">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38136497">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38137616">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38137616">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m confused, is the electrician in this example the Licensed Engineer(tm)?

Or, it could be that it&#x27;s a &quot;load bearing&quot; wall, and you need to put a wide I-beam over the new window to safely redistribute&#x2F;bear the load that the formerly intact wall was carrying.

I feel like you can read these and just come to a sense that nothing is engineering because everything is amorphous, which is not (I think) Hillelâs thesis but he doesnât really want to anchor the discussion in principle because he is fundamentally asking for opinions.<p>For a more principled approach, I would say (as one of these âlicensed engineers who has not done as much actual engineeringâ) that engineering as I have seen it kind of has three really major themes:<p>â¢ Prototyping&#x2F;building&#x2F;creation. Tinkering. I guess the reason we don&#x27;t talk about this is that everybody finds it trivial? But when you talk to ChemEs and they discuss optimizing pipelines for chemical processes you do see that it can get a little abstract so it&#x27;s worth pointing to as a baseline.<p>â¢ An underlying scientific theory that guides the models used. Building stuff has happened since way before science but engineering is clearly a postscientific endeavor, âhereâs the underlying mechanical principles of how this works.â This is probably the sketchier principle in how we talk about âis this software design really engineering,â we tend to not have a firm scientific understanding of the problem domain of building software. Some things like CAP theorem, patch theories in version control (Darcs, Pijul), distributed consensus algorithms, TCP&#x2F;IP, I would say really rise to that challenge and say something hard-learned about real systems. Things like OS kernels also have so much trial and error, so much prototyping that it feels like  âyes you really did do enough hypothesis-test-reÃ«valuate cycles that the result embodies a model of the problem domain that counts as a scientific understanding.â But a lot of our work is just gluing systems together and that seems more âelectricianâ than âelectrical engineering.â Now, science uses math, so people think of engineering as highly mathematical, I am not sure that it has to be. Whereas I do think it has to be scientifically based.<p>â¢ The last big thing that I think we don&#x27;t talk about enough is risk assessment. The reason that weâre doing all of this science and math to build a bridge, is so that we can assess how strong it needs to be to just barely survive the peak loads that it will ever have, and then double that strength just in case.<p>I think that when we say ânot all programmers are doing software engineeringâ a good proxy for that is looking at, first, do you have a scientific model of the sorts of approaches that you can do; and then, do you use it to assess numerically the kind of loads that your system will come under up-front and design accordinglyâwrites per second, queries per secondâand set realistic targets and choose caching and consensus and whatever else to achieve those and measure that you have... Or do you work via crude heuristics, âwe use Kubernetes so I&#x27;m sure it will scale later, we do âbest practicesâ so we don&#x27;t have to think about those,â and related kludges where we can comfortably say you&#x27;re just tinkering rather than being principled about it.<p>And then, this reveals that maybe you don&#x27;t need to be doing engineering, maybe you really do just need to tinker in the problem space while you achieve better product-market fit. Maybe you are doing science rather than engineering, and that is okay.

There was a dot on the screen. I didn&#x27;t know why there was a dot but I was under pressure to finish everything else. So I semi-ignored it.<p>The the Engineering Manager walked by. &quot;There&#x27;s a dot,&quot; he said, &quot;Get rid of it before Wednesday.&quot;<p>With all the other things going right with the project, why this dot--a single pixel--was so important drove us all crazy. I ran through the assembly code that handled all this over and over again and couldn&#x27;t see anything wrong. Never a reported error by the assembler. Neither could the project manager. Stayed at work all night to wrap it all up and, on Wednesday morning, everything was done and working perfectly just as the Engineering Manager walked into the room at 8am.<p>&quot;That dot is still there.&quot;<p>Like the author of the article, I questioned whether I should be in this line of work.

We have the unique ability to delve deep into intricate processes, monitor real-time activities, log whatâs happening, and even pause time with a debugger. This remarkable capability is not only cheap but fast, bordering on thoughtless.<p>&gt; While many other professions struggle to understand and resolve their issues, we have the advantage of being able to experiment multiple times a day with just a few clicks.<p>So much strained positivity, as if the author was tasked to find something to be thankful for. Look, software engineering is a great job if you enjoy the work. But even in this parable, the problem is the author&#x27;s week of distress and flailing. It has nothing to do with the work and everything to do with the author.<p>All the others he turns towards, no matter their discipline, their tools for investigation, or the constraints they faced in a dilemma, relate stories where they have a mature understanding of how their industry works and how they navigate its system. They encounter problems in the course of their work and they resolve them in the course of their work. Maybe it takes a little while to proceed with diagnosis. Maybe it takes a long while to integrate improvements into a later product. Maybe they need to forgo some procedure that they prefer to use.<p>By the authors account, the embedded engineer, the hardware engineer,  the CEO and veterinarian all face greater challenges when solving problems in their work, yet they all speak of their road through those challenges with a confidence that the author lacks. They try to soothe the author and empathize, but none of their stories hint at a week of panicked flailing.<p>So if they handle their work so much more confidently, is it true that their dilemmas are worse and that the author is lucky to be a software engineer?<p>If the author listened to their own invented characters, the realization to come to is not that the author is lucky to work in a field with purported &quot;privileges&quot; and that everyone else has it worse (gross!), but that <i>everyone</i> faces dilemmas in their work and that the real skill is in staying cool and confidently relying on the processes of their discipline. And this has everything to do with the person doing the work and nothing to do with the discipline. The realization is that challenges arise in all professions and that you can proceed through them without distress and flailing if you allow yourself patience and confidence.<p>It&#x27;s funny because they wrote this as a parable, but they missed the real lesson in the very piece they wrote. Four people reassure them that &quot;We&#x27;ve been there! We all go through this!&quot; and their takeaway is &quot;I need to remember that I&#x27;m lucky and that everybody else has it even worse.&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="38134888" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38134888" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">danwee</span><span>|</span><a href="#38130659">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38131976">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38134888">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38134888">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; By Thursday, I began to worry about my own job security.

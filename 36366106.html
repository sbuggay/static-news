But there’s much less focus put on <i>how</i> your peers became productive at their specialization. That’s the real secret sauce, is to become productive at some specialization in software engineering you need experience + a deep mental model of your codebase and a mental model of your dependencies.<p>The reason a task that should have been 4 hours takes 4 days is because you had to debug, read documentation and try things. If you immediately could predict why an issue was happening because you had a deep mental model of the OS, the runtime, your architecture etc. you would be able to solve any issue you run into in several orders less time. That’s how you actually become more productive as an engineer in your field.<p>This obsession with grinding and hyper productivity is out of hand, your physical and mental health are way more important.</div><br/><div id="36367702" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36367702" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">raincole</span><span>|</span><a href="#36366938">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36368388">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36367702">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36367702">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I noticed this hyper obsession with productivity in our industry from measuring yourself against how you perceive others productivity.<p>Carmack doesn&#x27;t measure his productivity against someone else.

To put it simply, when you make $25k&#x2F;yr, you care a lot about your CEO making $200m&#x2F;yr, but if you are making $250k&#x2F;yr I don&#x27;t think anyone gives a shit.<p>The parent specified a critical qualifier that I think supports this interpretation and many may be missing. Let&#x27;s make sure we&#x27;re speaking the same language before we start fighting.<p>&gt;&gt; Being productive is really hard when any value produced immediately and __ONLY__ goes towards lining the pockets of the wealthy.<p>The use of &quot;only&quot; differentiates this from &quot;a job.&quot; It implies that they feel not just undervalued, but excessively so. It is the feeling of doing all or most of the work in a group project and only to have someone else take all or the majority of the credit. I believe most of us have been in that situation at some point. I would be shocked to find that a single person that was in that situation wasn&#x27;t resentful of that person. Either you&#x27;re lying (to us or to yourself) or you&#x27;re the chillest person on the fucking planet.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone cares how big CEO compensation is when they&#x27;re living a comfortable life themselves. The relationship between utility and monetary value does not increase linearly for essentially all metrics of utility. Most follow an S-like curve. When you don&#x27;t have a lot, every fucking dollar matters and you&#x27;ll be resentful of anyone stealing any credit from you (scarcity mindset) because the loss is very meaningful. When you&#x27;re comfortable, then money is substantially less important to you and you probably won&#x27;t care as much if credit is taken from you because the loss isn&#x27;t as meaningful. It is actually quite difficult to spend a million dollars a year continuously (or some other Brewster&#x27;s Millions like situation). You can even see this change in places like HN. When everyone was being let go comments about Pichai&#x27;s bonuses and Google&#x27;s stock prices increased. But go back 5 years when there was a bigger boom and all the free stuff and incentives were being given, no one really cared.<p>In this respect I think people focus on the wrong parts of economic inequality. Rather than focusing on the ceiling, focus on the floor. The floor is not the dual of the ceiling because these are not zero sum games (they are for instantaneous or local times, but not in general).<p>Courseofaction, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36368116" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36368116" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">colordrops</span><span>|</span><a href="#36366520">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36366679">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36366924">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36366750">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36368116">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36368116">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Everytime I see the word &quot;entitlement&quot; bandied about, it almost always smacks of entitlement.

We&#x27;ve gotten used to algorithms and mathematical expressions but I don&#x27;t think many have internalized meaning and the actual information that they convey. All metrics are guides, not absolute objective signals. People hear Goodhart&#x27;s Law and think about how metrics can be abused, but the real lesson here is that metrics are only guides. The abuse only happens because they become absolute measures rather than only a part.<p>It may take one person all day to produce 50 lines of code and another 500, but we can&#x27;t differentiate these people by the metric of time, number of lines, nor the number of commits. Even bug and error metrics don&#x27;t complete the story. Those 50 lines could be more critical, more complex, and have higher impact.<p>Realistically, we need to embrace the chaos. Everything is fuzzy and messy, and that&#x27;s actually okay. That&#x27;s how life and the universe actually are. Metrics are good guides to this chaos and help us navigate these complex landscapes, but they all have a limitations, which if we aren&#x27;t aware of can lead to disaster. You need to be aware of the uncertainty and limitations of your metrics. I see a lot of HN&#x2F;STEM like people argue passionately for meritocracies, but have yet to see one of these people account for the limitations of the measures they so passionately advocate for. The irony of this being that this takes us further away from that meritocratic goal and actually increases the noise in the system. To make a system more meritocratic you have to embrace the noise in the system.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36366581" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36366581" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">doitLP</span><span>|</span><a href="#36366613">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36366466">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36366581">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36366581">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; And if I&#x27;m really productive in the morning and afternoon and feel like I can go home at 4pm with a clean conscience, I do that too, so I don&#x27;t burn out.<p>This is the part that is difficult for me.

I burned out hard and even now have to psyche myself up to do all but the most interesting tasks. Everything is hard these days, and so I can no longer rely on my inner Protestant to tell when I’ve done “a good days work”.

Many years ago I was forced to work with a <i>terrible</i> laptop. It was one of those Dell 5cm thick things that were basically cramming a desktop cpu and gpu into someting that looked like someone had bolted a second box undeneeth a standard laptop. Fans ofc screeming loudly all day. So I had the brilliant idea to just run everyting of an external drive so that when I could work from home, I could seamlessly switch to a better computer.<p>Now the powerbrick for the laptop from hell was also huge and heavy (I remember the total package was over 4.5 kg, and the battery lasted 80 minutes when new, so you always needed wallpower), but it had the exact with and lenght of the exteral drive cage. So fancy me had the great idea that when I tidied up my desk putting the drive on top of the powerbrick, ofc neatly allingned with the desk edges, looked perfect.<p>Perfect until the drive crashed hard due to being right on top of the very hot powerbrick. All code was checked into subversion, but the 127 pages of a product manual I had been writing the last week were gone without backup.<p>Having come across the freezer method, I decided to give it a try. Nicely sealed in a ziplock freezer bag, I left the drive in overnight. Tried booting it up the next morning without success. Put it back in the freezer on a whim, but had to start writing the manual anew and forgot a out the drive.<p>I came across the drive again while fetching some peas from the freezer a few weeks later. Gave it another try, and lo and behold, it worked!<p>Learned my lesson about excess heat on drives and no nightly backups though, so never needed this procedure again.</div><br/><div id="37788472" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37788472" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hollander</span><span>|</span><a href="#37787572">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37787855">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37788472">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37788472">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Fans ofc screeming loudly all day.<p>Once I worked in a small office and we used ancient but silent servers and we needed new ones.

The whole board-solder-chip sandwich expands at different rates due to heat, so internal stress and cracks develop in solder joints, which makes them fail.

It&#x27;d help a bit - would cool things a bit faster,* but, eh ... I wouldn&#x27;t expect that to necessarily be a KEY element.<p>That written, temperature may still have been quite important (i.e., reboot alone wouldn&#x27;t help). Particularly with a device containing something like <i>spinning platters</i> (as well as potentially extra heat generation associated with certain failure modes), and the additional factor of laptop heat load trade-offs, ... simply having the laptop off for some minutes might have been essential. In fact, the writer notes that transfer stopped during the first attempt to retrieve the data (after 10 minutes in fridge), hence a second round of 20 minutes was carried out after which the remaining data was retrieved.<p>The fact that that second pause was 20 minutes AND was carried out in a fridge may have had little to no role in success the second time. To me, that&#x27;s something like a 50-50 odds event ... particularly with this kind of infrequent (for an individual, hopefully) &#x27;high-terror&#x27; n=1 event &#x2F; &#x27;data&#x27;.** It may have primarily been the difference between having transferred other files prior to transferring that (last? not checking that detail) file vs. not.<p>* Newton said proportional to temperature difference, but that&#x27;s a rather rough guide in general for this sort of scenario - even with just basic details missing here<p>** I.e., where most people aren&#x27;t too interested in carrying out any kind of more detailed post-mortem ... most are much more interested in leaving the terror part behind.<p><i>Edit: OTOH, one should not discount the power of belief out-of-hand - i.e., &#x27;externum-placebo&#x27; or something to that effect, if you please (my</i> verbum fabulists <i>will know).

Her parents were wealthy and had very manicured lives. They signed her over to an institution at birth. She grew up with people with profound mental retardation. She receive no education. At 20 she was found by an uncle who always suspected something had happened that was not being disclosed. He began to visit her and teach her to read. He explained that she had a right to leave and helped her start her life. In a couple of years she was able to enter University and graduated despite the lack of any education before 20. She developed a friendship with a lady with CP and they were housemates when I met them. She died of pneumonia several years ago due to constricted lung size.

This can lead to extreme and sudden violence that can catch you quite off guard if you are not prepared for it (and even if you are) and cause significant injury. The staff turnover rate and workers comp claims were crazy high as a result and part of the cause of the low pay (although there were many other major factors involved). It can be quite dangerous. Although to be clear this is absolutely not to suggest that someone who is mentally ill or disabled is inherently dangerous of course; this is a small subset of individuals whose functioning was impaired in such a way that made the likelihood of violent behavior significantly more likely. Often it was not intentional violence, more like a childish tantrum except with the body of an adolescent or young adult that could do serious damage. Although occasionally it was serious targeted violence too. I personally still have a permanent neck and spinal injury a decade later as well as a ton of scars from bite marks. I saw much worse. It’s not just some mild annoyance shit, it’s life changing ruin your body kind of injuries.<p>With that serious caveat the other issue is that there’s not really a “standard” name for these programs. They vary by level of care, by provider, by state, and sometimes even by county. But some examples from around me would be residential schools, residential treatment facilities, long term structured residences, etc. more generic terms are things like “group homes” and they’re all considered an extension of psychiatric inpatient treatment facilities.<p>Also fwiw depending on your state&#x2F;locale there may be volunteer opportunities that offer training to help alleviate the above issues. At another program I consulted with later in my career they had volunteers who would socialize in this capacity. It was a really nice program; they would essentially go through a condensed version of the staff training. They wouldn’t do anything like restraints or things like that but they would teach them evasive maneuvers, de escalation techniques, and then train them on the clients a bit with staff before letting them do more independent socialization. Was really nice for the clients. The downside was the really difficult clients who had extreme behavioral issues tended to not get the service and they also tended to be the clients who got visited the least. But that’s the difficulty of the issue; when your behavior gets to that point you kind of need specially trained people around you at all times for safety.<p>And the thing is populations change the frequency of this a bit but not as much as you’d think. I’ve spent most of my career doing pediatric stuff, child and adolescent, with some stints doing 
adult work. All of those populations can have these issues obviously but it does tend to calm a bit with age in my experience. However, I have peers who focus in gerontology and dementia and have similar issues because of the impulse control issues that can come with that diagnosis.<p>I hope this doesn’t scare you off. I only hope to prepare you for the realities of the situation. I would hate to just post “oh yeah go volunteer” and have some kid bite you and have it get infected (human bites get infected super easily if they break skin, mouths are nasty!) or have your hair pulled and get your neck all messed up. You can do this and be safe if you are prepared and trained, you don’t need to be hypervigilant (that can actually make things worse), but you do need to be aware of your surroundings and know how to position yourself safely. That all said my suggestion would be to find a residential facility near you and contact them directly to see if they have any volunteer opportunities. If they just invite you they most likely have a population where none of this is a concern and you are good to go. If they offer training and you’re up to it go for it, you’ll learn a lot about safe positioning and de escalation techniques. If they ignore you I’m sorry, a lot of these places are overwhelmed and constantly short staffed unfortunately</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37399645" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37399645" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gumby</span><span>|</span><a href="#37400048">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37399162">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37399645">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37399645">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My dad had an Uncle Charles (probably born around 1910) who didn&#x27;t live with the family.

Anorexic people exaggerate how fat they are and how much (how little) they eat, and that’s clearly some kind of illness that needs medical intervention and medication as needed to get them proper. Same for fat people, I think fat people have something wrong with them where the whole process of eat food -&gt; feel sated is off. If everything I ate felt like half the portion is actually was I’d also be totally fucked up in how I understood my portion sizes too and would probably inadvertently lie on “objective” measures too!<p>Like I don’t know how much a portion of chicken is.

Yes, you&#x27;ll lose weight if you run a caloric deficit; the SMTM argument is that something is messing with what they call the &quot;lipostat&quot;, which regulates how much your body thinks you should be eating. So when your body is yelling at you that you&#x27;re starving (even though you aren&#x27;t), it&#x27;s very hard not to overeat, because hunger is right there at the bottom of the Maslow pyramid and it takes inordinate willpower to consistently ignore it.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;achemicalhunger.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;achemicalhunger.com&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37401950" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37401950" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crdrost</span><span>|</span><a href="#37399162">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37400799">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37400844">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37401069">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37401950">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37401950">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just to be clear, I am trained as a physicist and I am not criticizing the thermodynamics as <i>incorrect</i> but rather <i>insufficient</i>.<p>It is <i>also</i> incorrect, which is to say that there is only a vague relationship between the kilocalories reported on the side of the box and the actual marginal energy absorbed into your body. This is due to multiple factors. The most basic is measurement methodology: “count up the carbs in grams and multiply by 4 because this one ancient paper claimed that was the right fudge factor to average all carbohydrates with”; then there is the reality that the carbs described as “dietary fiber” on the label should never have been counted in the first place; add to this that the fudge factor for protein is <i>also</i> 4 kcal&#x2F;gr even though it is known that proteins require twice the energy input from your body to be metabolized. If you&#x27;re a physicist you&#x27;re hoping for very clean simple measurements, “we put this into a calorimeter and burned it, or maybe we let some bacteria rot the thing in a sealed jar and monitored the oxygen in there” or something. The nutrition facts are nothing of the sort! (Related: the scale llliiieeesss, it lies, liar liar pants on fire how it lies.)<p>However the bigger problem is that it is <i>insufficient</i>. For instance if you are worried about health outcomes, like diabetes risks, it turns out that calories in minus calories out doesn&#x27;t predict those well. Both Omega-3 fats and trans fats are given the same fudge factor of 9 kcal&#x2F;gr, but one is significantly less healthy than the other.<p>It&#x27;s not even terribly helpful to understand the full context of weight gain. Did you know that before our species grew up in Africa, our ape ancestors actually grew up in Europe? During this process they lost the ability to make an enzyme called uricase, which helps most other mammals eliminate a waste product called uric acid from the body. The loss of this enzyme is usually chalked up to, “those apes needed to put on a lot of weight really fast at harvest time before the winter came up”—google «uricase evolution» to learn more. So we actually have a hardwired tendency which most mammals do not have, to consume fructose and not consciously register those kilocalories as satiety signal, and instead we pack on those kilocalories as fat because of our artificially high uric acid levels. Wild stuff.<p>The physics curriculum does touch on this but in a strange place: it&#x27;s the courses where we teach kids to analyze circuits made with nonlinear components like op-amps and transistors. So there&#x27;s the thermodynamic fact of calories in, calories out... but it also comes with a sales pitch which is trying to provide a simple answer that would work for a linear system, “just perturb this input a little bit and you will get the corresponding output.” But nonlinear systems don&#x27;t work that way!</div><br/></div></div><div id="37401069" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37401069" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nradov</span><span>|</span><a href="#37399162">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37400799">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37401950">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37401127">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37401069">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37401069">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For some real life examples see the &quot;Secret Eaters&quot; TV series.

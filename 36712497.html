That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m in favour of SMS based auth for really important services like banking and government services. Your phone got broken&#x2F;lost? Most providers offer replacement sims immediately or in 24h at worst around here. Your phone is broken, but you have an old 20 year old flip phone? Pop your card in there (with a plastic frame) and you can still authenticate (another reason against non physical sim cards).<p>I saw mentions that SMS is insecure, but I never heard about a credible remote attack that didn&#x27;t include provider cooperation or taking over your phone. (someone driving to your house and setting up a fake cell tower in your yard doesn&#x27;t count for most people). Yes, the user experience is annoying to say the least. Consider the current system we have in Poland for government services (taxes, health care, driving agency, benefits). Most people use their bank as the auth provider a typical session would look like this:
- go to a gov website, click login, be present with various login options that include personal certs etc, choose your bank from the list
- login to your bank&#x27;s system the normal way (with physical 2fa if you have it, printed keys, or SMS).
- then the bank asks you &quot;do you want to provide auth request that contains these personal detail to _gov_agency_A, if yes tick these 4 boxes that absolve us from anything you do down the line
- then they send you another SMS to confirm finally authenticating you to the site
- you can browse the site etc, but let&#x27;s say you want to send in a document that requires signing, you fill that document online and they ask you &quot;select your signing provider&quot; (despite already being logged in
- you select your bank, you go through two rounds of SMS again to sign the doc
- phew... Done<p>It&#x27;s rather elaborate and hinges on SMS being secure. Most older people get lost at around &quot;tick these 4 boxes&quot; part, so most likely the whole process is being done for them by a local gov&#x2F;library&#x2F;internet cafe employee or a relative.<p>Is it secure? It&#x27;s pretty annoying to use, but personally I consider the security adequate.

If Chrome becomes aware that manufacturers are not maintaining their attestation metadata we may choose to disable attestation for those devices in order to ensure a healthy ecosystem.<p>e.g., it is acceptable for a bank or other public-facing site to say &quot;we&#x27;ll only accept authenticators which have been L2 certified via this independent program that maintains an up-to-date list&quot;.<p>It is not acceptable to say &quot;we&#x27;ll only accept this one vendor&#x27;s products, and maybe another vendor after a 2 year audit if we feel a business need&quot;.<p>And Chrome has stated publicly that they will remove some or all of the WebAuthn API from your domain if you do so.</div><br/><div id="36719875" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36719875" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nazgulsenpai</span><span>|</span><a href="#36713427">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36718835">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36720451">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36719875">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36719875">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So Google will be the arbiter?

Displayable site and user account names, a user record handle, and the private key all take up storage, along with a few other items.<p>A mobile phone could store 10 thousand passkeys without breaking a sweat. Modern hardware keys might only be able to store 25 total in available flash.<p>The reason for wanting this storage is discoverability - the ability to hit say GitHub.com&#x27;s new passkey support on the login page, and log in without having to even type in an account name. The browser provides a password manager-like experience. Just like passwords in a password manager, the passkey locally becomes a record of an account on a site.<p>However, WebAuthn also has quite a few other, non-passkey modes. Non-discoverable credentials expect you to provide a list of handles for a particular user account, which were provided by the keys as part of registration. Only credentials which match a handle are given as options during authentication. For hardware security keys, they leverage this to actually store the record needed for the future cryptography in the handle itself - this mode doesn&#x27;t take up flash storage.<p>So the user would type their username, some API returns a list of handles, and this could be used against a security key to authenticate - without no storage limitations.<p>The problem with this argument IMHO is that a lot of sites take a policy of not revealing if an account exists or not. We&#x27;ve seen recovery processes that say &quot;if this account exists, you should receive an email shortly&quot;. A login process that provides an API to detect if a username or email address has an associated account and how many credentials have been recorded against it may simply not be acceptable to the site.<p>It seems more likely that we eventually have security keys with 10x the available storage, rather than sites adopting this process widely enough to make an impact against the current hardware limits.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36716454" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36716454" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dcow</span><span>|</span><a href="#36716366">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36719082">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36712932">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36716454">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36716454">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s a poorly argued point, agree.

As a result, users will be pressured into using passkeys often, run out of precious passkey space despite thinking they have plenty, and then be forced to forego the benefits moving forward or reset and lose their keys.<p>Is that more or less accurate?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36712932" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36712932" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">saulrh</span><span>|</span><a href="#36716366">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36718028">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36712932">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36712932">[43 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s a rather uncharitable take on the situation.

Resident keys aren&#x27;t necessary for that use case since by the time you get to the second factor step you already know the account you&#x27;re trying to log into.<p>Further, the autocomplete functionality afforded by resident keys is important for the UX of passkeys in my opinion. I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to sacrifice that in order to to retain backwards compatibility with a small number of keys that only security nerds use.

At this point, the idea everyone is converged on is that you have a locally encrypted secure &quot;vault&quot; of some kind, that you can trust, and you need to verify identity with <i>that</i> system, perhaps with a password and perhaps with a key. It is easier to have some trust that your password manager of choice is more secure, rather than having to assume that every service in existence you create an account for is secure (or unphishable.) So, by the time you use a passkey, you&#x27;re quite often in a more secure context where you&#x27;ve already established that identity: to your operating system, to your password manager that owns your passkeys, etc.<p>It also seems likely that places that didn&#x27;t support hardware keys now or recently probably wouldn&#x27;t have supported them in the near future. But the ROI for a Passkey solution is likely much higher since the buy in (just some software support) is much easier for people to achieve. Of course, this is only true for websites mainly; a Passkey is basically the equivalent of &quot;Standardized SSH keys&quot; for a website.<p>I see hardware keys as more useful for second factors like actually <i>unlocking</i> your vault with your passkeys inside of it, which might also want a password. I suspect hardware keys still have a bit of life left in them.<p>The Passkey login flow is actually super, super nice now that I can use it on GitHub, Gmail, etc as a primary method.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36717564" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36717564" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway892238</span><span>|</span><a href="#36713604">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36713916">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36718159">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36717564">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36717564">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Password managers have already made passwords obsolete.

Passkeys are an insanely overcomplicated solution we don&#x27;t really need.<p>Browsers just need a simple HATEOAS API for password managers to hook into, and web apps expose some HTML that triggers the browser. The password manager can then determine how to authenticate the user (however <i>the user</i> wants!), auto-inject the secret for that website, and the user is automatically logged in. E-mail reset if anything goes wrong.<p>From the &quot;we&#x27;re a website that wants super fancy security&quot; perspective, I get that they want something more complex. But there should be levels of security that the user can opt-in to.<p>For example: most websites are fine with a simple password hash, assuming the password manager uses random passwords. Any website can implement that, every password manager can implement that, and it&#x27;s better than 99% of regular users&#x27; password use today. So there&#x27;s your baseline auth method.<p>Then if you want something like TOTP, OIDC, public-key crypto, etc the server can advertise it, the client can opt-in to it, and authentication can continue. But not every site needs to implement it, and not every user cares to use it. Basically, we don&#x27;t need every site and every user to use the most secure methods.

The passwords could have been extracted in so many ways because it depends on easily transferable knowledge.<p>Moving the authentication interface to device2device is actually much better, you no longer assume that the easily transferable knowledge was not transferred. Instead, you assume that the biological being is capable of keeping track of the authentication device and people are naturally good at it.<p>You can increase the number of authentication channels to tighten it up a bit, you can restrict the authentication of the biological  being with the device(FaceID) which will be used for authentication with remote systems but at the core I think it feels right to assume device(phone, key etc.) means the person.<p>It&#x27;s also quite a human thing to do. At home, we share not only the Netflix password but one of the credit cards. For practical reason, one credit card stays with the spare keys and when there&#x27;s something to buy for the house anyone can grab that card and use it. We trust each other that the card would be used properly, everyone knows the pin code but that&#x27;s rarely needed since contactless payment is the norm anyway. It&#x27;s much more natural than keeping track of the expenses and then pay each other the outstanding amounts. However, It&#x27;s probably illegal and if the bank finds out about it, they will cancel the card.<p>IMHO, the IT systems desperately need to approach human behaviour by working in analogous ways with the real world. Since I&#x27;m involved with IT systems I don&#x27;t struggle most of the time but people who are not that tech savvy are having hard time figuring out daily stuff like What is the iPhone&#x27;s password for, What is the iCloud password for, what is the Gmail password for, why I need to enter a code in WhatsApp etc.<p>Actually, I think I struggle too - I never came along to understand Mastadon.

Since nobody else is &quot;in computers&quot; they really don&#x27;t have a clue about what things need passwords and why. They would NEVER voluntarily complicate their lives with 2FA or even with a password manager.

The purpose of 2FA was to pitch instead to use authentication processes that counteract the weaknesses through layering.<p>Platform authenticators aren&#x27;t just providing an authentication technique - they are a user-supplied authentication and recovery process.<p>Even understanding the entire workflow of that process, you may not have the ability to retrofit that into a _larger_ process to meet your regulatory and security requirements. But that workflow is actually per vendor, per device, configurable by the end user, and evolving over time.<p>This has been an ongoing problem for ages, because the &#x27;knowledge factor&#x27; was actually often something the user didn&#x27;t know, but something provided by a software agent (password manager) which had its own configurable authentication and recovery processes. It just eventually got ignored as people shifted to thinking of the second factor as &#x27;the thing that makes up for all possible weaknesses of the password&#x27;.<p>IMHO this is why passkeys are pitched as a replacement for passwords, e.g. as a knowledge factor. It may eliminate your site&#x27;s need for another factor if you were mostly concerned about phishing. It stops you from needing to use breach lists, and limits the impact if your credential table gets exposed.<p>It isn&#x27;t a great fit for regulated&#x2F;secure environments, which may still need to do all the same additional factors for risk mitigation or compliance.

There&#x27;s no real &quot;emulation.&quot; 1Password 8 supports them just fine, your browser has APIs so third-party software can integrate exactly for that. So, the answer to your question is pretty much &quot;exactly the same scenario as your password manager getting leaked&quot;, which is basically unsurprising and already well understood when you frame it this way, I think.<p>The particular case I was referring to (and probably should have been clearer about) was when a <i>website operator</i> gets hacked; in that case the only information an attacker gains from your user account is a public key, which isn&#x27;t of much use. But like, that&#x27;s actually a major issue in practice, because the value of hacking a service operator is often far greater than just one user. That exact scenario was one of the motivations for using password managers in the first place, too, to mitigate operators getting hacked and common passwords getting reused between users, thus turning a single compromise for many users into <i>multiple</i> compromises for many users. So, it all has come full circle in a sense; now we&#x27;ve finally recognized that instead than shoehorning passwords into becoming psuedo-random strings that might as well be base64 encoded bytes from &#x2F;dev&#x2F;urandom, you might as well go &quot;all the way&quot; and just get those raw bytes from &#x2F;dev&#x2F;urandom directly and then use them as key material for a public key exchange.<p>Again, the best analogy is to just imagine that you used SSH keys to log into a website. That&#x27;s all this is. It&#x27;s software. Then you remember: oh yeah, SSH key synchronization and enrollment across machines sucks ass, and normal people would hate doing it. Hey, you know what, we already use passwords to encrypt SSH keys -- so what if we added a storage synchronization layer between your machines to keep those SSH private keys synchronized, encrypted with that password, and stored using $FAVORITE_SERVICE_PROVIDER? That&#x27;s pretty much it, in a nutshell. You just reinvented modern Passkeys. Most of the threat models at that point are well understood: what service provider or software to choose, how secure is the local encryption, should you use two-factor authentication to further improve unlock safety, etc.</div><br/><div id="36717050" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36717050" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">autoexec</span><span>|</span><a href="#36713604">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36715284">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36718165">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36717050">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36717050">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; when a website operator gets hacked; in that case the only information an attacker gains from your user account is a public key, which isn&#x27;t of much use.<p>How is that different from situations where a website gets hacked and all the attacker gets is a well-hashed version of a unique password?

But in practice they are aiming to actually be better, faster to use, and more secure since every Passkey implementation is basically designed around syncing (iOS 17 TBD) and device authentication, and they are phishing resistant, which seemingly nothing else can hope to solve so we just gave up on solving it and don&#x27;t ever mention it because it&#x27;s the users fault that they did it.

It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you&#x27;re logging in as root or a normal user, on your VPS or a friends box. People just use SSH keys instead. Everything works around SSH keys today. People do not want to deal with your secret key material. Passkeys are in many ways just SSH keys for the browser.

Point being, I think there&#x27;s a point but it was hard to get there.<p>Anyway:<p>1. <i>Passkeys</i>, to me, are the private key. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether it&#x27;s resident or not, or whether it&#x27;s device bound (non-extractable) or not, whether a &quot;genuine&quot; authenticator made the signature or not, or whether user presence was verified or not.

Additionally, where I diverge from the author, I don&#x27;t think preserving the sanctity of decade old hardware keys which only conform to older versions of a TPM spec is of paramount concern, either.

But I also don&#x27;t think RPs need to care about whether the key is resident or not. Let the library on the user&#x27;s browser&#x2F;device decide how to find the key. An RP wanting to verify user presence is one thing, but saying this key must be stored with the user IMO <i>is</i> a step too far. It&#x27;s likely that RPs don&#x27;t even care and are just avoiding wanting to store some extra bytes in their DB. Or their security team overly cares and is making up reasons why the RP needs to require resident keys (IMO bad security take all things considered) but I can see the tin-foil angle).<p>So I think the simple solution is probably to, for WebAuthN specifically, deprecate the ability for the RP to specify that it needs a resident key. Problem solved.<p>Oh and while we&#x27;re at it, forbid hardware attestation. The <i>web</i> doesn&#x27;t need that. If rk=required and hardware attestation need to exist for tightly controlled enterprise use cases then whatever, but relegate them there preferably in some non-required protocol extension.</div><br/><div id="36713933" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36713933" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dathinab</span><span>|</span><a href="#36713657">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36720625">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36713933">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36713933">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">no not far enough<p>residual keys are IMHO a security misdesign and shouldn&#x27;t exist<p>but now the industry hype is pushing to make the the de-facto mandatory way</div><br/><div id="36714038" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36714038" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dcow</span><span>|</span><a href="#36713657">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36713933">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36720625">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36714038">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36714038">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not clear on what you mean by this.

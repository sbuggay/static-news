I can&#x27;t vouch for the accuracy of it, but he was definitely on to <i>something</i>: In the West, it is assumed that it is the speaker&#x27;s job to make himself understood to his listeners. In the East, it is the other way around.<p>In recent times, it seems like we&#x27;ve gotten even more extreme. The speaker or writer must not only spoon-feed the understanding, they also have to provide the motivation and the entertainment. Which I find sad, because some things you can&#x27;t get unless you go to the effort of extracting them yourself. (See many reproducible psychology findings about retention being highly correlated with depth of processing, for example.) It&#x27;s like the information equivalent of highly processed food.<p>I find myself falling into this trap on sites like this. An interesting but difficult article will be posted, I won&#x27;t immediately know what to think or where I stand on the topic, and I&#x27;ll flip to the comments so that I can get some part of the collective to tell me what to think and how to feel about it. Which is also sad.<p>In paintings, it is known that the viewer can get out more than the painter put in. It used to be the same with writing, but it feels like that is becoming more rare and less acceptable. If a reader can&#x27;t follow the argument, it&#x27;s automatically the author&#x27;s fault and a waste of the reader&#x27;s time.

On the surface level, it&#x27;s about the events of the life of Augustus Caesar (better known in the book as &quot;Octavian&quot;)—but on a deeper level, it&#x27;s about the rarity of longtime friends in life, and dealing with aging and one&#x27;s mortality. I put the novel off for a year because I thought I had to read a non-fiction historical account of Augustus&#x27;s life first, as I thought I couldn&#x27;t appreciate the novel without doing so, due to the unfamiliar character names and events. But one day, I just decided to try it out—and I found myself naturally remembering the character names and events without special care in reading the novel.<p>Similar experiences have been reported by people engaging with various forms of media. I&#x27;ve seen readers take copious notes on the novel &quot;Infinite Jest,&quot; which has a reputation for being a difficult read, only to burn out. In contrast, readers who have finished the novel said that they didn&#x27;t need to take notes, and that the story began to make sense simply by reading more.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen a similar pattern from subjects as academic mathematics, where some learners spend too much time on textbook explanations instead of working on the textbook problems, to subjects as relaxed as computer role-playing games, in which some players end up dropping these games due to a perceived need to take notes to understand the story, before they can get immersed in the game&#x27;s world.<p>I think a lot more understanding and enjoyment of various subjects can be attained by being comfortable with confusion for a while. While note-taking has its place in understanding a subject, I&#x27;ve personally found that immersion is the most important factor for understanding.</div><br/><div id="40871045" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40871045" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">senkora</span><span>|</span><a href="#40870823">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40871346">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40871045">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40871045">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I finished Infinite Jest without taking notes. I definitely missed a lot of stuff but I loved the experience and it ended up being one of my favorite books.<p>I think Infinite Jest is a great example for this sort of thing because I later realized that I had completely missed the entire main plot. By the author:<p>&gt; There is an ending as far as I’m concerned. Certain kind of parallel lines are supposed to start converging in such a way that an “end” can be projected by the reader somewhere beyond the right frame. If no such convergence or projection occurred to you, then the book’s failed for you.<p>Nothing converged for me at all and yet I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I’m still not quite sure what to think of that.<p>Aaron Swartz (yep, that Aaron Swartz) wrote a great essay that explains the ending and main plot in clear language:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aaronsw.com&#x2F;weblog&#x2F;ijend" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aaronsw.com&#x2F;weblog&#x2F;ijend</a><p>But I don’t think I got any part of that plot by reading the book.

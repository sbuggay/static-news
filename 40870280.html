If the book we are reading does not wake us up with a blow to the head, then why read the book?
To make us happy, as you write?
My God, we would be just as happy if we had no books, and those books that make us happy, we could write ourselves if necessary.
But we need the books that affect us like a disaster, that hurts us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like if we were being driven into forests, away from all people, like a suicide, a book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us.&quot; [2]<p>[1] Brief an Oskar Pollak, 27.

On the surface level, it&#x27;s about the events of the life of Augustus Caesar (better known in the book as &quot;Octavian&quot;)—but on a deeper level, it&#x27;s about the rarity of longtime friends in life, and dealing with aging and one&#x27;s mortality. I put the novel off for a year because I thought I had to read a non-fiction historical account of Augustus&#x27;s life first, as I thought I couldn&#x27;t appreciate the novel without doing so, due to the unfamiliar character names and events. But one day, I just decided to try it out—and I found myself naturally remembering the character names and events without special care in reading the novel.<p>Similar experiences have been reported by people engaging with various forms of media. I&#x27;ve seen readers take copious notes on the novel &quot;Infinite Jest,&quot; which has a reputation for being a difficult read, only to burn out. In contrast, readers who have finished the novel said that they didn&#x27;t need to take notes, and that the story began to make sense simply by reading more.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen a similar pattern from subjects as academic mathematics, where some learners spend too much time on textbook explanations instead of working on the textbook problems, to subjects as relaxed as computer role-playing games, in which some players end up dropping these games due to a perceived need to take notes to understand the story, before they can get immersed in the game&#x27;s world.<p>I think a lot more understanding and enjoyment of various subjects can be attained by being comfortable with confusion for a while. While note-taking has its place in understanding a subject, I&#x27;ve personally found that immersion is the most important factor for understanding.</div><br/><div id="40871045" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40871045" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">senkora</span><span>|</span><a href="#40870823">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40871346">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40871045">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40871045">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I finished Infinite Jest without taking notes. I definitely missed a lot of stuff but I loved the experience and it ended up being one of my favorite books.<p>I think Infinite Jest is a great example for this sort of thing because I later realized that I had completely missed the entire main plot. By the author:<p>&gt; There is an ending as far as I’m concerned. Certain kind of parallel lines are supposed to start converging in such a way that an “end” can be projected by the reader somewhere beyond the right frame. If no such convergence or projection occurred to you, then the book’s failed for you.<p>Nothing converged for me at all and yet I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I’m still not quite sure what to think of that.<p>Aaron Swartz (yep, that Aaron Swartz) wrote a great essay that explains the ending and main plot in clear language:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aaronsw.com&#x2F;weblog&#x2F;ijend" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aaronsw.com&#x2F;weblog&#x2F;ijend</a><p>But I don’t think I got any part of that plot by reading the book.

The story was occasionally hard to follow. But that was part of &quot;cyberpunk&quot;, at least initially. If you were really about to read a report from a different possible world, you also wouldn&#x27;t understand everything. In reality not everything serves some central plot. There are always superfluous details, and (especially for fictional settings) things that are hard to understand for the outsider.<p>I remember reading, a few years ago, Amazon reviews of the 1990 William Gibson&#x2F;Bruce Sterling novel &quot;The Difference Engine&quot;. Apparently most people expected a normal novel, just with a &quot;steampunk&quot; setting, so naturally they were disappointed and complained about the book being confusing. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a cyberpunk novel. Which is a literary genre, not merely a setting like steampunk. (The latter term didn&#x27;t even exist when the book came out.)<p>I remember Stanisław Lem (an SF author well-known outside the English speaking world) said approximate this about historical novels: Historical novels have the advantage of <i>depth</i>, they can reference a world that is much more complex than required for their plot, they can set themselves in the deep complexity of actual history -- whereas fantasy and sci-fi books must always rely on their own made-up world, which almost necessarily looks flat and shallow in comparison, even if it seems spectacular on the surface.<p>I really came to understand this when I read Umberto Eco&#x27;s &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;. All the historical details are so intricate that they are almost impossible to match by a novelist writing about a fantasy world or the far future.<p>This is, perhaps, also why The Lord of the Rings is such a great fantasy story, and why most other fantasy stories fall short in comparison: Tolkien didn&#x27;t just write a novel. He invented a fictional language first, then an elaborate fictional history around it, and the Lord of the Rings is really just a small part of this story near the end. When reading the book, you constantly read allusions to &quot;historical details&quot; about things that happened thousands of years ago in Valinor, Beleriand, Númenor, in certain ancient wars etc. These &quot;superfluous details&quot; are occasionally hard to understand (except if you read Tolkien&#x27;s posthumous &quot;Silmarillion&quot;, which his son compiled from fragments) but they approximate something like the depth that usually only a historical novel can achieve.</div><br/><div id="40877761" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40877761" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TillE</span><span>|</span><a href="#40875577">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40873263">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40877761">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40877761">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; All the historical details are so intricate that they are almost impossible to match by a novelist writing about a fantasy world or the far future.<p>This is a thing game designer &#x2F; writer Ken Hite always says [1], and he&#x27;s absolutely right. If you dig deep enough into even the most boring corner of history, you will find more interesting details than any person could possibly invent. And if you base your creative work on an exciting part of history that people are familiar with, you have huge advantages.<p>[1] It&#x27;s a frequent subject on his podcast, but this talk is also good introduction: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wwVcbZ0CKCY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wwVcbZ0CKCY</a></div><br/><div id="40879929" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40879929" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">NoMoreNicksLeft</span><span>|</span><a href="#40875577">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40877761">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40873263">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40879929">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40879929">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; you will find more interesting details than any person could possibly invent.<p>Than any <i>non-Tolkien</i> person could invent.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40873263" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40873263" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">monacobolid</span><span>|</span><a href="#40875577">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40871679">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40873263">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40873263">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Related to &quot;I don&#x27;t entirely understand what I just read, but I loved it&quot; from the article - some time ago (I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s been years now), there was a submission on HN (at least I believe I found it on HN, though I&#x27;m not 100% sure) about rules for critiquing art (again, I&#x27;m not 100% certain, but this is how I remember it).

The purest version of understanding is kind of a personal relationship to a piece of media. A relationship you form while engaging with it that enlivens your life and has the potential to broaden your horizons. But we live in a moment where it&#x27;s very popular to talk about &quot;the right understanding of media&quot;[1] and therefor everyone begins to need to explain their relationship to every piece of media to their friends.<p>The bare experience of reading The Baroque Cycle completely stuffed full of historical references you don&#x27;t understand is kind of its own immersive experience in a less media-rich climate. You kind of get a sense what it might be like to have no access to education and run into like, Leonardo da Vinci or whoever. But then it comes time to explain that experience to someone else and they might think you were silly for not just looking the names up.<p>I just think it&#x27;s too bad. I once almost broke my wrist snow boarding, but my friend wanted to finish the day so I hung out in our car. The medics had given me a dose of percocet[2] for the pain and I had just started Neuromancer. Finishing that book in that hot car, slightly high, has both erased all of &quot;what happens&quot; from my mind and left me with this kind of indelliable feeling of what it was like to be reading the book. I didn&#x27;t understand it and feel all the better for it.<p>[1] I think it&#x27;s very easy to understand why people want to set others straight on points like this, even if I don&#x27;t like the ecosystem it creates.<p>[2] I think it was percocet?

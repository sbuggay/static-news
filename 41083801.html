I did pull it off after a tenday of work or so, undercutting the cheapest offer by about 70% (and the most expensive one by about 95% or so...), but there was a <i>lot</i> of intricate reading and experimentation involved.<p>I am looking forward to validate my understanding against the content of this article - it looks very promising and comprehensive at first and second glance!

The reason: our systems run in containers that are stripped down versions of some Linux, and I don’t have shell access to production systems (and usually reproducing a bug on a dev or qa environment is useless because they are very different from prod in terms of load and the like).<p>So the only chance of running any of the commands in the article are when playing around with my own systems.

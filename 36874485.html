What we&#x27;ve seen happen over and over is that product A needs Feature A, and product B needs Feature B, and they both need it tomorrow, and the platform team only has resources for one. And since Product A and Product B are in different business divisions, you end up needing to involve a senior VP or even an officer to make a prioritization decision for a simple software feature, and everyone gets frustrated by the process.<p>What we&#x27;re striving towards instead is an &quot;inner source&quot; model, where a platform is collaboratively developped and maintained by multiple product teams. Each product team is then empowered to build new features as needed into the platform, and others can reuse them.<p>Of course, the platform needs some architects and overall review, and all teams will not equally participate. But the key point is to encourage this collaboration mode, where no one team is a bottleneck for multiple products.<p>The inspiration for this structure is obviously the open-source world, where multiple corporations and foundations collaborate on a single code base without needing to rely on a single platform vendor to provide features for them.</div><br/><div id="36904430" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36904430" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">manbearbig</span><span>|</span><a href="#36903844">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36904441">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36904430">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36904430">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sounds like you were working at a terrible organisation, not that there is anything wrong with running a platform team.

Sounds like a design-by-committee dumpster fire. Teams need ownership of their product to perform effectively. You can claim that this is collective ownership of the platform, but in reality no one will feel any responsibility for the platform when things don&#x27;t work or don&#x27;t align entirely with the particular thing they are currently working on.<p>And have you ever looked at the source code for most open source software? It&#x27;s an absolute mess that requires the collective effort of large numbers of people to keep it going.

It&#x27;s very frustrating and limits product team velocity. That said, in my experience this is mainly due to a misinterpretation and mis-implementation of platform teams. Too often, platform teams are forced upon product teams. This misses an essential element of a platform, optionality. A platform should be a jumping board, that people can choose to accelerate development. When a platform is made mandatory it misses essential feedback mechanisms, such as rate of adoption, for it to steer in the right direction. While the rate of adoption is still often seen as a metric for a platform team&#x27;s success, the mandate to enforce the platform onto product teams is fundamentally corrupting. In addition, the tools to truly accelerate development are not the same as time progresses. Without optionality, there is never the incentive to sunset anything the platform provides. Deviations of technology&#x2F;pattern&#x2F;solution use are often seen as negative aspects of the product team&#x27;s performance, but rarely reflect back on the platform team&#x27;s output.<p>TLDR; platform teams without product team&#x27;s freedom to deviate (optionality) is corrupt and can destroy a large chunk of engineering velocity.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36904230" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36904230" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DanielHB</span><span>|</span><a href="#36903844">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36904441">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36903964">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36904230">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36904230">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; What we&#x27;re striving towards instead is an &quot;inner source&quot; model, where a platform is collaboratively developped and maintained by multiple product teams.

But constraints like this are what makes a model useful. Team Topologies is a tool that impels people to evolve their organization into a more effective way of operating, one that allows stream-aligned teams to maximize their flow by lightening their cognitive load.

It further reinforces my sense that these pompous sounding vacuities are a marketing tool and have no intrinsic applicability.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36903140" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36903140" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jauntywundrkind</span><span>|</span><a href="#36903398">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36903244">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36903140">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36903140">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s a lot that I like about this book. Splitting up the mandate between platform and products teams, and eliminating friction, letting each team be good at their thing is I think an efficiency many companies indeed could benefit from.<p>But I&#x27;ve also seen this book promoted heavily within an org, and the one core strength kept feeling like a core weakness that mades me incredibly sad, about how isolated it made work.<p>It doesn&#x27;t insist it has to be so, but the org I saw that was so excited for TEam Topologies loved how it continually stressed independence of teams. And as a direct result, I&#x27;ve seen cooperation, coordination, &amp; cross-team planning plummet. In ways that keep having suboptimal plans get put into action with bad outcomes. Stream aligned teams would turn into complicated subsystem teams, after they created something complicated and gnarly while being stream&#x2F;product aligned, and unchecked.<p>I think the topologies here are quite useful framings, and as Fowler says the idea of trying to reduce cognitive complexity is an interesting one we haven&#x27;t heard well represented before. And is probably due given how impractical making each team truly full stack devops has become, as the CI&#x2F;CD&#x2F;observability stack complexity has expanded. But I caution so much against the messages this book gives management, which is that stream&#x2F;product aligned teams just need to be racehorses with blinders on &amp; interference is bad. The book glories the stream aligned team, the value creator, and makes everyone else auxiliary, which is sort of true &amp; great. But the book&#x27;s glorification of execution speed doesn&#x27;t leave much space for how and where cross-team wisdom happens, what kind of processes you have there. Broader cross-team architecture reviews, brainstorming, systems planning, systems coordination aren&#x27;t well captured here: most teams need a strong <i>collaboration mode</i> to build <i>good</i> software that <i>fits</i> the architecture well. But the book only really regards a single collaboration need: those of platform teams to get feedback to ease their Developer&#x27;s Experience.<p>The missing element was ubuntu. <i>If you want to go fast, go alone.

I think beyond a certain size, independence <i>of the team</i> is the prize. You are not alone, for you have your mates. Beyond your team, trying to collaborate is like herding cats. Every team has its own priorities, everything moves more slowly, and the more stakeholders there are, the greater the risk of the project falling through. Bezos&#x27; stipulation that teams communicate through interfaces was a stroke of genius. This created a standard which allowed teams to self serve.<p>I agree that teams must collaborate to go farther. One team can only do so much. Management should make sure all the teams stay aligned and hold them all accountable, but the teams themselves should still strive to be independent.<p>It sounds like what your organization needed was a project manager to co-ordinate or a forum for the teams to share information.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36903799" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36903799" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seer</span><span>|</span><a href="#36903140">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36903254">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36903371">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36903799">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36903799">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Iâve experienced something akin to the isolation you experienced in a relatively mid sized (about 300 devs) org. While team isolation made it possible to move fast, there was a lot of chaos and duplicated effort all over the place, lessons learned was promptly forgotten etc.<p>I think what made it kinda work is when they introduced âinfraâ dev teams that tried to see what the global problems were and solve them on a library&#x2F;infra level.<p>Networking was one terraform module away, kafka integration was solved with in house abstractions, design systems, knowledge bases, etc. While not perfect there was a sense that âif its too gnarly a solution, ask around, somebody probably already solved it more elegantlyâ.<p>They would talk to all the teams and if someone developed an elegant package&#x2F;lib&#x2F;idea they would promote it to other teams.<p>Key was to have people working explicitly on tech sharing and global problem solving.

In fact many of you who attended university and studied at a &quot;school of computer science&quot; would have been in a building next to a &quot;school of education&quot;.<p>This post is interesting, but it reads like a layperson (from a teaching point of view) coming up with some fairly good theories of learning (of which there are quite a few) and discussing how applying them makes concrete differences in knowledge acquisition.<p>If I was to make a guess, I&#x27;d say that the &#x27;effortful&#x27; component the author discusses is most aligned with something commonly called the &quot;transformation&quot; stage of learning -- where the student takes things they have heard, seen, or experienced and attempts to transform some part of the world using them. A silly but apt example would be watching a youtube video on solving a rubik&#x27;s cube, then having to transform the state of a real rubik&#x27;s cube using your new knowledge.<p>This idea, and related ones, continue to be discussed at length by those who develop curriculum for educational institutions, and at a more meta-level, those who develop lessons for students who will later write a curriculum! I see a few links in sibling comments to Aviation learning, Youtube, PBS, but not to documents produced by any university on theory of learning.

only two of the forms of teacher training we study influence productivity. First,
content-focused teacher professional development is positively associated with
productivity in middle and high school math. Second, more experienced teachers
appear more effective in teaching elementary math and reading and middle school
math. There is no evidence that either pre-service (undergraduate) training or the
scholastic aptitude of teachers influences their ability to increase student
achievement.<p>The evidence is that teachers learn literally nothing (or overall nothing - maybe they learn some good things and some harmful myths) in teacher college. They might learn a bit of math, which helps them teach math. IIRC it&#x27;s also found that doing a PhD in education can be helpful in teaching classes with a heavy essay writing focus.<p>It&#x27;s not surprising, since a lot of what gets taught in teacher college is junk psychology from the 1930s, and the essays of the kind of people who do a PhD in education. Here&#x27;s a few of the biases that they tend to have (IMO):<p>* Education experts did OK at school, and think that the fundamentals are boring because their white upper-middle-class parents helped them learn phonics and the times tables.<p>* Education experts are often not actually good at much other than essay writing and year 10 math, and don&#x27;t see the point of hard sciences like pyschology.<p>* There&#x27;s plenty of smart people who go into education, but they do it because they want to teach, not be a researcher.<p>I could go through some of the poor content in education degrees (like the hero of education experts Vygotsky, who I&#x27;m not convinced many have even read other than through n-th hand sources where people write &quot;the student is thus about to construct knowledge through scaffolded tasks in the zone of proximal development (Vygoskly, 1930something)&quot;, but you&#x27;d be lucky to find many teachers who agree on what any of that means (other than be common sense &quot;don&#x27;t make it too hard to follow&quot;).<p>Is it really a wonder that Cletus, who got a job in rural school in Alabama with no more qualifications than being able to write his name correctly teaches just as well (according to research) as someone with a PhD in education?<p>The good research is in psychology departments - people who study the science of learning are generally pretty well informed on it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36583604" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36583604" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">barry-cotter</span><span>|</span><a href="#36581456">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36583160">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36583561">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36583604">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36583604">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; There is a field of education, that studies teaching and learning!

Education schools aren’t held in low esteem by social scientists or the educated public by reason of lack of familiarity. They can’t even manage a detectable effect on teacher effectiveness. Note I did not say large. The effect of an education degree on teacher effectiveness is not reliably distinguishable from zero.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s easier to pick a good teacher than to train one: Familiar and new results on the correlates of teacher effectiveness<p>&gt; Neither holding a college major in education nor acquiring a master&#x27;s degree is correlated with elementary and middle school teaching effectiveness, regardless of the university at which the degree was earned. Teachers generally do become more effective with a few years of teaching experience, but we also find evidence that teachers may become less effective with experience, particularly later in their careers. These and other findings with respect to the correlates of teacher effectiveness are obtained from estimations using value-added models that control for student characteristics as well as school and (where appropriate teacher) fixed effects in order to measure teacher effectiveness in reading and math for Florida students in fourth through eighth grades for eight school years, 2001–2002 through 2008–2009.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0272775710001755" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S02727...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36583561" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36583561" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scotty79</span><span>|</span><a href="#36581456">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36583604">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36583549">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36583561">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36583561">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; &quot;transformation&quot; stage of learning -- where the student takes things they have heard, seen, or experienced and attempts to transform some part of the world using them.<p>Hear and forget, see and remember, do and understand.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36583549" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36583549" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scotty79</span><span>|</span><a href="#36581456">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36583561">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36583414">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36583549">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36583549">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; where the student takes things they have heard, seen, or experienced and attempts to transform some part of the world using them<p>That&#x27;s probably why some school subjects that lack this component largely or entirely like history, geography or literature are so hard to learn.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36583414" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36583414" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">irrational</span><span>|</span><a href="#36581456">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36583549">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36581677">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36583414">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36583414">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My Masters degree was in Instructional Psychology!

The style of discussions, without marketing, status seeking, linking to blogs, medium articles etc. is also extremely pleasant and lets the content float up much better. Even modern communities which don&#x27;t suffer from these problems still seem to have jaded userbases, who are just... Tired and not willing to really revel in their knowledge, but protectedly proactively avoid things.<p>- really calming myself down before engaging, e.g. closing my eyes for 10 mins in quiet, or just doodling on a paper, maybe stacking some 9 volt batteries into a tower and calmly approaching the topic, reading or such. In this way, reading can almost be like a reverse stream of consciousness. However life quickly knocks, taking me out of this (flow?) state. I recall some researchers discussing how children effortlessly play (so the opposite of the original topic about effortful learning...) experimenting, collecting data etc. to learn and develop their worldviews, but if you impose requirements or expectations on them, they learn slower and don&#x27;t blossom.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36581119" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36581119" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">irjustin</span><span>|</span><a href="#36581006">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36581063">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36581100">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36581119">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36581119">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m definitely in this camp except for one area - PBS Space Time[0].<p>I have _NO CLUE_ about 80% of the topics on the more complex subjects.

Does it need to be _effortful_?<p>After a bookish childhood, I spent years as an adult trying to &quot;learn more.&quot; Mnenomic tricks, Anki, active note-taking, exercises, trying a different book if the first one doesn&#x27;t stick. It didn&#x27;t work very well and I probably wasted a lot of time. Two things became clear: 1) I was focusing on the process as a way to procrastinate on the real effort involved, 2) I was compensating for a lack of real curiosity about the subject matter. Yes, learning is hard work, but does it need to _feel hard_? When I&#x27;ve felt truly engrossed in something, I don&#x27;t need to remind myself to exert effort, and I&#x27;m not really thinking about whatever X% of learning gain I can get from doing it better.<p>Deep down, I think like seeing myself as the kind of person who is &quot;really into learning&quot; -- math, theology, classics of literature, CS, art history, whatever. Keeping up the identity I developed as a nerdy kid. Of course, it&#x27;s important to be gritty about learning because... why? Hustle culture?<p>Now, I&#x27;m trying the opposite approach: enjoy as much entertainment as I want, avoid exerting any effort or discipline in learning, and stop immediately if I&#x27;m not feeling it. Part of this is not beating myself up when I naturally lose interest in something (95% of things). Yes, it&#x27;s easy to get distracted by low-effort scrolling and such.

When I create I learn. When I consume I just relax.</i><p>This core idea is getting at something important, something that other commenters are covering and is covered in this previous HN thread [0] about information addiction for example, but I disagree the author&#x27;s assertion that all passive consumption ought to be categorized as entertainment and all active creation ought to be categorized as effortful work. (I&#x27;ve seen too many video game damage calculation spreadsheets for that to be the case.)<p>I&#x27;ll highlight the author&#x27;s conjecture that &quot;edutainment is not learning but preparation for learning&quot;. Relevant, digestible, and yes sometimes entertaining collections of information are preparation for <i>understanding</i> (which typically requires application), which is preparation for <i>mastery</i> (which typically requires ten more years of application). I would argue this entire process is what encompasses learning, of which well-sourced information is a critical component for. I suspect there is some conflation here of entertainment with the risk for distraction, which is a real mind killer that ought to be addressed, but instead gets tossed away by the author during his Cal Newport reference in favor of his love for Twitter and vested interest in newsletter subscriptions.<p>The concept I feel the author is getting at via his edutainment strawman is that information acquisition is not sufficient for the fluency of understanding required for conceptual mastery. This is a concept that I think most HN readers and textbook exercise writers would agree with.<p>The possibility that the author may be missing a working understanding of this concept feels to me like it would explain a certain awkwardness about the entire article, which seems to rely on shoehorning a plethora of loosely-connected, name-dropped quotes and ideas into italicized slots of questionable logical integrity to support the presumption that everything entertaining must be useless, and everything educational must be hard.

Or they will get caught up on a minor point because they don&#x27;t agree. That proclivity to disagree can often turn into blindness, erasing any further information past wherever they got hung up. Even if they do ask you questions, often it is some attempt to highlight their disagreements, in a pseudo-socratic method kind of lawyering. AIs have no ego, they don&#x27;t have stake in the game.

The flow state I&#x27;m describing can be playful, productive, or both - and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s ever really pointless.<p>... I also think that this is usually a difficult experience to guide people into, <i>especially</i> in a classroom. In many ways, the classroom seems almost designed to prevent this state:<p>* You&#x27;re surrounded by people, often noisy<p>* You do not often get to choose your subject matter<p>* If you zone out (ie, zone <i>in</i>), and do something <i>weird</i> (sit funny, pick your nose, rock back and forth, doodle, whatever) then students and even the teacher will break your flow. This means you need to be watching yourself, which is antithetical to flow.<p>* Regular interruptions, lack of physical activity, disconnection from nature, etc, etc.<p>* As the author very rightly points out, the lack of movement in most &#x27;learning&#x27; situations is more harmful than most realize.<p>This leads to people associating learning with work, with effort, with strife. People decide they don&#x27;t like math, or music, or art, or reading, because their school experiences are <i>so, so bad</i>.<p>It&#x27;s kind of grotesque.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

I was listening to a podcast with Joel Spolsky recently.  He told a story that when he went to Microsoft, they had done internal research (and experiments) to debunk <i>some</i> of the theories from Fred Brooks&#x27; &quot;Mythical Man Month&quot;.  At the time, he generally believed in the &quot;rules&quot; from &quot;Mythical Man Month&quot;, and was pleasantly surprised to learn about this further research.

My team consists of: one product manager, one staff engineer, one or more lead engineers, one or more senior engineers, one engineering manager.<p>The PM wants his share of the cake, so any big feature needs to go through his approval (“does this feature delivers value?”, “how many users will use the feature?”, etc.)<p>The staff engineer needs to validate any design (that’s his job), and provide feedback if he thinks your design “sucks”. So if the feature ends up being successful, he gets points.<p>The senior and lead engineers need to own the design and implementation details. The leads would probably want to cover a good chunk of the solution so that it appears in their performance review. It’s gonna be though for senior engineers to get a good share if the leads are already one step ahead.<p>The engineering manager will own the timeline. He will ask you about estimates, but most likely you’ll feel the pressure of whatever imaginary deadline is set.<p>So there you are in the middle of all those people wanting their share. If you don’t manage to own a good chunk of that work, you won’t be able to show it in your perf. review. Owning is hard.<p>I have to say, though, that I only have experienced this in tech companies that are around 5-7 years (old enough to have well established processes, young enough to still hire like there’s no tomorrow) and that are obsessed with FAANGs: they will hire faang engineers only if they could. This mix ends up badly, because suddenly every team needs to be a high performing team, everyone is raising the bar and speed is number one prio.
When working with companies that hire no faang engineers, everything feels better.</div><br/><div id="42312205" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42312205" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bibabaloo</span><span>|</span><a href="#42311792">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42312084">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42315304">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42312205">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42312205">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I feel this so much.

Taking proactive decisions means allocating work for tasks that do not solve a concrete problem but bear the risk of introducing regressions. On the absolute best scenario, things continue to work as always. On the absolute worst scenario, you introduce a critical regression that brings down the service. There is literally no upside and all downsides.<p>There are many reasons why &quot;if it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it&quot; is tried and true.<p>&gt; * Resist the urge to build walls between people&#x2F;teams&#x2F;departments. Instead, build a culture of collaboration (Hard and squishy and difficult to scale? Yup. Worth it? Absolutely.)<p>That really depends on what you mean by &quot;walls&quot;. The reason Conway&#x27;s law is a thing is that in order to have functioning teams you also need functional independence. If you need to book a meeting with anyone to justify pushing a change to a service you do not own, that&#x27;s already a wall. No matter how easy it is to get through that wall, it&#x27;s still easier to not have to go through it.<p>I can tell you an example of how independence always beats collaboration. Once I worked on a project where QAs were a separate team entirely, and made it their point to be the sole owners and maintainers of all automated test suites beyond unit and integration tests. We experienced a major regression that the regression test suite wasn&#x27;t caught. I went right to the head of QAs and asked if I could push a commit to add a couple of regression tests. He politely declined by saying that they were already working on it and I wouldn&#x27;t need to bother with that. Great, a victory for not building walls I guess? Except that his &quot;we are working on it&quot; ended up being &quot;we added a ticket to our backlog and we might pick it up two months from now&quot;. Literally. And they never did, by the way, and the same regression was eventually introduced without anyone noticing.<p>In case you wonder how I solved that problem, I created my own regression test suite. Conway&#x27;s law always wins.</div><br/><div id="42315173" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42315173" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">khafra</span><span>|</span><a href="#42311792">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42315045">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42312461">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42315173">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42315173">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The context of &quot;stop making reactive decisions&quot; isn&#x27;t &quot;start making proactive decisions.&quot; It&#x27;s to just make fewer decisions.<p>The specific example is of a rare event which, while regrettable, does not justify the cost of policy changes to prevent it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42312461" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42312461" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aylmao</span><span>|</span><a href="#42311792">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42315045">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42312570">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42312461">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42312461">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Recently, I was thinking plenty about trust within organizations, and it resonated with me too.<p>I&#x27;ve worked at a few startups and have seen high-trust environments lead to a lot of productivity, comfort and success— and the opposite for low-trust startups. In general, I think startups tend to lean towards high-trust, especially when they&#x27;re small and early, but I was part of a 15-person one that was quite the opposite, and it was terrible.<p>The hiring process wasn&#x27;t great. Long take-home task, and that was the only technical interview. A lot of talking, but not much noteworthy signal on the rest. Very long wait times. Now I know this is a red flag for low-trust companies. If they&#x27;re not building trust at the hiring-stage, it means even after joining the organization it&#x27;ll take time to acutally &quot;be part of the team&quot;.<p>Once at the company, I had no permission to poke around— everything was hidden by default. There was no space for discussion, I was expected to learn, not to comment. There was plenty of micro-management; after all, if they don&#x27;t trust you, they need to keep an eye on you at all times. You&#x27;re probably doing something wrong.<p>The chasms were deep too; the company was building a web team to spin a contractor&#x27;s project into a full web product, and I was supposed to lead it. We were disjointed from the rest of the company though, and would only hear about requirements through the founders. The team had interest on being more involved with the main product, but management just wasn&#x27;t interested in making it happen, and just had us loiter around for a few months until they gathered requirements, and then implement some rather disjoint features.<p>The project failed. I&#x27;m working somewhere else now.<p>tldr; low-trust environments kill projects</div><br/><div id="42312562" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42312562" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">spuds</span><span>|</span><a href="#42311792">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42312461">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42312570">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42312562">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42312562">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah, I think there&#x27;s almost always a point where a company decides they need to stop generally trusting their employees.

I’ve seen this as startups mature. One very vivid recollection: we had a very strong and tiny dev team. Each dev owned a huge piece of the product. Definitely not egoless. We brought in trusted junior devs to grow. That was fine.<p>Then the very talented VP Eng. wanted a promotion and brought in a hack to replace him, who hadn’t coded in years, and was obviously more concerned with his career than our product. A real mediocrity. But the VP wanted to move on, so this mediocrity was hired, over vigorous objections.<p>That was the end. This new VP brought in mediocre devs, rewarding loyalty and “being a team player” more than productivity, or competence. He brought in employees who couldn’t be trusted.<p>As this was happening, we were acquired, and our new bosses from the parent company were used to employees who couldn’t be trusted, and acted that way.<p>HR knew that to keep the good engineers they had to do something, so they showered us with bonuses.

Performance cycles at the company very much disincentivized big bets.

It was called The Psychology of Computer Programming (Weinberg 1971). There was a peculiar idea contained among the many excellent ideas of that book. It was the idea that the task of programming should be egoless. Programmers, the author said, should not invest their ego in the product they were building. 
  ...

  What’s the alternative to an ego-invested programmer? A team-player programmer. 
  The team player sees the software product as a team effort and a team achievement. Error reports and reviews and questions become team inputs to help improve the product, not threatening attacks to derail progress.
  ...
  But after further thought, this notion begins to unravel. It is all well and good to advocate egoless programming, but the fact of the matter is that human ego is a very natural thing, and it is difficult to find people who can—or even should—divorce their ego from their work.
  ...
  A system that works will have to acknowledge fundamental human traits and work within the bounds they create. And ego is one of those traits.

Those are environments where it&#x27;s rare for any individual (even someone nominally in charge of a project) to have full creative and technical control over something, and even when they do, it only lasts as long as the project&#x2F;grant or until their employer puts them on something else.<p>Compared to the 70s there are effectively no barriers to a passionate engineer starting their own software project as either an open source project or in their own startup, and I&#x27;d argue that those are settings where it&#x27;s actually highly beneficial to bring ego into programming. It&#x27;s pretty much the same notion as &quot;founder mode&quot; or why BDFL is one of the most popular forms of governance for FOSS.<p>Personally I&#x27;d recommend anybody who &quot;brings ego&quot; to their dayjob to take a stab at FOSS or a startup rather than trying to fit a square peg (caring a lot about their work) into a round hole (the realities of working on large projects).</div><br/><div id="42313105" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42313105" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">01100011</span><span>|</span><a href="#42312579">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42313001">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42313534">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42313105">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42313105">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sometimes a person&#x27;s dedication and care expresses itself to others as ego.

Personally I think that that <i>is</i> ego, but that ego is not necessarily a bad thing.<p>There is nothing wrong with taking pride in your work, nor in recognizing that you might actually be more knowledgable&#x2F;skilled&#x2F;correct in some particular matter than someone else and communicating that to them  - as long as that sense of knowledge&#x2F;skill&#x2F;correctness is not misplaced, not expressed cruelly, and the actual reasoning is explained.

I just don&#x27;t think being egoless is necessarily good. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t sit there smiling while something I worked on for years got destroyed by other people, because it&#x27;d be impolite or egotistical to point out that they&#x27;re destroying something.

An engineering culture where engineers don&#x27;t care inevitably leads to abdicating responsibility for overall system health and even data&#x2F;workflow correctness as PMs attempt to steer the ship without understanding the implications of what they are asking for.  Once this has gone on for a while, the system will be so intractably broken, and the dead sea effect will have caused such a brain drain of all those capable of fixing the problems, that at some point there&#x27;s no economical path to restoring the software systems to a healthy and maintainable state.  At that point you might as well just call in the private equity guys and figure out how to extract maximum cash out of the business as it stands, because any code change becomes more likely to break more things than it improves.<p>So yeah you need ego.  That said, it must also be tempered with the reality of needing to compromise enough to satisfice all stakeholders (including both technical and business stakeholders of all the different flavors).  The beautiful thing about software engineering though, is there is a reasonable amount of objective facts, metrics and tradeoffs, that given a critical mass of sufficiently skilled and mature engineers, common ground tends not to be too hard to align on.  Or at least, far easier than to get a non-technical stakeholder to understand the long-term implications of a bad decision.</div><br/><div id="42314319" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42314319" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bruce511</span><span>|</span><a href="#42312579">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42313551">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42313634">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42314319">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42314319">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Agreed.<p>To make the best work you have to take pride in it.

The fact is that we are moving in such a diametrically opposite direction to cooperative compassion that we are literally destroying the Earth for our future generations.<p>And it is our choice, each of us, individually, but with billions of us aggregating into a miserable mass of selfish f_cks who are causing unnecessary strife, unhappiness, and destruction via our willful ignorance of what is possible for us both individually and collectively.</div><br/><div id="42314863" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42314863" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Nevermark</span><span>|</span><a href="#42312104">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42314368">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42314337">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42314863">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42314863">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for the rebuttle.<p>You are right, I stand corrected - I think both approaches make sense for spreading change.<p>Yours on an every day basis, the viewpoint I gave requires opportunity, but matters too.<p>The thing with game theory, is it’s the right way to think of social structures that scale.<p>I think a lot of people’s behavior responds strongly to their incentives.

As someone else said, it&#x27;s difficult to find people who work without ego (whatever working without ego would mean). 
Most of my professional experience is as a working musician, and it goes without saying that artists have egos, in the sense that they try to bring something from their inner selves to the outer world, and that they invest a lot of effort in learning how to do so properly. Sometimes I&#x27;ve felt that the best musicians I&#x27;ve worked with were &quot;low ego&quot; but this could be just that they are supremely confident and also not lacking in affirmation from their audiences - and if they are kind, from their fellow musicians. 
The worst people I&#x27;ve worked with are talented people who can&#x27;t seem to find the affirmation they crave, but feel they deserve. They feel constantly slighted and left behind. As a band leader, I realized I simply have to stroke these people&#x27;s egos - no matter how confident, skilled, or amazing some people seem they are riddled with self doubt and absolutely need outside affirmation. I used to fight it, but eventually learned it was my job as a manager of sorts to do so...</div><br/></div></div><div id="42314910" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42314910" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aeolun</span><span>|</span><a href="#42314337">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42312367">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42314910">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42314910">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ok, but how do you deal with people that submit broken CSS, break the site, and are unapologetic?

The problem is that stuff can (obviously, not in all cases, and not something you should just assume will happen without good evidence&#x2F;reasoning) start breaking all the time because you have too many people changing things that interact with other things they only partially understand. Or it&#x27;s that one team&#x2F;&quot;domain&quot; ends up downstream or dependent on another, and locally optimal but globally suboptimal decisions made upstream (eg a bad but quick to implement data model, or adding more dependencies on something you&#x27;re in the process of getting rid of) cause problems downstream.

SMEs write policy that is then enforced (or just warned, for some period ahead of enforcement) by the policy framework. Policies can encode exceptions, but changes to policy (i.e. to add exceptions) require SME review. The benefit is - stuff that passes policy doesn&#x27;t require explicit review, so in the normative case autonomous teams are not slowed down, and when they are (due to policy failure), then it is for Good Reasons.<p>&gt; Mandatory code review isn&#x27;t a &quot;feel-bad program&quot;, it&#x27;s precisely to guard against disasters like this (also I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s literally required by SOX&#x2F;SOC2 and I&#x27;d certainly want my software vendors to implement this).<p>High-trust environments trust engineers to understand the difference between &quot;this is a serious change so I need someone to review it&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m just fixing a typo here so I&#x27;m going to rubber-stamp it.&quot; But yes, SOC2 requires mandatory code review, tickets, the lot. Yes, it slows things down, but that is the price you pay to become a Serious Enterprise Vendor. No, it doesn&#x27;t fundamentally erode high-trust culture. People can just mark their MRs as &quot;I need a rubber stamp&quot; and find someone else to rubber-stamp them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42313794" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42313794" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sfink</span><span>|</span><a href="#42313256">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42315048">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42312527">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42313794">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42313794">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you care about the experience of your co-workers, you won&#x27;t repeatedly break stuff.

A: AI hits a peak soon and can’t replace any work I do, so it doesn’t matter. B: AI does get sophisticated enough to replace the work I do at which point we’ve basically reached almost star trek level tech where machines can do most of the work and we’ve allocated resources through society in a way that everyone benefits. And lastly the one I think is most likely C: AI automates all this knowledge work for the benefit of company owners and we end up either accepting it as a group and falling back to pre industrial serf like social structures or every rises up in a social revolution.<p>To be honest I’d expect that going back to serfdom style rules would be the most expected and stable but the current group of western oligarchs don’t seem to care to make sure that their burgeoning serf class have their basic needs met and instead want to antagonize them for not being rich. It’s a really odd juxtaposition of rabidly independent culture where people believe they accomplished everything by the sweat of their own brow crossing with the results of of a society that lets an individual run a company of 10s to 100s of thousands of employees at the same time</div><br/><div id="39764072" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39764072" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">red_admiral</span><span>|</span><a href="#39763803">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39764008">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39764112">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39764072">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39764072">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Having your serfs&#x27; basic needs met was very rarely a care of the ruling classes in any state form that deserves the name &quot;serfdom&quot;.

Even if your business is using AI to optimise ad targeting, those ads still get paid for because the advertisers expect humans to hand over money at some point to buy products or play games or something.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39764112" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39764112" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ordu</span><span>|</span><a href="#39763803">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39764034">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39764112">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39764112">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; the audience booed louder when the word disrupted was used as a term of praise</i><p>Yeah, it is often goes like &quot;lets disrupt and see if we will be able to rip some benefits from the chaos after the disruption&quot;.

Wages have stagnated. Cities have become places that are great if you have lots of money to spend and pretty hostile otherwise. Medicine has increasingly become a luxury, as has healthy food and a roof over your head. Meanwhile, in tech, the goodwill of the userbase has very rapidly and repeatedly been betrayed because capital wanted constant growth. News and media have been subsumed into a slog of ad-suffused &quot;content&quot; optimized to hook your attention. You are spied on in everything you do, supposedly to target more ads. Many new horrendous ways of abusing the labor force have been invented and then legalized by this industry<p>Now I hate telling people I study AI because SV people made a really interesting methodology into an apocalyptic cult whose adherents are often smugly dismissive of most recognizable human values in favor of a vague future that sounds like living in a video game made of vibes, and the main use case the optimization-obsessed finance-twiddlers that run the show can imagine is replacing workers in every domain, starting with artists. Why should they like this? Technology for technology&#x27;s sake is not what most people care about, and why should they when the last ten years of &quot;innovation&quot; has on balance mostly been against their interests?</div><br/></div></div><div id="39763863" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39763863" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vasco</span><span>|</span><a href="#39764034">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39763817">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39763863">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39763863">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Not even Apple is like Apple anymore.

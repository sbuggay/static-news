There is a large flat stone that the group assembles on, then the monks form a half circle around the stone, and facing the cliffside, they chant and have some sort of horns which they blow a certain tonal frequency that bounces from the cliff face into the stone they are on, and the frequency resonates to levitate the stone up the cliff to hte temple they are seeking.<i>(read it in 1992, so deep pull from memory)</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=588pfqtMtz0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=588pfqtMtz0</a><p>There are the biblical versions on Trumpet and Walls falling - and other sound-based stories of yore.<p>We doing sonic surgery etc...<p>And as Tesla famously says 3&#x2F;69&#x2F; - if you want to understand the universe, understand frequency.<p>===<p><i>Movement and Measure</i><p><i>Time expressed through frequency</i><p><i>All is vibration</i></div><br/><div id="41206755" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41206755" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dr_dshiv</span><span>|</span><a href="#41205330">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41206364">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41206755">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41206755">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’ve never been able to source that Tesla quote.<p>I wanted to use it for a cymatics museum exhibit. Since I’m a stickler for sourcing quotes, I kept looking for something really sweet…<p>I found an Orphic hymn to Apollo from the 500BC or so, that had been translated by the great Renaissance scholar Marsilio Ficino (the guy who the Medicis hired to translate Greek classics into Latin).<p>One line stood out: “Tu sphaeram totam, cithara resonante, contemperas” or
“The resonance of your guitar attunes the whole world”<p>Well, what struck me was that Ion of Chios (b 490 BC) wrote that Pythagoras himself had authored a number of Orphic hymns. So, while somewhat speculative, I used: “Your resonance attunes the whole world” and just attributed it to Pythagoras. A bit cheeky, but I had sources!<p>The cymatic exhibit was funded from a quantum computing grant, as we used the Chladni plates and Faraday waves to illustrate eigenmodes — drawing parallels to the interference patterns seen in the quantum electron clouds of hydrogen atoms.<p>Well, it resonated with the audience, in any case!</div><br/><div id="41207069" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41207069" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">samstave</span><span>|</span><a href="#41205330">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41206755">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41207069">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41207069">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In another thread I posted the following -- on the same wavelength:<p>(The following is more stream of thought, and poorly organized, but I think you vibe it)<p>===<p>This is interesting, further, as the maths behind the Ghiri Tiles of Muslim Mosques reveals a deeper understanding of the representation of 4D concepts into 2&#x2F;3D tiling patterns.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newscientist.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;dn11235-medieval-islamic-tiling-reveals-mathematical-savvy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newscientist.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;dn11235-medieval-islami...</a><p>There are a lot of really interesting information on tiling:<p><i>&quot;Decagonal and Quasi-Crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic

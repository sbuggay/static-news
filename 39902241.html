It involved a build script that compromised the code being built.  Sandboxing the build script wouldn’t have helped much if at all.  Depending on the implementation, it might have prevented it from overwriting .o files that were already compiled, maybe.  But there would still be all sorts of shenanigans it could have played to sneakily inject code.<p>I’d argue that Rust’s biggest advantage here is that build scripts and procedural macros are written in Rust themselves, making them easier to read and thus harder to hide things in than autotools’ m4-to-shell gunk.<p>But that means it’s important to build those things from source!  Part of the movement you cite consists of watt, which ships proc macros as precompiled WebAssembly binaries mainly to save build time.  But if watt were more widely adopted, it would actually make an attacker’s life much easier since they could backdoor the precompiled binary.  Historically I’ve been sympathetic to dtolnay’s various attempts to use precompiled binaries this way (not just watt but also the serde thing that caused a hullabaloo); I hate slow builds.

But the twist it is wasn&#x27;t the binary not built reproducibly.  It was the tar ball.  The natural assumption is it just reflected the public git repository.

And the script must produce the same output every time, ie be reproducible.  Currently Debian&#x27;s idea of &quot;reproducible&quot; means it reflects the source Debian distributes.  This change means it will reproducibly reflect the upstream sources.  That doesn&#x27;t mean it will be the same - just that it&#x27;s derived in a reproducible way.<p>As for trusting the person who gave you the hash: that&#x27;s not what it hinges on.  It hinges on the majority installing a binary from a distro.  That binary can be produced reproducibly, by an automated build system.  Even now, Debian&#x27;s binaries aren&#x27;t created just once by Debian.  There are Debian builders all around the planet creating the binary, and verifying it matches what&#x27;s being distributed.<p>Thus the odds of the binary you are running not being derived from the source are vanishingly low.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39911079" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39911079" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">emn13</span><span>|</span><a href="#39907080">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39909683">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39911839">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39913865">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39911079">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39911079">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One thing a culture of reproducible builds (and thus stable hashes) however does provide is a lack of excuse as to why the build <i>isn&#x27;t</i> reproducible. Almost nobody will build from source - but when there&#x27;s bugs to be squashed and weird behavior, some people, sometimes, will.  If hashes are the norm, then it&#x27;s a little harder for attackers to pull of this kind of thing not because you trust their hash rather than their blob, but rather because they need to publish both at once - thus broadening the discovery window for shenanigans.<p>To put it another way: if you <i>don&#x27;t</i> have reproducible builds and you&#x27;re trying to replicate an upstream artifact then it&#x27;s very hard to tell what the cause is.  It might just be some ephemeral state, a race, or some machine aspect that caused a few fairly meaningless differences.  But as soon as you have a reproducible build, then failure to reproduce instantly marks upstream as being suspect.<p>It&#x27;s also useful when you&#x27;re trying to do things like tweak a build - you can ensure you&#x27;re importing upstream correctly by checking the hash with what you&#x27;re making, and then even if your downstream version isn&#x27;t a binary dependent on upstream (e.g. optimized differently, or with some extra plugins somewhere), you can be sure that changes between what you&#x27;re building and upstream are intentional and not spurious.<p>It&#x27;s clearly not a silver bullet, sure.  But it&#x27;s not entirely useless either, and it probably could help as part of a larger ecosystem shift; especially if conventional tooling created and published these by default such that bad actors trying to hide build processes actually stick out more glaringly.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39913865" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39913865" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tripdout</span><span>|</span><a href="#39907080">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39909683">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39911079">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39908922">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39913865">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39913865">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But you can build the code yourself, and verify that your hash is the same as theirs, meaning the binary is the same.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39908922" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39908922" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mjw1007</span><span>|</span><a href="#39907080">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39908337">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39909413">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39908274">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39908922">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39908922">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Maybe not untenable.<p>If everything is done carefully enough with reproducible builds, I think using a binary whose hash can be checked shouldn&#x27;t be a great extension of trust.<p>You could have multiple independent autobuilders verifying that particular source does indeed generate a binary with the claimed hash.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39908274" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39908274" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RedShift1</span><span>|</span><a href="#39907080">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39907690">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39908337">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39907844">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39908274">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39908274">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How does the sandboxing help if the compiler and&#x2F;or build scripts or whatever modifies its own output?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39907844" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39907844" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shawnz</span><span>|</span><a href="#39907080">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39907377">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39907690">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39907460">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39907844">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39907844">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When your programmatic build steps are isolated in plugins, then you can treat them like independent projects and apply your standard development practices like code review and unit tests to those plugins.

Give ports a try (although the modern sense is that poudrie is better even if you want custom-built packages).  See how nicely everything works.

In an alternate universe with different leadership, an organization like the FSF might use donated funds to pay a maintenance staff and an open-source maintainer might be able to lean on them.

If there isn&#x27;t a clear successor, I think the maintainer could inform the Big Company that they&#x27;d like to move on in the next year or two, and Big Company could maybe find an internal engineer who wants to take over the role.

It seems like Kumar was a bad actor. <i>Was</i> there actually a real maintenance issue?

The billion dollar company who hired Collins in this hypothetical maintainer could be Baidu or Yandex or Saudi Aramco, and then people would be suspicious. It&#x27;s one thing to have your task be &quot;don&#x27;t make people mad&quot; but doesn&#x27;t that change if people getting mad can give you unbounded retrospective work and responsibility?<p>&gt; &quot;<i>If these tasks fall under the &quot;don&#x27;t make everyone mad&quot; job responsibility, then yes. [...] Was there actually a real maintenance issue? [...] Or, the community could raise the problem to Big Company, who can do the work of verifying that there is a problem and working with the maintainer to resolve it.</i>&quot;<p>As soon as the internet becomes aware that they can get anything merged ASAP by threatening to get mad, everyone will be mad about everything all the time. Whom at the BigCo will do the work of verifying whether there is a problem? I mean, let&#x27;s put Lasse Collins on a specific team along with other employees who are expected to work 40-80 hour weeks while he isn&#x27;t. The pressure on the team manager to ditch the maintainer and distribute his salary among the other team members would be constant. If those other team members see him doing less work for similar or more money it would be a morale killer and they would want to leave. If they <i>also</i> have to know his project well enough to follow all the drama and things people are complaining about and tease out what is and isn&#x27;t a real problem and coerce him to do his job, sorry &#x27;work with him&#x27;, well, they won&#x27;t be very motivated to do that.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39906600" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39906600" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sloowm</span><span>|</span><a href="#39904908">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39905373">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39906563">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39909348">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39906600">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39906600">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the best solution would be governments forcing companies to secure the entire pipeline and setting up a non profit that does this for open source packages.

When building a Linux kernel image, the resulting image is compressed by default with gzip [3], but can also be optionally compressed using xz-utils (amongst other compression utilities). There&#x27;s a lot of distributions of Linux which have chosen xz-utils as the method used to compress kernel images, particularly embedded Linux distributions.[4] xz-utils is even the recommended mode of compression if a small kernel build image is desired.[5]<p>If the attacker can execute code during the process of building a new kernel image, they can cause even more catastrophic impacts than targeting sshd. Targeting sshd was always going to be limited due to targets not exposing sshd over accessible networks, or implementing passive optical taps and real time behavioural analysis, or receiving real time alerts from servers indicative of unusual activity or data transfers. Targeting the Linux kernel would have far worse consequences possible, particularly if the attacker intended to target embedded systems (such as military transport vehicles [6]) where the chance of detection is reduced due to lack of eyeballs looking over it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;pull&#x2F;31550">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;pull&#x2F;31550</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lkml.org&#x2F;lkml&#x2F;2024&#x2F;3&#x2F;20&#x2F;1004" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lkml.org&#x2F;lkml&#x2F;2024&#x2F;3&#x2F;20&#x2F;1004</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.kernel.org&#x2F;pub&#x2F;scm&#x2F;linux&#x2F;kernel&#x2F;git&#x2F;torvalds&#x2F;linux.git&#x2F;tree&#x2F;init&#x2F;Kconfig#n258" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.kernel.org&#x2F;pub&#x2F;scm&#x2F;linux&#x2F;kernel&#x2F;git&#x2F;torvalds&#x2F;lin...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;search?q=CONFIG_KERNEL_XZ%3Dy&amp;type=code">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;search?q=CONFIG_KERNEL_XZ%3Dy&amp;type=code</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.kernel.org&#x2F;pub&#x2F;scm&#x2F;linux&#x2F;kernel&#x2F;git&#x2F;torvalds&#x2F;linux.git&#x2F;tree&#x2F;kernel&#x2F;configs&#x2F;tiny.config#n6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.kernel.org&#x2F;pub&#x2F;scm&#x2F;linux&#x2F;kernel&#x2F;git&#x2F;torvalds&#x2F;lin...</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linuxdevices.org&#x2F;large-military-truck-runs-embedded-linux-open-source-database&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linuxdevices.org&#x2F;large-military-truck-runs-embedded-...</a></div><br/><div id="39904976" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39904976" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rsc</span><span>|</span><a href="#39902780">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39908892">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39904976">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39904976">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for this comment.

The backdoored xz is distributed widely, including to a target vendor who wishes to from a Debian development environment compile a kernel for an embedded device that is usually used in a specific industry and&#x2F;or set of countries.<p>3. When backdoored xz is then asked to compress a file, it checks whether the file is a kernel image and checks whether the kernel image is for the intended target (e.g. includes specific set of drivers).<p>4. If the backdoored xz has found its target kernel image, search for and modify random number generation code to effectively make it deterministic. Or add a new module which listens on PF_CAN interfaces for a particular trigger and then sends malicious CAN messages over that interface. Or modify dm_crypt to overwrite the first 80% of any key with a hardcoded value.

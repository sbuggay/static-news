I understand that the majority of opinions is that it&#x27;s fine to use without modifications, but  I wanted a clear statement from authors of Minio.

Most CLAs seem to require copyright assignment, but theirs does not.  Outside contributors keep their copyright, but grant the company a license to (more or less) do whatever they want with it.<p>I think we&#x27;re at a bit of a crossroads here.  Enough (smaller) companies have been bitten by the likes of Amazon monetizing their code and crushing the original developers&#x27; monetization strategy.  So we see some companies turning to non-F&#x2F;OSS &quot;source available&quot; type licenses instead.  This is bad for the open source community as a whole.<p>IMO, AGPL+commercial is a fine compromise, and companies need to be certain that if they take contributions from the community, that they can still sell commercial licenses for the whole product, including the contributions, without issues in the future.  Requiring contributors to assign copyright is one simple way to do that, but I think the path this company has chosen is a lot nicer in letting contributors keep ownership over their contributions.<p>For a piece of software where the expectation is that the company is going to be doing 90% of the work, and outside contributions will be relatively small, this seems entirely fair to me.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41238472" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41238472" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gumby</span><span>|</span><a href="#41237721">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41243370">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41243136">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41238472">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41238472">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Their github repo just says AGPL 3.0.

The name of that very license is... &#x27;APGLv3&#x27;!<p>The CLA means you&#x27;re giving them an <i>additional</i> license: one that lets them do things that the AGPLv3 wouldn&#x27;t, like use your code in proprietary software.<p>This is common for FOSS-maintaining organizations that want to use dual-licensing as part of their revenue strategy. Users (including organizationswho are comfortable  publishing any downstream changes they might make under the terms of the copyleft license use the free version. Users who are not can instead choose to purchase a proprietary license, like they would with closed-source software.<p>Often there&#x27;s some hope that as users of F&#x2F;OSS, the developers and users are overlapping groups, and there&#x27;s enough alignment of interests there to provide some level of assurance that the developers (or publisher, in the case of a corporation or collective entity) won&#x27;t suddenly make drastic changes without user input. (Often, too, that isn&#x27;t actually the case.) A CLA can give the developer the ability to make such drastic changes as taking a copyleft project and creating a closed-source fork. In cases where the development work is supplied predominantly by a single commercial entity, that means that they can essentially orphan the project out from under you, leaving the open-source version of their software an unmaintained vestige of a proprietary commercial offering, at any time.<p>So CLAs involve a lot of trust or a lot of risk. Some companies have set up non-profit foundations to be the official stewards of their dually-licensed software so that the chief&#x2F;commercial maintainers of the software can leverage the dual-licensing revenue strategy while fostering strong community trust. See, for example, the Free Qt Foundation. When Google wanted a CLA as insurance against patent litigation for Kubernetes, they did a similar thing and set up the Cloud-Native Compute Foundation so that Kubernetes could have a &#x27;trustworthy CLA&#x27;, so-to-speak.<p>I hope that clears up both why upstream developers might sometimes want a CLA of this kind and why downstream developers can sometimes be leery of them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41241505" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41241505" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">warkdarrior</span><span>|</span><a href="#41237721">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41240694">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41241538">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41240097">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41241505">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41241505">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, the CLA says that you give them a license for them to in turn sublicense your code to others in any way they want.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41240097" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41240097" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mperham</span><span>|</span><a href="#41237721">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41239839">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41240694">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41243136">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41240097">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41240097">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Like what?

It makes sense that a company that may have spent several years developing a product can sell commercial licensing. The only alternative way to monetize AGPL works is to provide services and support.<p>Nobody is forcing anyone to give away their rights.

If I had to guess, if you installed each application in your stack separately, and they simply interacted with each other through API calls, you could consider them &quot;System Libraries&quot; and therefore would not dragged into the AGPL.

I think you mean &quot;open source&quot;, specifically open source <i>as opposed to</i> free software. Your terminology makes a lot of the conversation here unnecessarily hard to follow.<p>&gt; The AGPL restricts use; it is an EULA: end-user license agreement. The antithesis of free software.<p>I don&#x27;t see the AGPL as the antithesis of OSS at all, even though I agree that it is activated by a condition that pertains to use, not just redistribution. But that&#x27;s the mechanism, not the goal. Just like the GPL relies on copyright law to have its effect, AGPL relies on what you&#x27;re calling a EULA. (I don&#x27;t disagree, and to me a EULA <i>is</i> a contract, but whether it&#x27;s exactly the right term doesn&#x27;t seem important.) GPL isn&#x27;t alone in depending on copyright; the BSD license does just as much.<p>&gt; Running a program, as a service or not, isn&#x27;t redistribution. It is use.<p>Agreed, but &quot;redistribution&quot; vs &quot;use&quot; is a mechanism argument. The intended purpose of the GPL was to allow a developer to write software whose future evolution is freely shared. The redistribution mechanism doesn&#x27;t even accomplish this 100%: in particular it allows branchless twigs off of the evolutionary tree as long as they are indeed branchless (i.e., not distributed to anyone else who makes further modifications). That goes counter to the goal of free software, but is an acceptable loss because those twigs are irrelevant to the rest of the evolutionary tree.<p>But there&#x27;s a loophole here when the GPL is applied to server software: if the software only runs server-side, then the redistribution mechanism no longer works. You could modify your copy, and give that modified copy to someone else who also modifies it. You would have to share your modifications with that person, but not to anyone else. <i>Your twig can grow branches.</i> Neither of you are redistributing the software to anyone else, so you aren&#x27;t bound by the GPL to make your changes available to anyone else, and certainly not to the original authors.<p>The AGPL attempts to plug that hole using an extra mechanism: adding a restriction saying that you have to make your changes available not only if you&#x27;re redistributing the software, but also if users are talking to the running code[1].<p>&gt; This is no different from Adobe, Apple, Microsoft, ... identifying people using their software in ways they don&#x27;t like, and crafting their EULA terms to turn those activities into a license violation.<p>Sure. Those same companies depend on copyright law as well. But the purpose of the AGPL has <i>nothing</i> to do with people using the software in ways that the license chooser doesn&#x27;t like; its purpose is wholly concerned with the evolution of the software and therefore the changes being made to it. That purpose is achieved via the mechanism of adding conditions based on usage.<p>&gt; suppose that some government service website is using AGPL software. What do you gain by downloading the software and running your own instance? That&#x27;s not where your data is; you can&#x27;t use that cloned instance to communicate with the service agency.<p>That is correct. AGPL does not solve this problem. If you&#x27;re locked into a service, then having the full version of the AGPLed code does you very little good. That is described as &quot;Service as a Software Substitute (SaaSS)&quot; in the AGPL explainer at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;why-affero-gpl.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;why-affero-gpl.html</a><p>The free software folks had to punt on that problem. They &quot;solve&quot; it by saying: don&#x27;t use those services. Which is hardly a satisfying answer, but nothing else is currently possible. Any solution would require regulation and legislation (eg data portability laws).<p>&gt; I understand the social problem that the AGPL is trying to combat, whereby visitors are held captive by saas applications over which they have no visibility or control.<p>Incorrect (see above). Though I think some AGPL supporters did (and probably still do) think that the AGPL helps with that. I guess it does, in trivial cases.<p>&gt; Also one issue is that the AGPL doesn&#x27;t actually solve anything. Visitors having the source code to my evil saas platform doesn&#x27;t solve the problem that they&#x27;re locked to it. It doesn&#x27;t solve the problem that I can change the code at any time and they cannot. Or that I can shut it down and wipe out their data, or share it with third parties. An AGPL conforming application also need not provide visitors with any way to export their data.<p>This is all correct. Well, except the first sentence, because the AGPL <i>does</i> solve one thing: it ensures that the evolution of a piece of software is freely accessible.<p>Or maybe two things, though the second was not part of the original intention afaik: the ElasticSearch&#x2F;OpenSearch situation. The original author develops something that their business depends on and does not want to end up competing with their own code. AGPL ensures that nobody can take their code, add some features to it, and then win their customers with the enhanced proprietary version. The original author will at least have access to all of the modifications that anybody makes, so competition will need to be on a different basis.<p>[1] It seems like it would have been more straightforward to keep the AGPL conditions based on redistribution, and say that you have to release your changes to <i>everyone</i> if you distribute your version to <i>anyone</i>. Would that even work? You&#x27;d have a transaction from A-&gt;B that induces a requirement on A-&gt;the world. But it would have avoided making conditions based on use rather than just redistribution. I dunno, IANAL. It would still allow someone to change the version that they&#x27;re running without releasing the changes, unlike the current AGPL, but that&#x27;s no worse than the situation with GPL&#x27;d client-side software and doesn&#x27;t seem like a problem worth solving.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41242032" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41242032" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tzs</span><span>|</span><a href="#41231737">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41244043">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41240263">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41242032">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41242032">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It also seems to violate criteria #10 of the OSI&#x27;s Open Source Definition:<p>&gt; 10.

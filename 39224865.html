He&#x27;d be in the kitchen cleaning, or in his study, but since the house was big, it was rarely a problem. Sometimes he&#x27;d be napping in his study, and I know he slept easily on the train to and from work (with an efficiency that meant he woke up a minute before his stop on the way home).<p>When I was a student I just forced my polyphasic sleep periods into normal sleep as best I could, which typically manifests a bit like delayed sleep phase; by the middle of the week I was two hours behind everyone else, and I actually did worse in the courses that had early Friday lectures. But when you&#x27;re a student, being awake or asleep at odd hours is normal enough not to be remarked upon.<p>As a programmer, polyphasic sleep is sometimes unnoticeable to others.

Being forced to change sleep schedule constantly does cause health issues, but just doing what your body tells you seems to work out ok in my experience.  Taking drugs to force sleep to a schedule seems like a worse option.<p>One drawback to it is that many sleep trackers don&#x27;t handle it well.  They&#x27;ll treat a second sleep as a nap for example and then pester you that you&#x27;re not getting enough sleep.  The Galaxy G5 seems to capture all sleeps fairly well (but it loses pairing every few months and has to be reset from scratch), the Oura Ring sometimes catches 2nd or 3rd sleeps as naps and adds them to the total, the Xiaomi Mi7 Band often misses shorter sleeps or lists them as naps without adding them to the total.

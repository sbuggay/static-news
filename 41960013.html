I have been using a scythe to cut my lawn for a few years now.   It works, and is fun, but you must keep it VERY sharp. If the scythe is not razor sharp it will simply push the grass over instead of cutting it.   A sickle will still work when somewhat dull, because it gathers the grass into the concave bit and&#x2F;or you can hold on the grass with one hand and cut it with the other.<p>A scythe you have to sharpen every 5-10 min or so, normally you keep a scythe stone in your pocket to do this.   The sickle you can just sharpen at the beginning of the day and that will be good enough.<p>The sharpening process takes some practice to get good at,  particularly if you start peening it as well.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scytheworks.ca&#x2F;knowledge-base&#x2F;chapter-4-preparing-the-blades-edge&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scytheworks.ca&#x2F;knowledge-base&#x2F;chapter-4-preparing-th...</a></div><br/><div id="41992587" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41992587" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yetihehe</span><span>|</span><a href="#41990152">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41991330">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41992587">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41992587">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The sharpening process takes some practice to get good at, particularly if you start peening it as well.<p>I wish someone invented an easier and safer way to sharpen a scythe.

When people stopped using it, literally nothing went wrong or changed, no one needed it, but now everyone got back 15 minutes of their day.

So people might think, &quot;I&#x27;ll lose 3% of my harvest doing that, I can&#x27;t afford that&quot; except they&#x27;d expend 15% of the energy harvesting and thus that 3% loss is more than balanced out by the 85% time savings and the reduced work load. You can spend a fraction of that saved time making up the 3% difference in a hundred other ways.<p>People are very resistant to change.

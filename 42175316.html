This is an easy problem to avoid with minimal due diligence, people just choose convenience and make unnecessary tradeoffs.<p>* Use the standard library (ironically not available for Node projects). It will be built with better backwards compatibility almost every time. What deprecations do occur will likely be VERY WELL documented with much quicker adaptions.<p>* Limit third party dependencies. Do you really need an ORM for your apps 40 sql queries? How long would it take you to scaffold it with GenerativeAI then make it production-worthy without the ORM? 1 hour? 5 hours? 20 hours?<p>* Pick technologies with better track records.

They wanted to rapidly iterate, and so crufty old habits like this weren&#x27;t what they wanted or felt they needed.<p>What&#x27;s been interesting is watching these devs age 10 years, and still mostly decide it&#x27;s better to start new frameworks rather than treat legacy code as an asset. That feels to me like a generational shift. And I&#x27;m not shaking my cane and saying they&#x27;re wrong -- a modern LLM can parse an API document and get you 95% of the way to your goal most of the time pretty quickly -- but I propose it&#x27;s truly a cultural difference, and I suspect it won&#x27;t wash out as people age, just create different benefits and costs.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42177239" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42177239" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cxr</span><span>|</span><a href="#42175536">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42175778">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42175774">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42177239">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42177239">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re talking about what&#x27;s wrong with the NPM ecosystem, not JS.<p>Previously: <i>You wouldn&#x27;t conflate Windows development with &quot;C&quot; (and completely discount UNIX along the way) just because of Win32.</i> &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41899671">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41899671</a>&gt;</div><br/></div></div><div id="42175774" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42175774" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tpm</span><span>|</span><a href="#42175536">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42177239">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42175354">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42175774">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42175774">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah I&#x27;d expect 20yo Perl5 stuff to work without issues.<p>A few weeks ago I was experimenting with a sound generation dsl&#x2F;runtime called Csound and even most 30yo sources were working as long as they didn&#x27;t use some obsolete UI.</div><br/><div id="42175898" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42175898" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">transcriptase</span><span>|</span><a href="#42175536">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42175774">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42175354">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42175898">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42175898">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It’s the same with R.

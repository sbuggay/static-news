Meritocracy for the win. Not skin, not sobstory, skill and talent.<p>Some worries though:<p>Reproducing learning is way over-evaluated, as it can be reliably tested. Its the most worthless skill though, ever since the internet was invented. The ability to recombine approaches and create novel solutions to novel problems, that adhere to engineering approaches and principles, thats were the money is. 
Hard to test for that and i guess the tiger-mum kids will have to learn TRIZ inside out.<p>Also i find the cohort timing pressure detrimental. In my opinion, the option to study (because you are bored and dissatisfied with your station in life) should be open to anyone at any time. Even if it does not work out, it creates the ability to move and propels the person on.<p>Finally, i would detach the political and not society survival relevant pieces of university from the other parts.

Here&#x27;s how I view it.<p>To start, in America I believe that most of us believe that the &quot;default&quot; behavior should be to avoid unfair discrimination, especially for protected classes. I think most people would agree to at least this, it&#x27;s a pretty generic and obvious statement.<p>Therefore, when we deviate from this for some reason, generally, it REQUIRES a healthy amount of thought: the baseline should be at least a strong hypothesis to begin the conversation. The world is very complicated, so simply assuming something does what you expect it to because it intuitively sounds like it does is generally not a reasonable position.<p>And of course, the idea behind affirmative action, hopefully put into words that people feel is fair, <i>is</i> a sort of discrimination, but the intention is of course to try to adjust for past disgressions and injustice to try to &quot;re-balance&quot; opportunity. So unlike the four-letter-word that was discrimination in historical contexts, it is not based on racism[1], for example.<p>So does affirmative action work? It seems to do roughly what it is supposed to do, although honestly a huge problem is that it&#x27;s sort of tautological. Of course it <i>works</i>, at doing what it&#x27;s meant to do. Some have argued that it could potentially harm students by leading to a &quot;mismatch&quot;, but the evidence is mixed and in any case it probably causes more good than harm in terms of outcomes. I am not an expert on this though, and I have not been into the studies for a while.<p>The real question that I think causes so much strife and pain is the one that hurts to try to answer: is it worth it? And <i>that</i> is not easy to answer, nor does it have an obvious objective answer. I truly believe that most of this argument boils down to proxies for this particular question. Some people who have a particular egalitarian bend to their views on life and society might blanket oppose such a policy on an ideological basis, whereas someone who is strongly anti-racist is highly likely to prefer such policies even at high cost.<p>Cost? By that, in this case I mean in terms of going against the basic belief of not discriminating. Ideology is important to people even when there isn&#x27;t a discrete cost, but in this case the micro and macro views are very different. On the micro level, someone who is less qualified will be preferred over someone who is more qualified, on the basis of factors outside of their control. On the macro level, population demographics change, generally reducing biases.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of finer points. Like clearly, on the micro level, when someone &quot;less qualified&quot; according to some criteria passes due to affirmative action, the idea is that it was beyond their control in the first place that they were less qualified, which may very well be true. And on the macro level, statistics may not tell the full story: demographics are a measurement of people, and people are not fungible. The numbers surely look better on paper, but one must wonder sometimes if it&#x27;s actually doing what it looks like it&#x27;s doing.<p>You might think that I am staunchly opposed to affirmative action based on my framing of this, and the truth is, I simply don&#x27;t know. I think that it&#x27;s potentially very powerful, but it also is damn scary to wield institutional discrimination even if it&#x27;s supposed to be a force for good. This isn&#x27;t exactly a slippery slope situation, of course, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I&#x27;ve personally flip-flopped probably a lot of times. All I can say is that I sort of hope people don&#x27;t just assume this is the right way to solve all of the problem of injustices, or maybe even more importantly, that merely instituting policies like this doesn&#x27;t &quot;solve&quot; America&#x27;s history with racism and sexism; and I don&#x27;t think most people believe that it does. For some of those things, I think only a lot of time will truly be able to heal most of that, and it&#x27;s going to leave a pretty nasty scar.<p>Of course, beyond the fairly straightforward debate is the culture war bullshit surrounding it, but to me it&#x27;s mostly noise. I look forward to a future with less influence from Twitter and news organizations so that people can go back to discussing things at least slightly more like human beings.<p>[1]: Using racism in this context to refer to the fairly strict definition of being related to beliefs about races rather than about discrimination.</div><br/><div id="36796653" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36796653" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vacuity</span><span>|</span><a href="#36789546">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36792557">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36790720">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36796653">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36796653">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What baffles me is that so many people argue solely about affirmative action, as if it&#x27;s the only possible maybe-solution. I wrote more details here[0], but I think affirmative action can&#x27;t be effective because it&#x27;s so narrow, and the alternative should be lifting up poorer communities to an acceptable baseline. A strong foundation provides an opportunity for a strong house, after all. This would have an outsized impact on disadvantaged minorities but is more generally just <i>correct</i>: it doesn&#x27;t violate equality of opportunity and it actually helps out minorities.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36796543">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36796543</a><p>To go on a bit of a rant unrelated to your comment, but I think what I&#x27;m proposing will be very effective, assuming that the focus on education is held in poorer communities. Culture is a touchy subject. Anyways, education has been shown to be an empowering force, and what better way to eradicate racism to the fringes of society than to bring everyone to the same level? Intentional or not, the feasibility of racism would become less as the prevalence of undeniably qualified minorities grows. Affirmative action gets the goal right but not the method. Even if what I&#x27;m proposing is somewhat incomplete, it would be a lot better as a starting point of discussion.

At ivy league universities, the graduate students effectively get to treat their work as if they were a manager who contracts out every price of work needed.  Need cryo TEM of some samples? Send it down the hall, don&#x27;t worry about it for a week, and then get nicely formatted results done for you by staff scientists that perform this service for the university daily.

The main room served as a living room, dining room and bedroom.<p>&gt; Lincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin in Kentucky and was raised on the frontier, primarily in Indiana.<p>&gt; Feynman was born on May 11, 1918, in Queens, New York City, to Lucille (née Phillips; 1895–1981), a homemaker, and Melville Arthur Feynman (1890–1946), a sales manager.<p>&gt; [Tom] Cruise was born on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York, to electrical engineer Thomas Cruise Mapother III (1934–1984) and special education teacher Mary Lee (née Pfeiffer; 1936–2017).

Rawls&#x27; point was that in such circumstances, most even semi-rational people will choose the one that makes it the most likely that they will <i>not</i> end up in a non-disadvantaged position, which is the fundamental concept behind an egalitarian to oppurtunity and inequality.<p>Given that, faced with a choice between:<p>1) a society that carries out substantive income&#x2F;wealth redistribution so that few people (if anyone) has issues with a broad set of &quot;basic&quot; needs<p>2) a society that offers limited substantive income&#x2F;wealth redistribution in the name of &quot;high rewards for high achievement&quot; or something similar<p>most people in Rawls thought experiment will choose the former.<p>You only choose (2) when you have reason to believe you will be a high achiever, which in a truly meritocratic society, you cannot know in advance.<p>So, the US is a society in which median (PPP) income is highest, but low income redistribution ensures that large numbers of people struggle to enjoy the things that US society considers &quot;normal&quot;.

But all the data I can find says that there isn’t an outsized difference between the regions.

We should not “redistribute wealth like other western nations” because I can’t think of any G20 nations that have a clearly preferable economic system.<p>Also to your point about Rawls, if you go too far with redistribution you remove the incentive for people to do difficult or unpleasant work. We’ve witnessed this countless times over the past century in all the failed socialist&#x2F;communist societies. In a less extreme example we just witnessed France default on its pension obligations!<p>Nobody is going to work for free. The US spends more money than any other nation on social welfare programs.

Yes, the income&#x2F;wealth distribution curve is skewed to the right here...<p>But the majority of Americans are wealthier than the majority of Europeans! A random sample of both populations would yield wealthier individuals on the US side.<p>Equal distribution by itself is a silly goal.

The technological innovation that comes out of the US blows Europe out of the water. Where is all the European competition? Just look at the financial statements of the largest EU and US corporations. The data is plain as day!<p>&gt; The people who earn the most in our system are not the people who do difficult or unpleasant work, and it just seems preposterous to me to suggest that there is a link here.<p>You&#x27;re wrong. Any meaningful tax revenue for wealth distribution would have to come from people in the upper quintiles. These are lawyers, doctors, engineers, oil rig workers, underwater welders, etc.<p>You still haven&#x27;t suggested any actual policy change. I&#x27;m guessing you have a nebulous idea of &quot;take it from the billionaires&quot;. There is no way in hell we can create a wealth tax that generates a $1T+ in annual tax revenue. There aren&#x27;t enough billionaires to sustain such a tax and they absolutely have the means to legally evade taxes or jet off to anywhere in the world.

We are a rich country, and we could choose to place substantially more emphasis on the quality of life of all our people. But we &quot;choose&quot; to do otherwise.<p>We cannot afford infinite wars. Our military spending is dwarfed by our spending on social programs. Go read the federal budget for fucks sake. The majority of our budget is social security, medicare&#x2F;medicaid.<p>Go read history and international news. How can you hear about the current events in Europe and claim that economic conditions are good? The region is unstable and full of young governments. The region cannot create its own energy, which kneecaps its own heavily industrial economy. The region is entirely dependent on the US&#x2F;China and is just now decoupling from Russia. Macron is ranting about the lack of European Sovereignty. Inflation is much worse in the EU. The continent will definitely stabilize, and its not the end of Europe...but they&#x27;ve sustained significant economic damage.<p>I don&#x27;t give a fuck about nationality. I don&#x27;t think America or Americans are superior. Europe is our most powerful ally and I wish prosperity for the entire region. I just hate this constant populist rhetoric that the US needs to adopt undefined mythical tax&#x2F;spending systems to achieve some fantasy utopia.<p>Please name the policy changes required to solve poverty in America.

Most of the legacies are actually quite good, and many are exceptional, so perhaps 30-50% got in over  some &#x27;better&#x27; kid.

Staff members less so, but it is politically hard to reject them if you want to keep their parents.  There are more in the second category than in the first.

Now, students have to rely on unpredictable financial assistance like grants and scholarships, and take on predatory loans to cover the difference.</div><br/><div id="36793061" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36793061" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">onlyrealcuzzo</span><span>|</span><a href="#36788857">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36792575">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36790333">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36793061">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36793061">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; So what has changed?

It’s also where most organizations tend to dump their excess revenue, and since the US has been aggressively subsidizing demand for universities for decades, they’ve had a ton of excess revenue to dump into administrative staff.<p>&gt; TAs, grad students, adjunct professors<p>Most academic fields produce significantly more Ph.D.’s than there are tenure track positions or other full time professional careers.

People always claim that this is because there aren’t enough tenure track positions, but I think that’s backwards. Why would you open up a tenure track position when you have a plethora of Ph.D’s who are apparently willing to work as adjuncts?

It doesn&#x27;t stand to reason at all that the donations will be transferred to whatever other school their kid attends, donations like this are not fungible and do not scale linearly - if everyone in your family for five generations has gone to Harvard, and your kid goes to Arizona State, you aren&#x27;t suddenly going to build a family tradition of loving Arizona State. You&#x27;re more likely to simply dilute the strength of the family-college connection and not donate at all, or donate a perfunctory amount and put the rest into the opera you attend these days. I didn&#x27;t look up the authors of this study, but they certainly didn&#x27;t bother to mention any familiarity with the field of fundraising, which isn&#x27;t as straightforward as they make it sound. Even if the strength of connection was the same, do public schools have the same skills and desire to <i>request</i> donations as Harvard does?<p>To test that hypothesis: they should check the Arizona State alumni to see if the number of relatives who attended Harvard is just as good a predictor of donations to Arizona State, because it&#x27;s equally as strong a proxy for wealth when you attend Arizona State as when you attend Harvard. My bet is that it&#x27;s a very weak predictor!</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36789082" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36789082" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">savanaly</span><span>|</span><a href="#36788857">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36788957">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36790350">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36789046">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36789082">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36789082">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That doesn&#x27;t answer the question though, does it?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;astralcodexten.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-phrase-no-evidence-is-a-red-flag" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;astralcodexten.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-phrase-no-evidence...</a></div><br/><div id="36789639" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36789639" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bumby</span><span>|</span><a href="#36788857">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36789082">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36789195">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36789046">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36789639">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36789639">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The article clearly says there&#x27;s no evidence of a &quot;casual relationship between legacy preference policies and total alumni giving.&quot;<p>Can you explain your point further?

FWIW white students are the most underrepresented on elite campuses so it would be hard to argue that there are admissions policies favoring them.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;features.thecrimson.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;freshman-survey&#x2F;academics-narrative&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;features.thecrimson.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;freshman-survey&#x2F;academi...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stanforddaily.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;06&#x2F;30&#x2F;stanford-to-expand-outreach-efforts-as-supreme-court-strikes-affirmative-action&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stanforddaily.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;06&#x2F;30&#x2F;stanford-to-expand-outr...</a></div><br/><div id="36789690" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36789690" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ceejayoz</span><span>|</span><a href="#36788772">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36789040">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36789301">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36789690">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36789690">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Harvard recently reported that legacies actually had higher SAT scores than non-legacy admits.<p>This likely indicates wealthy people can afford SAT preparation tutors.</div><br/><div id="36792975" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36792975" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">timmg</span><span>|</span><a href="#36788772">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36789690">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36789301">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36792975">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36792975">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It could also mean: smarter people make more money -- and they pass down intelligence -- both genetically and through teaching.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36789301" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36789301" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kevinventullo</span><span>|</span><a href="#36788772">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36789040">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36789690">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36789098">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36789301">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36789301">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>Harvard recently reported that legacies actually had higher SAT scores than non-legacy admits…</i><p>So you agree that Harvard shouldn’t need to factor in legacy status and instead use fairer metrics like SAT scores?</div><br/><div id="36789789" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36789789" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">onetimeusename</span><span>|</span><a href="#36788772">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36789301">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36789098">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36789789">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36789789">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not necessarily.

I think you are deliberately ignoring that the SFFA lawsuit said this, politicians said this, and even people ITT said this and clearly these things reflect poorly on the university. There isn&#x27;t any evidence that legacy admissions is affirmative action for white people or rich people though.<p><i>simply drop legacy status from consideration altogether</i><p>There isn&#x27;t any evidence that legacy status counts for. You have never established that it does. Not one of the California schools in that article I cited says that legacy admits have an advantage.

CMU from the OP article said legacy status had no bearing on admissions for years. Harvard likewise. Their reasons for tracking legacy status are probably complicated. I concede at one point they were used to allow in less qualified students but that hasn&#x27;t been the case for years. But tracking legacy status does not mean it is used to give favorable admissions. I do not believe it does and the legacy admits are probably qualified. That is clearly the case for Harvard. If you did not believe this, you are saying universities are lying about their policies.<p>So since the accusation that legacy admissions is affirmative action for white people is disingenuous, I believe the people who continue to say that it is are actually the ones not arguing in good faith.<p>edit: dropping legacy status from applications may not even change the percentage of &#x27;legacy&#x27; admits and yet I am sure that universities know who they are. Including it on applications may harm the legacy applications because the universities are now under politically charged pressure which is what I am arguing would be wrong.</div><br/><div id="36794887" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36794887" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kevinventullo</span><span>|</span><a href="#36788772">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36794034">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36789098">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36794887">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36794887">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>Harvard likewise</i><p>To be clear, you are claiming that Harvard explicitly does <i>not</i> consider legacy status when deciding on admissions?<p>So, when a student is considered being cut in the final stage of the admissions process, i.e. on the “lop list”, and decision makers are provided with only four pieces of information: legacy status, athlete status, financial aid eligibility, and race; you are claiming that legacy status is included for… what, to satisfy the curiosity of admissions committee members?

Well... I think it&#x27;s unlikely. There might be cases, I went through some math on this once and concluded that maybe 2% of the incoming class at Harvard could be unqualified legacy admits based on the total pool and the SAT std dev, etc. but even that I doubt. I think legacies probably are qualified based on what I have seen but the main reason I think this is more because admissions are hyper scrutinized now (for the past 10-20 years and they&#x27;ve been publishing student body stats) so if there is a way for Harvard to let in unqualified people it will be noticed and the public would not accept legacy admissions(SFFA lawsuit began almost a decade now). The athletic one is a different beast.<p><i>you are claiming that legacy status is included for… what</i><p>Possibly a tactic to raise more money because alumni are somewhat tricked into thinking making donations increases the odds their children are accepted.

Well if a school came out and said we allow some legacy admissions because it raises more money from donors and we need the money (and that wasn&#x27;t a lie) I think that raises an interesting question about admissions I don&#x27;t have an answer to. Most schools probably don&#x27;t need the money now, I don&#x27;t know where the money goes though. But I don&#x27;t know what to think about admissions; not convinced there is a perfect formula.

Apologies for wall of text.<p>Alternate explanation is that particularly sneaky elite admissions boards have learned to coordinate to devalue SAT scores for Asians, they&#x27;d rather engineer their mean Asian SAT score around something not embarrassingly high as cover for other cohorts, especially legacy which AFAIK doesn&#x27;t need AA skew, since they&#x27;re... legacy. AA primarily brings down average scores of non-legacy, and in this case make legacy look better, like average at Harvard for non asian &amp; non white is 1450 according to your link, which is low considering 1500+ scores is 9th percentile for 223k Asian takers [0&amp;1]. This is slightly conspiratorial, but also essentially what started the anti-AA case was when an Asian applicant with 1590 got rejected from multiple elite colleges, and the case essentially revealed high scores make Asians seem like bland test takers with bad personality even though personality assessment showed otherwise. Asian scores are high enough to break Harvard&#x27;s argument not just for AA but IMO legacy as well.<p>Some other considerations, with respect to Harvard, according to latest admission data, @28% asian enrollment out of 2000 for class of 26, that&#x27;s about 550 asians (previously this was ~20%). The real question the Harvard admissions stats don&#x27;t show is how many Asians with 1550+ scores are being rejected due to &quot;personality&quot;. If you look SAT score distribution [0], Asians are the only group where perfect math score is NOT 99+ percentile rank but &quot;only&quot; 95, and on ERW Asians 750+ score is 95 percentile vs other groups where it&#x27;s 99+ except whites &#x2F; multi racial at 98. Meaning Asians have disproportionate candidates with most perfect math and close to perfect ERW scores of all groups. Asians also total score outlier in that 1500+ is &quot;only&#x27;&#x27; 91 percentile vs 98 to 99+ for everyone else. Collegeboard also has info that about 223k Asians (out of 2.2M takers) took SATs (2020 data [1]), so there&#x27;s ~20k Asians with 1500+ scores (9th percentile). If extrapolated from 98th percentile of over 1500+ scores from 2.2M takers, that&#x27;s ~44k total pool over 1500+ candidates of which 45% are Asians. 45% Asian is also in line with UCs where prop 209 banned AA and led to 40+% asian campuses.<p>Question is how many of 1550+ ones are Asians, keeping in mind ~7000 Asians have perfect math scores. My gut feeling is there are many 1550+ Asians being rejected by elites for skewing scores too high to keep legacy admissions charade going, especially at Harvard, because any Asian who scores that high, which rough napkin math is multiple size of their annual enrollment, would have an application to Harvard and eager to accept. Hence the narrative harvard stats paints via omission even by their student journalists, is that legacy does better non-legacy whose down by affirmative action, and legacy slightly worse than Asian Americans, when reality is Asian Americans have more than enough candidates to saturate scores above legacy and affirmative actions so their aggregate score has to be kept down through admission shenanigans.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;satsuite.collegeboard.org&#x2F;media&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;sat-percentile-ranks-gender-race-ethnicity.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;satsuite.collegeboard.org&#x2F;media&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;sat-percentile-r...</a>

I think it&#x27;s dangerous to think that a meritocracy always leads to good outcomes when there is huge inequality. This best analogy I can give is the &quot;sports stars&quot; analogy. Professional sports is probably the most even playing field I can imagine - there is such a huge incentive to win games that pretty much all else besides skills on the playing field is ignored. But what it results in is a teeny tiny elite making millions, and nearly everyone else barely making enough to get by. So if the rest of the economy was like the sports stars world (and more and more of it is leaning that way), what reason do the rest of the 99.99% have to support this meritocracy? Sure, you can say it&#x27;s an improvement that the best people are in charge, but if it&#x27;s clear my genetic talents will prevent me from ever being a star, my incentive is really to tear the whole system down if none of those benefits ever make it my way.<p>I think one contributing factor you see behind so much increasing social strife, the resurgent interest in unions, etc. is the belief that <i>unless</i> you make it to a top job after a top school, you&#x27;ll barely be scraping by your whole life.<p>Pure meritocracy in a &quot;winner take all&#x2F;most&quot; economy leads to a very unstable society.</div><br/><div id="36789312" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36789312" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lotsofpulp</span><span>|</span><a href="#36788772">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36789103">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36789542">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36789312">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36789312">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why are the reward ratios in professional sports relevant to other occupations in society?<p>&gt; But what it results in is a teeny tiny elite making millions, and nearly everyone else barely making enough to get by.<p>That is because a very small number of people can satiate the demand for almost all of the world’s people for entertainment from watching sports.

Athletics was and is education. In countries where there are no athletics, education is just rote indoctrination. Someone who has played a team sport is more equipped to lead - e.g. <i>scale their capabilities</i> -  than someone who has not because it&#x27;s about tacit knowledge and physical experience you can&#x27;t just memorize. An athlete is necessarily more educated than a non-athlete, just by definition. The most dominant organizations in the world recruit from athletic programs for this reason.<p>Thanks to the replication crisis, statistically, probably half your professors were frauds anyway, especially if you went to a top tier school in the last decade or two, and almost none of them would have been athletes. They don&#x27;t have the character required to succeed in a physical discipline, and they hate athletes because people from physical culture are difficult to bully and decieve.<p>Want to learn how to work on a team? Sail a boat with a crew. Want to learn to push boundaries and take risks? Race downhill on anything. Want to solve coordination problems? Play football&#x2F;soccer. Want to appreciate nature? Surf. Want charisma? Ride a horse. Want to understand cumulative effort and long term strategic goals? Powerlift. Want to understand endurance? Run marathons or be a triathlete. Want to learn ego discipline and humility? Play tennis. Want to read people? Try fencing. Want to learn what performance really means? Do any of these at a serious level. Dismissing athleticism is just farcically ignorant and effete.<p>Maybe the argument against these is that they require class, but I know poor kids who have achieved at the highest levels of most of them, and they earned the class distinction and respect for their skill that comes with the competence. Merely learning to call things problematic and fall into line commands no respect from anyone, and it has created a layer of anxious impostors driving institutions into the ground.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36791535" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36791535" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">philip1209</span><span>|</span><a href="#36788875">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36790382">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36794460">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36793449">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36791535">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36791535">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The federal funding going to these universities is to subsidize education, not athletics.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36793449" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36793449" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">janalsncm</span><span>|</span><a href="#36788875">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36790382">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36791535">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36790851">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36793449">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36793449">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Would you say the same in reverse?

The purpose of legacy admissions is predominantly to get students who could go to plenty of universities at your tier to go to your university, based on the fact that their parents are alumni. You do end up with a minority-within-a-minority population of rich students who are only there because they share a last name with a building, but frankly those students are also valuable to the rest of the student body from a networking perspective.<p>I&#x27;m opposed to the change. The value in a university education is not just from &quot;going to school&quot;. You have the prestige of the university (helped by attracting noteworthy alumni), networking opportunity (helped by having current students with connections through their parents), academic quality of the student body (having the rich kids subsidize merit-based scholarships boosts this, too).<p>On the whole, legacy admissions (and preferential admission of rich kids in general) benefits the student body as a whole. It&#x27;s the raison d&#x27;etre of private schools, and eliminating it maybe lets in another say ~1-5% of your student body&#x27;s worth of students who wouldn&#x27;t have gotten in otherwise, in exchange for lowering the value of getting in for everybody.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36789168" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36789168" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ghaff</span><span>|</span><a href="#36788858">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36789638">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36789514">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36789168">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36789168">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Is it really a big deal?<p>Probably not in general.

This is how many countries do it in Europe and it just works.<p>But what about economically disadvantaged minority groups? That&#x27;s easy to fix too. Just give schools in poorer areas lots of extra funding and resources, and their skills should improve, so that they do well in exams without any ridiculous &quot;positive discrimination&quot; based on skin color or ethnicity.

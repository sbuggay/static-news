The concept that was used was called &quot;unit presidency&quot;. Each employee was empowered, expected, and trained, to make decisions as if <i>they</i> are the president of the company. The principles behind making decisions were called &quot;economic thinking&quot; which the CEO used to say was everything he learnt in a Harvard (EDIT: or maybe it was Stanford) MBA distilled into the core principles. Basically looking at the ROI (Return on Investment) of the decision. Decisions were generally made by consensus though depending on the nature of the decision sometimes other methods were used. This extended to decisions that involved spending money, not just should you pick language X or language Y for your next software project.<p>I think it worked pretty well for quite a few years. It gradually stopped working when the company acquired a large company with a different culture and also hired people (well, managers mostly) who weren&#x27;t aligned with the culture. Eventually this basically disappeared when the company was acquired by Kodak.<p>I&#x27;ve seen flavors of this in other places. Famously Andy Grove of Intel also preached that decisions need to be made by those closest to the decision and empowered people to make the right decisions. More generally this can be reflected in a servant-leadership model where leadership sees itself as facilitating the growth of the people underneath them.<p>Another requirement for this to work well is that management (e.g. the CEO or other leaders) are able to lay down a broad strategy for the people of the company to execute on. If the leadership has no strategy then tactical decisions can not be made properly. They also need to make sure there&#x27;s coordination and structure.</div><br/><div id="40894595" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40894595" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LeFantome</span><span>|</span><a href="#40893945">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40894808">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40894595">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40894595">[29 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">[Edit: apologies for the wall of text. A lot of pent up emotion around Creo.]<p>Best place I ever worked.<p>This was “the Creo Philosophy”:<p>Our priority is to provide unique and sustainable value to our customers.<p>1. All decisions must be based on sound economics.<p>2. Key decisions are made in consensus, with full team agreement to accept and implement the decision.<p>3. We believe that people are most effective when self-managed.<p>4. Compensation is based on contribution, gauged largely by an annual peer review.<p>5. All employees share the wealth created by their hard work and innovation.<p>Creo was extremely proud of how “flat” the organization was but my primary take-away from there as an ex-employee is actually how important management is.<p>First and foremost, management created a shared vision of the future. Not silly posters to laugh at but a real shared mission. It was exciting and motivating. Every Creoite knew how the world would be changed when we were successful. Decisions could be distributed because it was obvious which outcomes were aligned with the companies goals. Trying to push outcomes not aligned with the goals was hard ( as it should be ).<p>Second, there was a strong framework for how decisions were made and how to identify good decisions from bad ones. Economic thinking and consensus were two important principles that you were expected to follow unless you could demonstrate very good reasons not to.<p>Third, management provided a great deal of mentorship, both through direct education and through calling re-enforcing the primacy of the principles. One of the reason Creo could be so “flat” is because everybody knew how the executives would behave if they were in the room and they could insist that others act accordingly. It was easy to assume executive sponsorship without having to resort to politics. “We do not tolerate politics” was an important mantra through the best parts of the company history.<p>Most importantly, I got to experience the everyday effectiveness of the organization under three different CEO’s: Ken Spencer, Amos Michelson, and Mark Dance. The “culture” was only as good as the man at the helm.<p>At Creo, we made the claim all the time that we basically did not have hierarchal management. It was true we did not always have “supervisors” but we had the best management I have ever worked for.<p>As said above, Creo stopped working when it acquired a rival that had more employees than it had. The politics exploded. The effectiveness disappeared. Financial performance followed. The company was sold to avoid a shareholder revolt. A sad end for a spectacular organization.<p>The original Creo employees stuck to the principles. Well, except management. Hierarchical authority was suddenly more important. Decisions did not have to make economic sense. What mattered was who was doing the deciding. Consensus stopped being a requirement. Speaking truth to power stopped being a path to better decisions and started becoming a career mistake. Executive sponsorship became real and aligning with people in position became the most important criteria for individual success. Empire building replaced shared vision. The lack of alignment between making the company successful and being successful as an employee completely broke. The company failed.<p>Managers and employees looked at Creo folks and their “philosophy” like naive children. Sure “the philosophy” worked well enough for Creo to beat them to begin with but, once merged, the acquired were right. Creo was idealistic and naive. But this was not inevitable.<p>Why did Creo fail? Did “the philosophy” not scale as the final CEO I think believed? I do not think so. I see it purely as a failure of management.<p>The final CEO provided little vision. Other than a focus on the bottom line, there was no insistence on economic decision making ( eg. instead of breaking up meetings because they had too many people in them - too expensive - he held meetings with dozens of people in them ). Instead of coming down on politics and insisting on consensus, executive authority became sacred. In fact, the term “consensus” became most often used when an executive used it as an excuse for their own lack of leadership by claiming the team should have to solve its own problems.<p>If strong management had provided the leadership, the mentorship, the vision, and support for the culture ( most importantly the principles of good vs bad decision making ), Creo would still be with us. If I was lucky, I would still be working there.<p>Creo ruined me in a way. I have never been able to accept why things cannot be as good anywhere else. Such simple ideas. So dramatically effective. Unfortunately, good management ( executive level ) is an absolute requirement. Even hundreds or thousands of well trained employees was not enough to make these principles work without strong management behind them. Management matters.<p>I got to experience some amazing leadership for a while. All I can do is try to emulate those role models as best I can. And everywhere I go, I try to make economic thinking an important part of how decisions get made.<p>RIP Creo. You left us too soon.</div><br/><div id="40895329" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40895329" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yosefk</span><span>|</span><a href="#40893945">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40894595">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40895011">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40895329">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40895329">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Author here - I&#x27;m simultaneously quite pessimistic about, and very interested in heterodox organizational structures and especially real-world stories about them.

They share the Creo quality of making lots of millionaires and people looking back on their time there as one of great freedom and achievement.<p>In all these places, employees are paid according to the revenue they generate, with seemingly no ceiling to what you can take home. 
It is true that the size of any one cell doesn’t scale beyond a small number of people. But all the organisations I mentioned above scale by having units tackling small pieces of vast markets.<p>The main lesson I took away from reading “Barbarians at the Gate” is that big companies hugely suffer from the principal agent problem, where management is mostly out to enrich themselves at the expense of shareholders and employees (sometimes). This looting is however only possible at a company that was established by a founder with a deep vision and passion for the product and has set up systems and culture that generates sufficient cash for the professional management to leech off.<p>What I have not read yet is a systematic study of these “cellular organizations” and what the common features are that make them successful. My guess is that the key is that each “unit” or “cell” has measurable economics that makes it possible to share the economic value over a sustained period of time. A bit like why sales people get paid a lot.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40895452" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40895452" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chii</span><span>|</span><a href="#40893945">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40895329">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40895792">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40895011">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40895452">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40895452">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  I feel that failure or regression to the mean are quite likely<p>i suspect that these failures are a failure for humans to adapt to a larger herd than the traditional tribal size - anything beyond a couple hundred people max.</div><br/><div id="40895497" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40895497" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LarsDu88</span><span>|</span><a href="#40893945">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40895452">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40895011">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40895497">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40895497">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Have you ever read the book &quot;Loonshots&quot;

The issue is that managers need to eat some of the risk of those failures although it is offset by the benefit of the team&#x27;s successes.

The CI systems I dealt with most recently, for example, were very much compute-bound. Way too weak VMs for the runnres, and way too few of them. With CI builds taking each of upward 2h, and capacity to run maybe 10 of them in parallel, this pretty much destroys any ability to work with small commits - you have to squash them before submitting for review anyway, otherwise you destroy anyone else&#x27;s ability to get their changeset through CI for the rest of the day.<p>This is entirely solvable by getting more resources. At least 2x more runners, each at least 2x as beefy. You could go 10x and I doubt it would be anywhere as expensive as the amount of money company wastes on devs waiting for CI.

His army of 10k men could not attack and break formation, since Saladin&#x27;s cavalry was faster and could pick off Richard&#x27;s men.<p>Richard&#x27;s goal was to wait until Saladin&#x27;s  horses got tired, and when that opportunity arose, charge and catch him while he was slow.<p>After a few weeks of nothing, suddenly one of his units (the Knights Hospitallier), led by Baldwin le Carron, started to charge on Saladin. Richard the Lionheart had no way of knowing if this was a good idea (to this day we don&#x27;t know why Baldwin made his decision) but he immediately backed the charge with all 10k of his men and defeated Saladin&#x27;s army.<p>This wasn&#x27;t being lazy or poor management. Richard understood that he did not have the information needed to execute his strategy, so he delegated it to his officers.<p>When Baldwin le Carron made a decision Richard didn&#x27;t understand, Richard didn&#x27;t ask for a Jira ticket or a design doc, so he would have more information to make his decision (as a &quot;good&quot; manager should). He trusted his subordinates and won.<p>I believe software engineers are getting the wrong idea about a company being in &quot;war mode&quot;.<p>If one reads military strategy, a proven tactic for leaders is outlining strategy and trusting your subordinates to execute it, because feeding information upwards takes too long.</div><br/><div id="40895471" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40895471" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chii</span><span>|</span><a href="#40894768">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40895519">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40895471">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40895471">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; When this happens, leadership should back these initiatives.<p>this requires trust in the &quot;low-level&quot; people.

Gotta have _some_ way to do it, even though I&#x27;d argue selecting for those most likely to hang in there for a long hiring process isn&#x27;t the best way.<p>3.

(Tens&#x2F;hundreds of megs of RAM, not KBs.) The only case where you don&#x27;t hoard resources is if the system is so small that it&#x27;s programmed by a small team since the functionality is severely limited by resource scarcity, so there&#x27;s no reason to grow the team to deploy more functionality. Above a certain not-so-large size, people will hoard resources in an embedded system - they can&#x27;t ask for more capacity like they would if it was server-side software, but they sure can avoid giving up whatever resources their code is already using.<p>Researchers actually have a limited and smallish hardware budget, so academia is likely to come up with cost-saving ideas even when hardware performance grows very quickly.

One of their primary products was a do-it-all embedded chip that handled many disparate functions, which eventually grew to rather massive proportions; rather than optimizing the resulting bloated software, the company just petitioned their chip supplier for a special part with way more flash memory than a standard part would have. IIRC it had something like 16x the Flash memory compared to the largest public part.<p>The code quality was awful. People were churning out C++ monstrosities with zero concern for code size. The final product was the result of linking together modules from dozens of teams, none of whom really cared at all about code size; I’m frankly surprised the CPU didn’t fall over from all the excess code it had to run (the RTOS was, at the very least, very good at prioritizing…).

There is no defined budget for raises; every significant raise is hard to get, and you never get it proactively without bargaining, but there’s no formal system to avoid spending too much on raises except for the reluctant, reactive approach to giving them. There’s also no system for firing low performers, and it’s only very rarely that you see anyone fired - like that crazy fuck who went on and on about how your source control sucked and should be completely different, and then used a single dot character, “.”, as the commit message when he finally committed something.<p>I am interested in the rest of this thought… “suppose you only get a standard raise unless you speak loudly”.

It was a call center, and they had status tiers for wages - e.g. if you were an &quot;A player&quot; you would get $.50&#x2F;hr more, or if you were a &quot;star player&quot; you would get $1&#x2F;hr more (or whatever the amounts were). These statuses were tied to various metrics that the business cared about - average call time, quality scores from customer surveys, repeat calls, and so on. So ostensibly, if you got the current metric  down to whatever the goal was, you would get a raise for a month or whatever.<p>The problem was that the business changed these metrics on the phone reps all the time, so it was common for some poor bastard to really strive to get his call times down, only to be told &quot;oh sorry we&#x27;re focusing on quality scores this month&quot; when reviewing his work with the boss. My impression was that the company was doing this to avoid having to actually pay people more, not to keep people from gaming metrics - but I think the results would be pretty similar regardless of motive.<p>What happened wasn&#x27;t that people focused on trying to be great generalists. Instead they got demoralized by the games the company was playing, and they would either quit trying to improve at all or they would exclusively focus on one metric (so that they could get the big raise when that metric was being rewarded next).<p>Based on that experience, I&#x27;m somewhat doubtful that what you propose would work.

Government bureaucracy is not typically associated with visionary leadership. However, faced with this conundrum, I called the CEO equivalent and said “We need this.” (In so many words), and later that afternoon we were moving along with critical procurements.<p>Competent management has tight process controls to prevent waste. But the leadership is the head and the process the tail. If a VP (or whatever) is slave to some bean counter in accounting, that VP cannot achieve her mission. Leadership means we follow the process, but have the ability to act.<p>In smaller orgs, much less formality and lighter process makes more sense.

It&#x27;s original in thought, and gave some attention to why things work stupidly, and are even upheld.<p>Let&#x27;s now turn to what one does about. I want to pick one issue to discuss here. Consider, this excerpt:<p>&quot;Great idea - now I can commit some CPU or memory hog, then you can fix it, and we’ll split the reward.&quot;<p>Here and in other places the author implicitly refers to an underlying tolerance, existence, or undertone of lying, BS, and effete manipulation. In my time in corporate America I&#x27;ve not seen code like that, but I have heard, seen, and been at the brunt of similar actions:<p>- I manage up and down (a boss I once had said this) ... meaning ... I&#x27;m selling up and down the chain of command to put the spin on it I want. And if you&#x27;re not doing this you&#x27;re a naive moron.<p>- The same guy orchestrated work in our team that was sub-optimal (details unimportant here) precisely so his team would be involved, and have work in a larger project.<p>- The same guy, prior to me joining his team and unknown to me, went around the corp getting internal customers to use a particular service. What internal customers did not know, what that his intent was to make it a one way join: once the customer&#x27;s code was integrated there was no practical way out. Besides job security, the ultimate aim was in his words &quot;take over the floor by taking over the data.&quot;<p>- Internal service groups whose visions for what to do are what they want to do, and not what their ``customers&quot; need. I&#x27;ve beat that into the ground in other posts. I will just say here: internal service groups MUST be customer driven just like they are on the outside. A roofer can tell me his vision, his price, what he wants to do etc.. I can agree or not. But ultimately I tell the roofer if he&#x27;s value add or not, if his prices are too high or not, if his work is any good or not. And I will pay or not based on what I see. He doesn&#x27;t tell me any of this. However, in corp america internal customer&#x27;s don&#x27;t have that agency because asshole internal supplies know management implicitly or explicitly will make customers use them.<p>- My better half works in cloud migrations. JFK the BS, games, lying that goes on to protect internal data centers is beyond even what I&#x27;ve been through. But I can say this: a leading reason companies move to the cloud? They are sick and tired of crappy internal servicing from those who run the private data centers. With-holding costs of labor, data floor space, or lying about it was common in her telling.<p>Where am I going? A good way to improve the climate at a company, which MUST BE DONE STARTING C-suite, then top management, the middle management, then TLs: BS, lying is fireable. As soon as people learn a company does not pay people to be cynical, that&#x27;s already way better. I say starting at C-suit, because I learned the hard way substantive change will not happen unless it comes from on-high. See Ishikawa&#x27;s tunnel analogy in &quot;What Is Total Quality Control?: The Japanese Way.&quot; which is a focus on management&#x27;s roles and responsibilities in quality.<p>Some examples you right read about where that&#x27;s worked well: Berkshire Hathaway; Renaissance Tech. An old boss (a Chem-E) in Silicon Valley was a guy like this. These people don&#x27;t like problems or mistakes ... making one is not a crime but not consequence free either ... but lying&#x2F;BS always makes them worse, harder to find, and harder to correct.<p>I got the guy I mentioned earlier kicked our of our division. So I mean what I say.<p>Openness&#x2F;truthfulness is a an critical intangible to good companies.</div><br/><div id="40895613" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40895613" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">brazzy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40895014">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40895613">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40895613">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; My better half works in cloud migrations.

If someone doing &quot;cloud migration&quot; is around to observe, that means the internal data center people <i>know</i> their heads are on the chopping board, and desperately trying to preserve their jobs. You cannot expect honesty from someone fighting for survival, and it&#x27;s disingenuous to assume they deserve it because they act that way.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

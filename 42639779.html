I suppose that could be a very important factor for some people who do work in a geographically dispersed area. A few things I would be concerned with are:
1) your SO is not on the same schedule and really for what isn’t a solid reason. I could see this becoming a source of resentment at some point. 
2) you have to cut people out of your life vs explaining the schedule when they don’t understand why. I understand that the lectures would likely get tiresome at some point, but it seems a bit selfish to switch to this schedule when it could become problematic for friends and family members. 
3) I think cardio and total health should be measured and monitored as part of the experiment. It is entirely possible that this schedule can have real benefits for health or at the least not negatively affect your health. You mention that you are able to workout more often and effectively, so it may also be interesting to track your fitness level on the schedule vs 24 hr days. It would just be anecdotal but it would at least be some data.<p>I guess the only other things I would want to know is what factors pushed most to switching schedules? How long do you plan to stay on the schedule? How does your employer handle this schedule change? Or are you self employed&#x2F;running a business? What do you think the biggest challenges are during the switch aside from being tired at hour 10-11? What does your SO really think about this schedule? The more I think about this, the more questions I have :)</div><br/><div id="42640887" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42640887" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">spoaceman7777</span><span>|</span><a href="#42640696">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42640873">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42640887">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42640887">[23 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The greatest benefit is that you can stay up until you&#x27;re absolutely dog-tired every day, and not have to worry about all the rituals of &quot;sleep hygiene&quot;, like limiting screen time, dimming lights, no coffee, etc.<p>On a &gt;24 hour sleep schedule, you _will_ be tired when it&#x27;s time to sleep. Guaranteed. Not only that, you can sleep longer and will always feel well-rested.<p>Meeting people all around the world, when they&#x27;re collectively hanging out online, is also fantastic. Social platforms that involve more one-on-one contact, like X, Group chats, and similar, have completely different things going on at different hours. You start to make even more friends spread out across the world, and prevent getting stuck into ruts.<p>There&#x27;s also the benefit that conversations and the environment online is always fresh. You&#x27;re always cycling into new time blocks that you haven&#x27;t been active in for a few days.<p>And, not just online. There&#x27;s something to be said about experiencing (while fully awake) all of the different times of day where you live. You get to see sunrises and sunsets. Busy morning chatter of cars, and the world buzzing to life. The beyond-wee hours of the morning, when the city is so quiet you can hear a pin drop.<p>Really though, the main benefit is the first one in this comment. You can live your life to the maximum extent, without scheduling in the extra time to manage getting to sleep, and feeling tired when you don&#x27;t.</div><br/><div id="42640975" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42640975" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pcthrowaway</span><span>|</span><a href="#42640696">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42640887">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42641066">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42640975">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42640975">[18 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re making some assumptions here that I don&#x27;t think hold.<p>OP is likely able to do this because they have a longer circadian cycle (though I think it&#x27;s still less than 28 hours)<p>A person who might naturally have a 24.4 hour cycle without external stimuli (which is the average sleep researchers found) will likely have problems trying to adjust to a 26 hour cycle or longer, because even if they push themselves to stay up beyond the beginning of the sleep phase of their cycle on a regular basis, there is a good chance they&#x27;ll wake up closer to the end of their sleep phase, and therefore might not get enough sleep.<p>It&#x27;s better to follow a sleep cycle tailored to your own circadian rhythm, which for most people conveniently aligns pretty well with the natural day.<p>I say this as someone with non-24 who often does free-running sleep (where I&#x27;ve found my own cycle to be a little over 26 hours in winters, and closer to 24 hours in the summer)</div><br/><div id="42641772" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42641772" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">euroderf</span><span>|</span><a href="#42640696">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42640975">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42641156">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42641772">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42641772">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Data point: I found mine to be between 25 and 26 hours.<p>Probably a contributing factor to difficulty in getting to sleep &quot;at a good hour&quot;.<p>OTOH mild sleep deprivation has been shown to counter depression, so there&#x27;s that.</div><br/><div id="42643132" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42643132" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zemvpferreira</span><span>|</span><a href="#42640696">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42641772">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42641156">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42643132">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42643132">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Likewise but I&#x27;ve found small melatonin doses (plus reducing caffeine to once per day) to really help me conform to a 24 hour day.

I&#x27;d guess mine is more like 26hr, not 28hr, but same idea applies. If I wake up after getting 8 hours of sleep, after 16 hours I am just... not sleepy. I can go to bed and not use screens and take melatonin and whatever else but I&#x27;m just not tired. So I end up staying later and getting less than 8 hours of sleep. Since many studies seem to show that getting a solid amount of sleep is good, my actual patterns seem bad. Much better then (maybe) to switch your cycle to be however many hours you need to get a solid night (~8hr) of sleep and feel tired at the end of the day, like the author is doing.<p>EDIT: just read the original post[1] from the author and indeed this is the reason.

During my time awake, I was either working on side-projects or playing with my hobbies, and I’d go to sleep whenever I felt sleepy, wake up naturally (no alarms), and repeat. This led me to observe that without sticking to a daily routine, my sleep schedule would drift every day compared to the previous one. I also noticed that on most days I’d sleep a bit longer than 8h, sometimes 9h or even 10h.</i><p>&gt;<i>An example of the sleep schedule drift: if on day X I went to sleep at 10:00 and woke up at 18:00, on day X+1 I’d go to bed at a time later than 10:00, and wake up later than 18:00. I almost never went to sleep at the same time on two consecutive days.</i><p>&gt;<i>I realised that this was happening because it took me longer to feel tired than the “normal people schedule” assumed. If I followed it, sleeping would tend towards napping until the tiredness built up, at which point I’d need to sleep more. In fact, for most of my adult life (especially when I had a full-time job), I’d always have to force myself to go to bed during weekdays, and naturally this drift would occur, and then I’d “reset” during the weekend (often 10h+ of sleep), thus going back to forcing myself to sleep on weekdays to stick to the routine.</i></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42641397" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42641397" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jandrewrogers</span><span>|</span><a href="#42640696">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42640873">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42641259">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42641397">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42641397">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Decades ago I did a free-running sleep schedule for a few months while working a fairly intensive software project that required almost no interaction with others. I didn’t have a schedule, I just slept when I felt like it, and did resistance training throughout the day when I felt like it (I had a bunch of gym equipment in the same room as computers). Empirically, this turned into 26 hour days, so my hours came into phase with “normal” hours roughly every two weeks. It was a pretty comfortable lifestyle, felt pretty healthy, and I put on some muscle.<p>The main challenges were two-fold. First, there is a significant part of the time where it doesn’t line up with store and restaurant hours that well, which is inconvenient. Second, there are few days every couple weeks where your schedule is completely out-of-phase with normal people which makes socializing nigh impossible on those days e.g. waking up at 8pm and going to bed at 2pm. However, since those days were predictable, I’d simply not schedule anything on those days.<p>I don’t think this really works for a global business though. Many people around the world are really fussy about rigid schedules, and you will only overlap those a third of the time.<p>All that said, I think for &gt;24 hour days to be practical, it would be best in a synthetic environment where everyone is on the same clock with limited access to natural sunlight.

During the day, especially close to assignment deadlines, there were often long wait times to get one of the terminals. If you were there (and awake) at 10pm or 4am, there was usually only a handful of other people using it, with no waiting queues and with noticeably faster performance.<p>(When I started 2nd year, the first year class behind me still learned Pascal, but got to use the new Macintosh lab. That kinda made the 28hr phase shifting unnecessary, but a bunch of us persisted anyway. By 3rd year, the VAX was under-utilised enough that they added a bunch of modems, and I could connect from home via a 1200&#x2F;75 baud modem from the Osbourne1 Z80&#x2F;CPM machine I had at home.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="42641331" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42641331" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mmahemoff</span><span>|</span><a href="#42640696">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42641259">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42641264">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42641331">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42641331">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It doesn’t have to mean cutting people out of your life, but you’d have to be more organised in scheduling events.

All of the forum reports started out optimistic and then ended in disappointment with basically nobody enjoying them after a long time.<p>One of the common themes was that people would think their lives were better at first. A sort of placebo effect. They’d push through the adaptation phase, which was miserable, and when they adapted they felt slightly better. Often this improvement (relative to the miserable adaptation period) was mistake for an absolute improvement because it had been so long since they had a normal sleep schedule.<p>What was really interesting was that most people reported some variation of the same thing: They didn’t realize how much they disliked the alternative sleep schedule until after they stopped it.

There are many of us who benefit remarkably from what you&#x27;re calling an &quot;alternative sleep schedule&quot; (I&#x27;m not specifically talking about 28-hour day entrainment like the blog author, but whatever works for each individual based on their own idiosyncratic circadian rhythm)<p>Many of us have periods where we have to go back to 24-hour schedules due to external factors, and sleep quality and duration suffer as a result. For myself, in the winter when my schedule is a little &gt;27 hours, when I enforced waking up at 8 AM Monday-Friday for a 9-5, my schedule might go something like this:<p>&gt; Sunday night: Sleep 7-8 hours starting at midnight.<p>&gt; Monday night: Sleep 5 hours starting ~3 AM Tuesday.<p>&gt; Tuesday night: Sleep 2-3 hours starting at ~5 AM Wednesday. Sometimes with exhaustion I may then be able to fall asleep at 5-6 PM (Wednesday) but often would stay up til closer to midnight-2AM. Regardless, when I fall asleep I likely will wake up in 1 or 2 hours and be unable to go back to sleep, as my body doesn&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s in the sleep phase.<p>&gt; &quot;Wednesday night?&quot;: There isn&#x27;t really a Wednesday night except on the occasion where I managed to sleep more than 2 hours. Sometimes I&#x27;m up all night with no nap; more than half the time I can&#x27;t sleep more than 3 hours. Occasionally I&#x27;m actually able to stay asleep during what my body thinks is a nap to pay off sleep debt.<p>&gt; &quot;Thursday night?&quot;: Exhausted from having slept no more than 9 hours in the last 48 hours, and usually closer to 3-4 hours, I&#x27;ll collapse around 5-7 PM from exhaustion and sleep until midnight-5AM.<p>&gt; &quot;Friday night?&quot;: Often I&#x27;m ready for sleep by 5-8 PM and will sleep 8-9 hours. But I&#x27;ll also occasionally try to sleep less and push myself to go out at 9-10 PM if there&#x27;s an event happening. After being more active and if I slept less than 4 hours I can usually pick up another 1-3.5 hours of sleep after 4 or 5 AM.<p>&gt; Saturday night: If I got a full night&#x27;s sleep, or went out Friday but slept a little bit after, I may be more energized, so this is the more consistent day for weekend plans. If sleep was poor I&#x27;ll try to sleep an hour or two early in the evening before going out and then sleep 3 AM to 9 AM or so. If I didn&#x27;t have Saturday plans I may go to sleep at 8 PM and sleep til 5 AM.<p>&gt; Sunday night: Usually fall asleep somewhere around midnight but who knows? I could be up til 3 AM depending on how the weekend went.<p>All told I would probably get an average of ~5.5 to 6 hour of sleep per 24-hour day, but with significant periods running on very little sleep.<p>Now that I work from home and have few meetings, my schedule may look more like the following:<p>&gt; Sunday night: Sleep from midnight to 7 or 8 AM<p>&gt; Monday night: Sleep from 3 AM (Tuesday) to 10 AM (in time for my 10 AM Tuesday meeting).<p>&gt; &quot;...&quot;: Sleep Wednesday from 6 AM to 1 or 2 PM (Wednesday)<p>&gt; &quot;...&quot;: Sleep Thursday from 9 AM to 4 or 5 PM. Stay awake for my 10 AM meeting Friday.<p>&gt; &quot;...&quot;: Friday I have a meeting from 10-11, then often coordinate with coworkers til noon, but as late as 2 PM (rarely later). So I sleep after and wake up any time friday from 7 PM to 9 PM, go out feeling relatively well-rested.<p>&gt; &quot;...&quot;: Saturday if I have plans I take a nap then go out and fall asleep around 3 AM until 10 AM.<p>Sunday I probably won&#x27;t be able to sleep at midnight. Tuesday my 10 AM meeting this week will probably interrupt my sleep phase, but I can usually go right back to sleep after.<p>All in all on this schedule I get longer periods of uninterrupted sleep, get an average closer to 6.5 hours of sleep per 24-hour period, and never have periods of 48 hours where I only sleep 2 hours, so my overall energy and focus over the week is much better.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42641073" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42641073" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">404mm</span><span>|</span><a href="#42641110">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42642746">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42641073">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42641073">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I find it amusing how the OP has the need to label meals within the day and gripes about how they don’t match when talking to others on a regular 24-hour schedule.

Like, can&#x27;t say how much GPT-4o takes in inference, but Llama-3 8B works perfectly fine and very fast on my RTX 4070 Ti, and it has a significant enough fraction of the same capabilities.<p>Speaking of:<p>&gt; <i>A better compiler helps you reason about errors.</i><p>There&#x27;s only so much it can do. And yes, I&#x27;ve actually set up an &quot;agent&quot; (predefined system prompt) so I can just paste the output of build tooling verbatim, and get it to explain error messages in it, which GPT-4 does with 90%+ accuracy. Yes, I can read and understand them on my own. But also no, at this point, parsing multiple screens of C++ template errors or GCC linker failures is <i>not</i> a good use of my life.<p>(Environment-wise, I&#x27;m still net ahead of a typical dev anyway, by staying away from Electron-powered tooling and ridiculously wasteful modern webdev stacks.)<p>&gt; <i>A better language reduces boilerplate.</i><p>Yes, that&#x27;s why everyone is writing Lisp, and not C++ or Java or Rust or JS.<p>Oh wait, wrong reality.<p>&gt; <i>Better language features help you be more expressive.</i><p>That&#x27;s another can of worms. I&#x27;m not holding much hopes here, because as long as we insist on working directly on plaintext codebase treated as single source of truth, we&#x27;re already at Pareto frontier in terms of language expressiveness. Cross-cutting concerns are actually cross-cutting; you can&#x27;t express them all simultaneously in a readable way, so all the modern language design advances are doing is shifting focus and complexity around.<p>LLMs don&#x27;t really help or hurt this either, though they could paper over some of the problem by raising the abstraction level at which programmers edit their code, in lieu of the tooling actually being designed to support such operations. I don&#x27;t think this would be good - I&#x27;d rather we stopped with the plaintext single-source-of-truth addiction in the first place.<p>&gt; <i>Its appearance as a silver bullet withers the closer you get to essential complexity.</i><p>100% agreed on that. My point is, dealing with essential complexity is usually a small fraction of our work. LLMs are helpful in dealing with incidental complexity, which leaves us more time to focus on the essential parts.</div><br/><div id="40655729" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40655729" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eru</span><span>|</span><a href="#40651618">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40655615">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40655662">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40655729">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40655729">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Yes, that&#x27;s why everyone is writing Lisp, and not C++ or Java or Rust or JS.<p>&gt; Oh wait, wrong reality.<p>You are a bit too cynical.  The tools (compilers and interpreters and linters etc) that people are actually using have gotten a lot better.  Both by moving to better languages, like more Rust and less C; or TypeScript instead of Javascript.  But also from compilers for existing languages getting better, see especially the arms race between C compilers kicked off by Clang throwing down the gauntlet in front of GCC.  They both got a lot better in the process.<p>(Common) Lisp was a good language for its time.  But I wouldn&#x27;t hold it up as a pinnacle of language evolution.  (I like Lisps, and especially Racket.  And I&#x27;ve programmed about half of my career in Haskell and OCaml.  So you can rest assured about my obscure and elitist language cred.  I even did a year of Erlang professionally.)<p>---<p>Btw, just to be clear: I actually agree with most of what you are writing!  LLMs are already great for some tasks, and are still rapidly getting better.<p>You are also right that despite better languages being available, there are many reasons why people still have to use eg C++ here or there, and some people are even stuck on ancient versions of or compilers for C++, with even worse error messages.

Its about the sorry ass conditions &amp; technosocialcultural bankrupcy that let so many people down, that didn&#x27;t give them good hooks to start digging in &amp; try enjoying their own powers. It&#x27;s also about being overwhelmed and emotionally unserwater by unrewarding crappy rentier-capitalism.<p>The belief system of humanity in itself needs nutrients, needs to seed and grow positively people. Open source is by far one of the strongest currents about for that.<p>Right now open source is a mess &amp; bogglingly complicated. Technology in general has gotten vastly less accessible year after year, the on-ramps to understanding detoured into ever more appliance-ized experiences &amp; neofuedal cloud empires happening in other people&#x27;s computers. Far fewer are primed for the esoterics of software, know the basics, or have positive rewarding experiences tinkering and tweaking. Humanity has been shoved into superficial &amp; coopted&#x2F;dishonest experiences. Heck yes, a lot of things are against the possibility of the good.<p>But we unlike almost all other relationships with the material world, we can directly improve things, can keep enhancing things practically without material constraint, limited chiefly by imagination &amp; will (ML excepted I guess). We can grow the pot, open up computing &amp; it&#x27;s softer side progressively, create better on ramps &amp; more learnable, observable, experience able authentic experiences.<p>Over time I hope the barriers to being interested might be less severe. The other material conditions dragging people down &amp; shutting them off from engagement might persist. But I think there can be a very tangible source of hope here, a demonstration that people, when they are doing their thing, creating as they might, when they are empowered, are cool. Are good. Are a role model. And that - with hope - will keep us iterating &amp; improving, will hopefully lead to more efforts to keep redefining &amp; expanding general purpose computing &amp; soft systems in less deeply technical terms.<p>I have a really strong reaction against projecting the users of today &amp; their sorry chained-to-the-cave-wall state to what people might be if there were some honest shakes out there.

I was a working web dev in 2004, and from that perspective, what we did was pretty close to what the talk describes.<p>Intermediated by commerce, certainly; as I recall having put it one day in that same job after hanging up a call wherein had occasioned a request that $400 a month of backhaul be provided free of charge, it&#x27;s nice there&#x27;s folks out there trying to save the world, but some of us have to earn a living. (&quot;You said you were a web dev. Why were you talking to anyone about backhaul?&quot; I pulled cable too sometimes, in those days. The mid-00s were a different time.)<p>And of course there were no LLMs involved, that technology then still being much the stuff of science fiction and allied fields like futurism. Even so, though: none of us had any real idea what we were doing, but we knew how to figure out what worked and what didn&#x27;t, and that was usually enough even if the level of trial and error, and the lack of rigor, were shocking by today&#x27;s standards. (I wrote my first SPA, a triathlon registration system for an org that lots of folks in the DMV might recall if I mentioned a name, in 2011. Imagine my surprise when two years later, on leaving my local backwater of web dev for the mainstream, I discovered that was what I had done, when I thought I&#x27;d just been trying a wild idea I was sure would fail, because it was that or lose the contract that was keeping the business afloat...)<p>Honestly, the vision described in this talk is a lot more like the kind of life I thought I&#x27;d live, when I got into this line around the turn of the millennium. It&#x27;d be easy to take an overly rosy view, and maybe I am. But then too, it&#x27;d be good if not every quarter-square-mile neighborhoodlet in my city had an intimate dependency on Amazon in order to function, too.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40651385" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40651385" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jay_kyburz</span><span>|</span><a href="#40650499">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40650920">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40652821">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40651385">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40651385">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">All the stuff in the first half sound great, but adding an llm dependency is a complete antithesis to local first and well crafted software.<p>I don&#x27;t really like the term barefoot developers, but local craftsman should own and understand the tools they work with and the code they write.

I don&#x27;t think current models are up to that task on their own, certainly not for someone without significant programming knowledge - but the sense I got, especially as the talk touched on still needing access to a skilled dev for a while at least, was that the author also understands this. Too, in sketching out so broad a vision as this, I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily expect any author to treat what&#x27;s possible today as a hard limit, any more than anyone else working in tech does or should.<p>I also don&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;d consider LLMs as a blocker to local-only. You can run a 7B model on a $600 refurbished M1 Mac mini today. It won&#x27;t be the fastest or the cleverest, and you probably will need an hour or so from
someone who knows how to set up Ollama and Open WebUI, but it is absolutely usable after that with no Internet connection at all - I have a Mac mini so configured on my desk right now, actually. Or for an order of magnitude more outlay, you can get a Studio capable of supporting multiple concurrent users with 70B models producing tokens faster than you can read them. Again, sure, it won&#x27;t be GPT-4o, and it won&#x27;t be up to the standard of the sorts of tools described in the talk - not <i>this</i> year, anyway. In 2026 or 2027, though? Again, this talk looks to a possible future, not just today. And with a setup based on open models running locally as I&#x27;ve described, there is the countervailing advantage that once you have it, you <i>own</i> it.<p>As for the term &#x27;barefoot developer&#x27; itself - it&#x27;s a cavil, I grant, but I still want to quibble, because as a child in rural Mississippi with an Apple IIc and a couple of books, I <i>was</i> a barefoot developer, writing my own programs to solve my own problems, and often enough going to play in the woods by the road cut when I got stuck. (It helped! These days I&#x27;m more likely to chase wasps with a camera, but it <i>still</i> helps, when I can force the time. For what it&#x27;s worth, though, I do wear shoes these days.)<p>Now I&#x27;m what Amazon would call an L5, earning as highly as almost anyone in this generation of my family - and not for a lot of student debt, because I never went to college. Whatever I am as a professional, I am in large part because I&#x27;ve been discovering and developing my craft since my single-digit days - and was free to do so without my parents having to pay anyone a damned subscription, besides.<p>True, the technology has grown far away from the kind of locally and individually empowering model this talk describes, and that I recall from my own childhood and early career days - that proto-SPA I mentioned nearby, for example, was hosted on a machine that everyone who ever worked on it could physically touch without leaving the office we all shared. And this in 2011! It really has not been that long a time since a model very much like what this talk describes was actually present in reality.<p>I see no reason in principle why that can&#x27;t be true again. Certainly I&#x27;m convinced that it should.</div><br/><div id="40653493" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40653493" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">skydhash</span><span>|</span><a href="#40650499">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40652619">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40652821">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40653493">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40653493">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The thing is you can learn a lot with a bootable FreeBSD usb, an old PC and a copy of the &quot;Absolute FreeBSD&quot; or the equivalent for Linux.

The point, or at least the point as I understood it, is to broaden the space for people who want to learn enough to support the things that matter to them, and no more.<p>Again, there&#x27;s nothing new in this; in fact it&#x27;s much the way things were when 8-bit micros and BASIC were about as fancy as most ever saw, yet anyone who ever saw a computer could hardly help <i>but</i> see them. Maybe you&#x27;d learn to use those tools and maybe you wouldn&#x27;t, but you knew they were there for you and the assumption was that you <i>could</i> learn enough to use them. More did than I think a lot of folks in their 20s today easily imagine. I don&#x27;t blame them; if all I&#x27;d ever seen was how things are now, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d be the same. But people made things the way they are now. People can make them otherwise.<p>There&#x27;s also no assumption in the talk that everyone involved is a loner, an atomized individual, the way you seem to assume would be true. Indeed, quite the contrary: community, in word and in concept, suffuses the text in its entirety, to such an extent it seems surprising its constant immanence could be overlooked even on a brief skim.<p>Admittedly, that&#x27;s a difficult concept for many to fathom in 2020s America. I&#x27;m certainly among that number. But I&#x27;m also old enough to remember when things were better, and young enough still to imagine a future where things are better again.

My personal take is that low-code&#x2F;no-code tools should have ushered in an era of homemade software, but it didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s something I think about a lot, incidentally.  We&#x27;ve had the technology to make software using a GUI rather than a text editor for a <i>very</i> long time, and yet programmers still use text editors, and programming in general hasn&#x27;t really been all that democratized.  At best, it&#x27;s now possible to create a website without knowing how to code, but it usually isn&#x27;t a particularly good one.<p>A simple explanation is that the devil is in the details when it comes to implementation.  Edge cases and granular behavior are hard to capture except in granular snippets of code.  I&#x27;m not convinced that LLMs necessarily solve this problem.  Even if you are working with a theoretically quite competent LLM, there are still going to be instances where describing what you want is actually challenging, to the point where it would be easier if you just did it yourself.  You could argue that this doesn&#x27;t matter in the case of simple software, but I think we underestimate what people really expect out of something that&#x27;s &quot;simple&quot;, and I think we underestimate people&#x27;s tendency to grow bored of old toys, especially if they don&#x27;t work as expected.<p>If anything, my belief is that LLMs by themselves aren&#x27;t necessarily going to make this a reality.  You need an accessible and empowering UX&#x2F;UI to go along with it.  Otherwise, asking an LLM to build software for you probably won&#x27;t be much of a fun experience aside from those who are AI enthusiasts foremost.<p>Side note, I have painful feelings about so many UX researchers I used to admire jumping on board the AI hype train so uncritically.  I kind of get it, their job is to speculate on new possibilities a tech offers without getting too hung up on external complications.  Still, I feel disillusioned.  It seems that prior to all of this these same people were questioning our implicit assumptions with how  we interact with computers in <i>really</i> interesting ways (in the same vein as Bret Victor).  Now, their takes are starting to converge with that of the usual anonymous midwit AI enthusiast on Twitter who pivoted from crypto.<p>Put more bluntly, the idea that LLMs will usher in a golden age of people making simple software is kind of a boring speculative future, a speculative future shared and talked about by the most uninspired and boring people on Twitter.</div><br/><div id="40655650" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40655650" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">namaria</span><span>|</span><a href="#40653303">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40653351">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40655650">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40655650">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The major fallacy in low&#x2F;no code and proposing LLMs as programming tools is thinking that you can automate away complexity.<p>Any automation will introduce complexity.

But someone will have to manage it.<p>People wanna buy machinery and have technical support. They don&#x27;t want to build machinery and maintain it. People want working software, they don&#x27;t want to design, build and maintain it. That complexity never goes away.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40653351" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40653351" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">giraffe_lady</span><span>|</span><a href="#40653303">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40655650">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40652726">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40653351">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40653351">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  there are still going to be instances where describing what you want is actually challenging, to the point where it would be easier if you just did it yourself<p>Yeah exactly.

This is especially true if I&#x27;m trying to perform some complex mathematical task that&#x27;s geometric in nature.  Put another way, it&#x27;s probably easier to understand how poisson disc sampling works if you saw the code for it, vs if you read the actual paper, especially if the code had comments providing additional context for different blocks of code.  Doesn&#x27;t help that the paper uses complex mathematical terminology, whereas the code, at worst, might have very terse variable names<p>And yet, I think a better example might be found in markup languages like HTML.

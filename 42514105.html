Japanese villages are empty. Spain, Italy the same. I’m in Thailand and my guide said exactly the same thing yesterday.
There’s also a draw away from the city as people have kids. They want a bit more quiet. Good schools safe environment.<p>The migration is about the different things one wants during the course of one’s life.<p>Perhaps you could rephrase the concept around “if you stay at home you might miss out on some of the opportunities your peers experienced” if you want to look at both sides you could consider the benefits of community family and friends that those who stay are able to enjoy.</div><br/><div id="42528691" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42528691" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aylmao</span><span>|</span><a href="#42527549">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42528223">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42527304">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42528691">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42528691">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Every culture on earth sees a draw from the small towns and villages to the city.<p>What you&#x27;re describing is true, but also different from what the original comment is talking about. There is a global trend to urbanization, yes. The original comment isn&#x27;t talking about moving from rural to urban; what they say applies to moving from one city to another.<p>Moreover, at an individual scale, moving for better opportunities doesn&#x27;t mean one has to leave family and friends. For example, my grandma: she was very poor, and moved a few times different cities looking for a better life. This meant moving with her whole family, and&#x2F;or moving where other family was. After she married my grandpa, he got job opportunities in both Guadalajara and Mexico City. I&#x27;m sure they could&#x27;ve done better in Mexico City, since it&#x27;s the capital, but they chose Guadalajara due to proximity to family. Her mom eventually moved to Guadalajara too.<p>Another, more recent example from my family: my uncle. He had the opportunity to move for a very good job, but didn&#x27;t take it since it was far from family. My brother moved cities for college, but specifically to one where he would be close to family.<p>One thing is moving wherever it takes for the sake of going to a specific school, working at a specific job, living in a specific dream home or dream city. That is very American. Another one is still looking for opportunities, but framing everything in terms of your family and friends; ie, what&#x27;s the best job, school, home I can find close to my family? That&#x27;s much more Latin American and much less common, in my experience, in the USA.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42527304" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42527304" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">extr</span><span>|</span><a href="#42527549">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42526948">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42527304">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42527304">[21 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I go back and forth on this.

I&#x27;d wager that constraining choice creates intimacy far moreso than alignment of interests. It&#x27;s not about how much you like each other — it&#x27;s about high-enough switching costs to hanging out with someone else that keep you together over a very long period of time.<p>In a city, even if you find the most compatible friend ever... there&#x27;s also going to be 50 people almost as compatible (and vice versa for the people you&#x27;re hanging out with).<p>In a rural area, you might not find someone you&#x27;re perfectly compatible with... but they&#x27;re far more likely to be the <i>only</i> person in the area with interests that are that aligned... and that creates intimacy... which will only make you more like them and them more like you.</div><br/><div id="42527772" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42527772" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">brailsafe</span><span>|</span><a href="#42526689">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42527330">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42526764">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42527772">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42527772">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Yes but investing in new, long-term friendships is a bit of an oxymoron.

And once you&#x27;ve done so, you then have to stop investing in new friends and stick with those old ones.<p>I think this is a bit of a false dichotomy that assumes you get a static group of people dumped in your lap—in either case—that you get to choose or be alone because everyone else is guaranteed to choose not you for some reason, and also that long-term friends always require the same amount of investment. Likewise, you seem to be leaning heavily into not having to make a persuasive case for yourself, as if there&#x27;s never a situation in which you&#x27;d be compelling.<p>Although scarcity might favor ease of intimacy, I think it&#x27;s more true that luck, opportunity, and chemistry, give any pair of people something to work with regardless of shared interest. You can&#x27;t assume every person you meet is friend material, but if you and them are open to it, you can both explore further. If 1&#x2F;5 people seem fun to have coffee or go to the gym with, including in a rural area that may not even have a gym, it&#x27;ll take a while to build that up, but you&#x27;ll want a breadth of possible situations to meet people in. Hometowns don&#x27;t necessitate that, you get it for free in school or church or wherever, but starting anew you gotta get out there.<p>You&#x27;re not wrong though, I just think it takes longer. When I moved to where I did, a good half of the people I met were always looking for a plan B, flaking on trivial plans, not interested in one-on-one stuff without an activity going on. That was 8 years ago, and they&#x27;re long gone. In their place are multiple groups of friends I&#x27;ve met in wildly different contexts, that don&#x27;t flake enough for me to notice, and I consider pretty solid and close. I let the others go, and likewise with everyone in my hometown that I still talk to, I either can feel great about making a deliberate effort to spend unconstrained time with, or they&#x27;re not in the picture, and maybe only 4 are left because everyone else is either a shallow acquaintance or were just there out of convenience in the first place.<p>As you grow older, there is certainly an economy of time you need to manage, but as you grow closer, you get grandfathered into not coming to that one thing or whatever every single time. My friend group consequently grows slower than ever, but is bigger than ever, and I make a point of being the friend I&#x27;d like to have—as cheesy as it is; I expect the same of them, and if they can do that then there&#x27;s something to work with.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42526764" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42526764" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wenc</span><span>|</span><a href="#42526689">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42527447">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42526764">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42526764">[72 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would love to, but I come from a place where intellectual pursuits are not valued, so I would lose out on that front if I moved back.

That’s fine — but realize that’s a cultural preference.<p>I grew up in a house with no backyard and had an idyllic childhood. I knew my neighbors and biked to the playground.

In a small community, you could choose to be entirely isolated, but if you want company you&#x27;ll need to associate with the butcher, the baker, and the candlestick maker—there&#x27;s no way to keep company only with the particular class of intellectuals that you find stimulating.<p>Speaking as someone who&#x27;s currently living in a small rural town, I concur with Chesterton here: if you really want to understand people in all their varieties, the city isn&#x27;t the place to be. In most cities I&#x27;ve spent time in everyone walks or (worse) drive past thousands to reach the few who they already relate to.

We are told that we must go in for large empires and large ideas. There is one advantage, however, in the small state, the city, or the village, which only the wilfully blind can overlook. The man who lives in a small community lives in a much larger world. He knows much more of the fierce varieties and uncompromising divergences of men. The reason is obvious. In a large community we can choose our companions. In a small community our companions are chosen for us. ... the men of the clique live together because they have the same kind of soul ... A big society exists in order to form cliques. A big society is a society for the promotion of narrowness.

Smaller cities offer many of the same opportunities but with lower financial barrier to entry, and less physical distance between you and the most lively areas.<p>Alternavely, you have to be willing to spend a lot of time in those neighborhoods, then go back to your home for the night.

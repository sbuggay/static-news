At the time of recording (2012) his talk was magical and ahead of its time. Today his principle (immediate feedback to the creator) is fully applied in tools for technical artists. (Unreal Engine, Houdini, etc...) It is funny to see what happened with his ideas: basically what happened is that the software engineer and technical artist roles has got really separated. For technical artists his ideas are everyday life today, almost trivial seen from 2024 (although they are not), although they work mostly not in text-based, but node based programming languages. For software engineers his ideas are not so relevant as software engineering is specializing on the more messy, more abstract or more complicated problems. Frontend development is somewhere in between.
I think Tim Sweeney (and his team) is missing from the list, who I believe has seen this coming already in 2012 and built Unreal Engine to its current form.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

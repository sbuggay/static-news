You can bet your bottom dollar that the director, Stahelski, didn&#x27;t do that; and that if he had, the movie wouldn&#x27;t have been a success.<p>I think the proper recognition here is that there are different kinds of work.  In order to scale past a single person, there needs to be <i>coordination</i> work; the work of coordination necessarily means that someone throws a ball to you, you ponder it briefly, and then toss it to someone else. The deep, full-throttled, do-only-one-thing kind of work that Keanu did was made possible by the juggle-dozens-of-obligations work that Stahelski and the other support staff did.  Division of labor: Stahelski juggled the balls so that Keanu could focus.<p>I think where this breaks down is where managers don&#x27;t realize these different kinds of work.  <i>They</i> must juggle lots of balls; this kind of juggling is necessary for scale; and usually people who do well as managers actually like the juggling at some level.  So they naturally project that onto the people working for them.  Whereas the ideal manager will recognize that their primary job is to juggle balls <i>so that</i> their stars can do a completely different kind of work than they do.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36335284" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36335284" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nosefrog</span><span>|</span><a href="#36337867">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36337052">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36335284">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36335284">[19 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Very interesting essay.

But if you take a high performing team with good cross-functional trust, deadlines serve a very valid function as a forcing function to make decisions, cut scope, and otherwise make progress towards shipping.  Without them, it&#x27;s all too easy for time spent to balloon for a million different small but justifiable reasons.<p>And sometimes (not all the time), it does make sense for a deadline to be the core organizing principle, see this Mary Poppendieck talk for an interesting example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoq.com&#x2F;presentations&#x2F;tyranny-of-plan&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoq.com&#x2F;presentations&#x2F;tyranny-of-plan&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="36337595" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36337595" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">doctor_eval</span><span>|</span><a href="#36335509">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36337355">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36336760">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36337595">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36337595">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I enjoyed that video some time ago, but I really didn&#x27;t get the takeaway about timelines. Maybe I didn&#x27;t watch it through.<p>Anyway, I do agree with you that deadlines can serve a purpose, but this doesn&#x27;t mean that deadlines are the core organising principle. Typically the sorts of deadline you&#x27;re alluding to are actually milestones. We&#x27;re not saying &quot;this feature must be delivered in 3 days&quot;, we&#x27;re saying &quot;we want to launch in 2 months, what do we need to do to get there?&quot;. In this case the milestone gives us a goal, but it&#x27;s not the organising principal. We&#x27;re not trying to guess how long individual features are going to take, and nor should we; there&#x27;s plenty of research that shows that this doesn&#x27;t work in practice.<p>So while I think deadlines can be a useful project management tool, they&#x27;re not the only tool, and they certainly should not be the primary one. Nevertheless, it&#x27;s very common to see projects managed using &quot;firm&quot; estimates and &quot;hard&quot; deadlines, and inappropriate pressure put on teams to achieve goals, such as low-cost accurate estimation, that are impossible.<p>Considering that estimation is both expensive and inaccurate, deadline based management is just never going to work. So I think instead we should be more concerned about team <i>productivity</i>, because a productive team (by definition) gets more done in less time overall, which is ultimately cheaper and more rewarding than being forced to work against poor quality time estimates. And you can&#x27;t maintain productivity if you&#x27;re constantly cutting quality corners to meet some artificial deadline due to the way the project is managed.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36336760" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36336760" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cudgy</span><span>|</span><a href="#36335509">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36335566">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36335611">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36337454">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36336760">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36336760">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">“whoever needs to use your thing has a certain stretch of time where they can implement their part.”<p>This can be ameliorated many times by attempting to mock something that covers the most likely interaction between the dependencies.

This is (part of) how I&#x27;ve run my last few projects and it&#x27;s been very successful from a productivity perspective.<p>The problems I&#x27;ve had with this is getting management to understand that productivity and developer quality-of-life is important. They want road maps, god damn it, because reasons. And they say they won&#x27;t hold us to the road map, but then they do.

For example, Keanu Reaves was able to singularly focus on “gun fu” as he is an experienced actor for whom remembering lines and handling himself on set is second nature, requiring less effort than from a rookie actor.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36337301" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36337301" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blowski</span><span>|</span><a href="#36336066">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36336775">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36337301">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36337301">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Western economies are obsessed with why their productivity has flat-lined.

Tentacles exemplifies the concept of &quot;Thinking Fast and Slow&quot; in his problem-solving abilities. Squidward, being a more sophisticated and intellectual character compared to SpongeBob and Patrick, often finds himself in situations where he must rely on both System 1 and System 2 thinking.<p>One situation that highlights Squidward&#x27;s use of System 1 thinking is when he is tasked with completing a complex painting for an art exhibition. Squidward quickly uses his instinctive and emotional response to choose a subject matter that will appeal to the judges. By tapping into his creative side and relying on his fast, automatic thought processes, Squidward is able to produce a visually striking painting that catches the attention of the judges.<p>On the other hand, Squidward also demonstrates his proficiency in System 2 thinking during situations where he needs to carefully analyze and make logical decisions. For instance, when he is entrusted with managing the Krusty Krab restaurant in Mr. Krabs&#x27; absence, Squidward employs slow, effortful, and deliberative thinking to ensure the smooth operation of the establishment. He meticulously manages inventory, schedules, and customer service, making logical and calculated decisions to maintain a high level of efficiency and customer satisfaction.<p>Another example of Squidward&#x27;s utilization of both thinking systems is when he engages in a musical competition. As a clarinet player, Squidward has honed his skills through countless hours of practice, allowing him to execute complex musical pieces effortlessly using System 1 thinking. However, when faced with a particularly challenging musical composition, Squidward switches to System 2 thinking to carefully analyze the notes, rhythms, and dynamics, ensuring an accurate and flawless performance.<p>Through these examples, it becomes evident that Squidward harnesses the power of both fast and slow thinking to navigate various challenges and achieve success in his endeavors. He recognizes the importance of relying on instinctive and emotional responses when appropriate, as well as the need for deliberate and logical thinking in more complex scenarios. By seamlessly integrating both thinking systems, Squidward consistently demonstrates his mastery of &quot;Thinking Fast and Slow&quot; and consistently comes out on top in his endeavors.</div><br/><div id="36336825" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36336825" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yulker</span><span>|</span><a href="#36336571">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36337197">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36336825">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36336825">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This leaves the taste of chatgpt in one&#x27;s mouth, whether you intended to or not.</div><br/><div id="36337348" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36337348" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Handprint4469</span><span>|</span><a href="#36336571">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36336825">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36337197">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36337348">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36337348">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is 100% ChatGPT</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36337197" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36337197" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">moomin</span><span>|</span><a href="#36336571">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36337749">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36337197">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36337197">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There’s a huge element missing here: the ability to take that risk.

The most productive knowledge workers are those who stay on top of their inboxes and somehow juggle the dozens of obligations, from the small tasks to major projects, hurled in their direction every week.<p>The deal here is <i>focus</i>. You can focus on anything, anything. Even on emails. The real problem is most people aren&#x27;t even doing that properly. People while away their time on Insta reels, Twitter, Facebook fighting etc etc.<p>The best productivity example I saw was when I was working with a Chinese colleague. He would have 2 monitors. One split, exclusively for Slack, Jira and Email. He would watch every issue, every communication, every PR, every darnest little thing going on in the project. He would review, it, or learn about it. He knew what code was going in, what was getting deleted, the pipeline of features, bugs and what not. The other monitor was for the terminal, coding and other work tools.<p>He would also find spare time in a day for TIL, and other long term learning. There was zero FB, Twitter, Insta, TikToK, whatever. There was lots of &#x27;productive context switching&#x27;. Or in other words, the context switch was in the boundaries of work.<p>The biggest lesson is not to avoid context switching. But to not waste time. Wasting time is the biggest time drain here. I define wasting time as doing something that is not relevant to the thing you are trying to achieve. If you are trying to have fun, working in periods would be equally unproductive to having fun.

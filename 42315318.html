Like the article said he is influential across very different strands of christianity.<p>&gt; In a situation of profound moral dislocation, there was no escaping complicity in evil. Violent resistance or tacit acceptance of monstrous cruelty: There was guilt either way. In the end Bonhoeffer chose to sin for the sake of righteousness.<p>His essay exploring that specific contradiction, written in prison, is one of the most useful and interesting works of christian writing I&#x27;ve ever come across. The article glosses over it probably because of writing for a secular audience, but what he was specifically hung up on was the use of children as messengers in the resistance movement he was involved in.<p>Some of the children would inevitably be caught, tortured, and killed. Possibly many of them if the plot were severely compromised. That&#x27;s what he was weighing against his need to oppose the nazis. In the end he decided to participate and trust in forgiveness if it was necessary, a decision so self-assuredly childlike I marvel at its strength.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Passion_bearer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Passion_bearer</a></div><br/><div id="42323212" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42323212" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mike978</span><span>|</span><a href="#42318415">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42319596">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42323212">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42323212">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would suggest the book Jesus and the Powers[1] by NT Wright and Michael F Bird if you have interest in the topic.<p>Basically they prefer nonviolence, but leave the door open to other options when confronting abusive governments in extreme situations where nonviolence has failed to produce change.

A third option, which is actually compatible with Jesus’ command to not resist evil, is to love your enemy, and their victims simultaneously, by redirecting the evil upon yourself, as Christ did and taught himself, while teaching them the truth.

Not all sin is avoidable, a sinless choice is not guaranteed.

Any atheist would agree with him that you&#x27;ve got to minimize harm, etc.<p>The relevant choice for the Christian is to decide whether we&#x27;re going to &quot;use evil for good&quot; in a way that only God can facilitate, by loving our enemies and dying for them, as Christ died for his enemies.<p>&gt; What you present isn&#x27;t a third option, it&#x27;s just a particular mindset about the second one.<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;just&quot; a mindset because it restricts (and expands) the options you can take. Isn&#x27;t Bonhoeffer&#x27;s stance &quot;just&quot; a mindset, because regardless of why you&#x27;re killing your enemies, they end up dead anyway? An atheist killing Nazis and Bonhoeffer killing Nazis only differ in what they&#x27;re saying, not really what they&#x27;re doing. A Christian not resisting evil and loving their enemies is identifiable both by word and deed.<p>&gt; Many christians do accept that as the only choice. Others finds that they are compelled to action, and consider this a personal failure to remain peaceful in the face of great evil.<p>You&#x27;re construing this as a choice between action and inaction, so I don&#x27;t think we understand each other yet. Was Jesus action-less when he came to the earth to die for his enemies? Or did he take action to not-resist evil, love and die for his enemies, and bear the sins of the world? What I&#x27;m suggesting as the Christian approach to this is very active, but not to kill our enemies the same way literally everyone else does. It&#x27;s to feed our enemies when they&#x27;re hungry, give them drink when they&#x27;re thirsty, and stand in the way of the bullets when they&#x27;re fired at others, all the while proclaiming our love for them, and God&#x27;s love, so that they would quit trying to earn their righteousness by good works, and believe on Christ for righteousness. This is all and only what Jesus did, and bade us do.<p>&gt; Not all sin is avoidable, a sinless choice is not guaranteed.<p>This might be your opinion, but I&#x27;m not sure you could find any support for this in scripture.<p>I&#x27;m also not sure that we can take Bonhoeffer&#x27;s decision as anything other than the proposition that Jesus would have killed Nazis too. Is that the road we want to go down? (I presume he wouldn&#x27;t be defending a choice to do something that Jesus wouldn&#x27;t have done.)<p>Maybe the answer here is that I just need to read his book first.<p>&gt; Contemporary Theology Understander: We cannot do evil so that good may come of it ... that is evil.<p>&gt; Big Brother D, unable to escape the conclusion that he must kill nazis: Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on me, a sinner.<p>The problem with this is that Big Brother D is morally equivalent before God to the Nazi, so in deciding the fate of the Nazi, he&#x27;s deciding his own fate: he&#x27;s too evil to let live, he should be put down. This is Brother D acting like he&#x27;s still under the Law, which says, &quot;The man who does these [good] things shall live [and by implication, the man who does bad things shall die].&quot; According to Jesus, God cannot and will not have mercy on a (n undeserving) man who does not have mercy on (undeserving) others. There is no forgiveness for those who do not forgive others. Bringing death on others is asking for death upon ourselves (and for consistency, everyone else).<p>Bonhoeffer can&#x27;t have mercy for himself and death for others.<p>And isn&#x27;t this <i>the</i> thing that sets Christianity apart? Otherwise Jesus&#x27; earth-shattering teachings become just another &quot;treat people nice who are nice to you, punish the bad guys&quot; idea like every other one out there. My personal feeling is that trying to give up this nigh-impossible teaching is trying to give up the heart of Christianity, the core beauty and truth. Christianity has nothing attractive about it if we rip out the core and everything else that depends on it, imo.<p>Sorry for the long post.</div><br/><div id="42321669" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42321669" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MrJohz</span><span>|</span><a href="#42318415">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42321125">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42321502">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42321669">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42321669">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think this is too simplistic a theological approach, though.

Jesus didn&#x27;t kill anyone. It&#x27;s a long leap from driving people out of a temple, to killing someone and sealing their eternal fate, potentially consigning them to hell. Same can be said for property destruction (even omitting the fact that this is a special case of property <i>within</i> Jesus&#x27; own house, as it were).<p>2. All indications point to the fact that the whip was for the animals, not the people.<p>3. Even if we allow that Jesus whipped the people in the temple, he whipped people who weren&#x27;t attacking him. Then later he died when people did attack him. This isn&#x27;t a case of self-defense.<p>4. Jesus&#x27; stated purpose in this situation wasn&#x27;t to physically protect anyone or to right a worldly injustice, it was to protect against a harmful spiritual idea, the commercialization of worship.<p>5. This was taking place in the community of God. The rules are different when you&#x27;re dealing with God&#x27;s people; more is permitted because souls are not at stake. Scripture states that God disciplines his children, not those who aren&#x27;t his children.<p>So, next time you&#x27;re in church among believers and there are moneychangers there, feel free to drive them and their animals out with a whip.

Which is why heresy was often treated in civil courts as sedition.<p>Even when the U.S. introduced the concept of seperation of church and state, it was for the explicit purpose of <i>promoting</i> religion. The U.S. founders axiomatically assumed religion was necessary for morality and self-governance and believed that a free market of religions (as opposed to state religion) would lead to increased religiosity [0]. And, interestingly, it seems they were right as the countries with state churches have all seen massive religious decline while the U.S. is one of the most religious countries in the world (especially when you filter out the elite class, who as secular as Europeans).<p>The danger is that politicians co-opt religious institutions to help legitimize their regime and bolster support.

&quot;Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. . . Let it simply be asked, Where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="42319304" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42319304" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jasonhong</span><span>|</span><a href="#42318613">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42320058">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42320132">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42319304">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42319304">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s a comment on MetaFilter that has always resonated with me about the Church in America, which I&#x27;ll copy here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metafilter.com&#x2F;80588&#x2F;Jesus-who#2514085" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metafilter.com&#x2F;80588&#x2F;Jesus-who#2514085</a><p>The story of the temptations of Christ is a familiar one. After forty days and nights of fasting, the devil came to Jesus with three temptations. The first was to turn stones into bread, the second, to throw himself off the peak of the temple and have the angels catch him, the third, to have all the kingdoms of the world. We could summarize these as temptations be comfortable, to be impressive, and to be powerful. I am inclined to believe that those are also the three most common temptations of the church. Until recent years, the American church was offered each of those and gladly accepted them. Christianity was the default religion for the world’s greatest superpower—a position that should have made us tremble with concern that we were in danger of sliding off the path of self-denial that leads to the cross—but it seemed to occur to very few people that having such a position could be spiritually problematic. We built impressive structures, including dining facilities, recreation and entertainment centers. We turned praise and worship into a profit and star-making industry, and we gladly took our place in the halls of power. It seems that Satan offered us the same things he offered Christ, but we responded “Yes! Yes! Yes!” I doubt that the contemporary trends that are stripping away the power and prestige of the church are the work of the evil one—more likely it is the work of the Holy One, who is leading us step by step back to the paths of righteousness.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42319150" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42319150" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">devjab</span><span>|</span><a href="#42318613">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42320132">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42320188">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42319150">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42319150">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Jesus has absolutely existed as a “warrior” figure.

Gregory of Nyssa, Basil of Caesarea, and John Chrysostom for example wrote on this subject in the fourth century and were all incredibly well known among early christians and through the middle ages.<p>Some very early detractors of christianity latched onto the weakness and submissiveness of Jesus as being incompatible with their contemporary ideal of manly virtue. Influential early christians like the ones I mentioned accepted that assessment and used it to form the theological foundations of self-sacrifice that have always been present in christianity.<p><i>Certainly</i> the warrior-figure conception has always been there as well, it has never been purely one or the other. And it&#x27;s definitely true that that element has had more emphasis in certain times and places.

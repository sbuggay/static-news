I&#x27;ve fooled around with coupled oscillators, using 555 timers, and seen how little coupling is needed to get synchronization. And that you can synchronize at 2:1 or other ratios, although not as easily as 1:1.<p>The new idea here is that you can have coupled oscillators running at very different frequencies, and only the ones that are close in frequency will couple. So it&#x27;s sort of like frequency-division multiplexing, or radio. In a radio receiver, there&#x27;s only one time-varying voltage coming in, but in that one number is the entire spectrum. So this offers the possibility of connecting some large number of elements without a large number of interconnects.<p>It takes a lot of cycles to do anything with phase locked systems. Maybe. There are efficient modulation strategies.<p>It&#x27;s a new way to think about analog computing. Not clear if it&#x27;s better.<p>If biological brains were doing this, researchers should be seeing far more high-frequency activity than is actually observed. There&#x27;s speculation that something in biological neurons ought to be going fast, because brains seem to get more done than ought to be possible with such slow signals. So far, nobody has found that.
EEG measurements, even at the single neuron level, seem to be below 30 Hz.
There was an article on HN a few weeks ago with speculation that something optical was going on. But it was just speculation.</div><br/><div id="41538280" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41538280" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kragen</span><span>|</span><a href="#41538234">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41538287">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41538280">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41538280">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">yeah, if memory serves, the 2:1 coupling is how the parametron mentioned in the article works; given a reference frequency signal such as 6 gigahertz and some oscillators that can oscillate around 3 gigahertz, you have two possible frequency-locked phases that can serve as 1 and 0. one of the half-frequency oscillators serves as a phase reference for the 1 level and everything else is measured relative to it<p>hmm, now i see that the article explains this, but i guess i&#x27;ll leave this here as a simplified summary in case that it&#x27;s useful to somebody</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41538287" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41538287" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bob1029</span><span>|</span><a href="#41538234">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41538257">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41538287">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41538287">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Spiking neural networks use oscillators for generating the signals but do not take advantage of the nonlinear interaction between oscillators, and so most of them do not belong to OBCs as we defined them.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I share this view. The interaction between oscillators in a SNN is indirect but certainly non-linear by way of the network elements and how they process information.<p>I would think of STDP like a biological form of injection locking.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41538257" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41538257" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kragen</span><span>|</span><a href="#41538287">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41538257">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41538257">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">in the 01950s the parametron was one of many approaches being considered for computing at microwave frequencies; it&#x27;s kind of amazing that it took until the 01980s for microwave computing to realize its potential, and then by way of conventional &#x27;level-based&#x27; combinationial logic and flip-flops rather than through oscillator-based computing</div><br/><div id="41538298" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41538298" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Vecr</span><span>|</span><a href="#41538257">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41538298">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41538298">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If we could compute faster we&#x27;d be able to do digital visible light interferometry, but for now we&#x27;re stuck with lenses and mirrors bolted to heavy tables, and our telescopes have to be very close together.</div><br/><div id="41538337" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41538337" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kragen</span><span>|</span><a href="#41538257">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41538298">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41538337">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41538337">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">well, i can see best around 540 terahertz, so i think you&#x27;d need digital state transition rates around a couple petahertz for digital visible light interferometry, about six orders of magnitude faster than this cellphone. that&#x27;s clearly physically possible, but one or another technology might be able to compute much faster while topping out in the low terahertz<p>such speeds would likely require that most bit operations be reversible to avoid vaporizing due to landauer&#x27;s limit (perhaps coincidentally also first proposed by von neumann)</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

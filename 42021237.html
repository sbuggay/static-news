The Asahi devs have had to painstakingly reverse engineer and reimplement the safety DSP that macOS uses on each device, and add some safety margin, because if they get it wrong they could literally destroy the speakers (and IIRC at least one of their own MacBooks did have its speakers sacrificed along the way).<p>I wonder if there will be a similar issue with the displays when Asahi gets around to supporting HDR on machines equipped with FALD mini-LED backlights (or XDR, as Apple calls it). HDR displays usually regulate their brightness to keep the panel from getting too hot, and if Apple does that in software too then Asahi will need to replicate it.</div><br/><div id="42024712" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42024712" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neya</span><span>|</span><a href="#42022146">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42023012">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42024712">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42024712">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As someone who builds speakers commercially, there aren&#x27;t any devices that will actually monitor a speaker&#x27;s temperature. I think what you mean is perhaps, wattage? The speaker&#x27;s temperature arises from the coil, which is what moves to produce sound. In large speakers, I&#x27;ve seen manufacturers attach some sort of sensors pointing at the moving coil to produce an estimate, but for the speakers used in the Macbooks, they are so thin that this would be a near impossible feat. Maybe Apple uses an estimation from the DSP based on the watts supplied vs time. But, certainly, you cannot attach any sort of device to the coil without making it distort or non-functional.<p>I know that Apple like to supply the speakers with slightly more power (Watts) than they can deal with to get them loud, but I haven&#x27;t seen nor heard of this temperature monitoring so far. I couldn&#x27;t find anything related to it either.

1. Software is more likely to fail at protection with worse consequences when it does (fire, damaged goods, warranty claims). Not just now, but also the future updates.
2. It eats away at the resources that are intended for the user. In other words: it makes the machine slightly slower for the user, for no good reason to the user.
3. You can do things that are impossible in laptop OS software. It gives redundancy, even if the OS freezes you can still make sure the speaker doesn&#x27;t overheat. If it&#x27;s implemented in a seperate chip. Also there is real time ability, etc.
4. It makes the OS and drivers much much simpler, which is important if you want to support other OSes on the same laptop.<p>Advantages, for Apple, to do it in software:
1. Software upgrade is easier and cheaper (assuming they never ever fail).
2. Cheaper.
3. You can keep competing OS&#x27;es off of your hardware, because it&#x27;s too hard to write drivers for your secret sauce closed source drivers that include functionality that is &quot;preventing parts from frying themselves&quot;.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42023254" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42023254" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">adgjlsfhk1</span><span>|</span><a href="#42022146">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42023039">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42024205">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42023295">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42023254">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42023254">[14 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s probably a combo of cost-cutting and control.

Apple has a proper bootloader capable of secure booting 3rd party OSs. What part of the open-source ecosystem was built differently?<p>It just so happened that after possibly even more painstaking reverse engineering, the responsible hardware vendor later realized that server machines are de facto linux, and they better support it properly.

MacOS relies on a hybrid kernel architecture that emulates a variety of different APIs that aren&#x27;t used or integrated fully. The simple act of running software on MacOS is deliberately somewhat inefficient, which is a perfectly fine tradeoff for a desktop OS that&#x27;s not intended for server or edge applications.<p>The fundamental hardware of Apple Silicon is very efficient but I don&#x27;t think MacOS is inherently optimized any better than the others.

The existence of non-Apple ARM devices should hopefully lead to general interest in addressing these issues, but there&#x27;s so much hardware and software out there, and only so many devs with the time, interest and access to fix them.<p>On the other hand, I suspect people will start making choices for their hardware&#x2F;software that maximise compatibility, as they already do for Linux x86. (&quot;Don&#x27;t buy NVIDIA if you want functioning Wayland&quot;, etc.) It&#x27;ll be tough, but things will hopefully get better over time.</div><br/><div id="42023266" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42023266" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">timeon</span><span>|</span><a href="#42022173">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42022745">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42023481">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42023266">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42023266">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&#x27;Non-Apple ARM&#x27; is still a bit like second class citizen, at least on Arch.

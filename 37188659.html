As a fellow game developer who learned to navigate the complexities of matchmaking and server orchestration the hard way (and begrudgingly), seeing Rivet open source a matchmaker and server orchestrator is exciting and honestly refreshing. For those outside of games, the use of modern webdev &#x2F; infra tooling is frustratingly nascent, and production-ready OSS usable by smaller-than-AAA-sized studios is even more rare, just beginning to come online (the efforts behind <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;game.ci" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;game.ci</a> are a recent shining example in game infra).<p>I&#x27;m particularly encouraged here by the tools and approaches chosen — Redis for matchmakers, ClickHouse for analytics&#x2F;logs, Rust for speedy backend operations were tools I eventually came upon as best for the job after a long and painful process of iteration with inappropriate cloud dev tooling (with basically any datastore other than Redis you will run in to issues matchmaking).<p>High traffic&#x2F;concurrency in matchmaking is a hard problem when you need fast, consistent matches. Existing industrial-sized matchmakers (Google&#x27;s OSS OpenMatch, AWS GameLift, etc.) require locking in to a very specific format or spinning up an entire K8S cluster, which for game devops teams already stretched thing is a tall ask). And for all that effort, you may discover the performance characteristics of their approaches aren&#x27;t what you need, or (as has happened to us with different game web service&#x2F;API&#x2F;middleware providers) they may choose to abruptly deprecate the service upon which you built.<p>Appreciate the dedication to making this available and the focus on helping gamedevs get up and running as fast as possible. Looking forward to playing around with Rivet and seeing where it might fit in our stack — &amp; would love to talk shop on this with anyone since I&#x27;ve been tortured by &#x2F; interested in these problems while trying to simultaneously run a game studio &#x2F; make new games &#x2F; keep everything online the last few years!</div><br/><div id="37195575" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37195575" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">doctorpangloss</span><span>|</span><a href="#37191209">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37192037">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37195575">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37195575">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;game.ci" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;game.ci</a><p>I don&#x27;t recommend it.<p>Game CI has been in development for a long time.

Often the teams working on the services for multiplayer games are very small so it’s all about leverage. They’re also embedded within a culture that doesn’t value or understand the practices and tools that are taken for granted in webdev, mostly because they’re hard to transfer to the other domains in gamedev.<p>I’m glad to see the open source development of these tools. Personally, there’s a lot of stuff colleagues and I have built that I would love to see open sourced. Otherwise we just end up implementing the same services over and over again.<p>Another example is patch delivery. It’s a solved problem yet everyone keeps rolling their own, or only shipping to Steam. Of course, all managed with some Jenkins scripts written by someone that’s no longer at the company.

Butler from itch.io looked interesting but I couldn’t decipher how to use it in the end.

It implies that the everyone&#x27;s requirements are the same and static and that solution X has reached all of those requirements.<p>I&#x27;m somewhat inclined to agree, because iterating on what we have and developing new tech and practices seems like a good idea (the concept of 12 Factor Apps comes to mind).<p>However, I can&#x27;t help but to wonder what this would look like, when taken to the extreme. Perhaps something along the lines of: &quot;We are only going to use Ubuntu for the servers and Java for all of our back end services, as well as React for the front end. Nothing else, no matter how many different projects there are.&quot;<p>And on a certain level, it makes sense: consistency and skills that carry over seem like a nice thing to have, there&#x27;s even terms out there like a company being &quot;a Java shop&quot; and so on.<p>That said, such inflexibility might not always be nice (e.g. trying to do machine learning in Java) but at the same time if a specific technology is in demand in the job market in most companies, you don&#x27;t really get much of a choice.<p>To return from the analogy, in the particular case of Kubernetes, you&#x27;ll have to learn and use it and there&#x27;s only so much free time for exploring other options.<p>&gt; If people blindly accepted X has won we&#x27;d be still using Perl, XML, CGI-Bin, Apache, Angular, etc<p>For many folks, some of those might indeed be good choices.<p>Some backup software that I use is written in Perl and is actually pretty good (BackupPC).<p>XML can be a nice format to use and has lots of tooling available. Even SOAP wasn&#x27;t necessarily the end of the world thanks to WSDL - being able to plug a file into SoapUI and getting an API that you can play around with, something that took Swagger&#x2F;OpenAPI years to reproduce for REST.<p>There&#x27;s something nice to be said about the simplicity of CGI and FastCGI still makes sense with something like PHP (PHP-FPM).<p>I actually still use Apache for hosting my personal stuff - if has most of the features you might want and with mod_md it&#x27;s a bit closer to Caddy than Nginx in getting LetsEncrypt certs (ACME). If you disable .htaccess, reasoning about the config also becomes about as easy as with Nginx (nginx.conf).<p>I&#x27;ve also seen Angular be used reasonably well and the &quot;batteries included&quot; feel of it was nice, especially when React had about 1500+ dependencies for a new project. I do personally lean towards Vue, though (oh and migrating away from AngularJS after the EOL was a pain, when that was relevant).<p>My point is that if something is good enough for your needs and helps you put food on the table, then you can just go with that choice.<p>Let those who prefer to experiment do so (hopefully not with your livelihood), celebrate their efforts and successes and learn from their failures, though. Kubernetes is established, Nomad is interesting, even Docker Swarm or Compose is okay.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37193657" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37193657" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ForHackernews</span><span>|</span><a href="#37193453">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37195461">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37194248">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37193657">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37193657">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Kuberentes is such an overengineered disaster.

I’m a hobbyist game dev whose been attempting a deploy of a simple multiplayer game on AWS, specifically gamelift, for about four months.<p>Turns out I thought I knew more than I really did thus I’ve been spending much of my hobbyist time learning more AWS. I’m pretty stubborn about a local dev experience which takes time to establish an appropriate mental model to do. So it goes. Pro tip: find your application “interfaces” and discover what tooling can be used instead of a cloud resource (e.g. a mongoDB compatible document database is the interface to which AWS DocumentDB and MongoDB are concrete implementations). I have a docker compose file I use for local dev. It’s the best setup I’ve found for myself but I am open for advice.<p>Anyways I’d just like to voice myself as a possible target audience. Being able to develop locally is important to me and the hardest parts with AWS is having little support on how exactly to do this. Assuming this is even a fair ask to make…<p>P.S. another pro tip; I use Unity + Mirror networking for my multiplayer games. GameLift requires code integrated into your game code for it to function. I use nested prefabs to handle two cases: (1) when I want gamelift code to execute and (2) when I just want to focus on writing the multiplayer code. My production code uses (1) and I usually do development in (2). (2) is a child of (1).<p>P.P.S. GameLift has a lag of about 2-3 minutes when registering my running game server in Unity editor with a “gamelift anywhere fleet” before it can receive traffic. I didn’t know about this for a while and stressed out over the inconsistency.

We use EOS for connecting P2P lobbies and doing server browsing. 
When using unreal that service is basically free. Managing game servers is of course not part of the EOS package but it&#x27;s a big question if your game really needs dedicated servers or could do with p2p lobbies. Running your own servers is quite expensive after all.
Also console support is also always a concern for us so whether they check all the boxes so we can use them inside the console ecosystem would be very important to know.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37190736" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37190736" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">waughpew</span><span>|</span><a href="#37189201">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37191569">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37190736">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37190736">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So glad to see open source.

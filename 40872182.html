So unless you own what you&#x27;re coding and you really need it out of the door for your own benefit, if more time makes your work more professional, then take more time. Anyone telling you otherwise is a 100% hack. You are not an automaton that takes in JIRA tickets and spits out hacky code as soon as possible. Or at least you shouldn&#x27;t be. Not to mention that not taking time (doing things properly) is incredibly taxing on your psyche and you WILL burn out. There are only so much garbage tasks you can take.<p>It&#x27;s worth repeating: Unless you have a stake in the company, it is NOT your job to make sure the company is the most profitable it can be. Your job is to create great software. What&#x27;s great software? The kind you&#x27;d be willing to put on your resume without feeling bad. This is the thing that will ultimately make you feel good about the work you&#x27;re doing. Hitting that arbitrary deadline for a 1425474th time may feel like a relief but it&#x27;s short term and a form of negative motivation - and in the workplace, those NEVER work over a long period of time. So RESIST that pressure from the top and do your work properly. If they fire you, then who cares, the only way up these days is job hopping anyways.</div><br/><div id="40872836" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40872836" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vouwfietsman</span><span>|</span><a href="#40872489">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40872935">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40872836">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40872836">[28 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; It&#x27;s worth repeating: Unless you have a stake in the company, it is NOT your job to make sure the company is the most profitable it can be.

Making a great product often, but not always, requires great software. Many great products have terrible software behind them. The tension between product, sales and development should result in a compromise that creates the most value short, middle and long term. It is 100% your job as a developer to understand what can and cannot be hacked, what priorities the company has beside delivering great software, and finally: when great software <i>must</i> be made, because compromise is unwise.<p>Just like the boy who cried wolf, the developer who can never compromise on software quality is powerless when there is an actual reason to not compromise on software quality, and rightfully so.</div><br/><div id="40872890" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40872890" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fabioborellini</span><span>|</span><a href="#40872489">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40872836">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40873201">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40872890">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40872890">[21 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; This is a terrible take, and one I generally see as a signal of lack of seniority in a software dev.

I try to employ YAGNI reasoning to them, but they just have a perfectionist standard.<p>Look: job 1 is making safe software, job 2 is making money and job 3 is perfecting the architecture.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40873082" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40873082" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Culonavirus</span><span>|</span><a href="#40872489">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40872836">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40872886">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40872884">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40873082">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40873082">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; absolutely everybody&#x27;s job in the company to make sure it is profitable<p>Absolutely and categorically it is not.

And even then, employees typically (and I&#x27;d even say in the vast majority of cases) have very few and tiny levers to pull to affect company profitability. So you typically you get nothing if the profit is x and nothing if the profit is x+n and even if you get some of that n you can&#x27;t really affect the absolute value of n. Why should you care about n again? Oh, right, so the company doesn&#x27;t go under and&#x2F;or lays you off.

It&#x27;s to write the optimal amount and quality of software for meeting the particular requirement it&#x27;s supposed to meet. More generally, an engineer&#x27;s job is to produce optimal solutions to problems. That does not always mean building the highest quality product possible. Sometimes it means doing just enough to get the job done, even if it&#x27;s not very pretty, and stopping there because doing more would add no business value. And you should not at all feel bad about putting <i>that</i> on your resume.

Yes, shipping at different points of maturity represent different sets of tradeoffs in a complex multi-dimensional matrix and it&#x27;s an intellectually fascinating challenge but often, the choice is far less important than the debate that sucks it in and engineers end up bikeshedding the decision.

I sympathize with your predicament. If I had any advice it&#x27;s that you cast around for a position that&#x27;s more in line with your principles and goals (don&#x27;t quit your current job till you find that.)<p>Personally I&#x27;ve been on all sides in the myself. I&#x27;ve been the principled programmer. I&#x27;ve been the one dedicated to quality. I&#x27;ve been the manager. I&#x27;ve been the person responsible for the business staying in business.<p>Yeah its nice to adopt the &quot;code my problem, business not&quot; position. It seems like the moral high ground. But businesses are all about balance. They have to balance things like income, and happy customers with tech debt and so on. Having programmers (or anyone for that matter) working -against- the big picture is not ultimately useful and can do more harm than good.<p>I don&#x27;t always agree with my team and they often don&#x27;t agree with me. But ultimately I&#x27;m responsible so (sometimes tough) decisions have to be made. The most successful employees are those who acknowledge that this isn&#x27;t necessarily the best way to do something, but strive anyway to make it a success.<p>I wish I had the time and money to let programmers just spend forever building stuff and never shipping. They most definitely wish that. But we live in a real world with constraints and the reality is we need a lot more than perfect code.<p>Of course some places are just impossible to work at, where everything is rushed and there is no balance either.

I&#x27;d found a problem nobody was actually solving and wanted to see if they&#x27;d be willing to pay to solve it. Like many of us I also had a bunch of partly finished projects that were never released, so I knew it could be a struggle to ship things.<p>What I ended up doing was writing a list of all the features that I wasn&#x27;t going to work on, and all the compromises I was going to make to get something out there. Some of those compromises really hurt when I was writing them down, but didn&#x27;t end up mattering enough to change them for over a year. Once I had them on the list, it gave me permission not to thing about them while I implemented the rest.<p>I also staged the development to avoid anything unnecessary if it flopped. For revenue, the idea was that I&#x27;d get a card on file from you, then bill it each month. But I launched the thing with no integration at all for the card on file. My plan was to give people a 14 day free trial, and if anyone actually used it in that time I&#x27;d use the time to build a card acceptance flow using Square (their API is like Stripe&#x27;s). It turns out people did find and use it, and I had to extend the trial a bit, but eventually built the form. Then I had until the first of the next month to build the system to total up their bill (based on usage) and charge the card on file using the rest of Square&#x27;s API.<p>I also didn&#x27;t build anything at all for scheduling account lifecycle events. I used varmail.me (a little thing I wrote forever ago) to have my app email me when someone signed up, and check my inbox a couple times daily and send a canned welcome message to any new users. Then I&#x27;d write an email reminding me user X&#x27;s trial expired, set myself as the recipient, and use Gmail scheduled messages to schedule it 14 days in the future. When I got that email I&#x27;d check if they&#x27;re still using the product, send them a reminder to put in their card on file, and manually mark their account as inactive until they enter a form of payment. Billing jobs were run manually by me on my laptop for a while. Over time I got more users and it was worth the effort to replace these manual processes with automated ones. If nobody had used my product, it wouldn&#x27;t have been worth the effort to automate any of this.<p>Testing was another thing I experimented with doing differently. At first I tested everything manually. Automating tests was difficult anyway because the key flow redirects through PayPal, and there were parts written in Google Apps Script. Eventually I built an end-to-end selenium test. Then I started adding unit tests where appropriate. Basically my principle was that I added automated tests to any area where I felt uneasy about making changes for fear of breaking something. Since I&#x27;m fairly risk-averse, the product was small, and I worked on it solo, this worked well for me.</div><br/><div id="40872710" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40872710" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">f3b5</span><span>|</span><a href="#40872516">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40872941">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40872710">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40872710">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for sharing!

And you wouldn&#x27;t get insane invoices for 10-100x overpriced traffic that the clouds have and that kills many ideas even when it would make sense to do them in the cloud otherwise.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40872548" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40872548" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pacifika</span><span>|</span><a href="#40872941">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40872803">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40872548">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40872548">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There’s usually room for more than one implementation of an idea, most of the target audience haven’t committed yet?</div><br/></div></div><div id="40872803" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40872803" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neontomo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40872548">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40872520">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40872803">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40872803">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">an added benefit of shipping early is you get a feeling for whether people are interested, before you spend a year developing a toaster that eats its own toast.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40872639" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40872639" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">andrewstuart</span><span>|</span><a href="#40872520">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40872468">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40872639">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40872639">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve got three separate applications all &quot;close to finished&quot; and I&#x27;ve been working on them for years (along with many other things).<p>Just as I&#x27;m getting real close to being finished enough to release - something changes - life changes - or some other thing changes - or I don&#x27;t believe in the product any more - then I do believe in the product again - then blah blah blah.

Especially as idiomatic Rust as written by skilled programmers looks nothing like C, and most interesting code is written in C++ anyway.<p>Isn&#x27;t it equivalent to statically determining the lifetimes of all allocations in the C program, including those that are implemented using custom allocators or which cross into proprietary libraries? There&#x27;s been a lot of research into this sort of thing over the years without much success. C&#x2F;C++ programs can do things like tie allocation lifetimes to what buttons a user clicks, without ref counting or other mechanisms to ensure safety. It&#x27;s not a good idea, but, they can do it.<p>The other obvious problem with trying to write such a static analysis is that the programs you&#x27;re analyzing are by definition buggy and the lifetimes might not make sense (if they did, they wouldn&#x27;t have memory safety holes and wouldn&#x27;t need to be replaced). The only research I&#x27;ve seen on this problem of statically detecting what lifetimes should be does assume the code being analyzed is actually correct to begin with. I guess you could try and aim for a program that detects where lifetimes can&#x27;t be worked out and asks the developer for help though.</div><br/><div id="41110862" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41110862" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">woodruffw</span><span>|</span><a href="#41110693">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41111122">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41110862">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41110862">[18 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s very hard; DARPA likes to fund hard things[1] :-).<p>This isn&#x27;t, however, DARPA&#x27;s first foray into automatic program translation, or even automatic translation into Rust[2].<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.urbandictionary.com&#x2F;define.php?term=DARPA%20hard" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.urbandictionary.com&#x2F;define.php?term=DARPA%20hard</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;c2rust.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;c2rust.com&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="41111383" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41111383" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">the_snooze</span><span>|</span><a href="#41110693">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41110862">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41113477">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41111383">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41111383">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">DARPA is basically a state-sponsored VC that optimizes for completely different things.

I&#x27;ve used it for that task myself with success (Java -&gt; JavaScript).<p>But, this isn&#x27;t just about rewriting code from one language to another. It&#x27;s about reverse engineering complex information out of the code, which may not be immediately visible in it, and then finding a way to make it &quot;safe&quot; according to Rust&#x27;s type system. Where&#x27;s the training data for that? It&#x27;d be really hard even for skilled humans.<p>Personally I think the most pragmatic way to make C&#x2F;C++ memory safe quicker is one of two approaches:<p>1. Incrementally. Make std::vector[] properly bounds checked (still not done even in chrome!), convert allocations to allocations that know their own size and do bounds checking e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;issues.chromium.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;40285824" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;issues.chromium.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;40285824</a><p>2. Or, go the whole hog and use runtime techniques like garbage collection and runtime bounds checks.<p>A good example of approach (2) is Managed Sulong, which extends the JVM to execute LLVM bitcode directly whilst exposing to the C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;FORTRAN a virtualized Linux syscall interface. The whole piece of code can be sandboxed with permissions, and memory safety errors are caught at runtime. The compiler tries to optimize out as many bounds checks as possible. The interesting thing about this approach is it doesn&#x27;t require big changes to the source code (as long as it&#x27;s already been ported to Linux), which means the work of making something safe can be done by teams independent of the original authors. In practice &quot;rewrite it in Rust&quot; will usually mean a fork, which introduces lots of complicated technical, cultural and economic issues.<p>Managed Sulong is also a research project and has a bunch of problems to solve, for instance it needs to lose the JITC dependency and go fully AOT compiled (doable, there&#x27;s no theoretical issue with it and much of the needed infra already exists). And performance&#x2F;memory usage can always be improved of course, it regresses vs the original C. But those are &quot;just&quot; systems engineering problems, not rewrite-the-world and solve-static-analysis problems.<p>Disclosure: I do work part time at Oracle Labs which developed Managed Sulong, but I don&#x27;t work on it.</div><br/><div id="41113805" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41113805" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Animats</span><span>|</span><a href="#41110693">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41111030">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41116866">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41113805">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41113805">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; But, this isn&#x27;t just about rewriting code from one language to another. It&#x27;s about reverse engineering complex information out of the code, which may not be immediately visible in it, and then finding a way to make it &quot;safe&quot; according to Rust&#x27;s type system. Where&#x27;s the training data for that? It&#x27;d be really hard even for skilled humans.<p>That might not be too bad.<p>A combination of a formal system and an LLM might work here. Suppose we see a C function<p><pre><code>   void somefn(char* buf, int n);
</code></pre>
First question: is &quot;buf&quot; a pointer to an array, or a pointer to a single char? That can be answered by looking at what the function does with &quot;buf&quot;, and what callers pass to it.<p>If it&#x27;s an array, how big is it? We don&#x27;t have enough info to know that yet. But a reasonable guess, and one than an LLM might make, is that the length of buf is &quot;n&quot;.<p>Following that assumption, it&#x27;s reasonable to translate this to Rust as<p><pre><code>   fn somefn(buf: &amp;[u8])
</code></pre>
and, if n is needed within the function, use<p><pre><code>   buf.len()
</code></pre>
The next step is to validate that guess. The run-time approach is to write all calls to &quot;somefn&quot; with<p><pre><code>   assert!(buf.len() == n);
   somefn(buf, n);
</code></pre>
Maybe formal methods can prove the assert true, and we can take it out. Or if a SAT solver or a fuzz tester
can generate a counterexample, we know that the guess was wrong and this has to be done the hard way, as<p><pre><code>   fn somefn(buf: &amp;[u8], int n)

It is a very ambitious proposal and I agree that this level of ambition is appropriate for DARPA&#x27;s mission and I wish them well.<p>As a Rust advocate in this domain I have attempted to temper the expectations of those driving this proposal with due respect to the feasibility of automatic translation from C to Rust. The fundamental obstacle that I foresee remains that C source code contains less information than Rust source code. In order to translate C code to Rust code that missing information must be produced by someone or something. It is easy to prove that it is impossible to infallibly generate this missing information for the same reason that scaling an image to make it larger cannot infallibly produce bits of information that were not captured by the original image. Instead we must extrapolate (invent) the missing information from the existing source code. To extrapolate correctly we must exercise judgement and this is a fallible process especially when exercised in large quantities by unsupervised language models. I have proposed solutions that I believe would go some way towards addressing these problems but I will decline to go into detail.<p>Ultimately I will say that I believe that it is possible for this project to achieve a measure of success, although it must be undertaken with caution and with measured expectations. At the same time it should be emphasized it is also possible that no public result will come of this project and so I caution those here against reading too much into this at this time. In particular I would remind everyone that the government is not a singular entity and so I would not interpret this project as a blanket denouncement against C or vice versa as a blanket blessing of Rust. Each agency will set its own direction and timelines for the adoption of memory-safe technologies. For example NIST recommends Rust as well as Ada SPARK in addition to various hardened dialects of C&#x2F;C++.</div><br/><div id="41117400" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41117400" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">the8472</span><span>|</span><a href="#41112200">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41112251">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41117400">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41117400">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; In order to translate C code to Rust code that missing information must be produced by someone or something.<p>If you don&#x27;t go for preserving the formal semantics of C code and instead only require the test-suite to still pass after translation that can provide a lot of wiggle room for the translation.

Conversion of an individual function that works on plain-old-data structures is probably doable, if somewhat challenging.<p>An off-the-cuff idea I just had is to implement a semi-automated transformation, where the user has to input what a final conversion of a struct type should look like (including all Cell&#x2F;Rc&#x2F;whatever wrappers as needed), and the tool can use that to work out the rest of the translation.

Also memory safety is just a very small part of being able to actually trust code.<p>- C compiles down to straightforward assembly, almost like a direct translation, so you can at least verify that smaller programs that you write in C actually do compile down to assembly you expect, and compose those smaller programs into larger ones.<p>- C has valgrind and ASAN so it&#x27;s at least possible to write safe code with code coding discipline, and plenty of software has been able to do this for decades.<p>- A lot of (almost all) higher level programming languages are written in C, which means that those languages just need to make sure they get the compiler and GC right, and then those languages can be used for general purpose, scripting, &quot;low level&quot; high level code like Go or OCaml, etc.<p>- There are many C compilers and only one Rust compiler, and it&#x27;s unclear whether it&#x27;ll really be feasible to have more than one Rust compiler due to the complexity of the language. So you&#x27;re putting a lot of trust into a small group of people, and even if they&#x27;re the most amazing, most ethical people, surely if a lot of critical infra is based on Rust they&#x27;ll get targeted in some way.<p>- Something being open source doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s been fully audited. We&#x27;ve seen all sorts of security vulnerabilities cause a world a hurt for a lot of people that came from all open source code, and often very small libraries that could actually be much easier to audit than lines with millions of lines of code.<p>- Similarly, Rust does not translate to straightforward assembly, and again would seem to be impossible to do given the complexity of the language.<p>- There was an interesting project I came across called CompCert, which aims to have a C compiler that&#x27;s formally verified (in Coq) to translate into the assembly you expect. Something like a recursively compiled CompCert C -&gt; OCaml -&gt; Coq -&gt; CompCert would be an interesting undertaking, which would make OCaml and Coq themselves built on formally verified code, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;ll really work and I suspect it&#x27;s too complicated.<p>- I think Rust might be able to solve some of these problems if they have a fully formally verified thing, and the formally verified thing is itself formally verified, and the compiler was verified by that thing, and then you know that you can trust the whole thing. Still, the level of complexity and the inability to at least manually audit the core of it makes me suspect it&#x27;s too complicated and would still be based on trust of some sort.<p>- I still think that static analysis and building higher level languages on top of C is a better approach, and working on formal verification from there, because there are really small C compilers like tinycc that are ~50k LOCs, which can be hand verified. You can compile chibi-scheme with tinycc, for example, which is also about ~50k LOCs of C, and so you get a higher level language from about 100k LOCs (tcc and chibi), which is feasible for an ordinary but motivated dev to manually audit to know that it&#x27;s producing sound assembly and not something wonky or sketchy. Ideally we should be building compilers and larger systems that are formally verified, but I think the core of whatever the formally verified system is has to be hand verifiable in some way in order to be trustworthy, so that you can by induction trust whatever gets built up from that, and I think that would need to require a straightforward translation into assembly, with ideally open source ISA and hardware, and a small enough codebase to be manually audited like the tinycc and chibi-scheme example I gave.<p>- Worst case everyone kind of shrugs it all off and just trusts all of these layers of complexity, which can be like C -&gt; recursively compiled higher level lang -&gt; coffeescript-like layer on top -&gt; framework, which is apparently a thing now, and just hope that all of these layers of millions of lines of code of complexity don&#x27;t explode in some weird way, intentionally or unintentionally.<p>- Best case of the worst case is that all of our appliances are now &quot;smart&quot; appliances, and then one day they just transform into robots that start chasing you around the house, all the while the Transformers cartoon theme is playing in the background while, which would match up nicely with the current trend of everything being both terrifying and hilarious in a really bizarre way.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41114178" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41114178" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ksp-atlas</span><span>|</span><a href="#41114328">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41111015">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41114178">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41114178">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Technically, Zig has this functionality built in via translate-c, but it&#x27;s designed for reading by a C compiler, not a human</div><br/><div id="41115080" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41115080" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">deepsun</span><span>|</span><a href="#41114178">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41111015">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41115080">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41115080">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well, the main idea is memory-safety.

For example, in C I might have a `struct foo*` that aliases the 7th element of a `struct foo[]` array. How do you represent that in Java or Python? I don&#x27;t think you can use regular objects or regular arrays&#x2F;lists from either of those languages, because you need <i>assignments through the pointer</i> (of the whole `struct foo`, not just individual field writes) to affect the array. Even worse, in C I might have a `const char*` that aliases the same element and expects every write to affect its <i>bytes</i>. To model all this you&#x27;d need some Frankenstein, technically-Turing-complete, giant-bytestring-that-represents-all-of-memory thing that wouldn&#x27;t really be Java or Python in any meaningful sense, wouldn&#x27;t be remotely readable or maintainable, and wouldn&#x27;t be able to interoperate with any existing libraries.<p>In Rust you presumably do all of that with raw pointers, which leaves you with a big unsafe mess to clean up over time, and I imagine a lot of the hard work of this project is trying to minimize that mess. But at least the mess that you have is recognizably Rust, and incremental cleanup is possible.</div><br/><div id="41115989" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41115989" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wolfspider</span><span>|</span><a href="#41111015">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41112327">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41111108">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41115989">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41115989">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Iâve spent the past few months translating a C library heavy in pointer arithmetic to TypeScript. Concessions have to be made here and there but ended up making utility classes to capture some of the functionality. Structs can be represented as types since they are able to also to be expressed as unions similar to structs. These const types can have fields updated in place and inherit properties from other variables similar to passing by reference which JS can do (pass by sharing) or use a deep clone to copy. As far as affecting the underlying bytes as a type Iâve come up with something I call byte type reflection which is a union type which does self-inference on the object properties in order to flatten itself into a bytearray so that the usual object indexing and length properties automatically only apply to the byte array as it has been expressed (the underlying object remains as well). C automatically does this so there is some overhead for this that cannot be removed. Pointer arithmetic can be applied with an iterator class which keeps track of the underlying data object but sadly does count as another copy. Array splicing can substitute creating a view of a pointer array which is not optimal but there are some Kotlin-esque utilities that create array views which can be used. Surprisingly, the floating point values which I expected to be way off and can only express as a number type are close enough. I use Deno FFI so plenty of room to go back to unmanaged code for optimizations and WASM can be tapped into easily. For me those values are what is important and it does the job adequately. The code is also way more resilient to runtime errors as opposed to the C library which has a tendency to just blow up. TLDR; Donât let it stop you until you try because you might just be surprised at how it turns out. If the function calls of a library are only 2-3 levels deep how much âperformanceâ are you really gaining by keeping it that way? Marshalling code is the usual answer and Deno FFI does an amazing job at that.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41111108" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41111108" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">galangalalgol</span><span>|</span><a href="#41111015">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41112327">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41114162">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41111108">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41111108">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you have your cross hair on c, then you want a language that can do whatever c does.

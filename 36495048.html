Here, multiple generic drug manufacturers are competing to win sales contracts by offering the lowest possible price. This can be seen as an example of perfect competition, where firms are price takers and compete mainly on price, driving prices down to the point where they equal the marginal cost of production.<p>However, the problem arises when these prices are driven so low that they no longer cover the firms&#x27; average total costs (including both variable and fixed costs), making it unprofitable for them to continue production. Some firms may choose to exit the market, leading to a reduction in supply. This is where the theory of &quot;shutdown point&quot; comes in: firms will choose to shut down production (at least temporarily) when price falls below the minimum point of the average variable cost curve.<p>The complication in this case is that the reduction in supply is occurring for a product (cancer drugs) that is still in demand. However, as one commenter suggested, it&#x27;s unclear whether the demand would support a higher price.<p>There might be external forces (like regulatory environments, health insurance dynamics, and negotiations by large scale buyers) that are keeping the prices artificially low, preventing the price from rising to a level where it would be profitable for more firms to produce the drugs.</div><br/><div id="36503398" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36503398" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hannob</span><span>|</span><a href="#36502857">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36503360">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36503398">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36503398">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is probably a good example why naive market economics thinking is problematic.<p>Any &quot;ideal market&quot; assumes some kind of demand elasticity, i.e. people will buy more when it&#x27;s cheap and less when it&#x27;s expensive.

Further complicating matters, oversight of production quality is challenging for overseas manufacturers, and a lack of contingency plans for sudden disruptions, as seen with the closure of the Intas Pharmaceuticals plant in India, exacerbates shortages.

On one hand you can say &quot;well 15 out of 220 clearly shows generics are more likely to have shortages!&quot; but the vast majority of drugs (counted either by licensed drugs or prescriptions written) are generics. There&#x27;s not a clear correlation between whether a drug has generics available vs. whether it is or recently was subject to a shortage.<p>Bacteriostatic water &#x2F; Water for injection absolutely fits the model you posited -- American Regent discontinued production and no one else wants to fill the gap because as soon as demand is satisfied, prices will plummet and drive negative ROI. Game theory shows the stable equilibrium is continued shortage for these generics, as you&#x27;ve stated. But your model does not fit Wegovy, Semaglutide, Ozempic, Avycaz, Trulicity, Ultravist, etc.<p>Commodities like medicine and food do have terrible price elasticity which cause great problems in unregulated markets. Unsupported, these commodity prices can crash to floor, and in one year farmers might switch to other crops or shut their doors forever, and then in the next year there would be huge shortages and high prices which take too many years to fix. The original commodity swing could be caused by anything - consumers decide for whatever reason that milk&#x2F;cheese just isn&#x27;t that cool this year, last year prices went up 10% and then too many farmers jumped in on that commodity so this year there&#x27;s a massive oversupply, etc. The natural free-market state of things is: wild price swings and capacity chasing last year&#x27;s profits&#x2F;losses. Ideally the futures markets would help stabilize these prices by creating incentive for smart people to predict capacity-demand equilibria for upcoming years and allocate capital appropriately but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do that effectively for really any inelastic commodity, at least from what I see -- all minerals&#x2F;oil&#x2F;gas&#x2F;food&#x2F;etc seem to experience incredible price swings on a regular basis. The nature of reality is that demand for inelastic commodities does not seem to be able to be predicted to the precision needed to maintain stable prices and maintain the necessary revenue flows to keep enough producers online in a free market.<p>That&#x27;s a major reason why many (most? all?) developed nations create various &quot;Farm Safety Nets&quot; to help create an annual floor for the production of basic food staples. The USDA knows about how much of each basic food staple the nation needs in an average year and works to ensure that something like 110% of this amount is produced each year. They do this by paying for excess production -- in years when consumer demand is low, they pay the excess and leave it up to the farmers to figure out what to do with the product that no one wants. Maybe it&#x27;s sold at a nominal loss to someone who can use it for something else, maybe it&#x27;s buried in the ground, whatever. (During parts of the COVID swings, new Farm Safety Nets were authorized because the farmers literally didn&#x27;t have enough cash to even dispose of some excess food). These basic crops include milk, wheat, oats, barley, corn, grain sorghum, rice, soybeans, sunflower seed, rapeseed, canola, safflower, flaxseed, mustard seed, crambe and sesame seed, dry peas, lentils, chickpeas, etc etc.<p>There&#x27;s still the possibility that too many players jump into a market, prices crash, and some producers fail. But the USDA does their damnedest to ensure that 110% (or whatever, I don&#x27;t know what their target safety margin is) of the necessary production is well supported and can go on to produce again with more guaranteed margins next year.<p>We probably need more systems like this for some other industries -- medicine being a pretty good contender for the first industry we should put more attention into. It&#x27;s been working well for our farms and food supplies for 100 years. It has the <i>potential</i> to be used disastrously in a failed communist style USSR&#x2F;Mao planned-economy debacle or an equally disastrous kleptocractic &#x2F; regulatory capture &#x2F; campaign finance corruption &#x2F; conflict-of-interest debacle, but we&#x27;ve been doing it already for a century and we seem to be doing it reasonably well, all things considered.

They started out as hospital purchasing groups which were created by hospitals who banded together to get better deals so they usually monopolize purchasing for an entire hospital. Now they’ve grown so big they’ve got monopolistic pricing power as consumers (I don’t know the right economic term) since there are so few organizations buying for all the hospitals.<p>When buying syringes, bandages, and most of the things hospitals need, that’s not a big deal but the way many oncology drugs are administered these organizations end up handling all of the negotiations instead of pharmacies and insurance companies. Patients and even their healthcare providers have basically zero say in the purchasing because it’s all rolled in.<p>Since the US is the most profitable market in an already low margin business, the generic manufacturers can’t justify the production lines for cancer drugs without at least one of these clients so they‘re driven to extreme price wars. In good times, they eek out a profit, but in bad times when variable costs go up, they’re no longer viable.</div><br/><div id="36503465" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36503465" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Arkanum</span><span>|</span><a href="#36502672">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36503081">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36503174">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36503465">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36503465">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the word you might be looking for is &quot;Monopsony&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Monopsony" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Monopsony</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36503174" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36503174" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">worldsayshi</span><span>|</span><a href="#36502672">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36503081">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36503465">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36503500">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36503174">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36503174">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wonder if premier and vizient have a vested interest in some of the suppliers going out of business, like if they have indirect ownership in competing suppliers.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36502862" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36502862" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bandrami</span><span>|</span><a href="#36502672">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36503081">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36502816">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36502862">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36502862">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Cancer drugs in particular have this exceedingly weird market where oncologists buy drugs from distributers and resell them to their patients.

Even for people that chafe at the prospect of medication and traditional talk therapy, CBT specialists can help you implement some practical mental tools in only a few visits without protracted emotional history explorations or anything resembling them. The technique has proven to get quick, meaningful results for everything from combat PTSD to ADHD to depression and beyond, and can be a fast path to achieving good mental hygiene.

I have a different story.  I have convinced 2 partners over my younger life to have abortions.  I was young and stupid.  I thought life would continue in the grandest way it seemed then, and got caught off guard and was terrified.  I have since had 2 children, and the sorrow and devastation of my past choices now haunts me.  The love I lost.  Not getting to hold and care for them.<p>You might say &quot;get over it and stop feeling bad - you have something good,&quot; and I know I do, but the past hangs over me like a never-ending storm.  How can I ever forgive myself for what I did?  The thought of them safe in their mother&#x27;s wombs and being ripped out...I can hardly bear it.  I carry this pain daily.  I have since learned that having kids is the best thing that ever happened to me.  It taught me how to love in a way I hadn&#x27;t ever before.  Having this knowledge makes the past even harder to accept.  Who would those unborn have been today?  What would they have taught me?  How can I be a caring person to have done this?<p>I can&#x27;t say I can relate to your situation, so please forgive any apparent glibness, but I would gladly sign up to go through what a lot of people here have done for their children with special needs just to have the chance to have known them.  It may sound easy for me to say, but be glad you didn&#x27;t make my choices.  If someone else reads this who did, please know that there is also a part of me that realizes I thought things would be different, and I went on the information I had, which was bad.  I&#x27;m not at all judging you.  You did the best you could.  Despite me sounding self condemning, I&#x27;m just very regretful that I didn&#x27;t make a different choice.<p>All this to say: I hope you find a little more validation from my story that you are on a good path, and that you are not cursed, but rather have a gift.  It&#x27;s a gift I chose to throw away.  It sounds like it&#x27;s hard to manage at times but it&#x27;s very much a gift.  I know that sounds dismissive and cheesy, like everything everyone would say because it sounds good and doesn&#x27;t acknowledge the real sacrifices you&#x27;ve had to make in comparison to friends who don&#x27;t understand, but I want you to know that I truly mean it, and I understand, maybe unlike others who say it, what it really means, because I look at you and want so badly what you have, if it meant having all my children alive in my life.  Your child taught you how to love - deeper and more alive than anything else possibly could have.  It may seem like life&#x2F;God used force to shape you like this, but I&#x27;m learning that&#x27;s the only way it can work sometimes.  You have to get to a point where you are willing to see it differently, and God will find a way to show you that.  Maybe your child&#x27;s presence forced you to make a choice to break through your own ego and be willing to love them.  If so, it no doubt transformed you.  Learning that is the greatest lesson life can teach.  You are on a good path.  It won&#x27;t be evident for a time, but you absolutely are.  I send you my best.</div><br/><div id="39046099" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39046099" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DiggyJohnson</span><span>|</span><a href="#39038066">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39045983">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39046166">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39046099">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39046099">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is one of the most moving things I&#x27;ve ever read on this site.

When the grief first happens, it&#x27;s like a giant, dark ball suddenly fills up the <i>entire</i> ball. There&#x27;s nothing else. Everything is pain. Everything is grief.<p>People think the dark ball is meant to shrink over time, but in my experience, that&#x27;s not it at all. What happens instead is that, slowly but surely, the clear ball gets bigger.<p>Eventually, not every moment is grief. Not every moment is pain. It&#x27;s still there. It&#x27;s never smaller. It never actually even hurts less. But you grow around it.<p>Losing someone to death is like if a color suddenly disappeared from your whole world. Let&#x27;s use yellow. You&#x27;ve encountered so much of your life with this yellow in it. The more closely things were associated with this person,the yellower they are--and the more wrong they look now that yellow is gone.<p>Over time, you get used to the way they look, but you never really forget how they looked back when they were yellow. They&#x27;re not as beautiful now.<p>But then there are other things that you encounter that haven&#x27;t ever been yellow, places that person never went or things they were never a part of. You can <i>imagine</i> how much more beautiful they would be if they <i>did</i> have yellow, but they don&#x27;t look <i>wrong</i> to you without yellow. They just look how they look, and that&#x27;s the way you expect them to be beautiful.<p>I don&#x27;t know if these images are helpful to anyone else, but they&#x27;ve made a big difference to me on my own grief journey, and since today would have been my sister&#x27;s birthday, I thought I&#x27;d share them.</div><br/><div id="39052482" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39052482" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pokoblond</span><span>|</span><a href="#39038066">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39043337">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39045812">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39052482">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39052482">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve been reading your comments in this thread and wanted to say thank you.

Grief is an illness that can only be cured by time. Your wounds heal over, but never completely fade. You gradually pack it away in a little box alongside a few physical things—small clothes, toys, photos—and try not to open it too often in case you let it all spill out, or the smells to fade. Every now and then, someone knocks the box without realising and your grief tumbles onto the floor. It can take days to fit it all back in.</div><br/><div id="39047103" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39047103" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smeej</span><span>|</span><a href="#39041450">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39052161">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39047103">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39047103">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; A big life can be very short.<p>My nephew was born by emergency c-section after my sister experienced sudden cardiac death at age 29, 8 months pregnant.

At the very center are the people going through it directly. Each step outward represents one step removed from the event itself.<p>Everyone has permission to dump any pain or need or anything onto anyone in a larger ring than they&#x27;re in, but under no circumstance should any such things be dumped into a smaller circle.<p>For example, when my sister and my died, her husband&#x2F;his father was in the innermost circle. My mother was in a very slightly larger one. My brother and I were a circle out from that, followed by her closest friend, his parents, his brother, their other friends, etc.<p>It makes a really big difference not to have to try to deal with what other people need to dump when you&#x27;re dealing with enough to be broken yourself.<p>And when in doubt? The most effective thing you can do in many circumstances is show up, stay, and not say a word. Your physical presence and willingness to sit silently in the overwhelming awkwardness speaks volumes. It tells the person you love that they aren&#x27;t alone, even when being with them is really hard.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ring_theory_(psychology)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ring_theory_(psychology)</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39037689" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39037689" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pattesseriedude</span><span>|</span><a href="#39043489">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39037775">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39037689">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39037689">[26 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m really feeling sorry for both the author and his family. Can’t imagine what they must be going through.<p>When I was 10 my oldest sibling went through a coma and after coming out of it some time later she did some things that my parents were not happy about. My family was going through some things and me being the youngest was completely neglected. I was shoved in a room and my family being well off all the problems were tried to be solved by money. Then just as things were getting a little better for me between 11-12 I was molested a few times. I was too scared to talk to anyone. My parents were not bothered much. 19 years later today I have PTSD and I struggle with anxiety depression panic. In my entire life I had no one to talk to and no one loved me. I was unable to make any connections in life. I do therapy which helps a little. I fell in love with someone 12 years ago which was the only time I felt something in life but she never liked me and till this day I hope for a miracle. There was a time few years ago I was unable to leave my room without panic attacks as that was the only place I felt safe. Somehow I was able to work my way into a graduate degree in computer science from a top school and a job. However I still spent the last 3 days crying alone. I deal with it every single day every single hour of my life. Life gets better some days and worse some days.<p>Anyway my point is that your children and your spouse need you the most right now. This is a turning point for everyone in the family. Hold them close. Talk to them. They may show they are strong and handling it well but they need you more than you might think. Some things cannot be undone. Some things cannot be changed. But many are in control today and a lot will be decided about the future at this time. So please just hold them close and tell them you love them. I will pray for you and your family.</div><br/><div id="39037741" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39037741" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">voisin</span><span>|</span><a href="#39037689">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39038371">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39037741">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39037741">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I a sorry to hear what you’ve gone through and are still going through.

From what we observed, he was no longer the person we had known for many years. After contracting COVID, he became fully silent and bedridden for six months. His food was administered through pipes, and blood reports were regularly taken to monitor his health. In case of any infection, especially urinary, we had to take him to the hospital. Throughout this period, he was physically present but unresponsive.<p>I was unsure about what he was feeling—whether he experienced pain or had lost his ability to feel it. My mother was not ready to accept the reality, continuously supporting him during this challenging time. I cannot recollect those days clearly. He passed away six months later, but the thoughts of what he went through continue to trouble all of us. I still feel the pain.

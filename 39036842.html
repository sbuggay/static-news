Canât imagine what they must be going through.<p>When I was 10 my oldest sibling went through a coma and after coming out of it some time later she did some things that my parents were not happy about. My family was going through some things and me being the youngest was completely neglected. I was shoved in a room and my family being well off all the problems were tried to be solved by money. Then just as things were getting a little better for me between 11-12 I was molested a few times. I was too scared to talk to anyone. My parents were not bothered much. 19 years later today I have PTSD and I struggle with anxiety depression panic. In my entire life I had no one to talk to and no one loved me. I was unable to make any connections in life. I do therapy which helps a little. I fell in love with someone 12 years ago which was the only time I felt something in life but she never liked me and till this day I hope for a miracle. There was a time few years ago I was unable to leave my room without panic attacks as that was the only place I felt safe. Somehow I was able to work my way into a graduate degree in computer science from a top school and a job. However I still spent the last 3 days crying alone. I deal with it every single day every single hour of my life. Life gets better some days and worse some days.<p>Anyway my point is that your children and your spouse need you the most right now. This is a turning point for everyone in the family. Hold them close. Talk to them. They may show they are strong and handling it well but they need you more than you might think. Some things cannot be undone. Some things cannot be changed. But many are in control today and a lot will be decided about the future at this time. So please just hold them close and tell them you love them. I will pray for you and your family.</div><br/><div id="39037992" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39037992" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">l33tbro</span><span>|</span><a href="#39037689">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39037741">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39037992">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39037992">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Heartbreaking that you went through all that.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to trivialize your situation, but I recently learned about nociception [1] and your condition reminded me of what sucks about it.

This is real pain. When life hits you like this, it&#x27;s important to just endure, rather than escape. Trying to escape the pain can lead to addictions and behaviors that bring more problems. Some people are hit with pain like this and live a whole life trying to escape it, but never do. Best thing is accept, grieve, and continue on. Regardless, you will not be the same person, this will change you. Sometimes life just sucks, and there is no way of saying it doesn&#x27;t, only time and love can help. However, the sun comes up every morning, and there is a sunset every night.<p>This is for anyone out there suffering some acute trauma like losing a loved one, or a chronic trauma like abuse over many years. I have experienced both, and it took me over 15 years to realize what had happened and to recover. I originally chose escapism. I didn&#x27;t realize it at the time, but that&#x27;s what it was. I was always into something, eventually even substance abuse. Ironically, escapism is how I ended learning to code, which was an escape for me. However, I also ended up being around even worse things and witnessing more death, while living broke and stressed out. This dragged me into even more suffering to the point of wanting suicide every day, but I just couldn&#x27;t do it. This was a combination of escapism, and being around people with the same negativity as me.<p>Fortunately in time, I found myself, and realized everything that had happened, and how life can just be like that. But also how beautiful and exciting life can be as well. This would not have happened had I not met certain people that showed me what it means to love, and to be mentally strong. Also, by reading and learning you can find inspiration and love from someone that you will never meet in real life. Regardless, we need support of strong and positive people around us. We are a social species after all. When dealing with death&#x2F;loss, remember the good times, be thankful for the time we had, and leave it at that - easier said than done.<p>The sun will rise tomorrow, and you will too. Take care, friend.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39037775" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39037775" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kraig911</span><span>|</span><a href="#39039192">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39037872">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39037775">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39037775">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Death can have so many meanings when I read this.

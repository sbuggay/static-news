That looks like a series of APIs if they care about data exposure, or huge CSV exports that they need to then track ?<p>And as it seems to be important enough to warrant verification, it means your program is not some random batch, it needs significant validation.<p>Then picture the internal tool changing its output format. Reports getting categorized differently because of organizational change. New fields being added to follow new legislations. The tool could break at any of these changes, and the lady&#x27;s left with a broken system except a lot of money has been invested, it&#x27;s supposed to have solved her problem, she might not have the same access to data she had before the integration, and overall the situation could be worse than before.<p>That feels like a bleak scenario, but it happens all the time as well.</div><br/><div id="37973736" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37973736" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bloak</span><span>|</span><a href="#37971959">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972204">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972233">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37973736">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37973736">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think you&#x27;re right. I&#x27;ve sometimes been in the situation of having to maintain a script that depends on APIs or data formats that change from time to time without warning. A fair amount of skill and effort is required. (There is skill involved in writing the script so that it is maintainable and not too fragile but still detects when something has gone wrong.) If the script is doing a task that has to be completed on a particular day every month, rather than whenever the script hacker is next available, then you&#x27;d have to choose between paying the hacker a reasonable retainer or having someone around who you know can still do the task manually, which means you might have to get them to do the task manually from time to time to stay in practice.<p>A dilemma I keep facing in practice is converting a text that someone else has produced in their own special way, like the ghastly cluttered HTML from a word processor. For example, do I attempt to use a Perl script to automatically convert some of the mark-up, or do I throw away all the mark-up and put back the italics by hand, with the risk of making a mistake? (If anyone knows of a good <i>configurable or modifiable</i> tool for converting cluttered HTML into sane HTML&#x2F;XML I&#x27;d be interested to hear about it.

As transistors get smaller, Moore&#x27;s Law predicts increases in the number of transistors on a chip, while Dennard scaling predicts decreasing power usage per transistor. For many years, Moore&#x27;s Law really just tracked with Dennard scaling; CPU on-die areas weren&#x27;t getting substantially larger (to my knowledge), but transistors were getting smaller and more efficient, so more could fit in a given area.<p>However, Dennard scaling also says that the power density of a transistor remains constant. As transistors became smaller, more of the die became occupied by transistors, causing more heat dissipation per unit area. After exhausting cooling options (think back to the TDP of those CPUs back in the late-90s&#x2F;early 2000s), Dennard scaling died in the mid-to-late 2000s because of thermal issues.<p>However, just because heat can&#x27;t be dissipated doesn&#x27;t mean CPU manufacturers won&#x27;t try to cram more and more transistors in a given area. As a result, a modern CPU will not use all its transistors at once because it would overheat, creating &quot;dark silicon&quot;. Once in that paradigm, the next logical design approach was prioritizing application-specific transistor clusters, the extent of which we&#x27;re now seeing.<p>While I generally agree with the authors, the key in these circumstances is to find ways to combine the fragments and make a better whole. Perhaps we&#x27;ll have a &quot;brain board&quot; attached to the motherboard, where sockets on the brain board allow user-specific processor cores to be installed. Not everyone needs an i9 or even an i7, and maybe not everyone needs advanced ML performance.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Koomey%27s_law" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Koomey%27s_law</a></div><br/><div id="37972833" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37972833" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Qwertious</span><span>|</span><a href="#37971914">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972099">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37972833">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37972833">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The dark silicon isn&#x27;t necessarily application-specific, it&#x27;s also used by duplicating a particular circuit and then  rotating which duplicate does the computing, so that the other areas have time to cool down a bit before they&#x27;re used again.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37972099" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37972099" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">karmakaze</span><span>|</span><a href="#37971914">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37973396">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37972099">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37972099">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I largely don&#x27;t blame the specialized processors, they exist to fill a need.

To me, the trend looks more like a shift from centralized to distributed models of computing. Which I think is also backed up by data processing tools like spark which distribute over multiple computers.<p>I saw a &quot;SQL process unit&quot; announced recently[1] which I guess <i>really is</i> a move towards specialized compute.

GPUs are still universal computers, they just use a different model with different performance characteristics (and applications, which stem from these performance characteristics and also inertia&#x2F;maturity of tooling) than CPUs. ASICs and specialized processors have been a thing for a long time and their application towards some &quot;new&quot; things like crypto, hft, and a handful of cloud optimizations is hardly a new trend when seen in the larger context of their being used all the time for now-boring, once also-new technologies like networking hardware and embedded applications.<p>I&#x27;d argue that the last three decades have actually had massive shifts towards more generalized and ubiquitous computing that may continue even further. First, with the introduction of PCs the computing landscape shifted away from bespoke hardware and software to more standardized plug-and-play hardware and software. With the internet, everybody got a middleware called a &quot;web browser&quot; that standardized UI development on a single computing model. With mobile computing, we got a more restricted model of userspace that standardized <i>what</i> applications could do and even <i>how</i> (app review, software signing) you could do it. Cloud did the same things to various extents to server software. Except for at the height of Windows&#x27; PC dominance, it&#x27;s never been easier to write software usable by such a large portion of the market,  and the absolute number of devices and users that applies to is probably an order of magnitude more than existed during peak-Windows.<p>Everybody in tech knows single-core cpu performance gains are slowing down and that the remaining incremental improvements will eventually end too, so what comes next is on peoples&#x27; minds. IMO this article is jumping the gun though - it&#x27;s still way too big an undertaking to use specialized computers (and I don&#x27;t count GPUs as these) for all but the largest scale or most performance sensitive use cases, as it&#x27;s always been.</div><br/><div id="37972456" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37972456" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">8note</span><span>|</span><a href="#37972118">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37972493">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37972456">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37972456">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The last two decades at least have moved towards a purpose built consumer device, with a general purpose server.<p>Gpus, CPUs, and Asics, are run by vendors rather than end customers.

Somewhere during the Industrial Revolution, I suppose. But I also think the default mode of “art as self expression” plays a big part, and that’s more early-mid 20th century.<p>Because when you read about creators during say, the Renaissance, you don’t really have this much of a dichotomy. Da Vinci worked on a paid portrait project, and then did unpaid experiments on his own which ended up being useful for his paid projects. It was a very loop-like thing and I think he would find the explicit framing of “I’m doing this to make money” and “I’m doing this purely to create something I want to create” as alien. Ditto for most forms of art in most parts of the world, prior to the late 19th century.<p>The solution, I think, might be to focus primarily on the craft and not on the end product. You see this a lot with early 20th century fiction writers that moved in and out of journalism, with the idea that they were becoming better at the craft of writing, not at creating a final product or “being a good fiction writer.”</div><br/><div id="40061709" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40061709" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">timwaagh</span><span>|</span><a href="#40061630">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40060951">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40061709">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40061709">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In the sense of the article artists have always done their best to cater to the taste of the people who might pay them.

I took up miniature painting and quite soon was at the level where people will pay you decent money to paint their miniatures for them. I started getting offers and accepted one, not for the money, probably just out of pride. It was complete hell, I hated the result and every minute I spent painting it.

I design STLs&#x2F;CAD models for 3D printing, scratch together terrain boards for people to play games on, paint miniatures any hour I get free, machine parts for various outfits and armaments, and spend hours fantasising about what universe I&#x27;m going to delve into next.<p>None of that would be possible if I didn&#x27;t monetise the process.

Having lots of fame doesn&#x27;t necessarily take from others.<p>The problem with a lot of fame is that the more of it you get, the more decided people will be. A good modern example would be Taylor Swift. Some people love her, many don&#x27;t even notice but some call her Taydolf Swifler.<p>Turns out you cannot get just the good, you have to have the bad come with it as well. Unless you are Weird Al, everybody loves him!</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40061341" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40061341" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shymaple</span><span>|</span><a href="#40061622">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40061275">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40061341">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40061341">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Awesome blog, I just loved the way wrote it.

They&#x27;re not stupidly charging into a Normandy because they have magnitude more radars, missiles, drones etc, enough to make sure TW won&#x27;t have much of theirs for long. TW is an island 16x smaller than UKR, much larger gap in MiC production vs PRC than UKR vs RU, and unabled to be resupplied via porous land borded by friendlies. TW also thoroughly covered by PRC ISR, including SAR to look through foliage, nearly every inch of which can be hit within 7 minutes with PRC rocketry. Less once PRC establishes persistent drone presence. It&#x27;s why all the recent analysis depends on TW buying enough time for US+co to enter picture.<p>The flip side of a contested amphib operation is an uncontested one, which is potentially siginifantly easier than land invasion because there&#x27;s no where for defenders to hide &#x2F; ambush. Crossing a shallow strait where subs can&#x27;t hide is probably easier than US plowing through Iraqi desert where defenders can at least pretend to put up defense by entrenching tanks &#x2F; digging trenches. It&#x27;s basically untested sailing if PRC destroys TW platforms that can hit back and lock down with air supremacy.<p>Also folks should look up TW river map, TW island is broken up into a series of bastions cut up by rivers where connections &#x2F; bridges can be severed and sections attacked piece meal. If PRC&#x27;s smart, they&#x27;ll destroy most of TW weapon platforms that can reach out into water, bombard a few km of map squares of landing site to dust, have drones shoot everything that moves 5km out to carve a landing zone that can&#x27;t be contested by large or small fires. If PRC smarter, they&#x27;d just blockade TW until world realize the only country with enough sealift to supply an island of 24m with food and water is PRC.<p>As for taking urban centres, look at how Israel is doing in Gaza with 20x population density than TW, theoretically urban combat is suppose to be slaughter vs attacker but if you indiscrimantly bomb and starve the population until they can&#x27;t put up organized high end fight, then it becomes a managable problem.

In one, the USSR would have won anyway, but the war would have lasted until 1946 or 1947 and it would have been even bloodier and more destructive.

(Odd to think that both Made in Germany and Made in Japan were once intended as warnings, not endorsements.)

Instead of Sunday church, I had to sit in school listening to senile veterans who had never seen frontline action (but had their chest full of anniversary medals) tell fairy tales how they single-handedly destroyed 50 Tiger tanks and 100 planes and then threw themselves in front of a machine gun nest to save their comrades, but stepped on a mine while doing so and lost both legs and crawled for a week back to their unit, successfully avoiding German patrols.<p>By the 1970s, the WWII mythology (of which a lot was entirely made up) had formed the core of the identity of &quot;Soviet people&quot; and an excuse for everything. The narrative of &quot;Soviet people as the victors of the WWII&quot; acted as a God-given right to stomp over other nations, because after all, only a fascist would resist the glorious Soviet people. The way we see Zelenskyy, a Jewish comedian, branded as a Nazi, and the war against Ukraine propagandized as a &quot;holy war against Nazism like our grandfathers fought&quot;, is an echo of that. Doesn&#x27;t make any sense unless you are familiar with the warped Soviet WWII mythology.<p>Aggressive militarism is common in post-war generations that grew up with the simplistic brainwashing. There was very little militarism in the generation that actually saw the war, because the Eastern front was morally an ambiguous place. One of my older relatives fought in the battle of Velikiye Luki. He always suspected that his unit had been placed on purpose into a very poor position to wipe them out with German hands for earlier insubordination. The unit got hit hard, he got wounded and was taken prisoner by Germans. Weeks or months later Soviets overran German positions and he was reunited.<p>As a punishment for being taken prisoner, he was moved to a penal battalion, because not fighting until your death was officially declared treason. Penal battalion was a lighter punishment. Those who had panicked were executed. Penal battalions were &quot;dumb meat&quot; used to dig or dismantle fortifications under enemy fire, and attack in first waves to identify machine gun nests and minefields. If they didn&#x27;t attack with enough enthusiasm, then the barrier troops placed behind them would open fire. (This practice lives on, as can be seen in Ukraine.) By some miracle, he survived it all. Most didn&#x27;t. You can imagine how keen he was to put on his uniform, parade around on the V-E day celebrations and listen to speeches how &quot;the Soviet people fought united like one man against Nazi invaders&quot;.<p>But those who were born much later have no issues acting like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bigstockphoto.com&#x2F;image-129051800&#x2F;stock-photo-orel-russia-may-9-2016%3A-celebration-of-71th-anniversary-of-the-victory-day-%28wwii%29-family-in-soviet-military-uniform-horizontal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bigstockphoto.com&#x2F;image-129051800&#x2F;stock-photo-or...</a><p>And not only do they cosplay in wartime uniforms, but they also the adopt the language of propagandized version of history that they&#x27;ve only witnessed from movies, and go around yelling how Russia is fighting Nazis again and &quot;we won&#x27;t stop before Berlin&quot;.<p>In a way, that&#x27;s even understandable. Pre-USSR history is beyond living memory, and USSR put a lot of effort into creating a cultural disconnect with pre-1917 Russia. Older history offers no strong identity, it&#x27;s just too far away to be relevant, it&#x27;s hard for modern urban population to identify with either the imperial nobility or with peasantry. Modern Russia offers no identity either beyond &quot;superyacht for me and poverty for thee&quot;. So what&#x27;s left? Only the militaristic propagandized USSR victory narrative that so many cling to, otherwise they&#x27;d have no identity at all, because that&#x27;s the only meaningful thing in the past century of Russian history.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40460573" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40460573" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vkou</span><span>|</span><a href="#40457891">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40460432">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40460526">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40460692">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40460573">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40460573">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The experience of WW2 left a deep psychological scar in Soviet, and later Russian statesmen, in that the lesson they took away from it was &quot;We need to be surrounded by buffer and satellite states, so that in a war, they will bleed, instead of us.&quot; It&#x27;s why they had absolutely zero patience for Georgia and Ukraine turning West-wards.<p>The scar it left on the population at large was &quot;They attacked us, and we suffered a <i>lot</i>, but then we <i>really</i> showed them.&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="40460692" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40460692" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Beijinger</span><span>|</span><a href="#40457891">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40460432">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40460573">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40460644">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40460692">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40460692">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Russia is a country with fluid borders and could not allow NATO troops and Rockets in Ukraine in the same way, as we could not accept rockets in Cuba.<p>The war has gone bad for the West now.

The scary part of a bad culture is you could fake it with past airplanes, but newer aircraft with lighter composite parts&#x2F;less parts (which then make each part&#x27;s integrity more important) there&#x27;s less wiggle room. Plus with composite, you can&#x27;t just do a final QA on things and ensure they are good. You have to QA each layer layup, glues, etc. An xray at the end can&#x27;t really give you the whole picture. I remember friends talking about how a certain (not Boeing) company was experimenting moving composite layup to China and what a cluster that was going to be. They would find razor blades embedded inside and all kinds of FOB crap on the final xrays, and this was on the pre-production showcase pieces.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40461942" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40461942" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lazide</span><span>|</span><a href="#40457617">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40461168">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40461300">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40460127">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40461942">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40461942">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Uh, war profiteers were a thing.<p>The general vibe was if you made a shitty product and it got your fellow countrymen killed, someone would track you down and make you pay for it though.</div><br/><div id="40462406" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40462406" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pc86</span><span>|</span><a href="#40457617">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40461942">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40460127">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40462406">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40462406">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I can think of worse systems, honestly.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40460127" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40460127" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vkou</span><span>|</span><a href="#40457617">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40457842">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40460484">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40457911">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40460127">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40460127">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Someone who successfully ran an organization that successfully delivered 70 4,000-tonne ships is probably more qualified to be put in charge of building an aircraft carrier, than someone who delivered 70 4,000-lb boats.<p>When it comes to material goods that dramatically vary in size (ships, planes, bombs), tonnage is usually a good first metric.</div><br/><div id="40462617" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40462617" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">NegativeLatency</span><span>|</span><a href="#40457617">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40460127">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40457911">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40462617">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40462617">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">4000 70lb boats?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40457911" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40457911" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">more_corn</span><span>|</span><a href="#40457617">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40457842">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40457680">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40457911">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40457911">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The ussr tried to do this.

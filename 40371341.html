The paper mostly doesn&#x27;t discuss economics, and indeed the only reason the research appears to have been done is because there is a regulatory requirement to have the wastewater analyzed (as opposed to, e.g., being done because the company thinks it&#x27;s possibly economically valuable).<p>Here&#x27;s the abstract of the research article:<p>&gt; Decarbonatization initiatives have rapidly increased the demand for lithium. This study uses public waste compliance reports and Monte Carlo approaches to estimate total lithium mass yields from produced water (PW) sourced from the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania (PA). Statewide, Marcellus Shale PW has substantial extractable lithium, however, concentrations, production volumes and extraction efficiencies vary between the northeast and southwest operating zones. Annual estimates suggest statewide lithium mass yields of approximately 1160 (95% CI 1140–1180) metric tons (mt) per year. Production decline curve analysis on PW volumes reveal cumulative volumetric disparities between the northeast (median = 2.89 X 107 L&#x2F;10-year) and southwest (median = 5.56 × 107 L&#x2F;10-year) regions of the state, influencing lithium yield estimates of individual wells in southwest [2.90 (95% CI 2.80–2.99) mt&#x2F;10-year] and northeast [1.96 (CI 1.86–2.07) mt&#x2F;10-year] PA. Moreover, Mg&#x2F;Li mass ratios vary regionally, where NE PA are low Mg&#x2F;Li fluids, having a median Mg&#x2F;Li mass ratio of 5.39 (IQR, 2.66–7.26) and SW PA PW is higher with a median Mg&#x2F;Li mass ratio of 17.8 (IQR, 14.3–20.7). These estimates indicate substantial lithium yields from Marcellus PW, though regional variability in chemistry and production may impact recovery efficiencies.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-024-58887-x" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-024-58887-x</a><p>Discouragingly, they say:<p>&gt; Further, extraction of Li from [wastewater] with high Mg&#x2F;Li mass ratios (&gt; 6), such as in [southwest Pennsylvania], is less efficient and expensive relative to low Mg&#x2F;Li extraction methods31. The low Mg&#x2F;Li composition of [northeast Pennsylvania] produced waters are comparable to salar brines, such as the Atacama brines of Chile, which are favorable to more economical and sustainable evaporative and distillation Li recovery methods. As a result, the higher Li yields from [southwest Pennsylvania] wells may be more costly to extract due to the lower concentrations and reduced treatment efficiencies due to the high Mg&#x2F;Li nature of these waters.<p>Also<p>&gt; Another important consideration in the total Li yield of a reservoir is the well production decline rate. A typical Marcellus well has an 80% decline in production of water within it’s the first 2 years (SI 4.). Sustainable production of Li at volumes reported in this manuscript require continuous addition of new Marcellus wells to supplant older, less productive wells.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40375785" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40375785" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jillesvangurp</span><span>|</span><a href="#40375429">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40374365">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40375785">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40375785">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Lithium is everywhere, mostly in lowish concentrations but there&#x27;s a lot of it. Way more than we&#x27;ll ever need. The trick is extracting it economically.<p>It comes in several forms. Brines and mineral deposits. Brines are a form of very salty water that form when most of the water evaporates. Chile conveniently has some salt planes where that has happened naturally. The dead sea is very rich in lithium too. The salt lakes in Utah have plenty of lithium. And apparently Cornwall has some underground brines that have high concentrations of lithium. And actually our oceans are full of lithium too; albeit in lowish concentrations. The reason it&#x27;s in water everywhere is because it leaches out from the earth crust. Those Cornish brines are the result of underground water being heated up geothermally and extracting lithium from granite.<p>Extracting lithium from brines or sea water can be done through evaporation or through filtering. There are some companies experimenting with filtering using nano technology. The advantage is that it is less energy intensive and you need way less clean water. And you can extract all sorts of stuff from these brines as they contain more than just lithium.<p>Mineral deposits in clays and rocks are also fairly common. There are viable lithium mines in many countries. Most of these are not being exploited because demand for lithium wasn&#x27;t that high until only a few years ago. Also, it used to be a relatively worthless waste material that you&#x27;d have to separate from copper in copper mining and that would then get dumped. It&#x27;s only fairly recently that lithium became valuable enough to bother to extract it.<p>And of course there&#x27;s a rapidly growing third source of lithium that&#x27;s very convenient to extract because it occurs in super high concentrations: all the products we make that have lithium in them. Like batteries. The lithium isn&#x27;t actually consumed or lost when these products reach their end of life. Lithium recycling is becoming a big industry. Right now the demand for lithium is still growing rapidly so only a fraction of the demand can be met through recycling. But in a few decades that should taper off. At that point most of our lithium needs could come from recycling.<p>There&#x27;s no shortage of lithium and there never will be. There are temporary dynamics where bringing new lithium production online simply takes time and money which is why prices were high a few years ago and are trending down lately. Actually, Bloomberg NEF recently published a report where they note that it seems we are heading for significant over production of lithium batteries. So, they are predicting price jobs and cancellations for a lot of the already committed investments on that front. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.bnef.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;china-already-makes-as-many-batteries-as-the-entire-world-wants&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.bnef.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;china-already-makes-as-many-batt...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

You need to check a ridiculously long number which represents your correspondent&#x27;s identity. It&#x27;s a 40 digit hex &quot;key fingerprint&quot; in the case of PGP and a 60 digit decimal &quot;safety number&quot; in the case of Signal. The difference is that Signal will cheerfully let the user have an insecure conversation before the user has verified the safety number. PGP makes it very difficult to fail in that particular way.<p>Signal has a separate safety number for each of your devices. So it makes it significantly harder to keep up with the user verification than with PGP which has a single key fingerprint per user.<p>So you could totally have a Signal identity party for exactly the same reasons as in the PGP case...</div><br/></div></div><div id="36857731" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36857731" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gorgoiler</span><span>|</span><a href="#36859434">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36856909">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36857731">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36857731">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>”Signal [pioneered] end-to-end encryption, a feature that WhatsApp turned around and copied from Signal.”</i><p>It wasn’t copied from Signal — at the protocol level, it <i>is</i> Signal:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signal.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;whatsapp&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signal.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;whatsapp&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="36858971" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36858971" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pharmakom</span><span>|</span><a href="#36857731">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36857890">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36858971">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36858971">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">WhatsApp is a closed source client, however.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36857890" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36857890" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wolverine876</span><span>|</span><a href="#36857731">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36858971">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36856909">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36857890">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36857890">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s part of Signal.</div><br/><div id="36857917" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36857917" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gorgoiler</span><span>|</span><a href="#36857731">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36857890">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36856909">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36857917">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36857917">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks, I’ve edited my comment to be clearer.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36856909" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36856909" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wolverine876</span><span>|</span><a href="#36857731">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36857719">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36856909">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36856909">[60 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The motivations that led to end-to-end encryption going mainstream lie far out on the political fringe.

He&#x27;s in the company of people like Thomas Jefferson who advocated the idea of <i>permanent revolution,</i> or that the rebellion against unjust government would never end. It would keep on happening through the ballot box. That is what democracy is. It is continuous small, non-violent revolutions against the government.<p>This is quite different from almost every prior form of social system in human history and it&#x27;s arguably the single largest idea which has contributed to lifting humanity out of poverty, war, oppression and misery (the scientific method is a very close competitor for that distinction, but without permanent revolution most scientists probably would have been burned at the stake or ignored).<p>There will always be people - the powerful, the entrenched, and maybe just the ill-informed, cowardly or intellectually lazy - who are terrified by the notion of permanent revolution, so to them it&#x27;s radical. (One wonders what camp this writer falls in, because usually journalists are well aware of this stuff, for many it&#x27;s their raison d&#x27;etre. Has this one taken a civics class? Do they believe Jefferson was arguing for anarchy? If so have they looked up the definition of that word in a dictionary?)<p>But despite the fears of those people, permanent revolution is the secret sauce modern society is built upon. Western civilization has a long line of prominent thinkers and historical examples which has led to this way of organizing ourselves. It is precious and it is still new and if we lose it we might never get it back again.<p>Anyway, I like the argument that Signal&#x27;s CEO makes here [1], which is that for virtually all of human history, privacy has been the default. The Constitution was written before the invention of the telegram. At that point in history you could always go into a room alone with someone else, have a conversation, and be reasonably assured that the conversation was private. Bugs and wires didn&#x27;t exist. Wiretapping didn&#x27;t exist, surveillance didn&#x27;t exist unless you had a third human physically present.<p>This makes privacy akin to a natural right, something we have always had, that we are entitled to by nature of being human. I&#x27;m of the view that the US needs a Constitutional amendment to protect it, and if any government seeks to deny it we should give them a reminder of what permanent revolution is and show them how it works.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=E--bVV_eQR0">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=E--bVV_eQR0</a></div><br/><div id="36859205" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36859205" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bombolo</span><span>|</span><a href="#36856909">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36857947">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36857948">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36859205">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36859205">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I remember, as a young italian studying about risorgimento, asking my mother why did the people in venice and milan not want to be under the austrian empire.<p>My mum told me &quot;it was an oppressive government&quot;.

What the correct anatomical names for their genitals - parts of their bodies - are, and 2. What is appropriate and inappropriate touching.<p>Now, the reason you want to teach these things to children, really as young as possible, is because it turns out there&#x27;s been quite a lot of child abuse cases where the defense case has rested on the fact that the victims don&#x27;t actually know the anatomical names of body parts. And as a result when you go to prosecute, you can&#x27;t conclusively prove from their testimony what was taking place, which it turns out has a habit of not convincing juries.<p>A child who only will sort of gesture to the lower part of their body, because they don&#x27;t know to volunteer the correct name of the body part, again, it turns out, leads to a court system which fails to apply justice properly, and also increases the general risk of abusers being able to operate because they convince their victims that everything that&#x27;s happening is &quot;okay&quot;.<p>Oh, and as it turns out, it&#x27;s also very hard to teach children how to identify this sort of thing without touching on the idea of their being multiple sexualities, because of course to teach something like appropriate and inappropriate touching you are quite likely (a) having to service questions from children who&#x27;ll ask why it&#x27;s not inappropriate for mommy and daddy, or (b) have to ask what about daddy and daddy or mommy and mommy and (c) who might struggle with the notion if it&#x27;s not correctly identified that the inappropriate thing will apply regardless of gender, and yet can also be appropriate for adults regardless of gender.<p>There&#x27;s a reason no one targeting primary school level physical education classes wants to say anything more then &quot;sex ed&quot; because, if they had to actually cover the content of what they were opposing, they&#x27;d rather look they were basically defending child predators.

Though Marlinspike is of course an anarchist), as &quot;far out on the political fringe.&quot; It says explicitly &quot;sticking to anarchism would imply an almost certain defeat.&quot; It implies Marlinspike agrees by dropping his quote on anarchist failure.<p>However, in the quoted article from Marlinspike, he <i>absolutely doesn&#x27;t</i> imply something being anarchist relegates it to failure. From his article <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moxie.org&#x2F;stories&#x2F;promise-defeat&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moxie.org&#x2F;stories&#x2F;promise-defeat&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; Anarchists are best known for their failures... And yet, far from trying to suppress these histories, these are the stories that anarchists recount. ... This is unusual. American Patriots do not speak, with a gleam in their eyes, of the incredible number of battles that George Washington lost (and he lost almost as much as anarchists do). ... The difference between the ways Nationalists and Anarchists talk about their histories seems critical.<p>&gt; Will there ever be a night — one glorious evening — when the world is won? Where suddenly civilization, the spectacle, class, racism, and patriarchy all simultaneously topple and remain in ruins? ... It seems unlikely to happen in one moment. ... The George Washingtons of the world offer success. This is based on &quot;realism&quot; and the logic of quantifiability, where it is necessary to make compromises, pass laws, and assert control. Because these are the things that can be won; this is where success is found.<p>&gt; Anarchy, by contrast, offers us defeat. ... Anarchists are such failures because, really, there can be no victory. Our desires are always changing with the the context of our conditions and our surroundings. What we gain is what we manage to tease out of the conflicts between what we want and where we are. ... Remember that success is a word used to measure. It describes dollars made, people counted, votes cast. In other words, it&#x27;s a swindle. The rejection of quantification, the emphasis on the role of the individual, is what makes anarchism unique.<p>By my interpretation, the article is pulling a George Washington, trying to quantify the success of anarchism-in-software, or perhaps private communication, to whether signal can &quot;go mainstream.&quot;<p>&gt; For an idealistic engineer to succeed, he will have to build something that is useful to many....  Signal’s success depends on maintaining its principled anarchist commitments while finding a wide-ranging appeal to the masses<p>No, Signal is already successful, it&#x27;s probably already achieved Marlinspike&#x27;s goal of actualizing a &quot;normal&quot; way to do end to end encrypted private communication (and made it easy for his friends to do so), and it&#x27;s absolutely achieved the general philosophical goal, through the popularity of the protocol, of giving people the chance to be in control of their surroundings.<p>If Signal &quot;fails,&quot; I guess by not growing its userbase more, the anarchist solution is to build again for whatever the new context is. The Win is there, we&#x27;d have the memories of Signal, it existed and let us maintain control of our surroundings if even only briefly.<p>Example:<p>&gt; Signal also doesn’t do a good job serving some of its core users. Activists and organizers deal with huge amounts of messages that involve many people and threads, but Signal’s interface lacks ways to organize all this information.<p>The solution is build again. Or, squat. If people can find a way to make Slack work to organize an antifascist protest, even if it means trading end to end encryption, then, that&#x27;s a win.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36857414" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36857414" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nathanaldensr</span><span>|</span><a href="#36857241">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36858207">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36857414">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36857414">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I did get a good chuckle at Wired&#x27;s implication that only right-wing fringe groups use or need E2EE.</div><br/><div id="36857507" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36857507" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">asynchronous</span><span>|</span><a href="#36857414">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36858207">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36857507">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36857507">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Apparently that is now a right wing fascist idea.

If you&#x27;re going to promote yourself to whistleblowers and activists, they need to know what data you&#x27;re collecting and what their risks are, but ever since Signal started collecting all this data they&#x27;ve refused to update their privacy policy which even now starts with &quot;Signal is designed to never collect or store any sensitive information.&quot; which is an outright lie. I&#x27;m pretty sure at this point it&#x27;s a dead canary warning people not to trust the service.

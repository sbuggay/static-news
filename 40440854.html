I also had a mother who loved me and a step-father who came into my life a bit later who cared, but they were dealing with some pretty big challenges of their own, including mental health, bad relationships, debt, children who were in and out of jail, and everything that comes with that. I do not like to spend too much time focused on race, but I am a white male, which was also an advantage.<p>At the time I was leveraging Khan Academy I was around 24, had distanced myself from the people I had grown up with who were not on a positive track. I also don&#x27;t know how, but somehow I got it in my head that finance was the universal language and that learning more about finance was the key to understanding more about the world. So I was very focused on that. I had no clue what economics was at the time, but once I learned about that, I was addicted. Finding topics like that deeply interesting is a HUGE advantage.<p>At that time, I was living on my own and had a stable job managing a department at Home Depot. I slept on an air mattress and didn&#x27;t have any money to speak of, but I had enough time on my hands that I could spend time at a coffee shop after work and on my days off working my way through the knowledge map on KA, starting with long division (which was humiliating) and learning how to do everything by hand, and then progressing from topic to topic. My goal was to not have to take a remedial math class at the local junior college (2 year colleges in the US). I spent months mastering basic math and worked my way to more advanced topics (1 million energy points on KA, not sure if that&#x27;s a lot but I&#x27;m still proud of it).<p>One last advantage I had was that I genuinely enjoyed learning and talking to people, and it showed. And I was young. So people were willing to take the risk. Many people were willing to give me a chance, encouragement, and their time as I was making my way through school. If I had a question or was interested in a career or topic, I would just ask someone if I could call them or shadow them, and most the time they would say yes. I had nothing to lose by asking, and was always amazed how often it worked.<p>I try to share this with others who were in my position so they know it is possible.<p>Thank you for asking.</div><br/><div id="40450477" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40450477" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">siamese_puff</span><span>|</span><a href="#40441616">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40446152">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40448007">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40450477">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40450477">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for the detailed reply, great story.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40448007" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40448007" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">free_energy_min</span><span>|</span><a href="#40441616">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40446152">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40450477">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40442007">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40448007">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40448007">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for all the detail, it’s inspiring!

Open(source?) AI models trail the leading closed models by 6-12 months, it&#x27;s hard to say they are only in the hands of the most powerful. The world is better than ever before, but it could be even better. The internet is filled with too many doomerist takes.</div><br/><div id="40443293" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40443293" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">delfinom</span><span>|</span><a href="#40441616">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40442447">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40442664">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40443293">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40443293">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Suicide rates are not at all-time highs, they were much higher during the World Wars and Great Depression.<p>Nah we already exceeded WW2.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;mental-health&#x2F;cdc-data-finds-suicides-reached-time-high-2022-rcna99327" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;mental-health&#x2F;cdc-data-finds-...</a><p>&gt; but available data suggests suicides are more common in the U.S. than at any time since the dawn of World War II.<p>&gt;U.S. suicides steadily rose from the early 2000s until 2018, when the national rate hit its highest level since 1941.<p>I guess we still haven&#x27;t exceeded the Great Depression rates but it&#x27;s really not that hard of a target</div><br/><div id="40443375" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40443375" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lolinder</span><span>|</span><a href="#40441616">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40443293">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40442664">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40443375">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40443375">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Suicide rates during WW1 were hovering around 20 per 100k.

It’s the example that will get Bill Gates’ attention and end up on the stage at TED, but it might not be representative of 90% of how people are affected by technology. It might, and the story of how videos will change how people relate to each other (what made Chris Anderson buy TED, what Salman Khan has built, what Grant Sanderson a.k.a, 3blue1brown has done). It is true, anecdotally. It is a fantastic, compelling, clear story. I love that story: video is the easiest way to share any practice; people watch, learn, practice, and get good at something no one in their village knew was possible. Hurray.<p>But when I trained as a statistician, i.e., epistemologically someone working for the state, I was told I was the opposite of a journalist: my job is not to tell stories that explain what a problem is. My job is to tell the boss how common that story really is. A story tells all the details to pull your emotions, and journalists (at the time, at least) were telling fact-check, double-verified stories. “Truth” wasn’t our goal.

One, there is no money in Ed.Tech. There is no money in Ed.Tech. There is no money in Ed.Tech. What little money there is goes to the obvious stuff like student records databases. Anything that requires an ongoing subscription fee is dead in the water. The only reason those stupid smartboards took off is because they make school boards look cool, they are a one time cost, and can be paid for with bonds (because they are a one time cost). Teachers don&#x27;t want them (projectors and document cameras are good, though). Ed.Tech is a wasteland of failed startups. Part of the problem is also that classic &quot;the people with the purchasing power are not the people who will be using the product&quot; problem.<p>Two, everyone outside of education thinks &quot;well has anyone just tried sitting down with the kids and talking to them&#x2F;explaining it to them?&quot; Yes, obviously. The problem isn&#x27;t that they are lazy, snot-nosed kids (that&#x27;s a problem well within an experienced teacher&#x27;s skill set to solve). The problem is what is the AI going to do with the kid says &quot;fuck you&quot; to the AI because they haven&#x27;t eaten since lunch the previous day (school is the only place they get regular meals), or they don&#x27;t even know what to ask because they are basically 4 grades behind in math, or the wifi is dead for the 8th time that month because the school board will never pay for infrastructure.<p>Three, what if the AI is just wrong and starts confusing the student? Even GPT-4 fabricates things all the time. Sure it can generally put words in grammatically correct order and is passible for writing no one is going to read anyway (like marketing emails). But the moment it requires actual domain knowledge all these AI models completely fall down because, again, they don&#x27;t actually understand anything, they just are really good at guessing what word comes next.</div><br/><div id="40442209" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40442209" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seidleroni</span><span>|</span><a href="#40441867">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40442011">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40442209">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40442209">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I understand the skepticism around AI in ed tech, and I think people have the right to be skeptical of this being portrayed as a &quot;cure all&quot;.

I was never a great student because I had trouble focusing in class, but if I had this to guide me through my homework, I believe I would have been a much better student. Looking at math homework and having no idea how to even start and no resources to help is very different than looking at the problem and working with AI to help you understand how to attack the problem. Sure, you can&#x27;t turn every single kid into a math wiz, but I think there is a real possibility that this will help almost every kid become <i>better</i> at math than they would have.

It teaches us, primarily, how to get one over on the system, how to look for loopholes and shortcuts. It creates a culture of corruption, of looking for approval from institutions in order to move up in life.<p>What does a world where anyone can learn anything they like for free very easily look like? Well undoubtedly it looks like a place where a lot of people don&#x27;t learn much, because they have no interest in learning. But it also looks like a place where people who are interested in learning can and do learn endlessly if they like, the <i>opportunity</i> for anyone to get educated to a degree reserved for elites that most of us could only dream of even two decades ago is upon us. Writing the paper won&#x27;t be about proving you wrote the paper to some authority figure, because it&#x27;s no longer proof that you wrote it. Writing the paper will become about helping yourself understand something you want to understand.<p>So to your question, what is the future of proving that I know something, the future is you can&#x27;t prove you know something, there&#x27;s nobody to prove it to and you know things because you want to know things, because you recognize the value on knowing them beyond &quot;this piece of paper qualifies me for a job.&quot; The future is the truth that we have been pretending isn&#x27;t true for a century: that no matter what you try to do, those that want to learn will learn and those that don&#x27;t won&#x27;t, and their lives will be what they are on their own merit and of their own volition.<p>If you want to call yourself educated, the only person you need to be proving that to is yourself. We have entered a world of information post scarcity, which necessarily comes with post scarcity of noise, distraction and disinformation. The competition to understand things and the benefit that comes with understanding things will get stiffer, but access to that competition will become egalitarian. There will be a great divide among people: those that follow the noise of the day and those that continue to learn freely of their own volition.</div><br/><div id="40448673" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40448673" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vaidhy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40441867">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40443944">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40444176">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40448673">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40448673">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Right now, education focuses on getting people through the system so they can attain a credential.

And that sucks. There are probably many others with bad stories as well. I&#x27;m deeply involved with my kids education and can only imagine how much that sucked.<p>Second, we can&#x27;t solve everything at once. Hungry kids, bad parenting, all that will take time, and may never be resolved. I wish it could be, but honestly, it will take time - probably a long, long time.<p>Third, he&#x27;s building for the future. Richer schools (both private and public) will get this first, typical schools will get it next, and poor schools (both administratively poor and monetarily poor) will get it eventually. This is where that great quote applies - &quot;The future is here, it&#x27;s just not evenly distributed&quot; - and boy will it apply to education. So much so that some parents will feel like they are left in the stone age by comparison.<p>Fourth, an anecdote. I do volunteer work for an education-related non profit. I learned during covid that HISD (Houston school district) couldn&#x27;t easily move to online learning because 30% of their students did not have internet access at home. Thirty percent!!! I was blown away. Still am. But it&#x27;s gotten much better, and we&#x27;ve evolved. Does it still suck? Yes, undoubtedly (HISD was taken over by the state, if that tells you how big their problems are).

That’s because we finally have a way to give every student the kind of personalized learning, support, and guidance that’s historically been out of reach for most kids in most classrooms. As Sal puts it, “Getting every student a dedicated on-call human tutor is cost prohibitive.” AI tutors, on the other hand, aren’t.<p>Personalisation fails for a simple reason - people don&#x27;t really want to learn.<p>Classes work because the teacher can inspire (or at least push), and there&#x27;s peer pressure to learn (or at least keep up with the herd). I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a dozen or so self-taught Python or Rust programmers here who will loudly refute what I&#x27;m saying, and point out that they were perfectly capable of learning something they were very interested in, but I bet a lot of them would also like to learn a foreign language or quantum physics and haven&#x27;t gotten that done.<p>AI will fail for the same reason Youtube, DVDs, video cassettes, radio lessons, and phonographs all failed to be a revolution. If you want to learn something, and have the motivation, then reading the textbook is easily good enough (for theoretical subjects) and for less theoretical subjects you barely need a textbook, just lots of practice.<p>Yes, you can probably learn a little tiny bit faster with AI, if you (or someone staring over your shoulder) have the motivation to play some AI learning game rather than a more fun-optimised game that&#x27;s purely about having fun, but it&#x27;s a small optimisation.</div><br/><div id="40442715" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40442715" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">beryilma</span><span>|</span><a href="#40441682">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40452077">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40442715">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40442715">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Personalisation fails for a simple reason - people don&#x27;t really want to learn.<p>Students&#x2F;people who are interested in learning a particular subject are doing just fine learning it from already available material, be it books, videos, MOOCs, etc. They may or may not use AI, but AI won&#x27;t make a huge difference for these type of people.<p>For people who are not interested in learning, AI won&#x27;t do sh*t. Because the problem is not that they don&#x27;t have a tutor available to them; the problem is that they don&#x27;t have motivation to learn. I am not being judgemental here: it is perfectly understandable, for example, why a poor kid may not have motivation to learn.<p>A few years ago, MOOCs were touted as the next best thing to democratize education and make it available to underserved populations around the world. This did not happen. Some research shows that MOOCs are mostly used by an already-educated group of people who are interested in further learning.

The internet is all the resources you will ever need. Sure AI could augment this a little. Maybe it could re-explain something you can&#x27;t quite wrap your head around. The problem is that kids know that the education system isn&#x27;t even kind of preparing them for what&#x27;s to come. Knowledge work and trades couldn&#x27;t be further from what public school prepares you for.  Having a teacher for every kid wouldn&#x27;t change this. The problem is so fundamental, and the solution is so destructive that we can&#x27;t just tack on one more thing to &quot;fix&quot; education.<p>Learning comes from doing, augmented with reflection.  Public Schools don&#x27;t ever do either of those things. The closest you ever get to doing anything that another human could want is building something in shop class.

You’re right that instruction methods have evolved over time to be less teacher-centered. This might be considered an improvement. That said, good teachers who implement these methods well are mostly in good school districts (no surprise).<p>2. The issue comes more in secondary ed, imho. The issue is with the curriculum. In 1900, only about 4% of HS-aged kids went to HS. These folks were the elite, and the HS education was preparing them for a 2-year or 4-year program after HS (again, mainly for elites). The curriculum that existed then is largely the same one we have today, and it’s completely absurd. We get odds things like lower level math (non-calculus track) basically being re-heated middle school math. We get four required years of “English” that focuses on grammar (often taught in a dubious, prescriptive manner) and literature largely written by dead people (when there is plenty of good modern lit and poetry to learn about&#x2F;through). We have science education that largely does not train students to engage scientific thinking (again, except maybe for the honors classes at good schools). To summarize, we have a curriculum designed for college-bound elites that has been ungracefully shoe-horned into a one-size-fits-all train wreck.<p>All of the curricular issues are solvable, but it there will need to be a critical mass of support in local communities to be able to implement change through the inertia of the existing system of education administrators and (to some extent) teachers.<p>Until this happens, imho it’s best to look at secondary ed as very expensive child care for the vast majority of students, with the exception being in better school districts (usually where the elites or elite-ambitious live).<p>Primary ed is ok… the main learning outcomes that folks need are the three Rs. Some folks, especially on HN, seem to think scientific thinking should be included. They’re not wrong, but that only flies in schools&#x2F;communities of elites.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40443614" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40443614" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">balls187</span><span>|</span><a href="#40442835">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40451239">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40443614">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40443614">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My son is a second grader who is behind on his english reading and writing.

I&#x27;d argue that the very thing that made Khan Academy successful in the first place was not &quot;accessible education&quot; or &quot;cost prohibitive&quot; practices, but <i>Sal&#x27;s human attention to the students needs and all the amazing content he created</i>.<p>Thousands of people will pick up from this article that AI is the solution to the education, while in reality it is people like Sal who are the actual solution, with YouTube, AI and other tech just being the tools to help scaling human talent.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40444965" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40444965" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">couchdb_ouchdb</span><span>|</span><a href="#40442853">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40447281">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40444965">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40444965">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I am currently using ChatGPT 4.0o to help me learn Japanese.

I take photos of the pages with my phone, then use ChatGPT as my language partner to work through the problem sets.

Students motivated to learn will do great with it. Others will need AI to really push them to learn, and it&#x27;s not clear to me how that will work. Many students just want to know what they have to submit to get a grade. Spending 20 minutes chatting with AI about a topic might be a good learning activity, but incentivizing that with grading will be tricky.<p>I&#x27;ve sometimes wondered when I&#x27;ll get called to the Dean&#x27;s office because a student died in class because breathing wasn&#x27;t specifically listed as a grading requirement on the syllabus.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

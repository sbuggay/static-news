Google didn&#x27;t miss <i>anything</i> with MapReduce and TensorFlow. So what that Hadoop and PyTorch came out and became open source favorites? It&#x27;s not like that had any significant negative business impact to Google. On the flip side, Google&#x27;s open sourcing of Kubernetes <i>did</i> win the container orchestration &quot;war&quot; (RIP Mesos), and it&#x27;s not like that brought them any great benefits.<p>I agree with another commenter, where Google missed the boat was cloud. Ironically, AppEngine came out pretty early in 2008, but its original incarnation was much too &quot;Google-specific&quot;. Google just didn&#x27;t have the corporate DNA to understand that, sure, Datastore can allow infinite horizontal scalability, but most people don&#x27;t want to deal with eventual consistency, and they just want a plain-old SQL DB. It took Google a long time to come around to understand how other businesses use their infrastructure.</div><br/><div id="37318384" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37318384" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Animats</span><span>|</span><a href="#37315906">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37316167">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37318384">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37318384">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">MapReduce helped solve a huge internal problem for Google - how to update the index dynamically. Originally, index updates were batch jobs that took days to run. But MapReduce isn&#x27;t the solution to that problem. It&#x27;s just the orchestration for the algorithm. It was figuring out how to partition that matrix inversion that was the hard part.<p>Most of Google&#x27;s problems in B2B reflect that the organization has little concept of customer service, in the sense of serving customers. It&#x27;s not the technology.<p>The current problem with AI for Google is that the good stuff costs a bit too much to give away with search. That problem may be solved, or evaded. Most searches or questions don&#x27;t need a large language model. I expect to see systems where you ask a question, and if it&#x27;s hard, you get something like &quot;That&#x27;s a hard question.

Or, specifically, all the bits of product that aren&#x27;t R&amp;D.  MapReduce, Tensorflow and Kubernetes are all examples of technical successes that Google has spawned.  None is a product.

It&#x27;s not the tech; big G can go toe to toe with Amazon and MS on that.  It&#x27;s that enterprises want contracts and support and relationship managers and all that stuff.  That just doesn&#x27;t seem to be in Google&#x27;s DNA.  Unless they can adress that, they&#x27;re not going to win with big org customers.<p>They <i>might</i> win the startups - where the customers are themselves techies who are OK with self supporting, looking up Stackoverflow, asking ChatGPT, etc.  But unless they can address the people angle, I don&#x27;t see Vertex gaining meaningful traction against Amazon or OpenAI&#x2F;MS.</div><br/><div id="37319094" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37319094" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ctippett</span><span>|</span><a href="#37315906">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37318949">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37316167">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37319094">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37319094">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Make no mistake, Google has a legion of Account Managers, Customer Engineers, TAMs – you

The MR, Bigtable, and GFS papers were written to attract software engineers to work on infra at google, to share some useful ideas with the world (specifically, the distributed shuffle in mapreduce, the bloom filter in bigtable, and the single-master-index-in-ram of GFS), and finally, to &quot;show off&quot;.</div><br/><div id="37313922" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37313922" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ithkuil</span><span>|</span><a href="#37313298">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37313826">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37318665">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37313922">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37313922">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I remember the joke CL that deleted mapreduce from google3, even got an approval from Urs IIRC</div><br/><div id="37315715" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37315715" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dieortin</span><span>|</span><a href="#37313298">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37313922">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37318665">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37315715">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37315715">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As an outsider, what is a “CL” and who is Urs?</div><br/><div id="37315842" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37315842" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dmoy</span><span>|</span><a href="#37313298">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37315715">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37315740">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37315842">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37315842">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">CL is changelist, the perforce equivalent of e.g. a git pull request (sorta).<p>Even though Google codebase broke perforce scaling long ago and doesn&#x27;t use it anymore, the replacement still borrows a lot of perforce names and sort of API.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37315740" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37315740" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ebcase</span><span>|</span><a href="#37313298">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37315715">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37315842">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37315757">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37315740">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37315740">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Urs_H%C3%B6lzle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Urs_H%C3%B6lzle</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37315757" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37315757" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ReactiveJelly</span><span>|</span><a href="#37313298">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37315715">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37315740">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37318665">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37315757">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37315757">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Probably Change List <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;25716920&#x2F;what-does-cl-mean-in-a-commit-message-what-does-it-stand-for" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;25716920&#x2F;what-does-cl-me...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37318665" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37318665" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">calderwoodra</span><span>|</span><a href="#37313298">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37313826">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37313922">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37314831">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37318665">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37318665">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are you sure you&#x27;re not thinking of flume?

Similarly Spark was originally meant to run on HDFS but became a lot more popular once it started being able to use things like s3 as its storage layer and public cloud VMs for compute (which was a similar transition to GFS-&gt;Colossus).<p>In terms of usability the other two main innovations were to make it easier to program a workflow that chained MapReduce operations (without an intermediate, expensive, blocks-until-all-nodes-done disk write step, nor a jankass orchestration engine) and subsequently to declaratively specify the desired output (eg SQL) without requiring the user to specify the implementation.<p>They’ve since added more stuff like streaming, ML, whatever, but the biggest change from 1st to 2nd gen is really in the data topology.</div><br/><div id="37316765" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37316765" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">moandcompany</span><span>|</span><a href="#37313298">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37316658">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37317221">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37316765">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37316765">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yep.

While all of these companies certainly have challenges with not-invented-here (&quot;NIH&quot;) syndrome, and lots of internal, proprietary tools, as a software engineer at one of these three, odds are you will use and touch more commercial and open-source technologies than you would at Google. Google itself still struggles with having teams and projects use GCP for internal work versus Borg&#x2F;etc; and there are plenty of valid reasons why Google teams don&#x27;t use GCP.<p>The proprietary tech &quot;island&quot; issue is a non-trival concern when you need to hire new software engineers from industry&#x2F;outside and ramp-up time with some of these systems may be 6-months or even greater; today Alphabet&#x2F;Google is at around 200k+ FTE, and you aren&#x27;t going to be able to find many engineers outside that have experience with Borg&#x2F;Flume&#x2F;Spanner&#x2F;Monarch&#x2F;etc. Likewise when you are an experienced Google software engineer looking to work elsewhere, you need a translation map to figure out what tools outside are similar to the ones from inside.<p>Google&#x27;s proprietary tech island has its legitimate reasons for existing, and when people say &#x27;xyz&#x27; commercial&#x2F;open-source thing is &quot;better,&quot; they often mean it is better for their problem at hand.<p>At Google, a decade-plus ago many of the problems it had to solve were problems that few other organizations had, such as large-scale data processing (to be made cost-efficient on commodity hardware), and it needed to create a number of tools&#x2F;platforms as solutions such as Map Reduce&#x2F;GFS.<p>Many of these tools and platforms were discussed via papers, and inspired open-source work. In the Map Reduce case, it changed how Apache Hadoop itself took shape, and the lessons from all of these later led to things like Apache Spark.<p>The idea of losing a battle can only be applied with the benefit of hindsight, and many of the Google examples given were created at a time where there were no peers, nor at that time was Google interested in selling these things as commercial products at the time (i.e. GCP vs AWS vs Azure); it built these things according to its unique internal needs that few other organizations could relate to.

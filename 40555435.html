At my current job, I was working in a high rise office building with sixty-six floors.<p>The operating system computer was a JC8520, which was running a version of MS-DOS. All commands had to be typed in correctly or nothing would happen. While operating the plant, several commands had to be entered every shift, since the owners didn&#x27;t purchase a very automated package.<p>In the interview for the data center job, I was asked if I had any experience with Windows. I didn&#x27;t understand the question because I wasn&#x27;t aware they were talking about a computer operating system! So, I replied at the office building I worked in there were outside contractors who cleaned the windows.<p>After my reply all seven of the interviewers were all grinning and I was aware I said something they weren&#x27;t looking for. One of the men politely told me Windows  was a computer operating system. My reply was, &quot;Oh, I see.&quot;<p>When I returned home I told my wife what happened and we shouldn&#x27;t get our hopes up. To my utter shock, a week later I was offered the job, which I took and after some training, learned something I didn&#x27;t know before.</div><br/><div id="40559998" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40559998" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">remoquete</span><span>|</span><a href="#40558965">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40560179">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40559998">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40559998">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; While operating the plant, several commands had to be entered every shift<p>That reminds of the bunker from Lost.</div><br/><div id="40560219" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40560219" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Cyphase</span><span>|</span><a href="#40558965">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40559998">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40560179">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40560219">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40560219">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thankfully IRL no planes were at risk of falling out of the sky, I assume.</div><br/><div id="40560253" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40560253" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">HenryBemis</span><span>|</span><a href="#40558965">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40560219">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40560179">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40560253">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40560253">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Definitely not the ones with the bouncy sound..</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40560179" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40560179" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jonplackett</span><span>|</span><a href="#40558965">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40559998">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40559734">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40560179">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40560179">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You must have absolutely nailed the rest of the interview!</div><br/><div id="40560298" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40560298" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bitwize</span><span>|</span><a href="#40558965">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40560179">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40559734">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40560298">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40560298">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It was the early nineties.

In fact, there&#x27;s a good chance if I don&#x27;t fix the database schema now, it will never be done.</div><br/><div id="40559253" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40559253" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">a_t48</span><span>|</span><a href="#40557571">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40559143">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40557962">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40559253">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40559253">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Exactly.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40557962" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40557962" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chrisbrauns</span><span>|</span><a href="#40557571">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40557662">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40558429">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40558602">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40557962">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40557962">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It was Gary Bernhardt in this talk: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=sCZJblyT_XM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=sCZJblyT_XM</a></div><br/><div id="40560418" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40560418" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jwilk</span><span>|</span><a href="#40557571">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40557962">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40558602">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40560418">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40560418">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">More Gary&#x27;s talks:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.destroyallsoftware.com&#x2F;talks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.destroyallsoftware.com&#x2F;talks</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40558602" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40558602" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">randomdata</span><span>|</span><a href="#40557571">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40557662">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40557962">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40558659">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40558602">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40558602">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; since it had no unit test</i><p>But aren&#x27;t unit tests the half-assed solution?

Some might say it&#x27;s because of the network - that makes microservices messy and so on. But I dont think so, from what I remember plan9 (the os, successor of unix), Rob Pike wanted to make it so that there is no difference between an object being on the network or outside the network. In unix philosophy, things have the same interface, it&#x27;s easy to communicate. For microservices it would be REST api which is unique to network things. I honestly see a direct link between these ideas. Unix here is projecting a much nicer, simpler image but nonetheless they seem to overlap a lot. The result in both cases seems to be a hard to debug network of small utilities working together.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40560146" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40560146" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ywain</span><span>|</span><a href="#40557571">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40559715">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40560593">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40560165">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40560146">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40560146">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not the person you&#x27;re replying to, but here&#x27;s my take: even though the two look conceptually similar, Unix programs are just a lot simpler. All programs run on the same machine, they read their input, execute, produce output which is piped to the next program, and terminate. Want to change something? Change one of the programs (or your command line), run the command again, that&#x27;s it.<p>Microservices are a lot more complicated. You&#x27;ll need to manage images for each of the services, a fleet of servers on which the services will be deployed, an API for services to communicate together, etc. In many (most?) cases, a monolith architecture will be a lot simpler and work just fine. Once you reach the scale at which you&#x27;d actually benefit from a microservice architecture (most companies won&#x27;t ever reach this scale), you can start hiring devops and other specialists to deal with the additional complexity.<p>What actually gets hate, I think, is not microservices themselves, but the fact that microservices are often used in contexts where they are completely unnecessary, purely because of big tech cargo culting.</div><br/><div id="40560214" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40560214" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Karrot_Kream</span><span>|</span><a href="#40557571">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40560146">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40560165">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40560214">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40560214">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We only think of Unix programs as simple because we have many more abstractions nowadays.

The idea that a program should be well behaved, should accept things an inputs, should push outputs, and should have a virtual address space are actually huge abstractions over what could just be a block of code run on a spare OS.

I watch the teachers in my kids&#x27; schools and they do a great job and I think &quot;that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re teachers and I&#x27;m a lawyer.&quot;  I watch a great play and I think &quot;that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re actors and I&#x27;m a lawyer.&quot;  I hope I&#x27;m as good at my work as they are at theirs.  But I can&#x27;t excel at what they do.

Similarly to the poster above, I went from top of the class to middle of the pack in university, and in part that was because I didn&#x27;t focus on the academics, instead working on student projects that were valuable but didn&#x27;t improve my grade. But there were people working on those projects that contributed more to those projects than I did, also came top of the class, were substantially more athletic than me (actually competing vs essentially no exercise), more social (also not super hard, but still), and somehow also got more (or at least better) sleep than me.

It was a log cabin and the logs were colder than ice cubes and stayed that way over the ten days we were there. In the center was a pot belly wood stove. A foot away from it, the temp was 50. Ten feet away it was 20. Cold.<p>There was a wood cooking stove and a second older wood cooking stove. We decide to start using the second wood cooking stove for more heat. There was one problem, the stove would smoke. My friend climbed on the roof and cleared the snow away, and we tried to seal leaks but it kept smoking.<p>One day I came back from drilling a hole in the ice to get water - through 24 inches of ice. I noticed something funny.<p>When I opened the door, the old wood cook stove stopped smoking. When I closed the door the stove started smoking. I stood there trying to understand. Opening and closing the door over and over. Open the door, no smoke. Close the door, smoke.  I started to wonder why it would stop smoking and then it hit me.<p>The cabin was on fire. When the door was open it got enough air to burst into flame. No smoke. When the door was closed it smoked. I still remember standing there opening and closing the door. Over and over. What an idiot. But I learned something.<p>We looked underneath the cook stove. The reason there was a newer one wood stove became clear.  The firebox on the old stove had rusted through. So coals from the wood were falling through the rusted out part onto the wood floor.  We got a fire extinguisher and sprayed it. Then got piles of snow and packed it under there too.<p>That old adage &quot;where there&#x27;s smoke there&#x27;s fire&quot;.

There is a special security team that lives at the defense intelligence agency primarily but also they have them for NSA and other organizations, that would do white hat penetration tests on secure information facilities, like all the ones that I was responsible for (I had a half dozen physical locations to manage).<p>One of these tests was during a large scale exercise. Two civilians who had perfect credentials, were trying to access our primary headquarters SCIF. At the time I think I was managing a top-secret briefing preparation and so I delegated access control, and interrogation of these two people to another Lieutenant, as well as the actual special security officer who was an E6.<p>They had previously tried to penetrate all of the other places on base, but failed.<p>The process for getting access to a SCIF if you are not housed there is that that you send a visit request from your home security office to the visiting security office which will then transfer clearance details so that you can understand what access levels to give these people.<p>About a month before their visit, there was a new guidance released saying that all visit requests had to have a digital requst in 100% of cases whereas are previously you could just print out your details and bring them with you, The special security officer would then look them up in a system (I wonât name), and then itâs up to the security office whether they give you access or not.<p>My Special Security officer and my lieutenant came to me and said they have everything that they need per the requirements that we were operating under, and that they were comfortable giving them access to a terminal where they could do what they needed to do.<p>I said âthatâs perfectly fine however LT I want you to sit behind them basically and make sure they donât walk off or do anything more than Iâm giving them access to.â<p>So for like 30 minutes, we had two people in our SCIF who logged onto JWICS, weâre being actively monitored and were able to send an email and then logged off and left.<p>The next week, my commander asked me to go to a meeting and the penetration team briefed to the whole base how they got into all these places including my SCIF and one other facility<p>The good thing was, we were basically written up with flying colors, and this was the hardest possible test that they were able to get through and so everybody was generally happy with us.<p>This was really just one of those things where it was a specific detail that we were not up-to-date with but didnât have any major defense in depth risks.</div><br/><div id="40558324" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40558324" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bdangubic</span><span>|</span><a href="#40556697">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40557325">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40558324">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40558324">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">soâ¦ manyâ¦ acronymsâ¦ is this a thing in military like there are million acronyms everyone uses??! :)</div><br/><div id="40558461" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40558461" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AndrewKemendo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40556697">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40558324">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40557325">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40558461">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40558461">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yup!

My senior came running back to find me and saw me standing near the turnstile helplessly. I told him it&#x27;s not going up, I swiped already. He told me, you need to PUSH IT to move forward, it doesn&#x27;t automatically goes up! I guess I had the Delhi experience in mind where the turnstile goes up automatically.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40557075" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40557075" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kennu</span><span>|</span><a href="#40560280">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40557377">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40557075">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40557075">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Back when cloud computing was mostly for early adopters, I used to work on many customer projects at the same time, or in quick succession, in an architect&#x2F;developer role. It was great as long as the projects worked out as planned and I could deliver a working system in a few weeks or months and move on to the next project. It was easy to become a little overconfident until I faced unexpected difficulties in some projects and the tight schedules started to fall apart.<p>For instance, I learned that you should never trust what a customer says about reusing their existing code without actually looking at the code first. You can end up having to rewrite the code, and then have a dissatisfied customer, because the new code doesn&#x27;t have the same problems as the old code and produces different results. It doesn&#x27;t matter which one is correct, since the old code was already used for years and everything is based on it.<p>So the humbling experience has been not to become too optimistic and overconfident after some successful projects. You will become the bad guy if you over-promise and can&#x27;t deliver, even if you feel someone else is actually to blame. Every time you start something new, you have to check for yourself what the requirements and conditions truly are before accepting a deadline. And you can never trust the documentation or description of an existing system without also looking at the actual system.</div><br/><div id="40557241" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40557241" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smeej</span><span>|</span><a href="#40557075">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40557377">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40557241">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40557241">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve mostly been on the &quot;user&quot; end of buggy internal company code.

Every time you linked a program, the binary would be different. Functionally the same, but they wouldn&#x27;t compare byte for byte.

   439 bytes free

The &quot;bytes free&quot; were that unused and uninitialized memory.<p>The linker was a mess of spaghetti assembly code, and it was a real pain to find and fix all of the places where it failed to clear memory.<p>My manager knew what a hassle this task was, and he was a chill dude.

Sadly, it heavily skewed towards external validation. I was on the chunkier side for a lot of my childhood and into high school. Joined wrestling and stayed with it. Lot the weight, grew, and gained muscle. Also started to get a lot of attention from the opposite sex. That, with the external validation issue, leaned into it and just had fun. It became something that I just did.<p>I had been a personal trainer for awhile when I got a new client. An eighty something professor who taught Danteâs Inferno, Italian, collected degrees, and was actively pursuing some field in psychology (forget what one).<p>For about 6 months, weâd work out on Saturday mornings and heâd always ask of my adventures since we last saw each other. Iâd regale him and that was that.<p>One morning after going though it all, he asked, âwhat else is there?â or something. Whatever it was, it stopped me in my tracks. I couldnât answer. That question hit me harder than a freight train.<p>At that moment, I realized there was a massive issue with myself. I wanted a change, but a) didnât know what to change, b) how to change, 3) how to feel about myself. We continued to work on him and his goals, which was to bench 135 safely. He got to his goal. ;). He also helped me to get to mine, which was to focus more on internal validation and be happy with self.<p>I was able to shift from heavily skewed external validation to external validation probably being now around 20%-30% and the rest being internal.<p>Because of him, I was able to embrace myself and lean into the information seeking snd knowledge gaining person I am today and get to a level that someone with my academic background should not be at.<p>A quote that I came up with many years ago that explains all of this and the transformation I had, âyouâre not going to change until the pain of change is less than the pain of staying the same.â<p>One other one too. From him, the professor.  I have severe adhd and can read the same sentence 50 time and not remember what I just read, if itâs not something Iâm highly interested in. I came to him and told him that itâs so damn boring and itâs just a fight to sit there and attempt to read it.<p>He gave me a mind shift: instead of thinking how itâs important or exciting to you, try to imagine why the author of it thought it was so exciting, to where they spent their career learning about that subject.

I bought some course by someone who in hindsight I&#x27;m certain made more money off selling courses than they ever did off of day-trading. I got my account setup, had enough funds to allow me to trade short timeframes (I forget what this was called but there is a rule where you need X amount of money before you can do more than Y trades in Z timeframe) and was excited to trade short and long equities. I had some success and some failure with fees effectively eating my profits. I used to do my scans at night to know what I was planning to look at upon market open where there tends to be a lot of volatility and (I&#x27;m sure if you knew what you were doing; I didn&#x27;t) opportunity. One morning I was certain that Boeing was going to plummet so I shorted a very small number of shares and was glued to the screen. I placed my market order, it hit, then Boeing immediately ripped upwards. Now, if you&#x27;ve traded you know that the difference between going long and going short is that going long you can lose everything you invested, going short you can lose everything you own. For about 3 seconds - my heart pounds when I think about this - I hemorrhaged money. I was down a couple thousand dollars before I could hit the key to cover the short at a huge loss (thinking back I <i>know</i> I had a stop loss but am not sure why it didn&#x27;t trigger. Presumably it was a limit order and the price jumped the bid pre- and post- spike; I don&#x27;t know). Right as I went to cover the stock dropped back down, as quickly as it shot up, and I ended up making maybe $500 on the trade. My last ever trade. I withdrew my funds and closed my brokerage account immediately thereafter.<p>There were so many learnings it&#x27;s hard to know which is the most important, but I know that I am not cut out to day trade, I know that shorting is a fools game for (most?) non-institutional investors, I know that if it sounds too good to be true (&quot;day trading will make you rich!&quot;) then it is and I know that even people of regular intelligence (I&#x27;d be average give or take) can do really stupid things.

The rest of my portfolio was doing ok as well.<p>As META kept going down I kept adding to my position (meaning shorting more), and then it came back up.

Then he announced to the crowd that he had a surprise for me (and turns out, to the entire company), that he had changed the configuration to write the transaction log to a removable drive. Then, in the middle of the demo he proceeded to pop the drive. Our careful demo script had got Putin&#x27;d. I went numb, our marketing manager nearly had a coronary.<p>He then announced that if it were indeed enterprise quality, the system should recover once the disk is put back in again. It freakin&#x27; did; the system worked!! He got a laugh out of the crowd that if it survives a demo it would survive failures in production, esp. when one goes off-script. He said that we had spent months and months in careful design and implementation and we have no business writing the word &#x27;reliable&#x27; in our marketing literature if we didn&#x27;t believe it in our core. The crowd lapped it up.<p>It was a huge humbling and learning moment for me. Although I was the primary implementor of that system, I didn&#x27;t nearly have enough faith in it as he did.  In one instant, I realized all the practices he&#x27;d been drilling into our team from the first day,  the insistence on creating elaborate mock frameworks to induce faults, embracing the idea that if something could go wrong, it will. I realized that if you are surprised that the system works, you haven&#x27;t reflected on that doubt enough. He would light up like a child when we encountered a real bug, and he&#x27;d follow it up with a session of reflection on why it escaped our attention in the first place. That session would result in a raft of new tests.<p>Rest in peace, Ed Felt, my friend, mentor and guide.

I&#x27;m travelling in Europe at the moment and have been covering a lot of area with a lot of roundabouts where they would be signaled or signed intersections in the US. They definitely make traffic flow smoothly and I&#x27;ve noticed a few areas where they are used to eliminate dangerous left turns at places like parking lots, you leave turning right, hit the next roundabout to &quot;uturn&quot; then head back the way you wanted to go. As a traffic device they really have lots of different kinds of use cases beyond just an alternative for a 4way.<p>Where I grew up in a rural part of the US, we had one terrible 4-way intersection between two undevided highways. Over time they added lights, then experimented with different signaling systems, but every day it would back up for several miles in a couple directions, and add up to 30 minutes to some commutes. Then there were the inevitable accidents as people tried to rush it, making things worse all around.<p>They replaced it with a roundabout about a decade ago, the population in the area also has increased dramatically in those years as farms turned into suburbs, but the backup is entirely gone. Theres no need any longer to maintain lights and switching systems, and the accidents are almost nil. Nobody has died there in years. People complained at first because it was &quot;weird&quot; then they realized they were complaining at home a half hour ealier than they would have been, so they stopped.<p>They&#x27;ve since added a few more in the area and have even gotten very experimental with a double diamond interchange that&#x27;s also done a lot of good. There&#x27;s something in the water at the planners office. Seeing that transformation though and the immediate benefits has turned me into a lifetime fan of the roundabout.</div><br/><div id="41763372" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41763372" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rob74</span><span>|</span><a href="#41762435">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41763796">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41763372">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41763372">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m living in Germany, where roundabouts are very popular with planners recently.

For instance, one by my house had traffic lines which gave people the wrong impression about the right of way within the roundabout, leading to every vehicle treating driving like that. I actually drove like that as well for a long time - when you&#x27;re spending every day driving the exact same way that the hundreds of other cars surrounding you are driving, and the lines on the road suggest that it&#x27;s correct way to drive, it&#x27;s easy to mistakenly think this is what you&#x27;re supposed to be doing.<p>Then it hit me one day - this isn&#x27;t how right of way works in a roundabout at all.

After you&#x27;ve waited your turn and entered the roundabout, you&#x27;re required to yield again within a few feet. Obviously this is not an impossible task, but the signage leading up to the roundabout from northbound SR 203 doesn&#x27;t at all indicate the shape of the roundabout. The navigation sign at the entrance only shows a single roundabout.<p>The second yield point is indicated with the standard yield sign and triangle markings on the road. But judging by the amount of detritus scattered on the ground, as well as the recent addition of &quot;YIELD&quot; text painted on the road and orange flags attached to the yield sign (both not present at any other entrance to the roundabout), the yield-twice pattern is not obvious to everyone.<p>Plus, the topology of the roundabout isn&#x27;t conducive to seeing this from the ground, either; the relatively sharp right turn leading into the roundabout places the second yield sign out of your forward vision when you&#x27;re approaching the roundabout, and the whole intersection itself is very slightly tilted away from the northbound entrance, making it really tricky to see and understand it when approaching.<p>---<p>Anecdotally, almost every time I&#x27;ve driven through here while there is simultaneous traffic from northbound SR 203 and northbound 203rd St. SE, the northbound 203rd St. SE traffic ends up being cut off by drivers failing to yield at the second entrance.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41754734" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41754734" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">freditup</span><span>|</span><a href="#41761968">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41763698">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41754734">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41754734">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The picture of the roundabout from above at the beginning of the article is extra confusing because it doesn&#x27;t have the final lane markings yet and the ones you can see are misleading.<p>The (presumably) final markings[0] make things less confusing.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;place&#x2F;High+Rock+Rd,+Washington+98272&#x2F;@47.8121607,-121.9826373,89m&#x2F;data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x549aa0b779ae6ff3:0x66ffe2ef35ece7a6!8m2!3d47.8059769!4d-121.9660415!16s%2Fg%2F1v44q3pw?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAwMi4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;place&#x2F;High+Rock+Rd,+Washington+9...</a></div><br/><div id="41754812" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41754812" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jayyhu</span><span>|</span><a href="#41754734">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41763698">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41754812">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41754812">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They made a video that explains how to navigate the roundabout, and shows what it will actually look like (with yield markings)[1]<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;07_m7HHiZRw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;07_m7HHiZRw</a></div><br/><div id="41762383" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41762383" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SamBam</span><span>|</span><a href="#41754734">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41754812">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41763698">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41762383">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41762383">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Um, if your new traffic feature requires an explanatory video, then you&#x27;ve done something wrong...</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41763698" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41763698" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">urbandw311er</span><span>|</span><a href="#41754734">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41754444">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41763698">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41763698">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">UK reader here (we are pretty much &#x27;all in&#x27; on roundabouts) I&#x27;m reading this and wondering how they&#x27;d cope with the &#x27;Magic Roundabout&#x27;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Magic_Roundabout_(Hemel_Hempstead)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Magic_Roundabout_(Hemel_Hempst...</a><p>Even UK drivers struggle a bit with this one!</div><br/><div id="41763954" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41763954" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fransje26</span><span>|</span><a href="#41763698">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41754444">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41763954">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41763954">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As the credited inventors of the modern roundabout, I&#x27;ve always wondered how the UK traffic planners managed to misunderstand their own creation to the point that they come up with such designs..<p>An other baffling design I&#x27;ve encountered in the UK is a roundabout with traffic lights half-way through.. Wasn&#x27;t the concept based on removing traffic lights to fluidify traffic..?<p>As a whole, if designers come up with far-fetched designs where drivers struggle to understand what&#x27;s going on, they are doing something very wrong.  Assuming the average driver is already barely in control (phone distraction, screaming kids, lack of sleep, medication, subpar vehicle control, etc), the last thing you want to do is remove even more situational awareness by coming up with over-complicated designs that require serious thinking.<p>The argument that people will slow down because they don&#x27;t understand what is happening is a fallacious one.  Yes, they will slow down, but then, under stress, they will probably default to some instinctive basic reaction which has a high probability of being incorrect, leading to accidents.

There arenât actually studies being done before or after to see if makes the flow of traffic better.<p>They are also adding them in walkable areas with the express intent of âtraffic never stoppingâ which doesnât go well with pedestrians crossing the street.<p>I think we can find better ways to spend moneyâ¦ including the salaries of the people dreaming up bizarre applications for these things.</div><br/><div id="41754492" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41754492" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rootusrootus</span><span>|</span><a href="#41754428">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41763517">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41754492">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41754492">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Some of them have a stop sign in the roundabout?<p>Traffic gets much heavier and we&#x27;ll need stop signs at our roundabout near my house.

The first is judgement of how distant other vehicles need to be before you can enter. As a learner I used to irritate the drivers behind me by being far too cautious; on a busy roundabout you can&#x27;t expect an enormous gap, so you need to know what length of gap the other drivers will expect you to take advantage of. This you can only learn from experience.<p>The other is to plan your route, because you need to choose your entry lane based on where you want to go.

Firstly, the &quot;plastic is bad&quot; narrative is too easy to believe, just because plastic is ugly. It&#x27;s also starting to follow the pattern I have seen in clinical psychology, where many studies find promising initial results, but no one bothers to conduct the real-life randomized controlled study that shows an actual clinical effect. And after a couple of decades of dogma, someone points out that the emperor has no clothes. Suddenly, the whole field looks silly, be it EMDR, classical psychotherapy, mindfulness therapy for severe mental illness, or the abuse craze in the 1990s.<p>The longer it goes without concrete and clinically significant findings, the larger I think the probability of the findings being wrong becomes. I also find it strange that so few of the studies I have read ever comment on the fact that our system might be fully capable of removing the nanoparticles by itself, just as it removes everything from dust to methylmercury. We do not know if this is the case, but the fact that nobody is addressing this further strengthens my fear that there is a lot of confirmation bias going on.<p>Every time I post something like this, I get a lot of angry responses, so I can try to preempt some of them by saying: I am not asserting that microplastics are safe. But the pattern of lots of pilot studies, and few studies that significantly prove the theory, is very recognizable to me.<p>Until someone either conducts a naturalistic experiment with lots of people exposed to large doses of microplastics and compares them to a control group, or we expose some larger animals to microplastics over a long time in a true randomized controlled study, I&#x27;m going to remain skeptical.</div><br/><div id="38323890" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38323890" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">swatcoder</span><span>|</span><a href="#38323693">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38324578">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38323890">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38323890">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re right that conclusive research can be impractical or neglected for many environmental and social impact &quot;sciences&quot;. This is why psychology, ecology, biology, medicine and even chemistry weren&#x27;t always taken seriously by more rigorous disciplines. No innovation really marked a moment between when they were denigrated as soft sciences that couldn&#x27;t make sound conclusions and their role in society today. It&#x27;s mostly just a cultural shift and a loss of implicit skepticism in them. So yeah, it&#x27;s hard to <i>know</i> stuff like &quot;how dangerous are plastics&quot; as rigorously as &quot;how much energy is released when these two nuclei fuse&quot;<p>But there&#x27;s also a practical weight that matters in a lot of these pursuits. Plastics overtook the world during a time when people weren&#x27;t really considering their impact at ecological scale and didn&#x27;t have sufficient models and tools to really assess what they might do to biological systems over lifetimes or generations. It was a historical accident that happened fast and without many brakes applied and now &quot;plastics everywhere&quot; is a pervasive background noise that&#x27;s very hard to meaningfully control against. So the controlled science which was never conducted initially, and we now think probably should have been, is almost impossible to perform because we&#x27;re left in that that fuzzy &quot;soft sciences&quot; place where everything is already plasticked.<p>But does that mean we should just keep charging ahead without trying to look, and that maybe a mindful step back from unscientific historical use would be worth considering even without conclusive evidence (since such evidence is now too hard to gather)?</div><br/><div id="38324947" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38324947" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pardoned_turkey</span><span>|</span><a href="#38323693">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38323890">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38324578">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38324947">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38324947">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re cherry-picking plastics here.

There are many types of plastics, with many types of additives. Most plastics are bioreactive, especially when not handled properly or maintained in the proper conditions. A great many plastics and especially additives are known to be toxic, carcinogenic, etc. These aren’t controversial statements and is widely known, understood, and cataloged.<p>Further, in this study, they point to prior studies that have established most adult humans have detectable amounts of nanoplastics in the blood stream. Further the point to prior research establishing many nanoplastics (and specially polystyrene, what they are studying here), passes the blood brain barrier.<p>They contribute findings that, in mice, polystyrene nanoparticles are admitted to neurons and they isolate a number of changes in the proteins and signaling of the cells that propagate to other parts of the brain. The changes are indicative of changes observed in Parkinson’s, but since we don’t understand Parkinson’s, we clearly can’t establish a causal link in this way.<p>RCTs could establish a probable correlate, but given again plastic nanoparticles are a single monolithic thing, there’s an incredible amount of variability in such a trial. This will take a lot of time and need to be pretty narrowly constructed so fundamental research like this is how you establish and guide such trials in the future. We haven’t really focused on the subject very long. But all of the facts above <i>should</i> be of grave concern.<p>Even if the body clears out nanoparticles, which I’m certain it must, that doesn’t mean they can’t cause serious issues prior to clearance. We are also presumably constantly exposed to more so you should view it as a chronic and persistent level in the body even if the body can clear it. In fact I would say unlike heavy metals we almost certainly clear it otherwise you would simply accumulate greater and greater concentrations; which I don’t think is observed.<p>It’s good to be skeptical, but I don’t think “we haven’t established a specific disease caused by the pervasive presence of plastic nanoparticles in animals” doesn’t imply “this is ok” by any measure.</div><br/><div id="38325625" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38325625" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jtrn</span><span>|</span><a href="#38323693">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38324578">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38324747">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38325625">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38325625">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But you do agree that it would be better if we got some studies that went beyond &quot;particles have been observed in tissue&quot; to something like &quot;This is the dose-to-morbidity curve for this group of nanoparticles&quot;?My issue is that we have been stuck with hundreds, if not thousands, of research papers of the first type, and I haven&#x27;t found any of the latter type.<p>With regard to your last point, I kind of agree, but there has to be a balance between two extremes. You can&#x27;t assume something is safe just because you don&#x27;t have a smoking gun. On the other hand, the &quot;you can&#x27;t prove it&#x27;s 100% safe for everybody at all times throughout the universe, so we must assume it&#x27;s dangerous&quot; position can also be very dangerous. To me, the anti-GMO movement makes this mistake in a serio<p>us way, hurting actual people in deprived parts of the world.

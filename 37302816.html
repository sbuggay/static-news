Spent a lifetime since then building on his ideas and how to apply them to scientific laboratory work of various kinds, not just quality control, and it has been quite helpful.<p>Especially when it comes to the elements of experimentation and discovery.<p>Not everybody is aware of the way in his later years Dr. Deming was involved with Jim McIngvale &quot;Matress Mac&quot; of Gallery Furniture in Houston, and made a major difference in their operation.  As a very promotional local personality it was easy to witness the transformation as it occurred over the years.  I would say this influence was what allowed their ultimate growth beyond what would have been possible before.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deming.org&#x2F;customer-satisfaction-and-the-deming-way&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deming.org&#x2F;customer-satisfaction-and-the-deming-way&#x2F;</a><p>For some quick reading I&#x27;ll quote a few quotes from the 11-page quote page:<p>&quot;A bad system will beat a good person every time.&quot;<p>&quot;All that we have has come from people that are responsible only to themselves, only themselves to satisfy.&quot;<p>&quot;Defects are not free. Somebody makes them, and gets paid for making them.&quot;<p>&quot;In my mind, if you run your company on visible figures alone, you will have neither company nor figures, given a little time. The most important figures are unknown and unknowable. That opinion comes from my good friend, Dr. Lloyd Nelson.&quot;<p>&quot;Information, no matter how complete and speedy, is not knowledge.&quot;<p>&quot;It is wrong to suppose that if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it – a costly myth.&quot;<p>&quot;Joy in work comes from understanding why your work is important. Not from the work, but from knowledge of who’s going to use it.&quot;<p>&quot;The supposition is prevalent the world over that there would be no problems in production or service if only our production workers would do their jobs in the way that they were taught. Pleasant dreams. The workers are handicapped by the system, and the system belongs to the management.&quot;<p>&quot;To manage one must lead. To lead, one must understand the work that he and his people are responsible for.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deming.org&#x2F;quotes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deming.org&#x2F;quotes</a></div><br/><div id="37304902" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37304902" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kqr</span><span>|</span><a href="#37303966">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37303529">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37304902">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37304902">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ah I don&#x27;t remember the exact words but one of my favourite images he painted was something along the lines of<p>&quot;Managing an organisation by quarterly reports is like driving a car by looking at the centre line in the rear view mirror.&quot;</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37303529" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37303529" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aloha</span><span>|</span><a href="#37303966">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37303437">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37303529">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37303529">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One of the books linked within is interesting<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Reckoning-David-Halberstam-ebook&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00AG8FZ4C&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Reckoning-David-Halberstam-ebook&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B...</a><p>I read it some years ago, and its very very interesting.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37303437" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37303437" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">User23</span><span>|</span><a href="#37303529">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37303437">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37303437">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And even fewer people have heard of Homer Sarasohn[1], who was perhaps even more seminal to the Japanese economic recovery and kickstarted their electronics industry.

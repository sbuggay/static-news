It was located in an old Carnegie building!  They had an electronic catalog- but they still had the card catalog as well.  It had not been updated for some time, though.  So as part of my job (sometimes there wasn&#x27;t much for me to do), I took it upon myself to update it.  I think I impressed the older ladies that worked at the library- I not only knew what the card catalog was, but how it worked and how to operate the mechanical typewriter to type up new cards for new books that had been added to the collection.<p>Not long after this, the library moved to a brand new building.  The card catalog did not make the move to the new building.  I may have been the last person to have updated it.</div><br/><div id="37925224" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37925224" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Roark66</span><span>|</span><a href="#37923440">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37925533">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37925224">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37925224">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Discarding of these catalogs is a huge mistake. What if there is no power? What if there is a war, the IT system breaks and no one is able to fix it for the lack of parts and eventually lack of knowledge? These records are too valuable not to have a physical human readable backup.<p>What is the excuse? &quot;The company that printed the cards went out of business&quot; I bet there is a lot of companies that could print a batch of such cards upon order. How hard would it be to set up a printer that filled and updates the cards and the it system to be in sync?<p>I remember using libraries without computerised catalogs for a long time. When I used electronic search for the first time I thought it is huge. I could find stuff in minutes instead of hours (or asking a librarian to do the search for me). However, it t is extremely short sighted to just discard or let these old catalogs to rot.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37925533" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37925533" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vintermann</span><span>|</span><a href="#37923440">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37923955">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37925533">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37925533">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Card catalogs are often the only index into something people have stopped caring (much) about.

I visited the National Air and Space museum archives once to access a special collection, and one of the main ways they still found documents in this collection was through an old card catalog, though they did have a digital database of most of the information in the card catalog.  I only needed to use the digital database but I did also locate one document I was looking for via the card catalog to see how the collection was organized originally.  I think card catalogs will continue to be used for certain special collections for a long time.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37924205" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37924205" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">oldbbsnickname</span><span>|</span><a href="#37923955">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37924390">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37924205">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37924205">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">C. 1990, I volunteered in the library at the middle school I was attending.

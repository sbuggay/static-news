Leslie Groves was the cause that the experiment was not performed remotely.<p>Young further testified that Slotin’s quick reactions saved him and others from a fatal dose.<p>“ Slotin immediately knocked the two hemispheres of radioactive material apart with his hand, probably saving the other technicians and scientists in the room—including Young—from immediate death.
“<p>So Slotin was not a fool but under deadline pressure for results and his actions saved others.<p>Young is a fascinating chap, no formal science education but worked his way up to scientist and made the world’s first working breeder reactor in his spare time.<p>[0] “ The meme-ification of the “Demon Core””<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42200699">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42200699</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

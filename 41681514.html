We still hadn&#x27;t developed methods of mass-producing reliable, fast, and cheap microelectronics and controllers. So for high-reliability applications, analog computing was THE solution.<p>In 1954, Rex Rice wrote this piece about preferring a simple plugboard as the means of programming a computer, versus any sort of abstraction with a programming language (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;1455270.1455272" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;1455270.1455272</a>). So it was still very much up for debate, whether high-level programming languages were even the right solution for the problems being faced.<p>But I agree with you, our forefathers were simply geniuses to have figured out how to manipulate the physical world to produce mathematical computations. Early in his career, my dad had to disassemble and reverse-engineer some Soviet-made aerospace devices, and he still fondly recalls how superbly engineered and precise the Soviet devices were. I wish there was more information out there about Soviet computing, but the winners do write history after all.</div><br/><div id="41683652" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41683652" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">somat</span><span>|</span><a href="#41681750">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41682157">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41685751">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41683652">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41683652">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My understanding the surprising factor that settled the debate for analog vs digital computers. was that digital computers require far less precise electronics. the voltage in an analog computer has to be exactly 5.2648 volts, every resister, capacitor, transistor has to be a high precision part, the more complex the computer the higher precision required. while in a digital computer &quot;close to 5 volts&quot; is good enough. this makes the components cheaper, more reliable and smaller. and as such the digital computer won.<p>This is why I have my doubts about existing designs for quantum computers, the quantum algorithms we are trying to solve in hardware require an analog design and we rejected analog computers before, mainly because they were unable to scale.

And extrapolating from automotive experience, the color rendition and contrast is about some team of engineers being solely dedicated to simulating various lightning conditions and verifying that the screen remains legible, does not interfere with night vision and does not cause reflections on other instruments that would make them hard to read. In automotive this kind of simulations use multiple terabytes of reflectivity data for various mostly “dull” materials (gigabytes upon gigabytes of data on what the driver might wear…), so extrapolate from that to “most advanced fighter aircraft”.</div><br/><div id="41683511" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41683511" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">iancmceachern</span><span>|</span><a href="#41682579">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41683332">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41683263">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41683511">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41683511">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They kinda are:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;viewpointproducts.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw0t63BhAUEiwA5xP54SwOWsVrKsRQ-uJWBMQa89eVCypnSiOybXYCyM0o6Y5ijfbtWmpkexoCMPwQAvD_BwE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;viewpointproducts.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=C...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41683263" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41683263" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kens</span><span>|</span><a href="#41682579">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41682747">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41682748">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41683263">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41683263">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The backup for the display is an integrated standby instrument system (ISIS), which combines several essential instruments into one small digital display.

So the aircraft gyroscopes would be orders of magnitude better than a smartphone.

Although I&#x27;ll admit to not taking the time to understand all the math involved to get from the raw 3 axis acceleration and microTesla magnetic measurements to compass heading, I just copy&#x2F;pasted sample Arduino code which gave me 1 decimal place degrees. But my grinder has 100 &quot;notches&quot; around the 360 degrees of the grind adjustment ring, and my data logger at least looked like it was accurately&#x2F;repeatably showing changes down in the quarter to half a notch range.<p>So while I don&#x27;t think $50 worth of stuff from Adafruit will get you &lt;0.01deg&#x2F;hour gyro drift rate, with magnetic calibrations and sensor fusion you could probably hit at least 0.1deg long term precision&#x2F;accuracy, so over 10 or more hours you&#x27;d have &quot;navigation grade&quot; accuracy. Which is probably &quot;good enough&quot; for anything traveling at less that a couple of hundred MPH. 0.1deg error is about 1km every 600km - so if you were sailing from Sydney to San Francisco (with no GPS or astro nav equipment) which is ~12,000km, you&#x27;d be within 20km or so when you got there.

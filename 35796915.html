Countries don&#x27;t hold US treasuries because they&#x27;re great investments (..... obviously). They hold them BECAUSE they have liabilities in USD BECAUSE their international trade is in USD, and having to covert their local currency to USD not only introduces a currency risk. 
The world financial system is also organized to make local currencies of poorer countries depreciate over time, more than the USD does. Just like inflation is a silent tax that robs wealth from the poorer stratums inside a country, faster inflation&#x2F;depreciation in the global south than in the north does the same on a global scale; it&#x27;s a means of exploitation. Holding USD treasuries protects against that, at least a little.
The fall in USD use in world trade doesn&#x27;t immediately translate into an equivalent fall of reserve holdings because the trade isn&#x27;t the only reason they hold them. The other big one is serving international debt, also in USD (for.. the same reasons as above, again an exploitation mechanism). So even if you stopped ALL trade in USD tomorrow, countries would have years&#x27; worth of USD denominated debt to pay off (which, of course, never pays off, because just like student loans, it accrues fees and interest and will never be paid down under &quot;normal&quot; circumstances, just rolled over).
So there&#x27;s a second change to watch: the change in debt denominated in other countires&#x27; currencies. It&#x27;s a slow moving train.</div><br/><div id="35799595" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35799595" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gsatic</span><span>|</span><a href="#35797582">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35799279">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35798546">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35799595">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35799595">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I dont thinks its a means of exploitation in the sense that controling inflation is not something anyone has mastered in hundreds of years of trying all kinds of things.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35798546" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35798546" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">0xDEF</span><span>|</span><a href="#35797582">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35798847">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35799509">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35798546">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35798546">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Yes, there&#x27;s been a substantial decline in the use of the dollar, but that&#x27;s not because some other currency is shooting up to take its place.

It benefits US to have a military base but need not necessarily benefit the host country. Almost always there will be a compromise, &quot;a choosing of lesser of two evils&quot; so to speak, when a Nation has to give up sovereign space for a military of another Nation to occupy its lands. It is out of desperation. In some cases it is out of pressure too.<p>Which is why I consider it &quot;military involvement&quot;. There is a stark contrast between having an Embassy in a Country vs a Military Base in a Country. The host country can always call for shutdown of a foreign Embassy and expel Diplomats. These rules are governed by World organizations like the United Nations. However, a Host country cannot expel a military base from its land unless it is written down in the agreement between the two Nations. Even then, the actual ability to shut down an already established military base is significantly costlier on the host nation if it has lesser military strength (which it most certainly has, else why would it want to host another Nation&#x27;s military in the first place?).<p>I also include coup-de-tats as there is covert operations which involves using militia or even military of countries where USG wants Government to be toppled. The most recent example is that of Pakistan where there is widespread allegation within the country that USG along with Pakistani military toppled the previous regime. Now whether those allegations are true or not is secondary. The sentiment within the country prevails. So when I said &quot;bad blood&quot; I mean it as a &quot;perception of the people on ground&quot; sort of thing.<p>&gt; Cyprus, Switzerland, Malta, Scandinavia, Finland, Luxembourg, Spain and Portugal (unless you count them allowing US bases as &quot;militarily involved&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t cause bad blood so doubt it), Mongolia, Nepal, all of the former Soviet Union (except stuff like paying to get nuclear waste and weapons properly disposed of, which is even less of &quot;militarily involved&quot; and even less cause for bad blood), big chunks of Africa - Morocco, Algeria and Tunis (unless you count Operation Torch to free the Vichy France protectorates in favour of Free), South Africa, Rwanda, South Sudan, etc. Just off the top of my head, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing a bunch even if I might be mistaken on one or two.<p>I talked about military involvement. It need not necessarily mean the War was not justified. It could very well be justified and it could be fought on the sides of Allies too. However, when a foreign Nation involves in any War to assist another Nation (especially in civil wars), there will always be bad blood created within the Nation as there is one section of the populace who would be targeted by strikes. You can call them &quot;rebels&quot; but for those &quot;rebels&quot; it is an invasion of their homeland. I am sure if I do further research I&#x27;ll be able to find US military involvement in every one of these countries that you listed in some form or the other. Of the top of my head, US was involved in the Nepalese Civil War where it supported the Gorkha Empire against the Communist Party of Nepal.<p>&gt; All that to say, there&#x27;s no need to exaggerate American warmongering, imperialism and neo-colonialism. It has done insurmountable damage to many counties and resulted in millions if not tens of millions of dead, all for profits of American corporations. Exaggerating it makes it more easily refutable and minimises the suffering caused.<p>Not exaggerating. &quot;Militarily involved&quot; does not necessarily mean going into a country guns blazing. One can always covertly bring about regime change or tilt an ongoing civil war within another country in one&#x27;s favour. Almost always creates bad blood among a section of the populace.</div><br/><div id="35799525" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35799525" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway11204</span><span>|</span><a href="#35797344">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35799144">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35799531">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35799525">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35799525">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Here in Europe we compete over who gets the new US base first.

Eventually, in the long run, relationships of this kind sour inevitably. Because there will always be divergence in interests. The moment that happens you will feel &quot;stuck&quot; with someone you don&#x27;t want anymore but can&#x27;t do anything about it. Colonization comes in various forms. Setting up military bases is one of them. This bonhomie is good as long as relationship between your country and US is good. What will you do if it turns sour in the future? No one can predict the future. Who would have predicted splitting of Germany? Who would have predicted collapse of Soviet Union?

But if it loses that reserve currency status, ISTM that significant devaluation of the currency could follow, as the holders of those foreign reserves look to divest.

The one bank that would loan to them required they have seats on the board of directors. They loaned money at high interest rates, bought up the senior bonds with the interest payments, took control of the board, loaned money to themselves (effectively), paying dividends out of debt, and then forced bankruptcy and let it all collapse in the hope of a government bailout (which they got because rail is critical to food security and energy).<p>It also neglects stagflation but does mention Volcker, drawing the wrong conclusions of what really happened, doesn&#x27;t mention the S&amp;L debacle aside from a brief mention (which was huge as well), neglected the whipsaw effect.<p>The biggest problem I have with it, is it neglects a lot of important factors and only focuses on policy which doesn&#x27;t match up with reality and largely only what fits their narrative if you didn&#x27;t know better. There was also no mention of taking the currency off the gold standard in 1971. Most importantly, they don&#x27;t use any of the M2 or velocity of money data. Its available from the Fed website but it doesn&#x27;t support much of what they said, and shows how expansion of the money supply drives inflation in cost push or demand pull inflation.<p>MMT suffers from major problems. The people that subscribe to it largely only see these large sums in a very narrow context which leads to poor conclusions, and an idea that you can print money continuously into the future with no consequence. It largely was what led to quantitative easing (or money printing).<p>Graeber has a great book on Debt, which goes into the historical examples of what happens when you debase currency like this (no matter what you call it), and there&#x27;s some very interesting research in how the Economic Calculation Problem related effects can be seen as rational pricing and price discovery fail in markets denominated in unbacked fiat. The latter being most commonly known for its historic roots as an intractable problem with non-market socialist systems where the means of production are held by a single entity. The debate&#x2F;problem still isn&#x27;t solved 100 years later.<p>Additionally, the people making policy can&#x27;t control what people choose to buy and sell goods at. Inevitably you get shortages when they try, business sectors concentrate, points of failures are introduced, and people leave the business when its not profitable. Then you get things like the baby formula crisis where the only factory remaining is shut down for safety reasons (as a result of cost cutting) and no one can get baby food in Florida. Once sector concentration reaches a certain point, its a short step away from nationalization in furtherance of solving the shortages through greater regulation.<p>Needless to say it doesn&#x27;t work, and I&#x27;d expect at least some of that to be addressed, but it wasn&#x27;t. What&#x27;s covered seems misleading, and very much divorced from the reality.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35797190" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35797190" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jjtheblunt</span><span>|</span><a href="#35797051">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35797149">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35798543">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35798175">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35797190">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35797190">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is that what Paul Krugman in the NYT opinions section touts (and got a Nobel prize in economics for)?</div><br/><div id="35797244" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35797244" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Afforess</span><span>|</span><a href="#35797051">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35797190">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35798175">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35797244">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35797244">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No...

And this is not a good thing even for US. Since the consumption economy in US is driven largely by debt, what will happen when there is a default (which seems very likely to happen soon considering how US banks are collapsing like dominoes)? Who is going to bail out the US economy? Sure you can bail out banks when there is a banking crisis and is localized to only the banking sector (like 2008). But what will you do when there is an economic crisis that affects everyone? That is the real issue here. US National debt is at an all time high and is not slowing down. QE is still on full swing. One day it is all going to come crashing down. With de-dollarization, the strength of the US economy shifts from being able to control international trade and also drive up its own internal debt to finance World economy (by providing much needed liquidity for international trade through its SWIFT systems) to only having to drive up its own internal debt to finance US economy (which has all the potential to lead to runaway inflation). This shift is going to happen in the coming decade or two and I hope US Citizens are aware and prepared for the fallout.</div><br/><div id="35798650" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35798650" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">riffraff</span><span>|</span><a href="#35797042">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35798235">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35797277">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35798650">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35798650">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The US debt is practically always at an all time high.<p>That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s the recurring scene of Democrats and Republicans fighting to raise the debt ceiling.<p>One day the US will crash and burn, but I&#x27;m betting you a dollar it won&#x27;t happen in this decade or the next.</div><br/><div id="35799313" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35799313" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shri_krishna</span><span>|</span><a href="#35797042">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35798650">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35797277">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35799313">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35799313">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; One day the US will crash and burn, but I&#x27;m betting you a dollar it won&#x27;t happen in this decade or the next.<p>I am willing to take you up on your bet. My answer to your point is quite simple really. Consumption is going to slow down massively in USA over the next two decades because of Demographics. By current statistics itself, there is a major decline in young population in 70% of the counties in USA [1]. The median age in USA is 38.1 years. So 2 decades from now, this median age is going to shift to 50-60 because birth rates are plummeting big time. Unless US can produce more babies it is going towards an ageing society (like what Japan is experiencing right now). So when consumption falls, economy gets sluggish and that would cause downturn again. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the next two decades ends up worse than the Great Depression of the early 1900s considering how badly managed the current recession is.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.census.gov&#x2F;library&#x2F;stories&#x2F;2022&#x2F;06&#x2F;fewer-younger-adults-drives-population-loss-in-some-us-cities.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.census.gov&#x2F;library&#x2F;stories&#x2F;2022&#x2F;06&#x2F;fewer-younger...</a></div><br/><div id="35799784" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35799784" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neximo64</span><span>|</span><a href="#35797042">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35799313">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35797277">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35799784">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35799784">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The reason that wont happen is simply immigration.

Most countries now have better home grown systems where transactions are settled instantly (instead of taking multiple days) and have realized that the same can be extended when it comes to inter-country (read it as bilateral) trade too. Instead of India holding USD in a US Bank and Russia holding USD in a US Bank, and using US Bank as an intermediary for any bilateral trade (giving a cut to US Bank as well as being at mercy of the US Government), India and Russia can bypass the middleman (US Bank) and trade directly: India holding Rubles in Russian Bank, while Russia holds INR in Indian Bank. There is no SWIFT being used anywhere in between. Totally avoids sanctions as well as removes the middle man from the equation.<p>De-dollarization has nothing to do with US Dollars losing its value. It has more to do with the US Government losing its economic superpower status where it can control other countries through economic sanctions. Even after de-dollarization, USD might be the most sought after currency purely for its value and not for &quot;fear of the US Government&quot;. There is no &quot;perceived loss&quot; for USD as such. But there is significant loss for the US Administration if it cannot use USD as a weapon against another Country. That&#x27;s the point that is most important to realize. It is all about balancing power dynamics.</div><br/><div id="35797393" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35797393" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neximo64</span><span>|</span><a href="#35797042">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35797334">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35799141">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35797393">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35797393">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My argument is that the US dollars that are on these reserves only exist because consumers have spent them.

What makes America economically strong is its consumption demand. Correct. However, we are talking about removing SWIFT and US Bank as an intermediary.

I&#x27;ll differ with you slightly here: US dollar reserves are highest purely because we use USD for imports from other countries too. That is why it is the most sought after today. We are all selling to US consumers primarily because we want those dollars to trade with other countries as all trade happens through SWIFT. However, with de-dollarization, we are trading with each other in our own currencies. Now obviously that would mean we wouldn&#x27;t be storing more than what is minimally required in USD reserves as we would be holding a bigger basket of currencies instead.<p>Would USD reserves still exist? Yes. Would the volume of those reserves remain intact? Absolutely not. It will reduce significantly as it gets replaced by reserve currencies of the countries we have direct bilateral trade with. Is that going to reset the USD price in the market? Obviously yes. Water finds its level. So will USD. Would USD still be the most sought after? Depends on the US consumer. If the US consumer still has an appetite for goods&#x2F;services it will be the most sought after.<p>You see, until now, all non-US countries were forced to be in the SWIFT system because we had no other way to trade. Now that we do, the reliance on USD as a reserve currency falls. USD will find its level eventually.<p>Also, do not forget demographics. US is losing the demographic race. The &quot;young population&quot; is shrinking rapidly and they are the &quot;consumers&quot; in any consumption economy. Like Elon Musk said recently, demographics is destiny. And US is losing that race and is not realizing it. Consumption will slow down majorly in the coming decades and other countries have to think of alternative solutions. Because consumption will move to where the &quot;young population&quot; is. And demographics decides that.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35799141" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35799141" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">johnvanommen</span><span>|</span><a href="#35797042">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35797334">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35797393">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35797338">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35799141">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35799141">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Countries have realized that US dollars is not a safe store of value (aka reserve currency) because of decisions taken by the US administration vis-a-vis its sanctions regime.<p>Another thing that really doesn&#x27;t get enough attention, is how recent events have jeopardized the peace that the United States Navy has provided for 70+ years.<p>I don&#x27;t think that most people appreciate the role that the Navy plays in the world, basically creating a situation where the United States provides security to seafaring vessels all over the world, in exchange for an unspoken agreement that other countries won&#x27;t build a massive navy.

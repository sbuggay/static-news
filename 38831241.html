But very few of us can sight-sing. Attempts to teach musical literacy like reading literacy on a mass scale have failed.<p>Or have they? Some efforts have done much better than others. I looked into a guy called Lars Roverud, crediting with reforming church singing in Norway in the 19th century. His system was a simple one based on numbers, very similar to the Chinese one briefly touched on in Tantacrul&#x27;s video. It worked really well.<p>Then there&#x27;s the American shape note tradition. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s an impressive success: regular churchgoers, not just an especially talented choir, actually learn to sight-sing three and four-part harmony. They don&#x27;t just learn the melodies by heart, they can actually flip to a new song and sing it. They rely on a partially symbolic system, and on harmonization conventions.<p>There are actually a lot of didactic music success stories, and what virtually all of them have in common is a symbolic system for pitch&#x2F;harmony.<p>But what those systems also have in common, is that most of the benefit to literacy is gone a generation after someone says, &quot;how great! now you should advance to <i>real</i> music notation!&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="38834199" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38834199" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bjoli</span><span>|</span><a href="#38839235">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38834612">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38834199">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38834199">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Now I have something to refer to every time I hear someone complain about the standard notation.

Don&#x27;t misunderstand me, I think MuseScore is awesome and recently I&#x27;ve found composing in staff notation valuable and efficient. This is just a critique of his essay.<p>And perhaps a deeper criticism is that his assumption of tonal harmony and paper and meatspace may reflect the kind of bias about the nature of music he criticizes elsewhere. I mean trackers are a &quot;folk art&quot; technology. They are a very plain and intellectually accessible way of notating music.<p>The verbosity of tracker notation means a person can gain competence in a matter of hours rather than years. Tracker notation removes the social gatekeeping that accompanies traditional western music education (that criticism isn&#x27;t wrong). I mean staff notation puts tonal harmony at the center of composition. Percussion and microtones get short shrift...nevermind samples and noise and effects (what is the musical notation for a dotted quarter note delay?).<p>None of this means I didn&#x27;t enjoy the video.<p>And none of it means I want to have an argument.<p>Notation as a tool of thought: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jsoftware.com&#x2F;papers&#x2F;tot.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jsoftware.com&#x2F;papers&#x2F;tot.htm</a></div><br/><div id="38839089" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38839089" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">andrewflnr</span><span>|</span><a href="#38834612">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38839207">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38839089">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38839089">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Tracker notation&quot; is basically the same as the &quot;piano roll&quot; he talks about, right?<p>Anyway, I think &quot;meatware performance&quot; also underlies the criticisms he&#x27;s responding to of standard notation as applied to music students, most of whom are trying to physically play instruments (those trying to compose on a computer are indeed on a completely different track that doesn&#x27;t need to care about paper or performance).

I&#x27;ve been making electronic music off and on for nearly 30 years and I can&#x27;t stand trackers; it&#x27;s just an event list so now you have to read everything rather than looking at it.<p>Also the concept of scale&#x2F;key is not at all limited to European composers; most music systems have a concept of scale degree, but for computer music it&#x27;s almost always been shoehorned into the 12-tone equal temperament system.

Sure, you can learn to play a single note melody faster, but I doubt it&#x27;ll work for complex pieces. At the very least, you&#x27;ll need to constrain the format, if only to know which hand (or foot) should play which note. Trackers also lack notation for fingering, tempo, dynamics, etc. Piano rolls would be entirely a no-no. That would turn into a giant, unreadable staff.<p>I don&#x27;t know what social gatekeeping there is for the current notation system. I know a teenager who learns the basics from Duolingo.<p>&gt; what is the musical notation for a dotted quarter note delay?<p>Composers have been very free in adapting notation. They make up a few symbols and strokes, and explain them in the first pages of the score. They&#x27;ve made up notation for aleatoric music, free passages with some direction, knocking on the instrument, etc. If someone wants to prescribe a certain echo effect only on a particular note, that&#x27;s doable.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38839121" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38839121" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tgv</span><span>|</span><a href="#38834612">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38839502">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38839121">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38839121">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I haven&#x27;t seen the video, but it seems to be clickbait, explaining the history of notation, and no doubt plugging the creator&#x27;s other source of income: Musescore.

It discusses early Greek, medieval and Renaissance notation systems and how Guido of Arezzo standardized staff lines and solfege in the 11th century. Mensural notation was then developed to notate rhythm and meter. The video examines attempts to reform notation over centuries and alternative systems proposed but argues standard notation remains dominant due to its balance and universality. An interesting aspect discussed is how notation is sometimes seen as elitist despite being accessible with education. While no system is presented as a clear replacement, the video shows notation continues evolving with new adapted forms developed for different musical styles.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

Sadly Harold could only savour that success for a few weeks as three week later he fell at Hastings, where the current King’s ancestor William managed through luck to eke out a victory thanks to a lucky arrow strike.<p>They must all have been tough bastards: to repel the Danes in Yorkshire, then race south on foot 300 miles in heavy armour and almost defeat another marine invasion.<p>Had I been around then and clapped eyes on even one of them I would have done whatever I could to hide and try to escape the slightest attention.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40964487" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40964487" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Tagbert</span><span>|</span><a href="#40964922">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40964001">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40964487">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40964487">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The British History podcast as a fun listen and spends a lot of time on the time from end of Roman control up to the Norman invasion.

Even in England, few people actually understand or really care about what happened between Romans and that (55 and 54BC and then finally: 43AD until about 410AD) and 1066 and the Norman invasion.<p>Something, something Saxons and Vikings and a round table and some burned cakes or something.<p>Its all rather sad, really because if you talk to a historian, that period is absolutely fascinating.  Across the entire world, although we are here focusing on 400 until 1066 in England. Post 1066 it&#x27;s all change ... of course it isn&#x27;t - English would simply be French otherwise.<p>That period is (or was) nominally described as the Dark Ages because there was not much written evidence found and proper modern archaeology was not a thing until recently.<p>If you fancy a decent read then &quot;The King in the North&quot; by Max Adams puts things into perspective.  By the way, I also think King Oswald was the real geezer.  A couple of famous Hollywood actors now own a Wrexam (Wrecsam) footie club off of Wales.  Just up the road is Oswestry.

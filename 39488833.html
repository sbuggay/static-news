Employer paid health insurance has grouping advantages, but also means you lose your income and health at the same time.<p>Steps for affordable personal health insurance are good. There&#x27;s some way to go yet, but its a step in the right direction. Having at least some part of the health system be available to the uninsured (ie non-profit) would also be beneficial.<p>So yeah, the US system, as it is, is great for those who can pay, terrible for everyone else. It favours the few with good jobs, and secure tenure. If you&#x27;re in that group, well done.<p>Other countries with national health have their own resource constraints. Not all individual outcomes are optional. And being rich doesn&#x27;t necessarily jump you to the front of the queue. There are good outcomes, and bad outcomes, but they don&#x27;t align to wealth or status (in theory.)<p>In the US its hard to change the status quo because the country is governed by the rich, paid for by the richer. The system currently favors the rich.

(Yes, we all had private offices!)<p>After a while, one of my colleagues asked a question that stuck in my mind: &quot;How can you afford to be so generous with your time?&quot;<p>Sure enough, a few months later I got a review with a mediocre rating and a comment: &quot;Your productivity hasn&#x27;t been quite we hoped, especially considering that the rest of the team has gotten more productive lately.&quot;<p>Which was exactly what I thought they had hired me for!</div><br/><div id="37367064" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37367064" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">progmetaldev</span><span>|</span><a href="#37364909">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37366847">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37367064">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37367064">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I know it&#x27;s too late now, but you are the type of developer that makes our profession an actual craft.

That set the bar for my expectations on how a team should function for a long time.<p>Luckily 2 years later I went a startup and similar great experience of team work and supporting each other continued. I worked at 2 more startups which grew a lot and were super successful and the culture continued.<p>Only in recent times, (post 2019) I have noticed that people are obsessed with performance rating systems and gaming them. I notice junior engineers are not as curious to learn or challenge-seeking as engineers a decade. And I notice recently promoted senior engineers are not as talented either.

Like, their purpose is to allow dev teams to do relative estimation (which is pretty easy to do), but also enable someone to produce absolute estimates based on the team&#x27;s track record of delivery. Team says a story is a 5 pointer? Query previously delivered stories which the team also said were 5 points and if there&#x27;s enough data you&#x27;ll be able to forecast with reasonable certainty how long it will take them to deliver this new story. Used this way there&#x27;s no &quot;fair&quot; value of a story point - it doesn&#x27;t matter if one team uses point values in the range 0 - 1 while another uses point values in the range 1,000 - 1,000,000.<p>The whole thing breaks if you start comparing point values across teams, or say that 1 point is 1 day&#x27;s work or whatever.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37366020" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37366020" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">epanchin</span><span>|</span><a href="#37362919">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37364618">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37365116">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37364995">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37366020">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37366020">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The point of scrum is to provide employment for consultants and non-engineers.<p>I left engineering for an engineering job in finance.

Tommy interrupted the operation and told the appropriate department he can do the work and needs only the physical equipments (routers, switches, cables) and two guys who can do the <i>cabling</i>.

High charisma is high when it’s with your interviewer, when it’s with your peers, when it’s with your business stakeholders.  High charisma is useful in getting a job, in arguing for addressing tech debt, in pushing back on unreasonable timelines.

As the author points out they often &quot;score poorly&quot; and yet losing them will create net decrease in team productivity.

But they miss that their understanding of &quot;best&quot; is not based on managing people, its based on getting their original job done. As a result they favor people who mirror their skills and habits and disfavor those who have different skills and habits.

On defense it’s more subtle, such as not over committing and leaving his man etc but on offense is where it’s obvious. As his own shooting has fallen off a cliff, more and more when he’s dribbling unguarded he frantically looks around for Steph or klay to flow into a dribble hand off to pry them free for a shot.<p>He’s talked extensively about the criticism he’s faced for lack of shot attempts, with his rational being why would he ever shoot if he can instead try to get Steph a shot. He’s also mentioned if Klay hasn’t touched the ball in a few possessions, he makes sure to get Klay the ball with at least a decent look; otherwise the next time Klay gets the ball he’s shooting it regardless of how bad the shot is. He also frequently pushes the break[1] to catch the defense off guard and before they can set up.<p>He <i>is</i> still a negative offensively, but why I appreciate draymond so much is for the above reasons and the myriad other subtleties he does to maximize his benefit to the team and diminish the detrimental elements of his.<p>And lastly, standard plus minus is still a hell of a lot better than box score garbage, I don’t mean to crap on it.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;squared2020.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;18&#x2F;deep-dive-on-regularized-adjusted-plus-minus-i-introductory-example&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;squared2020.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;18&#x2F;deep-dive-on-regularized-...</a><p>[1]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stats.inpredictable.com&#x2F;nba&#x2F;onoff.php?season=2022&amp;team=ALL&amp;pos=ALL&amp;po=0&amp;frdt=2022-10-18&amp;todt=2023-06-12&amp;rate=tot&amp;grp=1&amp;mpos=2000&amp;sort=son_opce&amp;order=ASC" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stats.inpredictable.com&#x2F;nba&#x2F;onoff.php?season=2022&amp;tea...</a><p>(Steph actually ranked higher than Dray last year in pace (seconds per possession) on&#x2F;off which is why separating Draymond himself is so difficult.

As long as you pair it with some success measurement, like re-reports from people within a short time, or work caused by the implementation. Or just feedback from the rest. Someone has to put down code to make the feature work in the end.<p>But this changes when you get more specialized and overall more experienced. If we bring a new technology into the team, my productivity based on the first metric will drop to zero. I&#x27;ll be busy supporting other people. Or, the incidents on my desk will be far more weird ones. Other people get clear click paths and an exception. I had to debug JVM crashes due to faulty hardware. That took a bit longer than an afternoon in a debugger and adding an if-statement, if I may embellish a bit.<p>But that&#x27;s why soft skills become important.

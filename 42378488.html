Many people had contributed their efforts to the Redis project for free - both in terms of code but also in advocacy, writing tutorials, publishing example code etc - and when they did that it was under the understanding that project would remain under the same open source license. It honestly felt like a betrayal of trust.<p>2. From a purely selfish point of view, my favourite thing about open source licenses is that they let me know exactly what I&#x27;m allowed to do and build on that software without having to consult a license. Licenses like the new Redis one leave me potentially needing to get my own legal advice depending on what I&#x27;m building on the software. I don&#x27;t want to spend my time, energy or money on that stuff!<p>I do also see these kinds of license trends as harmful to open source generally. It used to be that you could pick an open source project and build a business on it and expect that the project would stay available to you under those well understood terms. That&#x27;s not the case any more - not just because of Redis, there are a number of other high-profile license rug-pulling projects. I&#x27;m sad about that.<p>(And yes, I do understand and dislike the trend of businesses building on open source without contributing back.

For years it was some kind of &quot;dogma&quot;, something one could not even speak about. Then after all the kind of attempts, and following the experiences of MongoDB and others, finally this choice was made.

They decided that the short-term profitability of the company was more important than the project as a whole, the community which had grown around Redis and the future of the software.

People <i>could</i> and <i>did</i> fork. But something far more valuable was lost: the community&#x27;s trust.

I think it has its place, and to me it is an awful lot like postgres and EnterpriseDB, especially if Redis Labs gives its blessing, directly or tacitly, to adding this new vector type to valkey.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42379694" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42379694" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sroussey</span><span>|</span><a href="#42379400">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42379609">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42379713">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42382287">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42379694">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42379694">[21 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Whatâs valkey?</div><br/><div id="42379811" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42379811" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">simonw</span><span>|</span><a href="#42379400">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42379694">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42379779">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42379811">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42379811">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s the Redis fork with the most resources and the most backing.

If it is seen as not being a contract then it might be that the only remedies would be those under copyright law. Those would generally be an injunction ordering defendant to stop infringing and monetary damages. Actual monetary damages would be near zero so plaintiff would probably ask for statutory damages.<p>If it <i>is</i> seen as being a contract then potentially the remedy could include an order that the defendant release their source code. If the GPL infringement was distributing binaries without making source available this would probably be the remedy plaintiff wants.<p>Ordering the defendant to obey the terms of the contract is called &quot;specific performance&quot; and I believe is usually disfavored by courts if monetary damages are sufficient but since infringing GPL generally doesn&#x27;t cause any monetary losses to the copyright owner and the whole point of the contract was to make source available I&#x27;d expect a decent chance plaintiff could get specific performance.<p>Note that this means that it is actually better for GPL to be seen as a contract.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42383740" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42383740" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">madeofpalk</span><span>|</span><a href="#42379400">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42383207">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42383515">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42379511">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42383740">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42383740">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Being radioactive is the reason why it is considered an option.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42379511" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42379511" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jcgrillo</span><span>|</span><a href="#42379400">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42382167">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42385092">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42379511">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42379511">[19 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The question of what constitutes a &quot;service&quot; seems very murky, and although it&#x27;s obviously not the intention of all these source-available, BSL style things, in a dark timeline it seems like there&#x27;s a lot of room for litigious actors to behave very badly.

2. Second: &quot;One thing I particularly liked about the article was that Salvatore explained how he is using the Claude (any Gen AI) in his work.

But nobody serious will use it just because it is free. They will consider other intangible but critical aspects like risks to themselves w.r.t future viability of the project, ability to get custom work done to it or around it, keeping up with hardware and software ecosystem trends etc. These things have second order implications â how healthy the broader developer ecosystem is, is there a broad base of core committers we can hire, how easy it is to upstream our changes, who else is using it at similar scale, criticality, cost efficiency; is commercial support available (sometimes 3rd party commercial business support ecosystem is essential due to regulatory&#x2F;compliance reasons), do hardware vendors actively participate in the open-source community and ensure it runs well on their hardware etc.<p>Apart from free users, even the contributors have very similar considerations for their participation.<p>But the starting point is the license â it has to be a clear and unambiguous open-source license that is widely well-understood â especially w.r.t the blast-radius or infection radius of the license. Does it infect the library code that is linked&#x2F;loaded into it? Does it infect the independent binary&#x2F;processes that scaffold around it (say, control-plane, orchestrator, proxy etc)? What are the obligations if it does?
If we have to get lawyers involved to answer these questions because it is a custom license that is vaguely written or it has never been challenged in a court or the license holder is of unknown reputation, these are huge red flags.<p>Another equally important consideration is the motivations of the stewards of the project. While this isn&#x27;t explicitly stated, one cannot be naive about it. Contributors and users will have to consider a gamut of scenarios â best&#x2F;base&#x2F;worst scenarios and make their judgement. With smaller steward organizations, there are one kind of risks while with larger organizations open-sourcing there are other kinds of risks. If they are competitors in some way that&#x27;s another challenge. If there is no natural alignment of use-cases functionally or non-functionally, that&#x27;s another issue etc.<p>With recent changes in Redis, all these things have become less clear and straightforward.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42380321" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42380321" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BeefySwain</span><span>|</span><a href="#42385762">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42378770">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42380321">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42380321">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">All the conversations about SSPL seem to go the same way:<p>- Someone complains about the extra restrictions imposed on AWS (lets be real, it&#x27;s basically just about AWS)<p>- People point out that SSPL is basically AGPL+, and that for the vast vast majority of people it doesn&#x27;t make any difference<p>- People counter that the SSPL is written ambiguously&#x2F;untested in court, and so while it might seem like it&#x27;s AGPL+ and doesn&#x27;t matter for most users, you can&#x27;t rely on that<p>- People complain about rug pulling (valid, IMO)<p>My question is this: Can there be a AGPL+ that is OSI approved?

The engineering teams which build solar plants use them as âan extra set of eyesâ for increased quality control, and they chose ChatGPT. It discovered something to do with cable sizes and efficiency which ended up saving&#x2F;making a lot of money. Iâm sorry I canât be more precise than that, but I know they had a much better result rate with ChatGPT. For my team which is software development, we favour Claude. Itâs obviously rather anecdotal but it has been much better at Go than ChatGPT. For other languages like Python I donât think there is any real difference. If you feed them both the same prompt theyâll often give you an extremely similar output, and neither will consistently be better than the other.<p>So I think itâs mainly to work with the one which works for you.

The SSPL is on the face of it more reasonable than the BSL. It clearly states that it only becomes viral when âoffering a service the value of which entirely or primarily derives from the value of the Programâ. So it seems it should be pretty safe to use Redis as a cache or session store within a larger system. Contrast with hashicorp, which forbids use in any product they consider a competitor.

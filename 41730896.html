The behavioral data suggests that activity of some type will improve cognitive function (main effects of time). Such beneficial effects of activity on the brain have been shown before, and this is generally accepted. However, the authors&#x27; behavioral data doesn&#x27;t show any difference between the dance vs. exercise groups. This means that the study is overall off to a pretty bad start if their goal is to study dance vs. exercise differences...<p>The brain data claims to show that the dance vs. exercise groups showed different levels of improvement in various regions. However, the brain effects are tiny and are probably just random noise (I&#x27;m referring to those red spots, which are very small and almost certainly don&#x27;t reflect proper correction for multiple hypotheses given that the authors effectively tested 1000s or 10000s of different areas). The authors&#x27; claims about BDNF are supported by a p-value of p = .046, and having main conclusions hinge on p-values of p &gt; .01 usually means the conclusions are rubbish.<p>In general, my priors on &quot;we can detect subtle changes in brain matter over a 6-week period&quot; are also very low. Perhaps, a study with this sample size could show that activity of some kind influences the brain over such a short length, but I am extremely skeptical that this type of study could detect differences between dance vs. exercise effects.</div><br/><div id="41738064" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41738064" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kukkeliskuu</span><span>|</span><a href="#41732034">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41739161">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41738064">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41738064">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have done lots of free-form couples dancing (over 20 years, several times per week, some of it in complex styles like argentine tango) and in my first-hand experience the major difference from other kinds of exercise is that you need to harmonize your movements with your partner and music, and you need to improvise.

I&#x27;m looking at Fig. 4 and just by an eyeball test there&#x27;s clear difference in the distributions of the intra-individual BDNF increase. It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s some miniscule variation in the means that they make significant with really small error bars, the actual effect size appears to be notable. Moreover there&#x27;s clearly some effect on the width of the distributions which could support their ultimate conclusion (ex. even if the mean effect is the same, it&#x27;s possible the population-wide ceiling on gains is higher for dance).<p>Now with all that said this could definitely still be a multiple comparisons thing, I&#x27;m just a statistician with no background in neuro-stuff so possibly the BDNF thing is just a bad indicator here. Certainly the behavioral outcomes not showing an interaction difference isn&#x27;t a great sign as you point out, but in my personal and unimportant opinion I would at least say this study would be good justification for a follow-up with a better design and bigger population.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41736823" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41736823" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yellow_postit</span><span>|</span><a href="#41732034">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41736100">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41734824">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41736823">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41736823">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Replicability was my first thought as well.

In my training, I almost never used 100 percent effort. Rather, the muscles were constantly stimulated with similar but different movements, all the time varying the stimulus. The muscles grow in rest.<p>It is very similar to how I have learned to dance. On the social dance floor, there are always limitations (such as other couples, tables, walls, music etc.) that come up. When you are improvising, you need to adjust your movements constantly (varying step length, direction, the movement you are doing etc.).

They both take focus but I think the brain is engaged differently. Especially as lifting is usually one movement and the movement is performed in a short burst. Whereas dance is a long sequence and usually a very different energy profile which is important.

I joined classes alone and it went totally fine. You make friends in the class and if you go dancing regularly, you see the same people, so you start forming a community. Best of all, people who go to the dances are there to dance and not get drunk, so it&#x27;s a great, safe way to meet other people who want to socialize, too.<p>I stopped going regularly after a little over 5 years, mostly because I was plateauing in my dancing and getting bored with it. In my experience, you plateau multiple times, just as with any skill, but you find a way to get better and more creative, but at that point, my heart wasn&#x27;t into improving anymore so I wasn&#x27;t enjoying it as much. I definitely keep telling myself to get back into it, however, because it&#x27;s such a great social outlet.<p>I&#x27;ll also add that it&#x27;s a really great activity because it&#x27;s physical, it&#x27;s creative, and it&#x27;s social. Partner dancing forces you to learn how to work with other people and communicate better. Not everyone you dance with has the same skill level and you might think you&#x27;re doing well communicating (when you&#x27;re leading) but after dancing with several people you find out right away where you&#x27;re not doing a good job.<p>I also did find that it made me more aware of my movements and improved my musicality. I got better at watching other people dance and seeing what movements they made and how they choreographed their &quot;routines&quot;. That kind of tickled a different part of my brain I hadn&#x27;t used before in any other activity. The &quot;plateauing&quot; I mentioned earlier forced me to get better at watching others and repeating what they did as well as seeing what I was doing and trying to change it up if it was getting stale.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41734133" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41734133" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">momojo</span><span>|</span><a href="#41732904">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41734294">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41736181">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41734133">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41734133">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Can I ask how old you are?

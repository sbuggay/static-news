Canada still has a significant English-speaking majority. Even if Québec in isolation has a French-speaking majority, there&#x27;s a very large incentive for French-speaking citizens to learn English because their province is surrounded by primarily Anglophone regions.<p>There are also other factors at play. Montréal has a fairly large community of native English speakers and receives a lot of tourism from Anglophone Canada and the United States due to its status as the largest city in Québec (and second largest in Canada). It also gets a lot of immigrants, many of which are (at least initially) more proficient in English than in French.<p>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m entirely familiar with the situation in Switzerland, but as far as I know the country has four official languages, none of which are English. It also doesn&#x27;t border any English-speaking countries. It seems English is mostly used as a lingua franca for communication between citizens who don&#x27;t otherwise share a language rather than due to the direct presence of native Anglophones. Also, Romansh aside, all national languages of Switzerland (French, German and Italian) are spoken in areas that directly border a country where that language is the national language (France, Italy, Germany&#x2F;Austria). With Switzerland being in the Schengen Area, its linguistic regions may be considered to be part of a much larger individual linguistic communities, which I feel may also diminish the need to learn other languages.</div><br/><div id="42744811" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42744811" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seanmcdirmid</span><span>|</span><a href="#42739182">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42744564">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42742779">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42744811">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42744811">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m entirely familiar with the situation in Switzerland, but as far as I know the country has four official languages, none of which are English.<p>The language of French Switzerland is French.

Why couldn&#x27;t that kind of happen with their Disney competitor?<p>Another thing that might be happening is the literal closing off of the world into two spheres. Western US led and Eastern Chinese led. As we are seeing with BYD, they are taking over all the non western markets(and some western as well) but the US has essentially slammed the door shut on them (they haven&#x27;t actually but made it impossible to enter with their tariffs). Maybe the Disney competitor will take hold in the non western aligned world?<p>Honestly its a shame they are not open or democratic. The idea of watching or even being part of a rising country that is building their empire is fascinating to watch.

I spent an afternoon of PTO training my algorithm a couple years ago and it&#x27;s been great ever since. My partner and I share TikToks with each other all the time and. we shape each other&#x27;s algorithm and interests. Reels fixates too much on your follows and Youtube Shorts is honestly a garbage experience. Both platforms really reward creators building &quot;brands&quot; around their content rather than just being authentic or silly. I treat Reels as the place for polished creators or local businesses who are trying to sell me something and TikTok as the place for content. I find that I get a lot less ragebait surfaced to me than I do on other platforms, though I admit my partner gets more than I do. We both skip those videos quickly and that has helped keep this stuff off our FYP.<p>An important thing to remember is TikTok was one of the first platforms that was <i>opt-in</i> for short-form content. Both Reels and Shorts was foisted upon users who had different expectations of the network and as such had to deal with the impedance mismatch of the existing network and users who didn&#x27;t want short-form content.

Whenever I open it, there is a feed that&#x27;s been curated to me about things I&#x27;m interested in checking out, few new things that are hit or miss (and I like that), and very few infuriating&#x2F;stupid (to me) things.<p>Its recommendation engine is the best I have used. It&#x27;s baffling how shitty YouTube&#x27;s algorithm is. I discover YouTube channels I&#x27;m into form TikTok. Sometimes I&#x27;d discover new (or old) interesting videos from YouTube channels I already follow from TikTok first. For example, I follow Veritasium and 3Blue1Brown on YouTube but I certainly haven&#x27;t watched their full back catalog. YouTube NEVER recommends to me anything from their back catalog. When I&#x27;m in the mood, I have to go to their channel, scroll for a while, then try to find a video I&#x27;d be interested in from the thumbnail&#x2F;title. And once I do, YouTube will re-recommend to me all the videos I have already watched from them (which are already their best performing videos). Rarely would it recommend something new from them.<p>On TikTok, it frequently would pull clips from old Veritasium or 3Blue1Brown videos for me which I&#x27;d get hooked after watching 10 seconds, then hob on YouTube to watch the full video. It&#x27;s insane how bad YouTube recommendation algorithm is. Literally the entire &quot;recommended&quot; section of youtube is stuff I have watched before, or stuff with exactly the same content as things I have watched before.<p>Here is how I find their recommendation algorithm to work:<p>YouTube: Oh you watched (and liked) a brisket smoking video? Here is that video again, and 10 other &quot;brisket smoking videos&quot;. These are just gonna be stuck on your home page for the next couple of weeks now. You need to click on them one by one and mark &quot;not interested&quot; in which case you&#x27;re clearly not interested in BBQ or cooking. Here are the last 10 videos you watched, and some MrBeast videos and some random YouTube drama videos.<p>TikTok: Oh you watched (and liked) a brisket smoking video? How about another BBQ video, a video about smokers and their models, some videos about cookouts and BBQ side dishes, a video about a DIY smoker, another about a DIY backyard project for hosting BBQ cookouts, a video about how smoke flavors food, a video about the history of BBQ in the south, a video about a BBQ joint in your city (or where ever my VPN is connected from), etc. And if you&#x27;re not interested in any of those particular types, it learns from how long you spend watching the video and would branch more or less in that direction in the future.<p>Another example is search. Search for &quot;sci fi books recommendations&quot;:<p>YouTube: Here are 3 videos about Sci-Fi books. Here are 4 brisket smoking videos. Here are some lost hikers videos (because you watched a video about a lost hiker 3 weeks ago). Here are 3 videos about a breaking story in the news. Here are 2 videos about sci-fi books, and another 8 about brisket.<p>TikTok: Here is a feed of videos about Sci-Fi books. And I&#x27;ll make sure to throw in sci-fi book videos into your curated feed every now and then to see if you&#x27;re interested.</div><br/><div id="42743443" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42743443" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">toddmorey</span><span>|</span><a href="#42742292">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42743280">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42745111">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42743443">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42743443">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a really good writeup.

So let&#x27;s take an absurd extreme. The government designates a 1x1 mile &quot;free speech zone&quot; in the middle of Wyoming and says you&#x27;re not allowed to speak anywhere else. You have the same amount of free speech as you did before, right?<p>Another extreme, let&#x27;s say the government declared that you may speak freely but only by filling out a web form routed to Dave. Great guy. I mean they haven&#x27;t technically taken away your right to speak? And someone will hear what you say.<p>Both of these would he flagrant violations of 1A as I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d agree. But what this means is that implicit to 1A the government has limits on how many places it can deny you speech and limits on how much they can deny you an audience. And you can&#x27;t hide behind the &quot;well it&#x27;s just divestiture not a ban&quot; because the courts aren&#x27;t blind to POSIWID.<p>So the more nuanced question is does banning TikTok meaningfully affect the ability of Americans to speak. And I think because of how large they are you could answer yes to this question. Americans know exactly what they&#x27;re signing up for with their TT accounts and want to post there. TikTok but owned by an American would be legal so the platform itself isn&#x27;t the issue.

  of Investigation, TikTok can access “any data” stored in a
  consenting user’s “contact list”—including names, photos,
  and other personal information about unconsenting third
  parties. Ibid. (emphasis added). And because the record
  shows that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) can require TikTok’s parent company “to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,” there

It basically just says that the app asks for the user&#x27;s contact list, and that if the user grants it, the phone OS overshares information. That&#x27;s really thin as evidence of wrong-doing. It doesn&#x27;t even say that this capability is currently coded into the app. This sounds more like an Android&#x2F;iOS problem - why is the contact sharing all or nothing?

Gorsuch goes onto say<p>&quot;But before seeking to impose that remedy, the coordinate branches spent years in negotiations with TikTok exploring alternatives and ultimately found them wanting. Ante, at 4. And from what I can glean from the record, that judgment was well founded.&quot;<p>Maybe that was one of the alternatives. I wasn’t on the task force but if I was asked to then I would have went one on one with their tech lead’s and asked them to stop collecting this.<p>But it seems it is greater than that. How you interact with it, your likes and dislikes can be used as a fingerprint and against you.<p>This fingerprint can then be used against firesteelrain some time in the prophetic future.<p>Gorsuch says<p>“To be sure, assessing exactly what a foreign adversary may do in the future implicates &#x27;delicate&#x27; and &#x27;complex&#x27; judgments about foreign affairs and requires &#x27;large elements of prophecy.&#x27; Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 111 (1948) (Jackson, J., for the Court). But the record the government has amassed in these cases after years of study supplies compelling reason“<p>Then he says this.<p>“ Consider some of the alternatives. Start with our usual and preferred remedy under the First Amendment: more speech. Supra, at 2. However helpful that might be, the record shows that warning users of the risks associated with giving their data to a foreign-adversary-controlled application would do nothing to protect nonusers’ data. 2 App. 659–660; supra, at 3. Forbidding TikTok’s domestic operations from sending sensitive data abroad might seem another option. But even if Congress were to impose serious criminal penalties on domestic TikTok employees who violate a data-sharing ban, the record suggests that would do little to deter the PRC from exploiting TikTok to steal Americans’ data. See 1 App. 214 (noting threats from “malicious code, backdoor vulnerabilities, surreptitious surveillance, and other problematic activities tied to source code development” in the PRC); 2 App. 702 (“[A]gents of the PRC would not fear monetary or criminal penalties in the United States”). The record also indicates that the “size” and “complexity” of TikTok’s “underlying software” may make it impossible for law enforcement to detect violations. Id., at 688–689; see also id., at 662. Even setting all these challenges aside, any new compliance regime could raise separate constitutional concerns—for instance, by requiring the government to surveil Americans’ data to ensure that it isn’t illicitly flowing overseas. Id., at 687 (suggesting that effective enforcement of a data-export ban might involve).”<p>And the nail in the coffin is this<p>“All I can say is that, at this time and under these constraints, the problem appears real and the response to it not unconstitutional. As persuaded as I am of the wisdom of Justice Brandeis in Whitney and Justice Holmes in Abrams, their cases are not ours. See supra, at 2. Speaking with and in favor of a foreign adversary is one thing. Allowing a foreign adversary to spy on Americans is another.”</div><br/><div id="42745301" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42745301" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway199956</span><span>|</span><a href="#42739868">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42745092">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42742799">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42745301">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42745301">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Of course if the app have done anything seriously illegal it would not have been necessary to bring this law to ban it, because existing laws would have sufficed to do it.<p>Perhaps because US government wanted to do it despite TikTok not breaking any serious provisions of law this law has been made.<p>It feels like a sleight of hand

China is now grappling with sluggish GDP growth, declining fertility, youth unemployment, re-shoring&#x2F;friend-shoring, a property crisis, popular discontent with authoritarian overreach (e.g. zero COVID and HK), and increasingly concentrated power under chairman-for-life Xi. Their military spending has hockey-sticked in the past two decades and they&#x27;re churning out ships and weapons like nobody&#x27;s business. He realizes that the demographic and economic windows of opportunity are finite for military action against Taiwan (and by extension its allies like the US and Japan). The Chinese military&#x27;s shenanigans in the South China Sea with artificial islands, EEZ violations, and so forth in combination with Xi&#x27;s rhetorical sabre-rattling in domestic speeches don&#x27;t paint a pretty picture.<p>Before somebody like this poster calls me a &quot;war-mongering [liar]&quot; or something similar let me point out that this is the opinion of academics [1], not US DoD officials or politicians. I have nothing but reverence for China&#x27;s people and culture. I&#x27;d love to visit but unfortunately it&#x27;s my understanding that I&#x27;d have to install tracking software on my phone and check in with police every step of the way. This type of asymmetry between our governments is why this ban has legs.<p>With the gift of hindsight I think it&#x27;s safe to say that neoliberal policy (in the literal sense of the term, not the hacky partisan one) is a double-edged sword that got us to where we are today. To say that the US-China relationship is sunshine and puppies is ignorant of the facts.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foreignpolicy.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;02&#x2F;04&#x2F;china-war-military-taiwan-us-asia-xi-escalation-crisis&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foreignpolicy.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;02&#x2F;04&#x2F;china-war-military-taiw...</a></div><br/><div id="42743196" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42743196" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dmoy</span><span>|</span><a href="#42739868">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42742526">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42743592">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42743196">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42743196">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I&#x27;d love to visit but unfortunately it&#x27;s my understanding that I&#x27;d have to install tracking software on my phone and check in with police every step of the way.<p>Uh, what?

But we really don&#x27;t like America. Really, if the Americans had not fought with us in Korea in the early days of our country, prevented us from liberating Taiwan, provoked a trade war, challenged our sovereignty in the South China Sea, and bullied our Huawei, would we Chinese hate them?<p>And that&#x27;s what Chinese netziens agree without controversy on one of their biggest social media sites. What about the CCP here? Well if we look at Wang Huning, Chief Ideologue of the CCP, he is explicitly an postliberal who draws from the Schmittian rejection of liberal heterogenity, which he sees as inherently unstable, in favour of a strong, homogenous and centralized state based on traditional values in order to guarantee stability. And if it that&#x27;s just internally, how do you think a fundamental rejection of heterogenity translates to foreign policy? So yes, whether you think China is a problem, China certainly thinks you are a problem.</div><br/><div id="42741923" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42741923" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">popinman322</span><span>|</span><a href="#42739868">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42741636">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42741867">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42741923">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42741923">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s always very interesting to see people pull out threads with low like counts (like 12k) and claim that central idea of the post is widely held.<p>We&#x27;re talking about platforms with tens of millions of users; wide appeal is at least a quarter million likes, with mass appeal being at least a million.

Myth: TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance Ltd., is Chinese owned.<p>Fact: TikTok’s parent company ByteDance Ltd. was founded by Chinese entrepreneurs, but today, roughly sixty percent of the company is beneficially owned by global institutional investors such as Carlyle Group, General Atlantic, and Susquehanna International Group. An additional twenty percent of the company is owned by ByteDance employees around the world, including nearly seven thousand Americans. The remaining twenty percent is owned by the company’s founder, who is a private individual and is not part of any state or government entity.

Interestingly, many of the most destructive revolutions happened after the widespread use of radio.<p>Of course the Internet isn&#x27;t nearly as bad, but most people are completely unable to even consider a view outside of their indoctrination bubble.</div><br/><div id="42740580" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42740580" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway199956</span><span>|</span><a href="#42739868">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42740510">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42742782">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42740580">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42740580">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As far as first ammendment it does make no difference if it is print or voice or online service.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42742782" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42742782" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yieldcrv</span><span>|</span><a href="#42739868">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42740510">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42740076">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42742782">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42742782">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Because it has the option for selling<p>If the option wasnt there, it would have stricter first amendment scrutiny<p>They could have still banned it other ways though<p>and the first amendment aspect is also torn apart in other ways in the court ruling</div><br/></div></div><div id="42740076" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42740076" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">iLoveOncall</span><span>|</span><a href="#42739868">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42742782">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42743253">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42740076">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42740076">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">TikTok doesn&#x27;t do speech.

So any discussion of this being a matter of national security just rings hollow.</div><br/><div id="42744026" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42744026" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">antasvara</span><span>|</span><a href="#42743253">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42743663">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42744351">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42744026">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42744026">[17 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I worry less about the data and more about how a <i>lot</i> of kids, teens, and young adults get their news from TikTok (and social media in general).<p>That&#x27;s the real value of TikTok.

It&#x27;s a huge app with many many different niches that have their own little communities. Mostly, the algorithm has decided that what I need to see is woodworking videos, car videos, and some dad jokes. But there certainly is a very interesting undercurrent of &quot;information&quot;. One really interesting wave was when the TikTok ban passed Congress. Suddenly my feed was filled with absolutely random people saying how bad this is and how it just doesn&#x27;t make sense, etc. Like if you are an influencer on a platform that just got banned, of course you&#x27;ll have some feelings about it. But interestingly most people who do regularly show up (the woodworkers, car guys, etc.) who do have big followings pretty much didn&#x27;t talk about it. Even this week when the ban is about to happen, the popular and established accounts that aren&#x27;t politics-focused are not talking about it. But now there is a new wave of completely random people talking about &quot;how much is the US government freaking out that we are all moving to Red Note?&quot; And at this point I don&#x27;t trust that all of them are actual humans, let alone humans who haven&#x27;t been paid, or if they are AI-generated personas meant to really overtly drive people like me to the new app.<p>My point isn&#x27;t that there is some grand conspiracy here, just that if you wanted to have outsized influence on people who are there just for entertainment, you could do it and make it look organic. Inception has to be the target&#x27;s idea and all that.<p>In a similar vein I see talking heads of people in their kitchens contemplate world issues. Russia&#x2F;Ukraine, Israel&#x2F;Palestine, life in China: you can get in-depth opinions on all those issues from a hairdresser in Nebraska or a mechanic in Michigan, and they all will present them well enough. So I think there is something there.<p>But the clear damn solution is to pass laws that prohibit a bunch of this stuff across the board. The fact that Instagram Reels can do exactly what TikTok is doing but with ties to a different world power makes this ban seem shameless. Ban them all. Or none. Or regulate them like they should be regulated. But don&#x27;t pretend like this security theater is somehow going to fix anything meaningful.</div><br/><div id="42744296" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42744296" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">boredtofears</span><span>|</span><a href="#42743253">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42744161">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42744885">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42744296">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42744296">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A sibling of mine who gets a significant portion of their income through their Tiktok following confessed to me recently that they completely understand why they are shutting it down.<p>Apparently influencers get a lot of unsolicited pressure to take stances on things like Palestine even if they&#x27;re just a crafting influencer.</div><br/><div id="42744334" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42744334" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">IgorPartola</span><span>|</span><a href="#42743253">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42744296">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42744885">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42744334">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42744334">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Unsolicited pressure from whom and what form does it take?</div><br/><div id="42744350" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42744350" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">boredtofears</span><span>|</span><a href="#42743253">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42744334">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42744885">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42744350">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42744350">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Other accounts on the app. Mostly comments from my understanding.</div><br/><div id="42744541" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42744541" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">slg</span><span>|</span><a href="#42743253">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42744350">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42744885">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42744541">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42744541">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">i.e. peer pressure that exists absolutely everywhere and is in no way exclusive to TikTok.</div><br/><div id="42744701" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42744701" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">boredtofears</span><span>|</span><a href="#42743253">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42744541">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42744885">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42744701">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42744701">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They don’t get this kind of pressure on YouTube or IG.</div><br/><div id="42744850" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42744850" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">slg</span><span>|</span><a href="#42743253">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42744701">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42744885">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42744850">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42744850">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So what are you actually claiming here?

They learned the exact buildings where they go to work every day as well as who they met with and their home addresses. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;dispatch&#x2F;how-bellingcat-unmasked-putins-assassins" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;dispatch&#x2F;how-bellingcat-unmas...</a><p>Volunteer open-source researchers also used these readily available data sources to identify and publicly out several previously unknown Russian sleeper agents who&#x27;d spent years hiding in Western countries while building cover identities and making contacts. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bellingcat.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2022&#x2F;08&#x2F;25&#x2F;socialite-widow-jeweller-spy-how-a-gru-agent-charmed-her-way-into-nato-circles-in-italy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bellingcat.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2022&#x2F;08&#x2F;25&#x2F;socialite-widow-j...</a><p>To your point, if volunteer internet hobbyists can use commercial broker data to identify and track elite Russian assassins and undercover sleeper agents, <i>in Russia</i> and around the world, China having direct access to US Tiktok data, which Tiktok sells to anyone through brokers anyway, doesn&#x27;t seem like an existential intelligence threat to our national security. Forcing TikTok to divest Chinese ownership would, at most, make Chinese intelligence go through an extra step and pay a little for the data.<p>If politicians were really worried about foreign adversaries aggregating comprehensive data profiles on everyone, just addressing China&#x27;s access to TikTok is a side show distraction. Why didn&#x27;t they pass legislation banning all major social media services from selling or sharing certain kinds of data and requiring the anonymization of other kinds of data to prevent anyone aggregating composite profiles across multiple social platforms or data brokers? That would actually reduce the threat profile somewhat.<p>Obviously, they aren&#x27;t doing that because the FBI, CIA, NSA, TSA, INS, IRS, Homeland Security and their Five Eyes international partners are aggressively buying data broker info on all US residents at massive scale every day and aggregating it into comprehensive profiles - all with no warrants, probable cause or oversight. The US Constitution doesn&#x27;t apply because it&#x27;s <i>just</i> private commercial data, not government data. Any such law would have to explicitly carve out exceptions allowing US and allied intelligence agencies to continue doing this. Alternatively, they could put such use under the secret FISA intelligence court. US intelligence has thoroughly co-opted FISA oversight but jumping through the FISA hoop is extra work and filling out the paperwork to be rubber-stamped is annoying. They much prefer remaining <i>completely</i> unregulated and unsupervised like they are now, collecting everything on everyone all the time without limit. They&#x27;ve certainly already automated collecting all the data they want from every broker.<p>So yeah... let&#x27;s very publicly make a big show of slapping <i>just</i> China and <i>only</i> about TikTok - and loudly proclaim we really did something to protect citizen privacy and reduce our national data aggregation attack surface. This is the intelligence community cleverly offering a fig leaf of plausible deniability to politicians who can now claim they &quot;did something&quot;, while leaving the US intelligence community free to pillage every last shred of citizen privacy in secret.</div><br/><div id="42744075" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42744075" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gunian</span><span>|</span><a href="#42743253">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42743984">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42744752">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42744075">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42744075">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This sounds super cool where can I get&#x2F;buy this data?

If we allow theirs, our industry is essentially fighting with one hand tied behind its back.<p>2. China controls the algorithm for determining who sees what. This gives them tremendous ability to influence public opinion, and consequently public elections. That cannot be allowed to stand as long as China is hostile to the US.<p>3. China gets extremely detailed data about the interests and proclivities of millions of Americans, including military personnel and elected officials. This data is not otherwise publicly available and can be used for blackmail and other manipulation. Which is completely unacceptable when we have no mechanism to punish them from doing this short of global nuclear war.<p>Even ignoring the enormous threat to national sovereignty, TikTok has no redeeming qualities. It&#x27;s an addiction machine that profits off people wasting away in front a screen. That alone is not a reason to ban it, but it sure does make the case stronger.<p>Banning TikTok is a clear-cut positive for the American people.

Be aware that there is a large propaganda machine which uses this tactic to dehumanize Palestinians in order to justify a genocide against them.<p>Now if you wanted to compare atrocities—which honestly you shouldn’t—you would compare the Palestinian children that were brutalized both in the Gaza genocide, and in any one of the number of IDF incursions into Gaza and the West Bank before and after oct 7. That is compare victims to one side, to the victims of the other side.<p>But people generally don’t pick sides like that. They don‘t evaluate the atrocities committed by one armed group to the atrocities committed by the other and favor one over the other. And they certainly don‘t favor one civilian group over another based on the actions of their armed groups. People much more simply react to atrocities as they happen. And Israel has committed enough atrocities during the Gaza genocide that social media will be reacting—both in anger and horror—for a long time to come.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42740554" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42740554" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">soramimo</span><span>|</span><a href="#42738908">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42740219">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42743207">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42740369">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42740554">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42740554">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Bravo, perfect summary of the issue at hand.<p>It&#x27;ll be revealing to see which political actors come out in favor of keeping tiktok around.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42740369" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42740369" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lvl155</span><span>|</span><a href="#42738908">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42740219">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42740554">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42744457">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42740369">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42740369">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Nail in the head with reciprocity.

Technically those laws only apply to interstate or international commerce.<p>There are even supreme court cases discussing this:<p>&gt;Congress uses different modifiers to the word “commerce” in the design and enactment of its statutes. The phrase “affecting commerce” indicates Congress’ intent to regulate to the outer limits of its authority under the Commerce Clause. [...] Considering the usual meaning of the word “involving,” and the pro-arbitration purposes of the FAA, Allied-Bruce held the “word ‘involving,’ like ‘affecting,’ signals an intent to exercise Congress’ commerce power to the full.” Ibid. Unlike those phrases, however, the general words “in commerce” and the specific phrase “engaged in commerce” are understood to have a more limited reach. In Allied-Bruce itself the Court said the words “in commerce” are “oftenfound words of art” [...] The Court’s reluctance to accept contentions that Congress used the words “in commerce” or “engaged in commerce” to regulate to the full extent of its commerce power rests on sound foundation, as it affords objective and consistent significance to the meaning of the words Congress uses when it defines the reach of a statute.[0]<p>[0] Circuit City Stores, Inc. v.

In the US, we generally hew to the rule of &quot;party presentation,&quot; which generally provides that courts will consider the parties&#x27; arguments, not make up new ones on their own.<p>TikTok&#x27;s claim was that application of the statute in question to it violated the First Amendment&#x27;s clause that &quot;Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech.&quot; The Supreme Court has considered the interpretation and application of that clause in...well, a whole lot of cases. TikTok asked the court to apply the logic of certain of those precedents to rule in its favor and enjoin the statute. It did not, however, ask the court to reconsider those precedents or interpret the First Amendment anew.<p>Since the court was not asked to do so, it&#x27;s no surprise that it didn&#x27;t.<p>Second, as noted, the court has literally decades&#x27; worth of cases fleshing out the meaning of this clause and applying it in particular circumstances. Every textualist, so far as I&#x27;m aware, generally supports following the court&#x27;s existing precedents interpreting the Constitution unless and until they are overruled.<p>Third, even if one is of the view that the Court ought to consider the text anew in every case, without deferring to its prior rulings interpreting the text, this would have been a particularly inappropriate case for it to do so. A party seeking an injunction, as TikTok was, has to show a strong likelihood of success on the merits. That generally entails showing that you win under existing precedent. A court&#x27;s expedited consideration of a request for preliminary relief is not an appropriate time to broach a new theory of what the law requires. The court doesn&#x27;t have the time to give it the consideration required, and asking the court to abrogate its precedents is inconsistent with the standard for a preliminary injunction, which contemplates only a preview of the ultimate legal question, not a full-blown resolution of it.<p>Fourth, what exactly was the court supposed to do with the text in question, which is &quot;abridging the freedom of speech&quot;? The question here is whether the statute here, as applied to TikTok, violates that text. Well, it depends on what &quot;the freedom of speech&quot; means and perhaps what &quot;abridging&quot; means. It&#x27;s only natural that a court would look to precedent in answering the question. Precedent develops over time, fleshing out (or &quot;liquidating,&quot; to use Madison&#x27;s term) the meaning and application of ambiguous or general language. Absent some compelling argument that precedent got the meaning wrong, that sort of case-by-case development of the law is how our courts have always functioned--and may be, according to some scholars, itself a requirement of originalism.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42739874" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42739874" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">1980phipsi</span><span>|</span><a href="#42738557">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42741750">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42739342">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42739874">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42739874">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What are you talking about?

And now both Trump and Biden, as well as Congress, are shying away from actually enforcing the ban.<p>• In August 2020, President Trump issued an Executive
Order finding that “the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in
[China] continues to threaten the national security, foreign
policy, and economy of the United States.”<p>• President Trump determined
that TikTok raised particular concerns, noting that the
platform “automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users” and is susceptible to being used to
further the interests of the Chinese Government.<p>• Just days after issuing his initial Executive Order, President Trump ordered ByteDance Ltd. to divest all interests
and rights in any property “used to enable or support
ByteDance’s operation of the TikTok application in the
United States,” along with “any data obtained or derived
from” U. S. TikTok users.<p>• Throughout 2021 and 2022, ByteDance Ltd. negotiated
with Executive Branch officials to develop a national security agreement that would resolve those concerns. Executive Branch officials ultimately determined, however, that
ByteDance Ltd.’s proposed agreement did not adequately
“mitigate the risks posed to U. S. national security interests.” 2 App. 686. Negotiations stalled, and the parties
never finalized an agreement.<p>• Against this backdrop, Congress enacted the Protecting
Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications
Act.</div><br/><div id="42740159" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42740159" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">est</span><span>|</span><a href="#42738648">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42739875">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42740159">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42740159">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A simpler explaination, politicians were worried that Tiktok may influence mit-term and presidential elections, but it turns out a good place to run campaigns.<p>Then Gaza happened.</div><br/><div id="42741442" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42741442" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">suraci</span><span>|</span><a href="#42738648">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42740159">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42739875">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42741442">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42741442">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ouch</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42739875" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42739875" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mplanchard</span><span>|</span><a href="#42738648">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42740159">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42743992">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42739875">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42739875">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">2025, despite all this going on for four years, Gorusch complains bitterly about having had to rule on the case in less than a fortnight</div><br/></div></div><div id="42743992" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42743992" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">IAmGraydon</span><span>|</span><a href="#42738648">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42739875">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42738474">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42743992">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42743992">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The whole thing, including Biden setting the deadline for literally the last day of his presidency, strikes me as extremely odd.

And unlike other countries, the Chinese government exercises a great deal of direct control over major companies (like ByteDance). If TikTok was controlled by the Russian government would we even be having this conversation? (Ironically most Americans are freaked out about Russia, but when it comes to global politics, China is the much greater threat to the U.S.)<p>I think social media in general - including by US companies - does more harm than good to society and concentrates too much power and influence in the hands of a few (Musk, Zuck, etc.) So this isn&#x27;t to say that &quot;US social media is good&quot;. But from a national security standpoint, Congress&#x27; decision makes sense.<p>2- If China allowed free access to US social media apps to its citizens then it might have a leg to stand on. But those are blocked (along with much of the Western internet) or heavily filtered&#x2F;censored. TikTok itself is banned in China.

And we know that the US gov is not beyond spying on its citizens (Snowden, NSA). However, there are still fairly robust safeguards in place in the US by virtual of the political structure, to make this much less likely to happen. Those same safeguards make it unlikely that while Trump and Elon would almost certainly exercise the degree of control that Xi has if they could, they are prevented from the worst by the structure in place.<p>The problem in China is that there weren&#x27;t strong safeguards to prevent a totalitarian control (CCP is supposed to be democratic within itself in that leaders are elected, though it&#x27;s all restricted to party members, of course), and when Xi came into power he was able, within a few years, to sweep aside all opposition, primarily through &quot;anti-corruption campaigns&quot;. So he now has a degree of control and power that would be a wet dream for Trump. (And you should see the level of adulation in the newspapers there.)<p>Now in the US we have a separate problem, and that is we have a system where unelected people like Elon and Zuckerberg, Murdoch, etc., exercise a tremendous amount of influence over the population through their policies and who are pursuing a marriage between authoritarian politics and big business (by the way, there&#x27;s a term  for this, it&#x27;s called &quot;fascism&quot;).

Over the past few decades, I have slowly become increasingly skeptical about true, unfettered democracy being the best form of government. In the past, although the level of education probably was worse than now, the fact that people got their news from rather centralized sources controlled by elites acted as a &quot;nutjob filter&quot;. With social networks, we are witnessing what should be the true power of democracy (people electing candidates in spite of what the elites think), but it can easily create monsters.<p>I just wish the Western world would drop the hypocrisy in this respect, and stop claiming to defend more democracy than it actually does. A relevant problem is that democracy is often used as an easy excuse to keep people content. Singapore is a hugely successful country in most respects, with better quality of life than most Western countries, but we shouldn&#x27;t take example from it because we have democracy! China is constantly growing and improving the quality of life of their citizens, is still behind most of the West in that respect but on the path to overtake us, but it doesn&#x27;t matter, we have democracy! Maybe if we weren&#x27;t constantly claiming the moral high ground, when as you mentioned our own democracies are at most relative and the difference with more authoritarian countries is a matter of degree; we could be more self-critical and focus on actually fixing things.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42738828" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42738828" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mbrumlow</span><span>|</span><a href="#42738581">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42739051">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42738779">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42738828">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42738828">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I thought it was less about the data and more about the control China had on what Americans saw, and how that could influence Americans.<p>If China could effectively influence the American populations opinions, how would that not be bad?</div><br/><div id="42739602" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42739602" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">spencerflem</span><span>|</span><a href="#42738581">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42738828">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42739165">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42739602">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42739602">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Specifically, US citizens can see what&#x27;s happening in Palestine</div><br/></div></div><div id="42739165" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42739165" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ossobuco</span><span>|</span><a href="#42738581">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42738828">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42739602">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42738779">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42739165">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42739165">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If the reality of things, the simple truth, is able to &quot;influence&quot; Americans does it really matter who brought that truth up?<p>Do you prefer Americans to be ignorant about certain topics, or to be informed even if that comes at the cost of reduced approval for the government?</div><br/><div id="42739673" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42739673" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BobaFloutist</span><span>|</span><a href="#42738581">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42739165">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42738779">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42739673">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42739673">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What if, and hear me out, China didn&#x27;t limit its propaganda to the truth?</div><br/><div id="42739829" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42739829" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ossobuco</span><span>|</span><a href="#42738581">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42739673">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42738779">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42739829">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42739829">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sounds like a great opportunity for the US government to inform the people on what&#x27;s the actual truth.

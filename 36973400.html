If I’d been given a score, it wouldn’t have stopped me signing up and getting my own account to save the conversation I’d just had. I did sign up but only in the spirit of the fact you want feedback. If it hadn’t come from here I would have abandoned at this point and not come back. Sad but true.<p>So when I finally did get in, I still didn’t get my fluency score and that conversation was gone forever. I’m left now really wanting to know how I did, but I’ll never know.<p>I did a quick second conversation and then went straight for the score after a couple of rounds.

It responds well when the my transcript is gibberish (my pronunciation is not perfect).I know some people will point out that it lacks phonetic feedback.

Fast feedbacks:
- If you don&#x27;t know what PrettyPolly is saying you close the conversation and that&#x27;s bad for PrettyPolly (which is being less used) and for the learner (sad mood because you can&#x27;t handle a conversation after days of learning) so maybe think about some difficulty levels? (I think you can handle it in the prompt of chatgpt) or I read in the comments about the translations.
- When I click the button to stop my microphone, the user doesn&#x27;t have any feedback of what it&#x27;s happening, so maybe show a loading spinner and block all the buttons?<p>Btw well done!

I don&#x27;t get it.<p>Yeah. I can see that. Let me see if I can expand.<p>1. Keigo falls into the category of “specific purpose” (SP) language. SP language can be relatively simple things like tourism language, or it can be very deep and technical like scientific, medical, engineering, etc. SP language is typically taught and learned on a need to know basis, and it’s totally possible to be highly fluent (usually measured in terms of general proficiency) and <i>not</i> know anything about SP language.<p>2. Keigo (and this is <i>way</i> more than basic formal and honorific language) is used in very specific situations. As a foreigner, in almost all cases that matter, there will be an interpreter or the foreigner will be trained in keigo.<p>3. For reference, I think that most of the keigo that I would recommend a non-native speaker learn can be found at this link (it’s a small and easy to learn list):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fluentu.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;japanese&#x2F;japanese-keigo&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fluentu.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;japanese&#x2F;japanese-keigo&#x2F;</a><p>Furthermore, I think that most of this language is more useful receptively (listening and reading) and will almost never need to be produced (spoken or written).<p>4. As far as proficiency goes, most keigo would be ILR 5 &#x2F; CEFR C2, with the basics linked above being ILR 4 &#x2F; CEFR C1 (used dynamically… much lower as memorized set phrases). When you’re at that level and needing keigo, you know you are lacking in keigo and make an effort to learn it. Before that would probably be a learning sequencing error (other than nerdy curiosity).<p>Beyond learning the content in the link above, most foreigners will not find themselves in the context of needing to know or use keigo. As special purpose language, it should really only be pursued if necessary. Otherwise, the knowledge learned will most likely be forgotten due to lack of use, or it will be used awkwardly and possibly inappropriately (as I mentioned before).<p>If it’s just a nerd itch to scratch, then go for it. For most people, I think there are more compelling aspects of Japanese to spend time on.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36982527" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36982527" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vore</span><span>|</span><a href="#36976934">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36982388">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36982980">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36977006">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36982527">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36982527">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s a matter of priority - you can get by fine without using keigo, and instead of learning all the weird intricacies of keigo you could go learn something more practical for day-to-day use first (even native Japanese speakers complain about keigo, e.g. use of manual keigo).

Neat little app!<p>I was commenting elsewhere that I was super happy that Bard t had opened up foreign languages recently.  That way I could get my kids to practice their foreign languages.  But bard was not great, and prompt was not as intuitive as yours!<p>Click to talk.  Click to stop. Great!<p>I&#x27;ll be using your app.  Great idea! Keep UX simple that even a 5 yr old can figure it out!</div><br/></div></div><div id="36981996" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36981996" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TheRoque</span><span>|</span><a href="#36981969">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36982486">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36981996">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36981996">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I love it ! It&#x27;s very cool. I was thinking of doing the same kind of thing too. I&#x27;ll throw here some ideas that I thought would be cool also:
- adaptative level: just gradually starts to add more vocabulary in the conversations. I would assume an LLM already knows by design the most common and the most rare worsts
- remembers past vocabulary, and uses more the vocabulary you struggle with
- remembers grammar concepts, ideally makes a brief summary of a new concept, and refreshes your memory if it&#x27;s a concept you&#x27;ve already seen, but forgot.<p>I currently struggle learning Korean because so much of the language uses particles, and they all look the same to me. I think I would greatly benefit a tool that tells me &quot;hey ! you&#x27;ve seen this concept before, look: ___&quot; and by repetition give reinforce my grammar knowledge<p>This is how I would see the ideal language learning companion</div><br/></div></div><div id="36982486" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36982486" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">patrikbraborec</span><span>|</span><a href="#36981996">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36982716">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36982486">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36982486">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In the first paragraph is &quot;Select your desired language in the app.&quot;.

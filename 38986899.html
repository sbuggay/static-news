(I&#x27;m not talking about microcap companies).<p>The PE model is:
- buy company with debt.
- after purchase company assumes the debt (pays off PE company) and pays further fees to acquirer
- company therefore cannot make a profit, cuts staff which cuts output over time
- company goes bankrupt<p>This is the canonical business model from the big PE companies like Bain (Romney), KKR, Blackstone, CVC, Carlyle, etc.</div><br/><div id="38987850" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38987850" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MostlyStable</span><span>|</span><a href="#38987339">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38987576">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38987906">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38987850">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38987850">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">-edit- I realized that part of it is that you are conflating &quot;the big PE firms&quot; and &quot;all of PE&quot;. I guess the TL:DR of my comment is: don&#x27;t&#x27; do that. The big firms are not all of PE and you should probably avoid ascribing what they do to all of PE as a category. Ok, the rest is my original comment.<p>You just can&#x27;t generalize like that. My step dad was brought on as the CEO of a small Ag manufacturing company when it was acquired by a PE firm. He is an engineer. He&#x27;s been in charge now for close to 10 years. He has developed new products, invested in procedures and protocols, and in general focused on an increase in quality and repeatability of procedures while bringing new products into development. He cares deeply about the company (and has in fact tried at least once to buy it from the PE firm)<p>This might very well be a non-central example (I certainly don&#x27;t have industry wide stats to argue either way), but the point is that there is nothing <i>inherent</i> to PE that means companies have to be cut to the bone and stripped for parts. Yes, it absolutely can and does happen, but it&#x27;s not <i>because</i> it&#x27;s PE that&#x27;s doing it.<p>I&#x27;m fully willing to believe that the big PE firms that everyone thinks of when they make statements like yours have exactly the track record you claim. But it&#x27;s not <i>because</i> they are PE. Smaller PE firms like the one my step dad works for is proof-by-existence that responsible PE is not an oxymoron.</div><br/><div id="38987938" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38987938" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">KerrAvon</span><span>|</span><a href="#38987339">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38987850">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38987906">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38987938">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38987938">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">PE is notorious for buying firms with debt and then driving them into bankruptcy by loading them with that debt.

As the corporations grow in value so do the shares, naturally.<p>OTOH once the <i>market</i> has been established, and especially in case it grows faster than the underlying value for a long enough period of time (like longer than one human lifetime, or longer than a single business career[0]), then a sizable amount of &quot;investment&quot; capital can end up manipulating the system to extract established value through their trading[1].  Especially when it comes to things like voting shares and mergers &amp; acquisitions.  Probably the longer a corporation has been publicly traded can figure prominently since that can be a corporation living longer than a human lifetime too.<p>So rather than <i>investing value beneficially</i>, you end up with large chunks of capital actively working to <i>extract value parasitically</i>[2], which is like a double-whammy, and eventually the stock exchange and the market it spawned are not working as intended at all.<p>Maybe just the opposite.<p>IOOW with Boeing the value was lost a long time ago with an unfavorable merger, and every <i>stakeholder</i> has been doing without ever since.  It&#x27;s just becoming unbearably impossible to ignore any more.<p>It just so happens that with an aircraft company, it&#x27;s not only the shareholders, employees, and customers of Boeing who make up the majority of stakeholders.  The flying public (who pays for it all to begin with) participates in far greater numbers and depends on the product aircraft with more of a life-or-death risk factor than the stakeholders who are on the financial receiving end.<p>And it all comes down to integrity.<p>Some business operators are still traditionally astute enough to create value where everyone financially involved gets their money&#x27;s worth.<p>Others never will be able to accomplish this, and lots of them know who they are from the beginning and have had a lifetime focusing their efforts on ways not to give people their money&#x27;s worth.  Sometimes with the most insidious strategies.<p>And that&#x27;s merely from poor integrity, even when ethics are not fully compromised.<p>Now look what happens when the ethics go out the window too . . .<p>Well that whooshed by and most people never saw it coming.<p>[0] where some may rake it in and retire early from a relatively short career.<p>[1] often including long-ago established value or utility that is now irreplaceable economically or legally.<p>[2] from anything smaller or less powerful in their path, with who knows what kind of motivation not aligned with the growing needs of a growing mother country.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38987604" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38987604" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">whatshisface</span><span>|</span><a href="#38987339">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38987576">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38987906">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38988017">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38987604">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38987604">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Something does not add up.

They outsourced the latter two and provided insufficient oversight.<p>Concept: Lithium-ion batteries are great tech.<p>Design:  Boeing outsourced the electrical system design work to Thales, and the first production airliner designed around lithium-ion batteries seemed like a great idea until they started catching fire.<p>Execution: Relying heavily on sub-contractors to build big chunks of the 787 was a great idea to save money, until the subs couldn&#x27;t maintain the pace Boeing wanted for the price Boeing was willing to pay.  So Boeing bought the South Carolina facility.<p>And Boeing keeps insisting on learning the hard way.

Understand that one global cost minimization is worth far more than even 20 sub-optimum cost reductions.<p>&gt; Retain sufficient in-house production manufacturing that it is possible for future engineers to acquire the skills needed to develop new products, without which all businesses will fail. Even the work that is out-sourced requires internal expertise to write the specifications.<p>&gt; Acknowledge that cost-saving techniques that work in other high-volume industries are often quite inappropriate for low-volume industries like aerospace.<p>&gt; Listen more to your own employees about how to save cost than to any outside business consultants who have never run a factory producing your kind of product.

Otherwise people should start name-and-shame the journal and its reputation should sink.<p>Also I am curious if there are already lists of known incorrect predictions by Alphafold, shouldn&#x27;t this be published and alphafold&#x27;s database tag such predictions accordingly to notify users that these particular predictions are proven to be wrong.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40807092" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40807092" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">trivexwe</span><span>|</span><a href="#40808519">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40807632">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40807092">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40807092">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Weird article.<p>It mentions multiple times that ~”the protein folding problem is solved” as well as multiple instances of ~”but there are limitations to this technique and it is often missing crucial details”.<p>It really is difficult to conceptualize these highly nonlinear problem spaces, like protein folding, until you attempt to work with them.<p>Many in software development have an intuitive understanding of the difficulty evidenced in the community’s ~“the last 10% took 100% of the time” meme.<p>Even in a nonlinear problem spaces you have “trivial” solutions.<p>Terry Tao famously coauthored a paper finding arithmetic progressions for generating sequences of primes.[1] The sequences found are “trivial” in terms of “solving the prime sequence problem” in that they are sparse, the sequences are finite, and progressions lack a method of find more.<p>These machine learning tools are by design approximation engines.  I’m unsure of any results that prove one way or the other that it is possible to pass a bound of approximation that provides exact solutions.

Some cell biologists and biochemists who used to work with structural biologists have replaced them with AlphaFold2 — and take its predictions as truth.

Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, target a bacteria-specific enzyme called DNA gyrase.<p>So if macrolides and fluoroquinolones are each used independently already, and strains resistant to each of them independently, and these strains have an opportunity to co-occur and do horizontal transfer, wouldn&#x27;t we expect that to have resistance to a single drug that combines both mechanisms?

There are many possible mechanisms for resistance, and with this involving bacteria I expect pretty much all are sooner or later used.
Some ways are more specific to the substance, such as changing the target to fit worse or be less sensitive to the effect. Some can be quite general, such as actively pumping the molecules out of the cell.<p>In these cases there won&#x27;t probably won&#x27;t be that much wiggle room for altering the targets. Ribosomes and DNA-associated enzymes tend to be very very busy doing critical work against a lot of substrates and products, and are already heavily optimized for their normal tasks. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s no coincidence these mechanisms were chosen for a novel antibiotic attempting to mitigate resistance development.<p>Degrading the antibiotic, throwing it out, etc are still viable options, but it&#x27;s still very nice to see someone <i>finally</i> trying to do this more right, even if basing it on elements of existing classes adds some risk that there are strong initialization states for resistance development out there.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41078837" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41078837" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">s1artibartfast</span><span>|</span><a href="#41077811">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41078746">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41078825">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41078922">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41078837">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41078837">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Good question. Take many many antibacterial molecules to kill a bacteria, so there are two plausible methods. The first is that two compounds can have different pharmacokinetics. That is to say, they move through the body in different ways and have different concentration profiles.<p>The second is about how they are used. Two separate compounds with the same pharmacokinetics could be effective if you use them in parallel, but you have to contend with the fact that real human users may not always use them that way.

When you take one antibiotic to fight one pathogen, also attacks other bacteria in your gut microbiome (also those benign and even useful). Those bacterial also develop resistance.

Generally the idea holds. The example isn&#x27;t that bad either. O(100k-1M) people have dealer-fraud related problems every year in the US, usually without happy outcomes. A few ways this might happen relating to my use of the word &quot;lemon&quot; include:<p>1. Colloquial use of &quot;lemon&quot; differs from the legal definition. In the given example, this might include a 15yr old vehicle (far outside any normal &quot;manufacturer&#x27;s&quot; warranty) with numerous defects both known to the dealer and lied about to the consumer. The dealer would likely lose any civil complaint, but in Texas, and most states, this doesn&#x27;t count as a &quot;lemon.&quot; You&#x27;re protected, if at all, by the fact that the salesperson warranted a thing, and perhaps any actual written &quot;warranty&quot; (really insurance, not that it necessarily matters) the dealer might have sold you. You usually waive the warrant of merchantability, so the fact that the car is a dud isn&#x27;t enough by itself for you to have any damages (all state-specific, consult a lawyer in your jurisdiction).<p>2. Picking on Texas, since you brought it up, if you only bring the car in 3 times for a major defect covered under the lemon law, it&#x27;s not a lemon yet. If the dealer refuses to deal with you on the 3rd instance then you&#x27;ll have to sue with some other justification.<p>3. In the vast majority of states, you don&#x27;t have an automated (minus filing fees) hearing process pertaining to lemons. Even in those which do, you&#x27;re much more likely to succeed with the help of an attorney. In either case, in most states, attorney&#x27;s fees are not part of the damages you can claim, and when squabbling about a $5k used car it can easily cost more in attorney fees (plus incidentals like renting a car and missing work for the actual hearings -- usually not covered even in states granting damages for incidentals (including rentals and missing work in other contexts) arising from the lemon), often making it not even worth pursuing.<p>...<p>Usually, even with moderate legal protections, you don&#x27;t want to enter into an agreement where you expect to have to rely on those protections. Your best-case scenario is that you waste a bunch of time and still have only as many resources as you started with. You&#x27;ll usually do even worse.

And they&#x27;re shit. I remember them from the 80&#x27;s and they were really solid, good leather, well made, etc. The modern ones are crappy leather and fell apart after only a few months. But they still cost a decent amount because they&#x27;re Doc Martens.<p>My friend pointed out that Doc Martens are primarily worn by teenage girls these days, and  are almost &quot;fast fashion&quot;. My expectations based on the brand are not matching with reality, because the brand has moved on from being the de rigeur footwear for the entire 80&#x27;s alternative scene.<p>From this, I have come up with the &quot;reverse Vimes&quot; theory of boots. That actually the most cash-efficient approach to footwear is to buy cheap K-mart shoes, expecting them to last for a year, instead of buying expensive branded shoes which are actually made just as badly as the cheap ones and still only last a year.<p>The point being that Doc Martens, like Forbes, are trading in their reputation for quality. In ten years time they will be known as shitty boots that used to be worn by edgy teenage girls, and the brand will be worthless. But the shareholders will have made significant bank from the destruction of that brand.

They cost decent money, but they&#x27;d last a decade and became part of your identity. Practically a physical extension of your body; I had a flatmate who regularly fell asleep in his and eventually developed trenchfoot from doing that. The boots were fine, his feet weren&#x27;t.

It was worthwhile investing in them because that was all you needed.<p>I think you&#x27;re also right that the brand itself has changed and moved down-market, so they&#x27;re charging less than they used to for a lower-quality product.

And really it only has one.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter though. They have permission to use the name and domain, Forbes clearly knows what they are doing and why. If it wouldn&#x27;t be ok with them, they&#x27;d revoke the permission (I&#x27;m not sure, but I assume they can, right?) So, yes, you can claim there is an oversight. If anything, Google&#x27;s definition is a bit clunky, since it doesn&#x27;t grasp the essence of the problem. But it also shouldn&#x27;t matter, since it should be pretty obvious there is a problem indeed.<p>Now, why Google is ok with that (or didn&#x27;t notice that) is another and very valid question. I mean, great, Forbes can host whatever bullshit they see fit, but then it would be appropriate for the whole domain to never appear on the first page of Google. Or second. Or tenth.<p>But then again, it doesn&#x27;t seem like Google really tries to battle other, lesser doorways and LLM-generated content.

He’s a bit aggressive about it but a lot of what he says is on point.<p>The relationship with Forbes has always been a weird one. The understanding I’ve had was the company was spun off from an effort that kind of started in Forbes but they didn’t really want to deal with themselves.<p>It was always an SEO driven content strategy but for a while we had a pretty sizable content apparatus. Really big editorial teams for each vertical, a bigger cultural emphasis on the quality of the content and more collaboration across teams. The editorial teams had a lot of voice in what got published and tried to respect that we were using the Forbes brand and what that meant when we made recommendations or wrote about something. The only thing I’ll say to our (meagre) defense is there are panels of experts that are consulted for recommendations on a lot of products, and the teams that do research for the actual written content (not the affiliate&#x2F;partner garbage that often takes up sponsored slots) do try and work hard to provide data to meet the demands of the SEO and BD teams.<p>A lot of that has changed over the years. The company has grown explosively in the time that I have been here. The company something like tripled its size last year alone. I went from being a newbie on a team of less than ten to a senior member on a team in the mid double digits in the space of a year. The culture has become increasingly bureaucratic and disconnected. We’ve always been a fully remote team but it used to be much more collaborative and cross-functional.<p>We don’t hear much at all from leadership. It’s always been a fairly insulated operation from one vertical layer to the other. There have been two pretty big layoffs this year which came out of the blue. Editorial teams have been gutted across every vertical and the strategy has pivoted more and more towards shovelware content and partner posts. The latter being especially frustrating because they are handled by a completely separate team from the editorial team but are formatted to look like our written content even though they’re actually sponsored posts. At a team meeting after the last layoffs the CEO answered a question about the company’s plans and said something to the effect of “if we’re not growing we are dead” which I think is obviously seen in how the company is re-shaping itself.<p>It’s been disappointing to say the least. I don’t think any of us ever operated under the illusion we were doing important journalism or anything, but we all seemed to strive to make something good of the system we were working in. I’ve seen and heard of a lot of things I find commendable of my co-workers. Editorial and mid-level leadership have worked for a long time to ensure a separation of biz dev and edit so that they don’t have influence over the written content. I heard of times when BD really tried to push, however indirectly, for partners to get higher rankings in content. As edit gets increasingly sidelined in the business by the SEO content teams I’m not sure how much this is being maintained but I don’t work in that side of the business so I can’t speak specifically.<p>All of this is to say. He’s right, we are just ultimately doing our jobs. Unfortunately, I’ve outlasted a lot of people who were hired after me, and up til the layoffs it was very rare for someone to quit. Now more and more of the people who have been here since the early days (even before me) are peeling away. Those of us who stay are seeking more and more checked out. Honestly the benefits are excellent and I think that’s what keeps most of us around but no one is passionate these days.<p>That was a super rambling post, but I don’t ever see anyone talking about this place I’ve been at for a while. I wanted to share some insight into our world and get stuff off my chest as it’s been disappointing to watch go down, if not all that unique or surprising.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41594548" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41594548" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neves</span><span>|</span><a href="#41598797">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41593959">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41594548">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41594548">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Cory Doctorow article nails it <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doctorow.medium.com&#x2F;the-specific-process-by-which-google-enshittified-its-search-1ffd3b02d205" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doctorow.medium.com&#x2F;the-specific-process-by-which-go...</a><p>It is Google &quot;do no evil&quot; to blame.</div><br/><div id="41595197" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41595197" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tempfile</span><span>|</span><a href="#41594548">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41593959">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41595197">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41595197">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">he really never misses</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41593959" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41593959" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cynicalsecurity</span><span>|</span><a href="#41594548">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41593819">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41593959">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41593959">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So, Google can kill their whole business if they simply stop giving Forbes unfair prioritisation in the search results.</div><br/><div id="41594290" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41594290" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">erehweb</span><span>|</span><a href="#41593959">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41596588">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41594290">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41594290">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sure, and Google and FB have killed businesses before by changing algorithms.

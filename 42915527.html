We have a ship building industry plan and it seems to be going ok. Top of the range ships like type 26 are massive, expensive and cutting edge so will take time to build and commission. So what we&#x27;ve done is gone and brought an off the shelf design (Iver Huitfeldt-class frigate) and started building it. It&#x27;s not cutting edge or massive, it should need less crew and most of it&#x27;s system should be off the shelf. The first in class was paid in April 2022 and is to be launched this year with an inservice date of early 2027. To compare that against the first in class of the type 26, that was laid down on 2027 and is looking to be in service at the same time as the first type31!

War planners should have pushed to repeal the Jones Act decades ago, but now Chinese shipbuilding capacity is over 230 times greater than ours because of their success in civilian shipbuilding. The proposed measures in this aricle are too little too late.<p>The only logical course of action at this stage would be to seek an alternative that leverages the US&#x27;s existing strengths. Naval vessels are largely outdated technology and meanwhile the US is the world leader in aerospace manufacturing. If we were to revive the 747 Cruise Missile Carrier concept, or else an equivalent program, it could deliver the same range and operational payload as a guided missile destroyer, but at dramatically lower cost and higher operational tempo. With the ability to rapidly ferry munitions thousands of miles to a conflict zone, one 747 CMC aircraft could replace multiple guided missile destroyers despite costing one fifth the price. This is possible because the 747 CMC is based on a reliable and proven aircraft with existing economies of scale.<p>Thank you for reading my shameless sales pitch.</div><br/><div id="42916104" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42916104" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pbmonster</span><span>|</span><a href="#42915846">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42915875">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42916104">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42916104">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; the 747 CMC is based on a reliable and proven aircraft with existing economies of scale.<p>This is no longer true, unfortunately.

Aerial photos show shipyards with drydocks full of cargo ships, with an warship or two mixed in. 
US warships are mostly built by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock, and the Bath Iron Works, which don&#x27;t make civilian ships. There&#x27;s little economy of scale in US warship construction. Some years ago, the head of Newport News told Congress that if they&#x27;d order two carriers at the same time, the company would throw in a third one for free. Congress declined the offer.<p>The PLAN now has more warships than the US Navy. Fewer carriers, but that&#x27;s being fixed. China&#x27;s carriers are getting better. The type 001 carrier was a refurbished Russian carrier. The type 002 was a smaller ski-jump carrier. The type 003 was comparable to the US Kitty Hawk class.

However, this dependence varies depending on the development stage of each country. For example, African nations primarily require food to sustain basic living conditions.<p>Regardless of their specific needs, this situation has resulted in a unique exchange mechanism: developing countries must offer their best products in exchange for goods from developed countries. As a result, people in developing countries are unable to enjoy the finest products produced in their own countries, and sometimes not even second-tier products, as these are reserved for foreign consumers.<p>The U.S. market features products from various countries and regions, including China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Jamaica, and Mexico. The world&#x27;s finest products flow into the U.S. market in exchange for U.S. dollars. As everyone competes to obtain dollars, competition intensifies, leading to high product quality and low prices. This has created unprecedented prosperity in the U.S. market. This outcome is a result of market mechanisms and the benefits that the U.S. has gained from the global status of the dollar, established by the Bretton Woods Conference after World War II.<p>However, the massive influx of foreign products into the U.S. has also impacted its domestic industries, causing factory closures and rising unemployment. This issue cannot be ignored, which is why the forces of free trade and protectionism in the U.S. have been in constant conflict.<p>— Wang Huning, <i>America Against America</i></div><br/></div></div><div id="42916494" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42916494" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">roenxi</span><span>|</span><a href="#42915784">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42916229">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42929895">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42918998">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42916494">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42916494">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Probably.

The US keeps disabling economic feedback mechanisms rather than reform failures and it is starting to catch up with them since the Chinese just work harder than they do.<p><i>EDIT</i> And I think you might want to talk about the Baumol effect, not Dutch disease.

War planners should have pushed to repeal the Jones Act decades ago, but now Chinese shipbuilding capacity is over 230 times greater than ours because of their success in civilian shipbuilding. The proposed measures in this aricle are too little too late.<p>The only logical course of action at this stage would be to seek an alternative that leverages the US&#x27;s existing strengths. Naval vessels are largely outdated technology and meanwhile the US is the world leader in aerospace manufacturing. If we were to revive the 747 Cruise Missile Carrier concept, or else an equivalent program, it could deliver the same range and operational payload as a guided missile destroyer, but at dramatically lower cost and higher operational tempo. With the ability to rapidly ferry munitions thousands of miles to a conflict zone, one 747 CMC aircraft could replace multiple guided missile destroyers despite costing one fifth the price. This is possible because the 747 CMC is based on a reliable and proven aircraft with existing economies of scale.<p>Thank you for reading my shameless sales pitch.</div><br/><div id="42916302" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42916302" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Animats</span><span>|</span><a href="#42915846">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42916104">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42916302">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42916302">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Huh? The Jones Act was supposed to <i>help</i> American shipbuilding. It&#x27;s a requirement that vessels which operate between US ports must be made in the US, crewed by the US, and flagged to the US. It didn&#x27;t help much, but that was the plan.<p>China&#x27;s shipbuilding industry is so big that their aircraft carriers are being constructed by shipyards that make large cargo ships. Aerial photos show shipyards with drydocks full of cargo ships, with an warship or two mixed in. 
US warships are mostly built by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock, and the Bath Iron Works, which don&#x27;t make civilian ships. There&#x27;s little economy of scale in US warship construction. Some years ago, the head of Newport News told Congress that if they&#x27;d order two carriers at the same time, the company would throw in a third one for free. Congress declined the offer.<p>The PLAN now has more warships than the US Navy. Fewer carriers, but that&#x27;s being fixed. China&#x27;s carriers are getting better. The type 001 carrier was a refurbished Russian carrier. The type 002 was a smaller ski-jump carrier. The type 003 was comparable to the US Kitty Hawk class. Whether the next carrier will be nuclear powered hasn&#x27;t been announced.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42916104" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42916104" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pbmonster</span><span>|</span><a href="#42915846">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42916302">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42915875">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42916104">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42916104">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; the 747 CMC is based on a reliable and proven aircraft with existing economies of scale.<p>This is no longer true, unfortunately.

We charge an uplift for the installation (due to additional splicing) and a little bit more on the monthly price for the consumption of dedicated ports and cores rather than using the PON. However, as is the case with most provided services like this, the majority of the cost is covering the risk of the SLA. The likelihood of an outage is not too dissimilar to the likelihood of outage on PON, so really it becomes a financial and service guarantee more than an uptime guarantee. As a healthy middle ground, we will also offer BGP on regular services and we do a bit of a referral system with a couple of other friendly ISPs, who will also do BGP. I actually prefer multi homing to “dedicated” from a resilience perspective because it separates you from the entire network stack all the way to the transit and peering.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42355106" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42355106" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">baby_souffle</span><span>|</span><a href="#42355903">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42355103">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42355106">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42355106">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I know of only a few other people that have managed to get &quot;real&quot; fiber to the home.<p>I am jealous of them save for the &quot;your monthly ISP bill is similar to a car payment&quot; aspect.</div><br/><div id="42355611" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42355611" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">therein</span><span>|</span><a href="#42355106">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42355103">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42355611">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42355611">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So 300$ instead of $72.99 + tax and I get to not have Comcast?

How the heck this is legal, I don&#x27;t understand.<p>Some tidbits from me: my ISP installed a big honking ADVA optical line terminal on my premises. Getting them to move it to their side and just provide me with an SFP connection is still my work-in-progress.<p>The support is also outsourced into India, and getting them to understand what you want over the phone is... painful.

Most of those franchise deals were done in the 1970s or early 1980s, essentially mimicking the agreements that were in place for AT&amp;T (or RBOCs).</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

I see &quot;prices&quot; as money and time. To save time, pay more money, to save money, pay in time. Ikea is maybe low on money, but definitely high in terms of time. Any software with good UX should be high on money, because they are low cost in time.<p>There is also a feel good factor, which the time component is 0. e.g. I have a bad habit of buying books not to be read, but to put on bookshelf because it looks good.

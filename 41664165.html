You can work around those problems with technology but you can&#x27;t fix them.<p>In terms of real world problems: climate change, food scarcity, poverty, water quality and access, health care, etc. a lot of the solutions are technical. And a lot of those solutions are directly or indirectly about making energy cheaper and cleaner. With cheap clean energy, you can address climate change. You can desalinate water (at scale). If you have clean water, you can address food scarcity (e.g. irrigate desserts). You can also address sanitation. Cheap energy also enables transport, having light in people&#x27;s home (education). so that addresses poverty. And so on. All that comes from just a handful of technical solutions that make energy cheap and clean. Anyone working on those things is accomplishing more than decades worth of well intentioned but not very effective activism, charity, diplomacy, etc. I&#x27;m sure AI has a role to play here as well.<p>The point is moot anyway. We&#x27;re not going to turn into Luddites and competition continuously drives us to do better. Which means people keep on figuring out technical solutions to challenges around them.

Quite funny we have to choose sides: IsraeliLivesMatter vs PalestinianLivesMatter or RussianLivesMatter vs UkrainianLivesMatter. In the end, I decided to forget about the controversy.

You can work around those problems with technology but you can&#x27;t fix them.<p>It depends a lot on what is encompassed in the considered definition of technology. Education and language can certainly be taken as technologies, under certain perspectives at least. And addressing individual behaviors with undesirable social consequences is something that definitely can be solved with appropriate educational &quot;technologies&quot;.<p>In my current perspective, the most weighted factor between a technology and an innate individual trait is how transferable it is.<p>&gt;We&#x27;re not going to turn into Luddites and competition continuously drives us to do better.<p>It all depends on which values we endorse and thus how we deem something &quot;better&quot;.

So I happen to know how it is to live both with and without the ability to visualize, I used to be extremely good at visualizing. Most major impact (apart from the loss of ability to daydream) is that my memory is worse, as my memory was very much based on playing back memories as movies in my head. Especially childhood memories suffered. Also reading books is a very different experience, as when I previously would make up movies and picture the characters visually when reading, now it&#x27;s all black. That said, reading books is still an enjoyable experience, it&#x27;s just very different.<p>I also stopped dreaming in images for a long time, which was weird. It&#x27;s still very dim (not so vivid), but at least that part came back.</div><br/><div id="40765382" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40765382" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">isoprophlex</span><span>|</span><a href="#40765305">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40765643">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40765382">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40765382">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That sounds incredibly sad and frustrating. I can&#x27;t imagine what it&#x27;s like to suddenly lose that ability, being so dependent on it.<p>Indeed many of my childhood memories are mostly sequences of pictures, the emotional content kind of &quot;floats&quot; on the imagery. It must be very frustrating, being forced to reinvent how you experience your inner life and memories.<p>Edit, after reading some more comments: are you musically inclined? Did your ability to hear melodies in your &quot;inner ear&quot; suffer similarly?</div><br/><div id="40765471" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40765471" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">markers</span><span>|</span><a href="#40765305">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40765382">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40765643">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40765471">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40765471">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It sucks, but that&#x27;s life - there are worse things and life is still plenty enjoyable. In addition, I lost my sense of smell&#x2F;taste completely and that was much worse to be honest (but still, you learn to live without and focus on what&#x27;s good). If I had to choose between the two, I&#x27;d choose being able to smell&#x2F;taste any day. Funnily enough not because of food, but actually because of the added experience you get when walking in nature or other places - smell has so much to do with experiencing things, but you never consider it until it&#x27;s gone. Luckily it came back, even though it&#x27;s been 2.5 years now and it&#x27;s still only 80% normal (but 80% is quite good!).<p>As you mention, the most sad part about it is actually the childhood memories, but I still have the memories of course, they&#x27;re just a bit more &quot;facts based&quot; than re-living experiences.<p>Luckily, I didn&#x27;t lose my inner ear or even inner monologue like in another reported case [0]. I do play instruments, so I guess I was&#x2F;is musically inclined to some degree. I still have ability to imagine music exactly like I would hear it, unlike a friend with aphantasia who can&#x27;t.<p>Another interesting detail is that I regained the ability before losing it again  (Covid re-infection), and during this time of recovery I could gradually see grey, blurry images that got better and better. It&#x27;s like the image generator in my head didn&#x27;t have capacity to create full blown images, but only low res ones. Which makes me believe that in my case the &quot;image generator&quot; was damaged as I couldn&#x27;t even dream in pictures, while for most people with aphantasia that&#x27;s not the case, as they can dream normally.<p>On the bright side, I don&#x27;t get horrible, lifelike images popping up in my head anytime I hear about something disturbing. Not that that was a big problem, but it&#x27;s something you notice. It makes me believe that people with aphantasia might be better at coping with disturbing events, as they don&#x27;t have to re-live the experience visually. But that&#x27;s just a theory.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;covid-stopped-having-dreams-seeing-images-aphantasia-2022-9" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;covid-stopped-having-dreams-...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40765643" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40765643" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ryanjshaw</span><span>|</span><a href="#40765305">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40765382">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40763000">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40765643">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40765643">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; So I happen to know how it is to live both with and without the ability to visualize<p>True, but this is not the same as being born aphantasic.<p>I&#x27;m thinking that people like me who have never had the ability to draw pictures in their head have decades of dedicating brain power to alternative ways of thinking about the world that you wouldn&#x27;t have in place.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t be able to compare the experience in any real depth, but you might have more than typical insight.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40763000" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40763000" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neongreen</span><span>|</span><a href="#40765305">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40765747">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40763000">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40763000">[18 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Alert: if you were happy to learn about aphantasia, you might also be happy to learn about SDAM (severely deficient autobiographical memory), which I think is correlated with aphantasia.<p>SDAM is when you know <i>facts</i> about your life, but can’t walk through any or almost any <i>episodes</i>.<p>Apparently normal people can actually re-live episodes from their past, step by step or.. idk.

Any object on my desk, or a place, a drawing, abstract geometry or pretty much anything I have a reference to. If I were to visualize an apple in real life, with my eyes open, this is how the process would go: Imagine you&#x27;re taking photos of the world 5 times a second. You then take those pictures into your mind and superimpose an apple onto them, like adding a layer in Photoshop, perhaps with 90% opacity or a bit of inconsistent flickering. That&#x27;s probably the best way I could describe the experience. Those edits I create are on another visual layer, inside my mind, which requires an active effort to have a consistent visual experience, but of course sometimes it can passively activate and you&#x27;re just daydreaming without any effort. Personally, I have a hard time imagining faces. They change, they melt, sometimes they become inhuman. I only have consistent faces in my dreams.<p>The places I know well, I can fully navigate inside my mind, just flying around a town, going down streets and such. I, of course, don&#x27;t believe neither the scaling or the distance is accurate, but it&#x27;s convincing and consistent enough for me at the level of abstract thought.<p>I fully get immersed in the books I&#x27;m reading or listening to. It&#x27;s the best part of reading a book.<p>I can imagine smell, taste, sound, touch, sight and even other senses like balance and whatever else. Sound would be the most vivid part of my imagination. High consistency and fidelity. I also have an inner monologue which I use in second person communication, addressing myself from the perspective of another entity.<p>I have anxiety, intrusive thoughts, flashbacks and problems with rumination. I experience memories with a lot of emotion.

If someone asks me to imagine a scene, I&#x27;ll run through memories of actual experiences and combine them where necessary to produce an approximation. For aural imagination, such as music composition, I imagine snippets of music I&#x27;ve heard, then combine them. There is a visual component to that, but it&#x27;s symbolic, not vivid. If I need to imagine something I haven&#x27;t experienced, it&#x27;s like a combination of line drawings, animation and written and spoken language. It would look like a mess if I could project it. Colours are there, but they&#x27;re not vivid. They&#x27;re more like bad watercolours. If I take my time, I can clear up the image, and over time it becomes more vivid. This is actually how I write. It&#x27;s a slow process, but it&#x27;s the only way I can think clearly. I find social conversation difficult because it tends to move faster than my ability to visualise so I find it dull and uninspiring. I prefer to spend my time slow-reading literature.<p>Contextual conversations are ok, such as business or academic conversations, because the language is generally a closed set and visualisations are well practiced.

I&#x27;m speculating here because I just saw a movie today at a theater and I can playback scenes in my mind. I can certainly describe a scene with words but that&#x27;s clearly very limiting. At the very least, I don&#x27;t have words to map to all the colors my eyes can detect.  Do you think that&#x27;s accurate?<p>That&#x27;s said, I imagine if you rewatched a recent movie, you would recollect every scene during the act of rewatching, just like someone without aphantasia.<p>For anyone who has a hard time believing this condition is real (because I initially did) here&#x27;s how I think about it.  When I first learned there are people who are color blind, I was stunned and skeptical that I could be looking at a certain colored flower and someone next to me didn&#x27;t see the same reality. I can also easily believe that someone can imagine something in their mind way more vividly than I can.  I&#x27;m willing to bet you could do an experiment where you give various people step by step instructions to do origami in their mind, draw a top-down view of the final shape, and there&#x27;d be a wide range of accuracy even among people without aphantasia.</div><br/><div id="40763960" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40763960" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SaidinWoT</span><span>|</span><a href="#40758207">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40763380">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40764215">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40763960">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40763960">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; it sounds like the way you remember things must be missing a lot of details.<p>&gt; Do you think that&#x27;s accurate?<p>I don&#x27;t think someone with aphantasia (of which I am one!) is really capable of assessing this - which details our memories have routinely omitted is an unknown unknown until we&#x27;re explicitly made conscious of the gap.<p>With regard to your example of a movie, I think you may be overweighting the importance of visualization in recalling narratives (and details within them). Fiction books (for adults, anyways) generally lack visuals, yet readers across the entire visualization spectrum[0] can engage with them and recall&#x2F;discuss scenes, plot points, etc. Absorbing the narrative of a movie isn&#x27;t so far off from that. I just took my kid to see Inside Out 2 earlier this week, and have a pretty clear recollection (sans whatever gaps I&#x27;m incapable of being aware of) of all of it.<p>[0] I think, but am not sure, that it strengthens my point here to note that people who visualize the story as they read it are nearly certainly visualizing it _differently_, but that almost never poses a problem for engaging with others about it.</div><br/><div id="40764813" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40764813" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">prng2021</span><span>|</span><a href="#40758207">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40763960">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40764009">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40764813">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40764813">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks, those are great points.  After more thought, I somewhat agree I was overweighing the value of visualizing things in my mind.  I don&#x27;t know if there are people out there that can actually conjure tastes of food as part of remembering something. I only remember food tastes through language descriptions like sweet, salty etc. So maybe that&#x27;s analogous to aphantasia.  It&#x27;s just that we&#x27;re talking about the sense of sight versus taste. From a practical standpoint, there isn&#x27;t much value even if I could taste something as part of a memory.

So i can understand how - some people - can &#x27;see&#x27; what they think a bike looks like but then draw a mechanical mess.<p>Of course there are people with perfect recall, and others who design bikes for a living and so on.

For most people it&#x27;s more like a &quot;schema&quot; or a lossy compression. It can be placed in space, left or right or above or below other image-fragments, there can be colouring, shading, motion, sound. But it&#x27;s not a faithful bike-image, although it&#x27;s hard to notice that unless you try to draw it.<p>There are also other reasons why mental visualization doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean one can draw it faithfully. For me, mental imagery has a kind of unstable three-dimensional quality, where I see the image from multiple overlapping, shifting perspectives, kinda like a Cubist painting. Different parts of the image have more or less detail over time; I can&#x27;t hold fine detail about the whole thing simultaneously.

In the same vein, simple objects like geometric shapes are very easy for me to draw, no visualization needed.

For me sometimes it&#x27;s putting together LEGOs, other times it&#x27;s crafting a puzzle or panning for gold. 
And a rare few times its felt like hooking into the great creative currents of the universe to bring something to fruition.</div><br/><div id="42653697" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42653697" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jillesvangurp</span><span>|</span><a href="#42648679">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42650775">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42653697">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42653697">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s a good summary. It&#x27;s worth pointing out that there&#x27;s technical writing and literary writing. They are related but different enough that it&#x27;s worth calling out the difference.<p>Technical writing is a skill you can learn. If you have somebody pointing out what you are doing wrong structurally, you can learn to do it right every time. I had a Ph. D. supervisor who taught me that little life hack thirty years ago. I was a bit depressed with my lack of progress when he pointed out just four or five things that I was doing wrong a lot. So, I fixed those things and it got better and developed the skill of spotting my own mistakes.<p>The whole process took something like six months or so to get to acceptable levels (by review committees for conferences and workshops). Learning to communicate is a big part of the process of getting a Ph. D. A master degree won&#x27;t quite get you there (depending on the field). Especially computer scientists seem to have a few blind spots for this. Anyway, if you can&#x27;t talk about your findings in a coherent way, nobody is going to bother listening to you.<p>Literary writing is more free form. Technical writing skills are merely the starting point for that. But it&#x27;s like any art form where somebody that has mastered rules and skills start bending the rules in intentional ways; or even change them. Some authors I like make that look easy to the point where I wonder whether I could do that. But doing that well is not easy.<p>And there&#x27;s also the notion that it&#x27;s not just about the style and form but about the content. After a life of ignorance about Greek mythology, I read Stephen Fry&#x27;s Mythos over the summer. His writing is wonderful. But it also drove home the point of how ignorant I was of Greek myths influencing basically every popular movie or book I&#x27;ve ever liked. I like the Matrix, for example. There&#x27;s a reason Morpheus is called Morpheus (Greek god of dreams) and that whole business with the blue and red pills relates to that. That whole movie is dripping with Greek mythology references and it&#x27;s not like they were subtle about it. I kind of knew of course.<p>Movies and books don&#x27;t just come out of nowhere. They are variations of stories that have been told and retold over and over again by countless people for thousands of years. And the better authors tend to know their mythology, philosophy, work by their modern peers, etc. Learning to write involves a lot of reading so you can refer to that and be original and intentional.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42650775" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42650775" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">weakfish</span><span>|</span><a href="#42648679">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42653697">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42648867">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42650775">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42650775">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a beginner in fiction writing, it is really interesting to hear from various writers I admire how different their processes are how every single one, without fail, emphasizes that it’s deeply personal and to develop your own style.<p>I guess this comment proves my style is run on sentences :)</div><br/></div></div><div id="42648867" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42648867" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mocha_nate</span><span>|</span><a href="#42648679">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42650775">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42649738">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42648867">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42648867">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well said</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42649738" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42649738" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">memhole</span><span>|</span><a href="#42648679">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42651529">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42649738">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42649738">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Both art and article are good.

For me personally, it took a while to see this for the first time, but it was a revelation and completely changes your perspective on what&#x2F;who you think you are.</div><br/><div id="42649361" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42649361" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">javier_e06</span><span>|</span><a href="#42648191">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42646639">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42649361">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42649361">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In a lucid dream you know you are dreaming.

Though they were written to create or affirm my existence, they did not, once they were finished, continue to do so. What they suggested, when I read them afterward, was that I had once existed and had thoughts; something that had been alive and specific was now silent or vanished. So the poems became a kind of chastisement, taunting reminders of what was not.”<p>Looking back on previous writing can also be a positive reinforcement, though yeah sometimes you feel taunted, or that you could’ve done better. And small though it may feel, writing is action. You didn’t just let thing bounce around in your head, you wrote it out - you did something. My hot take on this this morning - I liked this read, thanks for posting.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42649712" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42649712" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">m_sahaf</span><span>|</span><a href="#42646639">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42646079">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42649712">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42649712">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I cannot find the source, but I saved this quote by Douglas Hofstadter about the process of writing, rewriting, and revising:<p>&quot;It is the intensity of this process of global tightening and smoothing of a huge structure that was once implicit in one&#x27;s mind but is now external and has its own unanticipated shape, life, and momentum, it is the power of this process of converting a set of once-intangible intuitions into a very tangible network of interconnected crystals, that I had forgotten.&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="42646079" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42646079" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">myst</span><span>|</span><a href="#42649712">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42648217">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42646079">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42646079">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20250106203714&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;culture&#x2F;the-weekend-essay&#x2F;writing-as-transformation-louise-gluck" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20250106203714&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyo...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42648217" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42648217" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">drewchew</span><span>|</span><a href="#42646079">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42647514">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42648217">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42648217">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Coming across stuff like this is why I value the hacker news community.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42647514" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42647514" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PaulHoule</span><span>|</span><a href="#42648217">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42647514">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42647514">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">An extreme version is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Automatic_writing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Automatic_writing</a></div><br/><div id="42649215" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42649215" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sebmellen</span><span>|</span><a href="#42647514">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42649215">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42649215">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You can get some pretty far-out places doing this on an electronic typewriter, in the dark, with the right state of mind.<p>Example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedaring.org&#x2F;post&#x2F;quarantined-thoughts&#x2F;the-pursuit-of-happiness&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedaring.org&#x2F;post&#x2F;quarantined-thoughts&#x2F;the-pursuit-o...</a>.</div><br/><div id="42650034" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42650034" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Rzor</span><span>|</span><a href="#42647514">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42649215">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42650034">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42650034">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you very much for posting this.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

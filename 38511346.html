This isn&#x27;t a question as to why Mastodon (or &quot;Fediverse&quot;) has yet to catch on in the wider public. It is more a question as to why scholarly societies are still organized around paid journals.<p>I think the answer to that isn&#x27;t inertia or greed. I would argue that the tools of federation aren&#x27;t necessarily suitable to that specific problem. There is a difference between tweets and feeds compared to peer-reviewed papers in magazine-like journals.<p>That is, Mastodon does solve a kind of problem that is related to closed groups of individuals collaborating on a moderated topic. And it allows those closed groups to broadcast their work into a network and to selectively include elements from outside networks. You could probably use those raw tools to create something that might sort of work for scholarly societies.<p>But it does feel a bit like trying to shape the problem to fit the solution (put another way, if you have a nice new shiny hammer, suddenly a lot of problems start to look like nails). I think the article is trying to suggest that federation is a tool that is flexible enough to fill that role, but I believe a significant amount of infrastructure would need to be built on top of federation to achieve such a role. And also, a significant culture and process change would have to take place within academia.<p>Federation might be a <i>part</i> of a solution to the problem, but no where near the whole solution.</div><br/><div id="38514368" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38514368" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">justinpombrio</span><span>|</span><a href="#38513938">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38514475">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38514368">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38514368">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Don&#x27;t conflate peer review with paid journals, they&#x27;re very different things.

We want to write software, not to wrangle with the laws of a hundred countries.
2. We don&#x27;t want to deal with providing infrastructure for millions of users.
3. We don&#x27;t want to run a community in general. Our passion is software, we don&#x27;t really care what they talk about.<p>On the user side, the value proposition is lack of lock-in.

Federation just isn&#x27;t going to happen with these philosophical arguments given all the practical problems.<p>No system is perfect, but IMO a federated system, if done well enough is more resilient. In a federated system, the hope is that something like Twitter would be just one of many providers. Thus if the leadership goes nuts one day, it has to content with that there&#x27;s 20 other nigh identical providers, and that it can over time be marginalized if it keeps being crazy.<p>Also, ideally federation means each community can be more focused, and have its own culture and local rules that make sense for it, but may not make sense for anyone else.</div><br/><div id="38513612" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38513612" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jmyeet</span><span>|</span><a href="#38512020">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38512196">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38514617">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38513612">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38513612">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Federation IMO solves problems on the developer side:<p>I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.<p>First, nobody cares about this.

We can all agree that as user count goes up, abuse and moderation scales as well.<p>A centralized platform takes all of that moderation load at once. You need a team of people or some crazy moderation software that doesn&#x27;t work. Abuse runs rampant as the company doesn&#x27;t want to invest in proper moderation. We see that on twitter, Facebook, tumblr, all of them.<p>The fediverse aims to solve this problem by limiting scale. Smaller communities are easier to moderate. We see this with forums and chat rooms. When the community is small, they tend to self-police more. People tend to self-identify with that community and actively protect it.<p>But small communities are small and don&#x27;t reach far. So we connect these small communities into larger networks. The implementation details of that are IMO pretty much irrelevant, but to answer your question: posts are duplicated throughout the network. Each server caches copies of all incoming posts to serve them directly to their local users. There are downsides to this approach, but the positive is that it crudely balances server load across the network.<p>Bad actors aren&#x27;t much of a concern. If you start a server that just blasts spam into the fediverse, the network will quickly drop you. Individual servers have the option to refuse connections from other servers or domains. Server admins actively network with each other to warn of malicious servers. So far it&#x27;s been incredibly effective.<p>As a user, you also have the option to block servers or other users. You also have extensive filtering options so that you can effectively moderate your own timeline.<p>And of course, there&#x27;s also the drama between server admins blocking each other and harming users by cutting them off from part of the network. The solution I chose was to start up my own server. It took a weekend and operates exactly the same as the big instances I&#x27;ve been on.<p>When a server shuts down, users can move elsewhere. You can keep all your follows and followers, but lose your post history. That&#x27;s obviously not ideal, but what were you able to keep when MySpace closed down? It&#x27;s not perfect, but you can still keep going. Plus there are limited workarounds, but that&#x27;s not important.<p>The fediverse has problems, but not the ones you pose.<p>Ask yourself how one scales a website to tens of millions of users. It&#x27;s pretty complicated, right? Lots of servers and load balancers and whatever else.<p>But what about a website for a thousand users? Ten thousand? That&#x27;s much more doable. That&#x27;s just a single machine. The magic of federation is linking ten thousand websites run by volunteers that each host only a thousand users into a more or less cohesive network.<p>No matter which node in the network your account belongs to, you get roughly the same experience. No one has to spend millions filling up a datacenter. Most servers are run on donations from users or out of their admin&#x27;s pocket. It doesn&#x27;t cost too terribly much unless you&#x27;re serving thousands of users.<p>When one server goes down, even a very large server, the network stays intact and absorbs the load and the users as they migrate. When a server with tens of thousands of users shuts down, we don&#x27;t see a dramatic drop in total network users. Nearly all of them just move. This makes the network very resilient. No one person can do any meaningful damage to the network as a whole.<p>Fediverse is far from perfect. And I agree that it won&#x27;t be a monetized ad- and celebrity-friendly platform like Facebook or twitter. But that&#x27;s fundamentally misunderstanding what and <i>why</i> it is.<p>The fediverse is the next logical step from hundreds of small isolated forums. People built and use federated services because they <i>want</i> small communities driven by and for people who simply want to talk to other people. Nothing more, nothing less. It&#x27;s not going to grow to encompass billions of users because that&#x27;s simply not the goal.<p>The goal of the fediverse is simple: give people a place to talk and share with each other that is controlled exclusively by people who want the same thing. No money, no tracking, no corporations, just people talking to other people.<p>Everyone I know on mastodon is perfectly happy with the way things are. We see a very stable network with slow and steady growth. That&#x27;s pretty much all we want or need.</div><br/><div id="38514010" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38514010" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shagie</span><span>|</span><a href="#38512020">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38512868">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38513345">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38514010">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38514010">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Each server caches copies of all incoming posts to serve them directly to their local users.

Merchants of FUD are abundant. They all have their &quot;the main issue&quot; why it&#x27;s hopeless. Few bother sparing even a second to contemplate the possibility of success - however faint it is against the meteor of doom which surely is careening through the sky right at us &amp; will obliterate us all momentarily that they see.<p>There&#x27;s so many criticisms &amp; critiques, and so much lowly &amp; pervasive nattering of fediverse &amp; alternatives. I think though that what&#x27;s important now isn&#x27;t getting everything right &amp; tackling each and every problem first. What&#x27;s important now are strong solid bases for innovation. We need early adopters &amp; innovators trying things.<p>We need to grow our capabilities, to figure out how to iterate again, after being well served by free with surveillance systems. The nattering can be constructive, once we have a base. I think we are losening things up, greasing into fluidity capabilities that have been ossified into place by titan sized ultra-captive industry. Making the connective online space <i>fluid</i> again is more important than anything. We can find wins, and the titans will keep stumbling &amp; making errors. Innovation from the edge is going to shed some blood, but it will also allow iteration &amp; evolution, will drive future wider forms of meta-moderation that will help us all suss &amp; grok each other in ways that these highly centralized walled gardens can never be open enough to allow.<p>The paradigm here, of connectivity being participative and evolvable and changing: that seems like something we forgot a while ago, and in the hours of such discontent about so much being decided for us, I think the commonality should be more important than the quibbles. No one is leaping to defend the creaky status quo. We haven&#x27;t figured out all the safeguards and onroading we need to get to the world scale that the titans are at now, but it sure seems to me like we have some viable starting places to work from now. We can iterate and change, socially direct ourselves, and that hope for iteration and ownership is what is at stake here.

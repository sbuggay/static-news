Consensus-seeking leads to endless debate.<p>Every rapidly growing company I’ve worked for has reached a point where we have product managers and program managers and engineers and engineering managers and stakeholders and suddenly nobody can even identify who is the decision maker.<p>Weak leadership then pushes a “we all have to work together to come up with a solution” angle that clarifies nothing and turns everything into a consensus-building operation. Progress slows to a crawl.<p>The second most common failure mode I’ve seen is, I hate to say it, similar to what this author is proposing as a solution: Product Managers who view themselves as facilitators of a process where they get others to come up with the answers about what to build. The product managers call meetings where they shuffle context and requirements and suggestions from stakeholders to engineers and customers and back and forth under the idea that their job is to lead others to the conclusion. I’ve worked with some product managers who produced prodigious amounts of meetings and slide decks and Figma charts and process documents and Notion pages and after meeting summary e-mails but can never actually conclude what we should build. They’re so enamored with <i>process</i> and <i>documents</i> and afraid of being prescriptive, so you only get questions and prompts and meetings and frameworks to follow to supposedly arrive at a conclusion about what to build.</div><br/><div id="39114228" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39114228" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">atomicfiredoll</span><span>|</span><a href="#39113273">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39113614">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39114228">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39114228">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think consensus-building is necessarily bad on it&#x27;s own.

Maybe schedule in some rework time to try again. That way, developers move quickly and sooner or later start building useful things.<p>&quot;Just tell me what to build&quot; is a dangerous attitude to foster. It pushes more work into the management layer which is already a bottleneck for making decisions. That is bad strategy. A couple of devs thinking that way is OK, but it is going to accentuate the inevitable management dysfunction.<p>The best approach is a culture where PMs understand customer problems and give quick, effective feedback to developers about whether what they just did affected a customer in a good way. Then management lets developers do what they do as quickly as possible. Alternatives can work, but that is the sweet spot.<p>The ultimate goal of any software company is to have that one lucky dev who just gets it, builds something amazing quickly and then the company comes in to maintain and milk the product until management miscalculates, destroys it and the cycle starts again. Failing that, the next best option is a product guy who just gets it and organises the engineers to build something that makes customers happy. Neither of those states depends on debate or, curiously, on what the median developer is doing. Software developer productivity is one of the spikiest, most disjointed and chaotic metrics I&#x27;ve ever dealt with and most of the time it appears to be $0&#x2F;day value add or slightly negative. Then sometimes it spikes to a few million dollars an hour.

It becomes the baseline. The strategy impact, the coordination, and the understanding and contributing to the team, company and customer success is part of your responsibility.<p>This is an underestimation of the potential of software systems. Of course it depends on the software application, but in many cases there is a lot of value lost when organizations implicitly create a technical ceiling for their engineers, and push their focus away from the theory and practice of engineering.<p>Saying that there is more value for an engineer to coordinate, plan, and present, is almost like saying that there is a point in which software systems can no longer be innovated or improved, or that there is nothing about software that requires more than 5 years of experience (or whatever the senior level would be). This is a sure way to build naive systems that brake all the time, when instead it could implement more sophisticated solutions. Of course this would mean that engineers would have a harder time communicating their solutions, but once again, it would be limiting software just because the managers want full control and visibility at every step of the way.<p>We&#x27;re now talking about the possibility of AGI, yet it seems every software org still goes through the same problems, with the same type of bugs, pipeline problems, etc. This is definitely not because software can&#x27;t solve the problems, so it must be that the solutions are too hard to implement, and so the question is why is that hard?</div><br/></div></div><div id="39114493" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39114493" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">danielovichdk</span><span>|</span><a href="#39113635">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39113948">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39114493">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39114493">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You need to minimise the debating.

But no manager can truly control the actions of their subordinates, and the wise manager understands that and channels that into productive workers who are <i>mostly</i> (but never fully!) aligned with the organization.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39114937" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39114937" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mmcnl</span><span>|</span><a href="#39114338">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39113474">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39114937">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39114937">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Decision making is a craft.

Uncertainty. People haven&#x27;t done X before, and are concerned about the outcome, so they delay, by debating. They don&#x27;t know whether they&#x27;re right or wrong. They&#x27;re really just trying to figure out their own opinion. So they will bring up objections, even if they don&#x27;t actually have a concrete reason to object. They just literally don&#x27;t know if something is valid, so they pose a hypothetical. Another form of uncertainty is lack of trust. If somebody has trust that an outcome will be acceptable, then they can deal with any fears they might have about whether a given approach will have the outcome they hope for. If they can&#x27;t trust the process, or people, they&#x27;ll bring out road blocks.<p>2. Ego. Let&#x27;s face it, we work with people with big egos. People who are smart, and capable, and know it.If their egos don&#x27;t feel adequately compensated, they will debate until it is.<p>I think &quot;just tell me what to do&quot; is easier to understand:<p>1. Apathy. It&#x27;s a real killer, and it can hit any organization. Sometimes people care too much; if they don&#x27;t feel like they can affect change, that turns into caring too little. Or perhaps they&#x27;ve just been burned too often at this job. Frustration builds until the stress or friction is too much, and they compensate emotionally by disconnecting. Some people carry this from job to job, like a form of PTSD.<p>2. Inexperience. When you have a lot of experience, you mostly know what to do already. But if you&#x27;re working on something very new, or the organizational hierarchy isn&#x27;t clear, or goals aren&#x27;t clear, or processes, or you just don&#x27;t have a lot of professional experience, you can be lost in a sea of uncertainty, not sure what to do. Maybe you have ideas of what to do, but it&#x27;s not clear how to decide on it. So you relent, just waiting for someone to give you some guidance.<p>In each of these cases, the missing component is: leadership. There must be good leadership to help people do their best work and keep the ship sailing. Bad leadership, or the absence of leadership, will lead back to these problems.</div><br/><div id="39114169" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39114169" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">leetrout</span><span>|</span><a href="#39113291">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39114218">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39114169">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39114169">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I believe there is a form of PTSD that develops within toxic software development jobs and I wish it would receive more legitimate attention and treatment options.<p>I have tried to explain to my therapist why I have developed something like PTSD around peer reviews... yes, we all say &quot;you are not your work&quot; but that does not excuse being (dare I say) abusive in comments on PRs.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39114218" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39114218" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jauntywundrkind</span><span>|</span><a href="#39113291">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39113078">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39114218">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39114218">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had such a great company social night, talking with an engineer who got his start here ~5 year ago.<p>They were taking about how they just want people to have a well formed idea of what to build, to be able to hand off clear expectations, and let him roll.

They had been battlefield promoted after two higher ups on a team had left &amp; it was just them running this product. They said they had little idea what they were doing but the company trusted them &amp; let them hack through it. They loved that time.

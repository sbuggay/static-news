Christ is saying that those who abuse his name with repentance will not be condemned; but those who blaspheme against the spirit by permanently refusing repentance will never be forgiven.<p>This is ironically rather self fulfilling. Repentance is necessary for both mercy and forgiveness. Absolute refusal to repent (a sin against the Holy Spirit, which gives the grace to repent), means absolutely no mercy or forgiveness. Very simple.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s sin or slander at most<p>This makes zero sense, even as a “win,” as both of those things can lead to damnation. It’s even more stupid when you are saying “beware the sin of pride” while simultaneously saying this only “sin at most.”<p>“If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.” - Matthew 18:6<p>“Don&#x27;t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves, you are slaves to the one whom you obey--whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness?” - Romans 6:16<p>“The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” - Matthew 13:41-42<p>As for you, for your ludicrously ignorant suggestion that swearing with the name of Christ cannot be a sin in Christian theology:<p>“For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths.” - 2 Timothy 4:3-4<p>“There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures.” - 2 Peter 3:16<p>“I appeal to you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught; avoid them. For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites, and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive. For your obedience is known to all, so that I rejoice over you, but I want you to be wise as to what is good and innocent as to what is evil.” - Romans 16:17-19</div><br/><div id="42024384" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42024384" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">heroprotagonist</span><span>|</span><a href="#42017143">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42023398">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42019195">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42024384">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42024384">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; As for you, for your ludicrously ignorant suggestion that swearing with the name of Christ cannot be a sin in Christian theology<p>You clearly didn&#x27;t read.

&gt; “When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment: about sin, because people do not believe in me.”<p>You are clearly in the wrong here.  Feel free to ignore your savior&#x27;s words about whether it is blasphemy to take his name in vain.<p>But to continue to ignore the fact you&#x27;re doing it now that it&#x27;s pointed out is not just a sin against your savior, it&#x27;s actual blasphemy against the holy spirit.<p>Matthew 12:31-32:
&gt; “There’s nothing done or said that can’t be forgiven. But if you deliberately persist in your slanders against God’s Spirit, you are repudiating the very One who forgives. If you reject the Son of Man out of some misunderstanding, the Holy Spirit can forgive you, but when you reject the Holy Spirit, you’re sawing off the branch on which you’re sitting, severing by your own perversity all connection with the One who forgives.”<p>If you would judge others souls&#x27; as past any redemption for the words they speak about your savior, you are slandering God&#x27;s Spirit.  Continuing THIS behavior knowingly after it&#x27;s pointed out to you is what your own religion says will damn you forever.<p>Please, sir, I worry for your soul here.<p>Unless, of course, what you actually care about here is your own sense of righteousness.

Making people think less of you is not the main dynamic of curse words (and they don&#x27;t have a monopoly on that either!). Rather cursing is about openly transgressing social mores to display some combination of exceptional emotion plus (not being beholden to) social status. It&#x27;s basically saying &quot;I&#x27;m going to reject this thing you care about.&quot;<p>So unless those words stop being routinely used for ignorant personal attacks, I don&#x27;t see how swearing with racial slurs could become trendy for anybody but racists rejecting the idea that racism continues to be a problem. A decade ago I had more of an idealist post-racist outlook and could have believed that in a few more decades we&#x27;d be at the point where these words would have lost their deeply personal punch, with their only lingering effect being to cause pearl clutching (and who doesn&#x27;t want to needle pearl clutchers?).

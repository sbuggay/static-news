I am a simple programmer. I had a website in 2009, where I posted useful articles. I had a small ad block, which allowed me to pay for my expenses. When users began to install ad blockers en masse, the number of ad views dropped significantly and I had to close the site. Now I have no job and I am very poor. I want to thank those people who not only do not want to pay for good service, but also install ad blockers. Now you say that there is nothing to find on the Internet. Who will do something for you for free? Maybe a taxi driver will take you for free?</div><br/></div></div><div id="42337298" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42337298" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jillesvangurp</span><span>|</span><a href="#42337813">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42337792">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42337298">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42337298">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s why I use Firefox and avoid situations where I might get exposed to annoying ads. I was watching some Amazon Prime recently (the new rings of power season). Pretty OK and completely ad free experience. Except I noticed these weird cuts every few minutes. It took me quite a while to realize that Amazon introduced ads some time ago for Amazon prime and uBlock origin was doing a great job of simply blocking them. Hence the cuts. Same on Youtube. I watch a lot of content there while maintaining zero interruptions by ads. Works great and so far I&#x27;ve never had to pay Youtube to not see ads. I do pay for Amazon Prime. Occasionally. I usually reactivate my subscription when I need it either because I&#x27;m ordering stuff or because they have something I want to see. I&#x27;ll cancel soon again because I don&#x27;t currently need them and I once again exhausted their limited offerings. Forced ad watching makes it less likely I come back.<p>I don&#x27;t pay any websites&#x2F;blogs for subscriptions for articles either. It&#x27;s not sustainable for me to do pay for all the websites I visit. And me randomly paying only some tiny subset of them doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me. I&#x27;d need some prioritized list. And it would have to be a very short one because I&#x27;m simply not rich enough to maintain lots of multi dollar subscriptions per month. And I also don&#x27;t want to micromanage a lot of payments and subscriptions.<p>The Verge, which was mentioned in the article is a good example of a website that I don&#x27;t value enough to get anywhere near that short list. They have a lot of competition reporting more or less similar stuff that I wouldn&#x27;t miss them. In fact, I can&#x27;t recall reading anything by them lately. I guess not a lot of their stuff makes it to the HN front page. Probably because it&#x27;s just not that interesting.</div><br/><div id="42337709" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42337709" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">contrast</span><span>|</span><a href="#42337298">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42337400">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42337709">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42337709">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You’re making a very different point to the article.

This type of package is absolutely a thing that gets sold.<p>Which bits of this are ads? Well the behind the scenes post and interview could theoretically have been produced anyway, they&#x27;re within the scope of the site, but in this case they weren&#x27;t prioritised, certainly not for launch day, it was only by the whole collaboration being paid for that they got made. Are they ads? Yes they are ads. How would a loyal subscriber feel about those parts being hidden from them though? I imagine they would be miffed about that.<p>Native advertising like this has a whole spectrum of quality and the worst native ads are very explicitly ads that have no value to typical readers. However &quot;good&quot; native ads are really just a company paying for priority reporting in the style that would otherwise be done anyway, and are probably content that readers&#x2F;viewers want.<p>How do you resolve this? No idea. If I were paying I&#x27;d want to see that content assuming it&#x27;s good quality. Others would not on the basis of bias or a more philosophical opposition to ads.</div><br/><div id="42336895" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42336895" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dantyti</span><span>|</span><a href="#42336529">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42336759">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42336895">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42336895">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; However &quot;good&quot; native ads are really just a company paying for priority reporting in the style that would otherwise be done anyway, and are probably content that readers&#x2F;viewers want.<p>That&#x27;s akin to saying a person wants some of that &quot;good&quot; cancer.<p>If I am paying, I am supporting the editorial staff. It&#x27;s their decision what to report on and how. Paid-for content, even if it&#x27;s just for priority coverage, compromises the integrity of the editorial staff as well as their ability to curate (not to mention a clear disincentive to be critical of the ad buyer&#x27;s claims).<p>It starts when TheBrink publishes a high quality behind the scenes piece about a scam mobile game instead of a truly great indie game just because the latter is not as profitable and cannot afford to buy the ad.<p>It ends with the entire catalogue of the publication being paid for by advertisers. Much like some influencer&#x27;s instagram feed. Paying for access to an ad feed is unacceptible.<p>To add: &quot;the firewall&quot; between the editorial and business sides of a publication is the basic prerequisite for ethical journalism, even if it&#x27;s an entertainment rag. Advertising that masquarades as reporting is therefore the worst and most toxic, i.e., cancerous, of the bunch.<p>So I do not agree that native ads are something that should be desired.</div><br/><div id="42337579" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42337579" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lazyasciiart</span><span>|</span><a href="#42336529">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42336895">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42336759">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42337579">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42337579">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They didn&#x27;t say it should be desired.

This type of package is absolutely a thing that gets sold.<p>Sure, but does this ever get sold on a site that _doesn&#x27;t_ already have ads in the first place? You literally mention &quot;increased placement on ad units&quot;, so I&#x27;d argue that if this site is directly supported, they&#x27;ve already violated the principle in a way that doesn&#x27;t involve &quot;native ads&quot;, and if they aren&#x27;t directly supported, this principle doesn&#x27;t apply to them. I&#x27;m skeptical that there are any non-hypothetical examples of sites that charge for access and make deals for &quot;native ads&quot; in the form of content but don&#x27;t have any actual ad units that are displayed to users.<p>If I&#x27;m wrong and this is a thing, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s it&#x27;s really that hard to solve. When a user signs up for a paid subscription, as part of the sign-up process, show a screen that explains that sometimes the company will partner with sponsors to produce content about their products, link&#x2F;screenshot to a couple examples to make sure the user understands what you&#x27;re talking about, and then give them the choice to either have content like that shown or hidden, and then put that as a toggle they can flip whenever they want in their account settings and mention that fact when you prompt them for their initial choice. If companies don&#x27;t way to pay for a partnership because their metrics show that too many users turn off the publication&#x27;s sponsored content from showing, that&#x27;s just a sign that the system is working, since users shouldn&#x27;t be paying for sponsored content that they don&#x27;t actually want to see.</div><br/><div id="42337603" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42337603" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lazyasciiart</span><span>|</span><a href="#42336529">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42337321">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42336725">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42337603">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42337603">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Although I no longer pay for a subscription and can&#x27;t be certain, I used to have a paid subscription to The Pragmatic Engineer and I&#x27;m pretty sure the paragraph &quot;brought to you by X, Y and Z&quot; was still included in each post.

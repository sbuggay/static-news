No matter how you execute it, we are talking about people (homo sapiens) putting a major something on their heads that dramatically takes over their visual field for the pursuit of... what exactly? That is the puzzle.<p>There is a missing <i>aha</i> moment around this type of interface that would justify the major behavioral adjustment that is required for it to be adopted as a general purpose interface rather than a gimmick.<p>The number of devices sold so far does not impress me. A small number of people, especially youngsters with disposable income can be sold on anything (including fake currencies).<p>What is missing is an indication that this is actually an <i>empowering</i> piece of tech that is a a major new mode in our interface with computing.<p>What would be such indicators? Anything really. E.g. Some leaked stories that the teams developing these devices wear them all the time because it makes them so much more productive &#x2F; social &#x2F; fun &#x2F; transcedental &#x2F; [insert something people might actually want to have].<p>So far at least, this is a tech that is being pushed onto people rather than being pulled. I don&#x27;t think this was the case with any of the major steps in the development of digital computing but would be quite interested if people can think of historical precedent.</div><br/><div id="36255152" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36255152" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ynx</span><span>|</span><a href="#36253942">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36254187">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36255152">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36255152">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One of the most persistently irritating parts of being deep in this space is people loudly proclaiming what it is that VR is truly missing.<p>The answer is not only different for different people, but very different for some of them. It&#x27;s a way for trans people to express their real gender in a way that seriously alleviates their dysphoria, or for people to explore sexuality in a place they are fully equipped to defend themselves in, and discover that their biases or prejudices were weaker than they thought, or outright reaction formations to their real-life environment.<p>Still others use it as an artistic outlet, a mechanism for connecting to people across the world, a sandbox with which to experiment with and learn certain pieces of technology.<p>It&#x27;s been juiced up by Facebook money, sure. It&#x27;s not purely motivated by that by a long shot. There&#x27;s a demand and perhaps an oversupply in some respects, but the experiences achievable are legitimately delightful if you know how to look for them. Fantastic escape rooms, beautiful gardens, relaxing rooms, sleepy hideouts, fantasy worlds. This is all happening and has been happening for years.<p>There are of course serious caveats, such as some people being simply physically unable to tolerate it.<p>It&#x27;s a rough piece of technology early in its lifetime and it&#x27;s got a lot of road to cover, but it&#x27;s already nailed a level of immersion into an artificial world that nothing else has come even remotely close to - and it&#x27;s everything else that sucks to some moderate degree and needs to catch up and surpass the norm.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36254187" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36254187" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">darawk</span><span>|</span><a href="#36253942">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36255152">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36255159">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36254187">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36254187">[20 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; So far at least, this is a tech that is being pushed onto people rather than being pulled.<p>I think it&#x27;s very hard to tell the difference between these things ex ante. Everything that succeeds looks like it was pulled. But many things were pushed before they were pulled. Buying things on the internet, for instance. This was laughed at for quite a while, while a few people and companies were committed to the idea that it was the future. They were right of course, so right that it feels like it was effortless and demanded by the public, but it wasn&#x27;t. Not at first.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say that that will happen with VR either. Just to say that there is a long history of things being pushed hard and finally breaking through and becoming a near universal norm, and there is a long history of things being pushed hard and dying and being completely forgotten.<p>The promise of VR is to unlock a world free of the constraints of physics. Where physical distance prevents certain styles of communication and interaction - where physical real estate is finite and therefore rivalrous, etc. There are many things that VR, in principle, could solve. Whether or not the tech can deliver those things in a way that partially (or totally?) replaces actual physical reality remains to be seen. It is clear though that if you want to weave tech into the fabric of people&#x27;s lives in the deepest possible way, something like VR is probably your best bet.</div><br/><div id="36254555" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36254555" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">roomey</span><span>|</span><a href="#36253942">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36254187">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36254285">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36254555">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36254555">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m sorry, but buying things on the internet wasn&#x27;t laughed at, if anything people were worried about it cause of their credit card numbers.

The &quot;killer app&quot; for VR is immersive experiences - while there&#x27;s a niche for them, and I think we&#x27;ll see more and better iterations, I don&#x27;t think it has the growth potential that AR does.<p>The killer app for AR is the pair of glasses that pops up information as an overlay on the rest of the world. Directions? You get an arrow and line telling you where to go. Meet someone for lunch? Facial recognition tells you information about them - either recent social media posts if you&#x27;re already connected or something like a public profile if you don&#x27;t. Testing out a new recipe? It shows you step by step directions and floating video of the task you need to do right them. Watching a movie? Built in subtitles and tells you who the actors (or voice actors) are. Looking to buy a car? The AR headset gives you pricing information and stats for any car that you look at.<p>I could keep going. Think combination of Ready Player One, any gadget spy movie, and a video game isekai. Menus that allow you to make notes for when you go to the store, calendar reminders popping up visually<p>The potential for abuse of privacy is high, but the convenience factor and instant gratification probably mean that people will still adopt it in droves. Add in some kind of AI assistant that does a halfway decent job at anticipating the user&#x27;s needs and it&#x27;s a done deal.<p>The main things holding back that kind of thing are battery tech and miniaturization. 2 hours isn&#x27;t gonna cut it, and it needs to shrink to a more innocuous level before we get there, but that&#x27;s the direction I see it going. That&#x27;s probably also why these companies are working so hard at iterating, to get that first-mover advantage.<p>If we do get there I pity anyone with photosensitivity issues or epilepsy.

The rest is history.<p>VR has been in the market for some time now and despite the fact that competitors haven&#x27;t reached the level of technology that Apple has unveiled, those cheaper alternatives are by no means something that are either underdeveloped or half-way unusable products. I&#x27;ve tried a pair of Occulus few years ago and found them pretty impressive (putting aside all their flaws).<p>I must assume that since then these got better and prices actually dropped a bit, and if they haven&#x27;t they are still way way cheaper than what Apple will be selling next year and I&#x27;m sure you can have a ton of fun with budget ones as well.<p>But yet... Why VR goggles can&#x27;t be found in homes the same way that TVs, mobile phones and other popular electronic products despite that they are already affordable? Why hasn&#x27;t this technology became mainstream? Is it maybe due to the fact that the VR experience can&#x27;t be shared the same way that when we turn on a TV, play with friends with a gaming console on the couch or sit down on a desk
with a PC and we share its use? Is it because it lacks that mythical killer VR app that could be a gamer changer? Is it because the industry hasn&#x27;t released as much software for VR as for other more common devices like consoles, PCs, mobile phones?<p>It feels as if there&#x27;s still something inherently missing in VR that won&#x27;t make you go and buy a pair of goggles no matter how technologically advanced they become.

But do you really not see the mass appeal in a pair of smart sunglasses that augments computing in a way we haven&#x27;t experienced before?<p>The technology has the potential to disrupt computing as we know it, but it&#x27;s _really_ hard to get right, which is why the experimental stage has lasted for so long. XR is _much_ more complicated than any computer interface we&#x27;ve had so far, and requires advancements in several cutting edge tech to align: display, battery, computer vision, voice recognition, miniaturization, etc., and, of course, the price to come down.<p>There&#x27;s a reason all these companies are pushing so hard for this.

This first generation is obviously not a mass market product, but the tech and price will improve until it becomes one.</div><br/><div id="36254724" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36254724" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">landhar</span><span>|</span><a href="#36253942">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36254451">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36254342">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36254724">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36254724">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; If we go further back in time, mobile phones were bricks used only by business people [...]<p>But they were widely used by business people, and I’m assuming that was an important aspect of permeating into the other demographics.<p>To me, what happened with cellphones is similar to what happened with personal computers.

Just like VR for gaming, not everyone was willing to pay exhorbitant prices to lug around a briefcase of a phone, and use it only for poor quality phone calls.<p>&gt; AR&#x2F;VR devices are attempting this the other way around: their current use cases seem to be mostly recreational, and we are hoping they will eventually come up with some productivity use cases.<p>Sure, but the actual current use case doesn&#x27;t matter. Once the capabilities, price and user experience improve, it will become more appealing to a mass audience.<p>Think of the iPhone: there were certainly devices that had the same functionality of &quot;an iPod, a phone, and an internet mobile communicator&quot; before it. But Apple saw the right opportunity when the tech got good and cheap enough to vastly improve the user experience and expand the capabilities beyond just a mobile phone. It&#x27;s what they&#x27;re good at.<p>&gt; Someone in this thread talked about how they are surprised that tablets have sort of flopped<p>But tablets didn&#x27;t flop. They got merged into 2-in-1s, foldables, &quot;phablets&quot;, etc. They&#x27;ve certainly replaced laptops for many users. The only reason productivity is limited on devices like the iPad is because Apple wants to, for whatever reason (possibly to avoid cannibalizing sales of their other products?). But the iPad is still selling well, AFAIK, and many professionals use it. Google and Android never prioritized the tablet form factor, so it understandably lags behind. So productivity is restricted mostly because of software, and the touch interface makes it more suitable for consuming content. If you need to be productive and the software is not a problem, you add a mouse and keyboard, and there&#x27;s your 2-in-1.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36254342" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36254342" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">doctor_eval</span><span>|</span><a href="#36253942">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36254144">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36254451">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36254334">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36254342">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36254342">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well, if you look back at the history of Apple, most of their popular products were considered unnecessary, especially including the iPhone.

Tablets were not doing well when Apple launched the iPad. The smart watch industry (and traditional watch industry) were shrinking.<p>Computing platforms have a tendency to become conversion devices, and have a pricing advantage over individual devices. Phones became car GPS replacements and mid-tier photo&#x2F;video cameras. iPads became an ebook alternative for many. Apple Watch took on fitness tracking and more &#x27;quantified self&#x27; roles.<p>It wasn&#x27;t clear at launch what was likely or unlikely to succeed. Fashion-tier Apple Watches pretty much failed. iPads have a difficult time competing with eBook reader screens and portability. Fitness trackers maintain a battery life advantage over the Apple Watch.<p>&gt; But yet... Why VR goggles can&#x27;t be found in homes the same way that TVs, mobile phones and other popular electronic products despite that they are already affordable? Why hasn&#x27;t this technology became mainstream? Is it maybe due to the fact that the VR experience can&#x27;t be shared the same way that when we turn on a TV, play with friends with a gaming console on the couch or sit down on a desk with a PC and we share its use? Is it because it lacks that mythical killer VR app that could be a gamer changer? Is it because the industry hasn&#x27;t released as much software for VR as for other more common devices like consoles, PCs, mobile phones?<p>Possibly all of them? I draw parallels between an Oculus and the Nintendo 3DS. Compared to other game consoles, it isn&#x27;t an easily &#x27;sharable&#x27; experience. Software had to be custom-developed for it to take advantage of its capabilities (two screens, one with touch and one with 3D display).<p>Some of the adoption was made easier by being software-compatible with the DS platform, meaning it launched with backward compatibility with an established library of games. If you liked the DS, you were mostly guaranteed not to be giving anything critical up with the 3DS.<p>That said, it was still gimmicky, and was still too expensive for some of their target demographics while also being a bit limited in terms of technology. The price was cut by a third, a model with a larger and higher quality array of screens was unveiled, while cheaper 2D models also shipped which were priced closer to what parents were looking to spend.<p>It sold about 77 million units over nine years across all models.<p>Compare that to the Nintendo Switch, which sold over 125 million units (across all models) in its first six years. It is more versatile (being both a personal handheld and tv-attached unit), more easily shared and perceived as less gimmicky. It launched at about $10 more when adjusting for inflation, without game backward compatibility but with a store where you could purchase ported titles.<p>A big part of the success of the Wii and the Switch are that they are suitable for more casual gameplay, including party play. This is something that VR is not great at, as you need to fit hardware for every player switch and it is rare (and expensive) to have local multiplayer.<p>I would say the Wii overcame the gimmicky nature of the controller interactions via Wii Sports; yet another outstanding showcase game for the system, on par with Tetris for the Gameboy. The multiplayer physical interaction and open nature of play set a tone for the system in general.<p>&gt; It feels as if there&#x27;s still something inherently missing in VR that won&#x27;t make you go and buy a pair of goggles no matter how technologically advanced they become. And people spend a lot of money on expensive phones, gadgets and the alike...<p>Games are a hard lead-in - console-like devices such as the Quest are going to have significant limitations for cost, while hardware integrating with higher-end gaming rigs are naturally a low volume market. You can&#x27;t really have a game like Guitar Hero for it because of how private and difficult-to-adjust it is.<p>Industrial applications are far easier, but lower volume on high margin hardware. I imagine you are talking about more of a consumer&#x2F;prosumer adoption.<p>Workforce is confusing. I kinda enjoy the idea of Apple both mandating the engineers working on VR functionality come into the office. As an employee, it feels like workforce always skimps on per-seat investments, and will only consider hardware like this if an all-in-one headset &quot;spatial computer&quot; is cheaper than their bulk-order laptop.<p>But that said, the most difficult part is to keep people from trying to reinvent EVERYTHING as if it all has to be a 3D experience. There are certainly 3D tasks which are difficult to do with 2D tools (such as CAD), but there&#x27;s also 2D tasks like word processing that make little sense to reinvent as 3D tasks.<p>Apple seems to be targeting it as an alternative to an iPad or MacBook Air, with backward compatibility to run iPad apps as 2D surfaces, and the ability to operate a Mac &quot;screen&quot;. They seem to have invested quite a bit in screen quality to make presenting existing apps at existing text sizes feasible.<p>That approach is also understandable because that is the computing market Apple goes after. I have a hard time thinking this &quot;Pro&quot; headset would launch without a medium-term plan to get something in more of a $1500 price range. Apple Pro products generally exist because Apple thinks they should, and to let the higher BoM let them explore new technologies that aren&#x27;t yet feasible on their baseline consumer hardware. But in all cases, Apple seems to try to go after gaps in the market where they don&#x27;t see other companies investing in a particular experience.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36254403" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36254403" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jbc1</span><span>|</span><a href="#36253942">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36254144">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36255051">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36254403">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36254403">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;we are talking about people (homo sapiens) putting a major something on their heads that dramatically takes over their visual field for the pursuit of... what exactly?

Movie theatres 1) exist when television ownership is common and 2) advertise it when they have particularly big screens.<p>Laptops make up like half of all computer sales. Plenty of people have been trying to make working on tablets work to shave down a bit more size. Phones are frequently used for media consumption.<p>If I wasn&#x27;t a person who existed in the world and used devices, it&#x27;d still be perfectly obvious to me that people want to see a lot of stuff at once but they also don&#x27;t want to lug around the things necessary to do that. I am a person who exists in the world though and therefore have this very problem. I carry a phone everywhere I go and sometimes find myself giving up on tasks, or it not even occurring to me to try them, because I know they&#x27;ll be a lot easier when I have my laptop. I carry it to less places and find myself doing the same thing, leaving off tasks until I&#x27;m at my desk, which I carry nowhere.<p>I keep seeing people mention an aha moment or killer app needed to make these devices make sense and I honestly dont get it.

I&#x27;m not saying this decision was wrong -- it was right, clearly. I just mean they may very well ignore the existence of controllers... right up until they release an awesome high tech controller for us to buy (as an option).)<p>The controllers on the Quest Pro are fantastic, and although Meta also seems to be pushing as hard as they can to improve hand tracking and gesture recognition, too, there are and will always be immense benefits to having a hardware controller compared to just waving your hands and pinching your fingers. Precision, haptics, joysticks and buttons, additional positional audio, and more.<p>I have no doubt that if Vision OS succeeds, it will also eventually get spatially tracked controllers as well.

It&#x27;s obviously superior in terms of delivering a deeper and more varied lineup of games; Apple seems to understand that and are hardly mentioning games (although, that makes sense due to the price as well).<p>It will be interesting to see how Meta tries to leverage this advantage.

I brought up the game porting toolkit because of the performance people are achieving on their laptops that have similar or the same apple chip that the headset will have. I understand not everyone will see the appeal of playing regular games on a headset but I feel that it makes sense with what the way they are marketing it. The draw is that I could play AAA titles <i>practically</i> anywhere I want with just a headset and a controller. Those games would appear to be displayed on a full size TV or smaller&#x2F;larger depending on personal preference.<p>I have yet to find a reason to buy and keep a VR headset as most things just feel so gimmicky to me. At this point unless you’re either tethered to a more powerful device to be able to do the heavy lifting for the headset or you have a standalone headset that can play some basic arcade like games. A single device that can be taken on the go and play new releases not made specifically for the headset would be amazing to me. Obviously until it’s released who can say what it will actually be capable of but if it has the equivalent power of a MacBook, when my mid 2015 MacBook Pro finally dies I’d honestly consider replacing it with the vision pro but wouldn’t run out to buy one to have in addition to the MacBook.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36253496" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36253496" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lmm</span><span>|</span><a href="#36252702">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36253097">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36253523">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36253687">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36253496">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36253496">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; You&#x27;re not going to play VR games with a vanilla console controller.<p>You might.

If you can directly touch something, then by all means that is the best. But if the menu to be interacted with is too far away, say 8 meters away, all current systems I have seen make you shout a beam out of your hand to the button or object, then do some gesture to click.<p>A controller is way more accurate for this, kind of how a mouse is more precise for most people than a trackpad.

They had a session at WWDC where they highlighted that you can open a floating 4K resolution Xcode window inside the spatial environment, and have your app floating next to it.<p>(This does require a Mac to be also present, though.)<p>Secondly, none of these devices have anywhere close to enough computing power to make doing builds on them directly feasible — at least not for most coding work, including the work I do.<p>So I want to develop using the model popularized by tools like VS Code&#x27;s remote development extensions or GitHub Codespaces. I want the headset to render all the editors and other windows locally. I want the device to connect to my mechanical keyboard and mouse, so that I can do all my normal coding stuff. But the machine where the code actually is, where the build is actually done, and where the local dev server or similar runs -- all remote.<p>This is actually the workflow I now prefer even on desktops and laptops, now that the tooling is so good. But for a spatial computing headset device, this will have to be the main model.<p>And while I also am not at all a fan of Apple&#x27;s limiting what we can do on our devices the way they do, putting that aside you can already do this workflow in iPad. You can use CodeSpaces in the browser, but there is a cool native app called Blink[1] that lets you use your own hardware as the build machine.<p>I use a large and high-spec Linux workstation with 4 large monitors in my day-to-day work. But with VS Code remote, when I have to travel with my laptop, I just connect to the Linux workstation (via Tailscale in my case, but there are various options) and use the code editor locally on the laptop, but the CLI, build, etc is happening on the remote machine.<p>On a laptop, this works great. It is better than the regular workflow of doing it all on the laptop, because the tooling (if you use VS Code, anyway, but others are also working on this) is so good and the remote build machine is so much more powerful than a laptop. It also lets you just switch to a new device whenever you want without worrying about having to commit your changes first. So I can go to the office or just a different room of my house and just sit down at whatever computer is available and pick up where I left off.<p>But I&#x27;ve also done this using both the Quest Pro and iPad, just to check in with the state of the art on those devices. Both of them can do it. The Quest sucks in lots of ways (clunky OS, low-quality passthrough of the real environment, glitches). The iPad actually works fine, except teven the largest iPad Pro is a laughably tiny monitor to work on. (YMMV tho... if you are one of those &quot;I love small screen!&quot; people then this workflow works fine, and an iPad works as well as a laptop.)<p>For me, Quest Pro and iPad aren&#x27;t good enough. But I want to do this workflow on a headset device, and Vision Pro looks promising.<p>Anyway, my point here is that even if Apple does make weird restrictions about being able to use dev tools locally on the device, that won&#x27;t prevent it from doing the workflow I am interested in.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;blink-shell-build-code&#x2F;id1594898306" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;blink-shell-build-code&#x2F;id15948...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36254302" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36254302" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vxNsr</span><span>|</span><a href="#36252702">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36252923">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36253650">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36252920">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36254302">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36254302">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just fyi, by many accounts of people who used the vPro its screen resolution is on par with the qPro.

I&#x27;d definitely take the opportunity to test it prior to buying, if possible. OTOH though I am kind of an avid hobbyist in this area, so I buy one or two of these machines each year (and sell the ones I don&#x27;t have continued use for). So I&#x27;ll probably end up buying it regardless, unless it is somehow awful when it actually comes out.<p>The resolution isn&#x27;t the problem with Quest Pro (although I always want more) but the passthrough of the real environment around you is terrible. It&#x27;s very distorted, as if the cameras are far lower resolution than the screen is.<p>I&#x27;ve heard that this aspect of the experience is better on the Apple Vision Pro, although I don&#x27;t know for sure since I haven&#x27;t yet tried it myself.<p>This actually doesn&#x27;t matter <i>that</i> much, because the resolution is still good enough to walk to the fridge and grab a drink (or whatever) without taking it off.<p>The other super interesting thing to me is the external display of your eyes on the surface of the headset.<p>This sounded so stupid to me when it leaked before they announcement, that now I am embarrassed, because the problem is one we have <i>all the time</i> in my own house. I&#x27;ve realized it is a fundamental problem with these devices, and one I even had all the time, and yet I couldn&#x27;t see how that would solve it. But it really does seem to.<p>The problem we always have is, our kids put on one of the headsets we have, but then we (their mom and I, and their siblings&#x2F;friends) can&#x27;t tell whether they can see us or not. This actually really matters a lot -- if the wearer cannot see, then we need to make sure no other kids get near them, otherwise there is a risk of collision and injury. This is partially solved by casting the view from the headset to the TV or whatever, but this is glitchy and sometimes even disabled.<p>The other scenario where this is really useful is at the office, or even a coffee shop. When a coworker walks up to you, they have a visual indicator of whether you can see them or not. Actually a very important social cue.<p>Or when the waitress comes up to bring you your coffee. You can look at her and accept the coffee, and it is obvious to her that you can see the cup she&#x27;s handing you. Sure, she&#x27;ll still probably be a little weirded out the first time, but she&#x27;ll get used to it. :-D</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36252920" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36252920" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">drcode</span><span>|</span><a href="#36252702">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36252871">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36252923">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36253710">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36252920">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36252920">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Apple Helmet is heavy as all out, because they refused to make it out of plastic, and are instead using glass&#x2F;metal- Definitely an Apple move.<p>(heavy, considering there&#x27;s no included battery)</div><br/><div id="36252964" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36252964" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wahnfrieden</span><span>|</span><a href="#36252702">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36252920">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36253710">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36252964">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36252964">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">AirPods Max hurts my head so much I have to wear a hat&#x2F;beanie.

They were already established with lower-cost, lower-spec&#x27;d devices. However, BlackBerry couldn&#x27;t conceive of how more would be transformative. They insisted that the iPhone would flop because it didn&#x27;t have a keyboard and such.<p>When you said that the iPhone wasn&#x27;t succeeding today based on delight, I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s the only reason the iPhone succeeded. BlackBerry had an amazing brand and the ecosystem that you say it the reason the iPhone is successful today - including its own proprietary messenger service. The iPhone came along with delight and overthrew the established players.<p>If the Vision Pro offers users an experience that they like, it could make the Quest series look like BlackBerries: low-rent devices that were bought as toys for enthusiasts before real devices came along.<p>The thing about the iPhone is that people could instantly see what they&#x27;d enjoy it for. BlackBerries were a status symbol, had some business use cases, and were a nice toy for those who tried to buy distractions. When Apple introduced the iPhone, they showed real web browsing, useful maps (even before GPS), a better iPod than they&#x27;d ever seen, YouTube, and more.<p>With the Vision Pro, Apple is showing me something I could see myself using. I could wear it writing code and have more display space than 3 displays (and still use my keyboard). I could watch movies, I could browse the web, and I could play games. Apple is showing me how it could become an integral part of my usage rather than just a gadget that I&#x27;m likely to ignore.<p>I&#x27;m not an expert on the VR&#x2F;AR space, but it sounds like the Quest devices don&#x27;t really have the resolution for reading text comfortably which cuts out a lot of usage - just as the BlackBerry devices didn&#x27;t have good web browsing and other stuff. That could leave the Quest series in the BlackBerry zone where they&#x27;re trying to fill a similar niche, but they&#x27;re limited in the things that bring users back to the device rather than it sitting in a corner unused. It also seems like the Vision Pro is likely to be a lot more responsive. Android tends to have a lot of input lag compared to iOS and Apple&#x27;s M2 processor will run circles around the Qualcomm XR2 in the Quest Pro - plus Apple has a dedicated R1 processor for handling real-time sensor data. The XR2 has one performance core from 3 years ago compared to 4 performance cores in an M2.<p>Meta can&#x27;t even buy themselves a CPU that&#x27;s competitive. Apple&#x27;s M2 will be 40-50% faster on single-core stuff and it has 4 performance cores instead of 1 performance core in the top-end Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. On multi-core, the M2 is twice as fast. Plus, it has its own dedicated processor for handling all the sensor data!<p>When BlackBerry saw the iPhone design, they assumed Apple couldn&#x27;t pull it off. They thought practically the whole inside would have to be battery. They weren&#x27;t wrong about that, but Apple did pull it off. Is Meta thinking that Apple won&#x27;t be able to pull off a better experience than their devices? I don&#x27;t think companies are underestimating Apple at the moment.<p>Sometimes with tech, it&#x27;s about getting over a hump. Everyone had been trying to do handheld computers since the 80s - even Apple&#x27;s Newton development started in the 80s. Apple was the one who finally got it over the hump where it was really useful. Likewise, it&#x27;s not like headsets are new - Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Boy came out in 1995, 28 years ago. But the Virtual Boy didn&#x27;t get over that hump just as the Newton didn&#x27;t. With the Quest, if I have to strain to read text, maybe it hasn&#x27;t gotten over the hump. Again, I&#x27;m not an expert in this area, but my point is that it&#x27;s not just about better specs for the sake of better specs. It&#x27;s about better specs that overcome a barrier to usefulness. Things like latency and display clarity matter a lot when we&#x27;re talking about a headset device.<p>And if we want to attribute Apple&#x27;s success to its ecosystem, the Vision Pro ties into that ecosystem. You can run apps on Vision Pro and use it as a display for your MacBook. I understand the things I can already do if I had a Vision Pro, not just as a gadget.<p>The Vision Pro might still be a flop. It&#x27;s expensive and it might not offer that much more when in the real world. However, the keynote was really impressive to me. It seemed like something I&#x27;d get after it had been out for 4 years - kinda like the iPhone. But we&#x27;ll have to wait and see what happens.</div><br/><div id="36253750" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36253750" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fomine3</span><span>|</span><a href="#36249525">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36253232">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36252672">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36253750">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36253750">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I understand what you say, but I think you underrating gaming market.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36252672" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36252672" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stouset</span><span>|</span><a href="#36249525">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36252526">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36252599">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36252960">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36252672">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36252672">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Is Microsoft today in a fundamentally problematic position ?<p>I mean… pretty obviously yes?<p>Windows is rotting on the vine, Azure is nowhere near the market share of other players, and while they still have a large installed base of users they’ve done nothing particularly noteworthy in like a decade at this point.<p>If there’s anyone on the path to being the next IBM it’s them.</div><br/><div id="36252792" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36252792" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">the_duke</span><span>|</span><a href="#36249525">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36252672">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36252835">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36252792">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36252792">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Other points aside, Azure is doing perfectly well, and is much bigger than Google Cloud.<p>Almost every large company is already a Microsoft customer, and MS does a great job upselling Azure to many of them.<p>(recent estimates are AWS ~33%, Azure 23%, GC 10%)</div><br/></div></div><div id="36252835" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36252835" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">davepeck</span><span>|</span><a href="#36249525">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36252672">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36252792">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36252812">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36252835">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36252835">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Azure ($75.3B in 2022 revenue) is only slightly smaller than AWS ($80B).

You can convince yourself that endless screen real estate will solve your digital problems. &quot;Honey, it&#x27;s not for the PlayStation, it&#x27;s for actual work.&quot;<p>I think both approaches are decent, but I&#x27;ve got a feeling that Apple are skating to where the puck will be, as they say.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36253895" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36253895" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mouzogu</span><span>|</span><a href="#36253758">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36253885">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36254668">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36253895">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36253895">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Vison trailer felt like it was directed by Cronenberg or David Lynch.<p>Something very off about it, the over-polished, plastic execs, talking out of smiles wider than the grand canyon and the weird almost dreamlike people and scenarios.</div><br/><div id="36254037" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36254037" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seanhunter</span><span>|</span><a href="#36253758">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36253895">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36254542">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36254037">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36254037">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Compared to the closest comparable which was the Zuckerberg Meta reveal video[1] which was so weird the <i>country of Iceland</i> produced a parody of it.

Meta has a lot of strong competency in this space as far as building the core components of a hand tracked XR computing experience.<p>What I do think Zuck misses are two things:<p>1) The Quest&#x27;s overall software platform and ecosystem now need to get much much better about quality and performance&#x2F;efficiency. Meta is already starting from a disadvantage when it comes to the hardware performance but it&#x27;s clear a lot of the software can be a bit janky. Also the reliance on the Quest app for phone integration is bad enough, except that the quest app is atrociously buggy. A lot of this is exactly the sort of thing Carmack complained and pushed back about the most.<p>2) The Quest developer platform has a lot of work ahead of it as far as the kinds of 2D productivity apps and 2D media consumption apps that were primarily showcased. When apple can give devs Xcode and tell them a checkbox can turn their UIKit&#x2F;SwiftUI App into a XR app thats not a small thing. Also all of Apples stack is either unity or swift based. Having a high level native system of deploying high quality Abi stable native frameworks is also no small thing. Meta has a lot of work ahead of it I feel if it wants to compete on the developer front to get app developers to write some truly great productivity software needed to sell Quests as general computer PC replacements instead of gaming products only.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36248032" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36248032" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anonzzzies</span><span>|</span><a href="#36253482">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36252483">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36248032">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36248032">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Keep bickering ya’ll ; it’s all better for us people who want to get work done.

When you actually put on the headset, though, you&#x27;ll often find that the promotional video was pure aspiration and reality still has some catching up to do. That was my experience with HoloLens, and it has been that way with consumer AR devices like Nreal, too. That was not my experience with Vision Pro. To be clear, it wasn’t perfect. But it’s the first time I’ve tried an AR demo and thought, “Yep, what they showed in the promo video was pretty much how it really works.”

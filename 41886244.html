(Yes, you need _permission_ to quit. Fuck the law)<p>This person was a fairly senior engineer and thus quite essential to the company so they kept giving him the run around, rescheduling his chats and not giving him a direct answer.<p>One day, a letter addressed to the dept head came, looking all important and official, like it came from a client. The dept head opened the letter and after taking a quick glance immediately tossed it. Our senpai engineer then jumped up and shouted across the entire office, you have seen my notice now, you cannot deny my resignation! I quit! And he stormed off like a boss.<p>Basically the gist of the story is that they cannot deny your resignation if requested but as long as they don’t acknowledge it they can pretend you never requested it. That’s the origin story of these companies.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41886403" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41886403" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cen4</span><span>|</span><a href="#41886581">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41886455">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41886403">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41886403">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just go to Google News and search of Japanese turning to resignation agencies.<p>All it takes is one news org doing a small story a month ago and now we get hundreds of stories from news orgs around the world with all kinds of opinions and mutations to the original story.

It was quite a disturbing story and was reported around the time some more high profile cases of people being arrested in UAE for what would be normal things in western countries. I saw the same story with the same language appear in dozens of news sites I read and then got suspicious that the wording was near identical and the individual never named.<p>search for &quot;swiss national jailed UAE poppy seeds&quot; and you can still see some of the articles<p>Anyway, I contacted the NGO (who it seems does good work, btw!) and asked who this person was and what happened to them. I got a response that during an interview about a more prominent case they told one journalist that it was just a rumour they heard and the story snowballed from there. Nobody contacted them to get more details.<p>The point I took is not that anyone is malicious or has some sinister agenda but that budgets in newsrooms had been so cut to the bone and &quot;content&quot; needed to be produced as fast as possible to get the clicks, to churn out those stores, and get that ad revenue that nobody had time to do basic fact checking.

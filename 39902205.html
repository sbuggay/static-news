I&#x27;ve got a use-case, long time friends with a glass blower. I was thinking of using it to make faceted glass pendants. They&#x27;ve got a faceting machine but it is manually operated.<p>The hard part is repeatability. You need tight tolerances and each joint in the arm adds inaccuracy the further you get from the base. If the base has 1mm of wiggle, the 20cm arm has 4mm wiggle at the end, and the arm beyond it has even more.<p>You also, for faceting purposes, need much finer resolution than an ungeared servo will have. Gearing it is tricky because you want backlash to keep the join tight, but not so much that it has high friction when moving. You don&#x27;t really want to use a worm gear because they&#x27;re both slow and overly rigid. So a cycloidal gear is the best bet for the gears in the arm. You also need real servos with some amount of feedback because grabbing at glass is sketchy at best.<p>I was estimating 1-2k build cost, bulk of that is in the gearboxes.</div><br/><div id="39905773" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39905773" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mglz</span><span>|</span><a href="#39905276">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39907384">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39905773">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39905773">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One thing that is amazing about industrial robots is how rigid they are when at standstill. Breaking systems start to be a challenge too at high speeds and loads.<p>And once you manage to get the hardware working, getting a kinematic solver to really <i>work</i> is a massive challenge. Tons of edge cases, real-time feedback to handle and the need to balance usability with reliability. That&#x27;s where robot companies charge a lot, and rightfully so.<p>Whenever you can avoid building a robot arm and replace it with simpler kinematics, you should.

For reference, these designs got to approx 1mm repeatability with 2.5kg payload at ~80cm reach, meant to model a human arm somewhat.<p>Here&#x27;s some specifics if you&#x27;re interested. Depending on the end effector payload requirements, a mix of NEMA34,24,17 can do this (bigger ones for earlier joints). You can go cycloidal&#x2F;harmonic gears if you have the budget, otherwise each actuator (motor + driver + gearbox + shaft coupling) would run you something like $100-$200 depending heavily on supplier and exact requirements (+$50 or so for closed-loop systems). So not terrible on the price front. Then for the base joint you&#x27;d want some wider cylindrical gearbox that distributes the load across better.<p>If you&#x27;re able to work with a machine shop I think you can put together something really high quality. Here&#x27;s some example design inspirations, some of them even better than what I described I was able to put together as a hobbyist:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7z6rZdYHYfc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7z6rZdYHYfc</a> (this one is fantastic; a smaller and lighter version operated more slowly would have even less wiggle from the base)

If you are applying force in one direction and all the backlash has been taken up, everything is fine -- any force you apply or movement you make will be transmitted to the tool like you&#x27;d expect. However, if you have to decelerate, or you&#x27;ve gone over-center, or the tool&#x2F;load pulls harder than you&#x27;re pushing, now you have to apply force in the other direction, which you can&#x27;t do until you take up the backlash.<p>If your axis has high enough friction, then nothing will move when your actuator is in the decoupled backlash region, so you can compensate by adding the backlash amount to your target position whenever you switch directions. But that means you need more friction than tool force, with bigger motors and drivetrain to compensate. It&#x27;s often easier just to build a system with zero backlash, then you can focus on tuning for system rigidity&#x2F;resonance (as shown in your link).</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39907617" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39907617" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Climato</span><span>|</span><a href="#39905276">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39905770">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39909817">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39907617">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39907617">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think about this regularly just don&#x27;t have the time to pursue it:<p>Couldn&#x27;t you build your arm in Nvidia Omniverse by also adding feedback like a cheap hig resolution distance or angle detector and train an ml model to compensate it?</div><br/><div id="39908682" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39908682" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">GabeIsko</span><span>|</span><a href="#39905276">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39907617">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39909817">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39908682">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39908682">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Making and animating a 3D graphics robot arm is trivial compared to building it in real life.

What we found was that giving someone a robot arm - even one with reasonable APIs and no cost to them - didn&#x27;t really help because the hard part is making useful automations. Mostly people spent a few hours playing with the arm and then put it on a shelf.<p>Every use case is completely different and is a lot of work. Even when you get something working, accidentally shake the desk or crash the arm into something and all your coordinates are broken and you have to start again.<p>Not to mention the actual mechanics are really complicated - to have a meaningful payload at 50cm reach you end up with really high torque at the base joints (which also need to have super-high accuracy), which requires expensive gears and motors. None of that is cheap.<p>Then you get to safety - an arm that has a useful payload is also quite heavy, and having that amount of mass flailing around requires safety systems - which don&#x27;t come cheap.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like hardware no-code - you can&#x27;t make an easy to use robotic arm because programming it is inherently hard. I think the only thing that will change that is really good AI.</div><br/><div id="39905989" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39905989" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zafka</span><span>|</span><a href="#39903545">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39905891">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39906876">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39905989">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39905989">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In Robotic assisted surgery, Tracking targets are mounted on the robot arm and an infrared camera tracks the exact position.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39906876" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39906876" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dansitu</span><span>|</span><a href="#39903545">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39905891">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39905989">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39906010">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39906876">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39906876">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s cool to hear from someone with experience!<p>Do you know if anyone has tried building an arm that uses spatial positioning techniques from augmented reality, like structured light or pose tracking[1], to understand the position of the arm in space without resorting to &quot;dead reckoning&quot;?<p>It seems like that kind of approach would increase the physical tolerance and reduce the programming complexity, since you know both a) where the arm is supposed to be, and b) where it actually is.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pose_tracking#Outside-in_tracking" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pose_tracking#Outside-in_track...</a></div><br/><div id="39909637" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39909637" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ska</span><span>|</span><a href="#39903545">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39906876">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39906010">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39909637">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39909637">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is actually pretty common.

And if it can beat the toddler it risks injuring them because neither of them really understand what&#x27;s happening and what the risks are. The arm can&#x27;t stop if the toddler says &#x27;ow&#x27;.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>Handwriting notes for small jewelry brand?</i>&quot;<p>Can be done already with a commercial 2D plotter: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.axidraw.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.axidraw.com&#x2F;</a> . It costs twice as much as this arm, but you don&#x27;t have to build it and it already has &quot;software for realistic handwriting&quot; and there&#x27;s a company to get support from.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>Handing towel when in the bathroom, then getting a new one?</i>&quot;<p>Is the arm big enough to be useful for that? It appears to be shorter than a typical human arm so it would be cheaper, simpler and quicker to put the pile of clean towels a foot closer to the shower where the robt arm is sitting, and not have the robot arm at all. Plus you wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with electricity in the bathroom or dripping water on the robotics as you reached for the towel it was handing you. (Are you thinking of a robot arm with cameras for feedback of where it&#x27;s positioned? Cameras in a bathroom won&#x27;t be popular with everyone no matter how much you promise they are innocent).<p>&gt; &quot;<i>Setting up my morning espresso? (grinding the beans and turning on the coffee machine)</i>&quot;<p>Simpler and cheaper done with a timer mains plug which you can get for under $10. Put the beans in and load up the coffee machine the night before (work you&#x27;d have to do anyway) and have the timer start them in the morning. If you expect the robot arm to unseal a bag of coffee beans, measure some out, deposit them in the grinder, close the grinder, and close and seal the bag after, you&#x27;ll wake up to spilled beans and unsealed bag a lot of days before you get that working reliably. Instead of $250 plus weeks of effort to speed up this 2 minute task(!) you can get a Keurig &#x2F; Nespresso pod coffee maker for less than $100.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>Drink mixer?</i>&quot;<p>How much spilled wasted alcohol, plus time of disassembling and cleaning your robot arm and the surface it sits on, and the floor, or finding the bottles, unscrewing the tops, handing them to the arm, waiting for the arm to slowly pour them which you could have done quicker, then putting the tops back on and putting the bottles away yourself, then putting the drink stirrer into the arm, then waiting for it to mix the drinks which you could have done yourself quicker, before you decide this was not a good use of time or money? (How often do you drink mixed drinks anyway?)<p>The robot isn&#x27;t going to learn to do the task better next time like a human could so if you have to get involved in the task <i>at all</i>, you may as well do it yourself. And if it&#x27;s a 15 second task like &quot;reaching for a towel&quot; what are you doing with your life trying to automate that? Roomba saves a lot of time, a lot of annoyance, it could be worth it even if it does an inferior job - because you can leave it running over and over and over. Same with a robot lawnmower, if you just glance around to make sure there&#x27;s no pets or children in the way then let it go, it can save you a good chunk of time and if it goes wrong you just get a patchy lawn or dusty floor and it can retry tomorrow. But handing you a towel or mixing you a drink saves you almost no time, but if it goes wrong you get a broken bottle of sticky drink all over or a pile of towels on the floor, which has undone months of &#x27;time saved&#x27; in one go.</div><br/><div id="39906514" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39906514" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sebastiennight</span><span>|</span><a href="#39903545">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39906162">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39903561">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39906514">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39906514">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I like how this comment is clear, comprehensive, full of common sense,<p>AND very likely to be completely outdated within a few generations (5 years?) of robotics + AI progress.<p>I would also not discount how easy it is to sell people on additional cameras in their homes (including the bathroom) for the sake of convenience.</div><br/><div id="39907755" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39907755" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jodrellblank</span><span>|</span><a href="#39903545">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39906514">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39909965">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39907755">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39907755">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">State of the Art public robot arms include Boston Dynamics&#x27; Stretch[1].

I would be very surprised.<p>(Can you get a robot arm today, for any price, to help a quadraplegic open their mail, bring a drink with a straw in it to their mouth, lift them into a sitting position, hold a book in front of them and turn the pages, or ... do anything helpful? I&#x27;m not aware of any, but haven&#x27;t been looking specifically).<p>Yes you could probably build a robot today which hands you a towel from a pile, reliably and swiftly, or selects the bottles of alcohol and opens them and pours and mixes a drink - in a carefully controlled and lit environment where none of the lids or corks are stuck and the glasses are all a similar shape and size and nobody is allowed to be near it - I don&#x27;t say it&#x27;s impossible with today&#x27;s tech, but it would cost a lot more than $250.

Maybe more than one. You want depth sensing? Even an cheap choice like a RealSense is going to add another $250 to your costs. And you&#x27;ll need a sturdy mount for it, the robot&#x27;s going to vibrate the table and you don&#x27;t want to suffer motion blur.<p>Got the camera in a fixed location, over the area you&#x27;re picking from? Then the robot&#x27;s going to block the camera&#x27;s view when it reaches in. No real-time hand eye coordination for you. Putting the camera on the robot&#x27;s wrist? Now you&#x27;ve got motion blur problems - and reliability problems, because normal USB cables aren&#x27;t designed for continuous flexing. You&#x27;ve also got a gripper in view all the time - and now the camera moves, things are always out of focus.<p>The reach of the arm isn&#x27;t long enough to give you many bins to drop items off into, considering the number of lego parts there are. The longer you make the arm, the greater the torque at the shoulder joint. Making the motors bigger? Now the elbow motor is heavier. Gearing them down? Now you&#x27;ve got gear backlash.<p>Your Dynamixels will break, for some reason. Maybe eventually you&#x27;ll figure out why. In the meantime, $50 each please.<p>Parts like the small satellite dish <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bricklink.com&#x2F;v2&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;catalogitem.page?P=4740#T=C" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bricklink.com&#x2F;v2&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;catalogitem.page?P=4740...</a> will prove very hard to grasp. And there&#x27;s like 50 different colours, you&#x27;re going to need to know your way around lighting and camera settings if you want to reliably tell transparent light blue, transparent medium blue and transparent dark blue apart.<p>And that&#x27;s before you get into questions like how to tell a 2x4 stud brick apart from two 1x4 stud bricks next to each other - or how to grasp a brick when an adjacent brick is blocking you from getting in with the gripper.<p>Every single one of these issues is solvable - but by the time you&#x27;ve solved them all?

I always wanted one of those AR robot arms but I&#x27;d rather buy it off-the-shelf than assemble from scratch. I don&#x27;t think anyone sells them pre-built though. This type of &#x27;high level hobbyist robotics&#x27; is in a bit of business dead-zone unfortunately, as it&#x27;s some combination of too small a market and not enough use cases to justify having a company around. Or maybe there&#x27;s potential there but no one&#x27;s thought of it yet.<p>Btw I bet your arm&#x27;s movement smoothness can be improved with some different deceleration rates. It was really fun watching it sort those beans!<p>My research goal with one of these &#x27;good enough&#x27; 1mm repeatability robots would be vision-guided adaptive control to complete tasks after seeing examples of them done via human manual control. Would be a really interesting ML&#x2F;AI problem. Just need a reasonable hardware platform to get started. Right now I&#x27;m leaning more towards simple&#x2F;smaller servo motors like in the OP of this post (plus there&#x27;s the cost&#x2F;time trade-off).</div><br/><div id="39908025" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39908025" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">robmurrer</span><span>|</span><a href="#39905103">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39907512">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39903666">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39908025">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39908025">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">this is where my research is going. camera -&gt; llm -&gt; targets -&gt; tasks -&gt; ros2 arm :)</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39903666" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39903666" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SSNLF</span><span>|</span><a href="#39905103">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39902939">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39903666">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39903666">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s cool but just reminds me of the robotic manipulation episode of big bang theory.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39902939" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39902939" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hyperswine</span><span>|</span><a href="#39903666">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39903487">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39902939">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39902939">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">wow, thats really amazing.

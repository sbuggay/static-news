But we can clearly see that the experiences of their childhood had a huge effect on their financial situation as adults.<p>It also has an effect on virtually everything else in their lives.&quot;<p>You cannot infer the direction of causality from this data, i.e. that the traumatic experiences themselves cause the poorer outcomes.  I remember reading about how in Chicago someone had noticed that kids who did better had more books at home, so they decided to give poor kids books.  Certainly not a bad thing to do, but just giving them some books is not going to make them like the better off kids in all of the other (highly correlated) ways that they&#x27;re different.<p>Just as an example, one of the traumatic factors they identify is if a kid had witnessed someone being shot.  The wealthy kids are way less likely to see anyone get shot, because if people were regularly getting shot in their neighborhood, they would move.  The poor kids&#x27; parents don&#x27;t always have that option.  In this case it could be the poverty itself, not the shooting that is causing the poor outcomes.  But then you get into why the parents are poor in the first place, and there are many causes, but a lot of them get passed down to the next generation in one way or another.</div><br/><div id="40058222" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40058222" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">GuB-42</span><span>|</span><a href="#40057417">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40057583">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40058222">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40058222">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think witnessing someone being shot is a good metric because it is factual.

I&#x27;d be curious if you had any major setbacks that you rebounded from after things started rolling successfully forward for you. Now at 32, unemployed with a spotty resume and no prospects, I could really use a &amp;pointer (or reference ;))<p>Reading through your comment and picturing my own upbringing (poor, abusive, but I guess I got a handle on it and discovered programming through gaming eventually, it does make me sad that although there were hand-me-down computers available that I gravitated toward and experimented with, I could not picture where the nearest library was, and had to Google it now. I&#x27;m not particularly resentful though, I did get out, and I&#x27;m grateful for that.<p>I wonder if the books alone would have been enough, but having the books and the physical escape together is kind of incredible, and it&#x27;s heartening to hear you used the hell out of that space.<p>Much earlier on, I had some exposure to small motors, and had some mentorship from my extended family on the programming front, but didn&#x27;t really have a sense of how to build on that; no conception of how to connect motors with gears in a more complex system, no business exposure at all, no ability or framework for learning how to execute on any project, and just a debilitating lack of motivation up until around 17, along with no appreciation for the idea of proving myself measurably; I thought I was capable, but apparently wasn&#x27;t. I got my little bots for Runescape running though, and that was empowering.<p>Thankfully, I did and continue to have a similar refuge at the skatepark, which provided me some social and physical benefits for free, much like your basketball league, that a surprising amount of people I meet now don&#x27;t have. I was nerdy, but couldn&#x27;t execute, and couldn&#x27;t see how I&#x27;d get there. My first job was a glimpse into how much potential there was available; I made more than my father who I was on good terms with, but then I was laid off for lack of reason to have me on the payroll, which took a positive signal and turned it into hopelessness in a way. I experienced adult job loss <i>my first time</i> trying. It was a great opportunity that I relish in some ways still. I then got another job as a frontend developer, making a bit more, and then burnt out, slowed down, and got fired, partially because I was trying to do CSS things that nobody was paying me to do, instead of just writing some JavaScript to handle dynamic layout and getting the job done. I was too deep in the weeds and got stuck there, but the idea of just cranking out things quickly wasn&#x27;t stimulating enough and I&#x27;d just sit there trying to convince my brain to do the work.<p>Since then, it&#x27;s just been gradual pay increases, some early freelance clients that worked out for a while, but at this point I&#x27;ve never held a continuous job for longer than a year and a half, and I feel like the pieces of minor success are hard to stabilize, despite being in a wildly better situation still than I&#x27;d ever have imagined in high school, and a hell of a lot of personal inward reflection. My last job title was Software Engineer II, but really I&#x27;m just a generalist that keeps failing upward, and I don&#x27;t know whether if I were to double-down and specialize more, go deeper, or pivot out completely, I&#x27;d be able to do that well; it&#x27;s a bit of a constant existential crisis. It&#x27;s hard to be consistent over a long period of time without a manager deciding I was a liability or me just burning out so badly, or a series of unfortunate life events coming together for the negative, and once you&#x27;re out, it&#x27;s extremely hard to get back in.<p>For the last year, I&#x27;ve been working my way through Nand2Tetris, because in a career highlight I landed an actual interview with Apple (that ended up going nowhere, rightfully so because my lowest level knowledge didn&#x27;t exist) as well as building a small SwiftUI project that may or may not see the light of day, and while I think those are positive moves, it&#x27;s going to be a hard year ahead that may take me to net zero again unless I can pick up something in general labor for while (Waiting tables would be quite difficult without a solid short-term memory, and don’t believe someone would hire me for that with largely tech experience and random interspersed menial work).<p>Anyhow, ultimately I wholeheartedly agree with your sentiment, those little shifts really do add up for either the positive or sometimes negative. I think the longer you can keep them positive, keep the ball rolling forward, the more likely things will work out, and as a society it&#x27;s crucial we continue making it possible to smooth out the experience of life, especially for people who grow up in volatile situations.</div><br/><div id="40059700" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40059700" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">noisy_boy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40057417">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40059567">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40057632">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40059700">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40059700">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; My last job title was Software Engineer II, but really I&#x27;m just a generalist that keeps failing upward, and I don&#x27;t know whether if I were to double-down and specialize more, go deeper, or pivot out completely, I&#x27;d be able to do that well; it&#x27;s a bit of a constant existential crisis.<p>As a generalist that still has the title Software Engineer after over 25 years of experience, I think I am able to empathize.

Another approach is building something on the side that you know will be very useful, even though nobody asked for it - helps you figure out the quick way of doing it (what you mentioned) since these are POCs and you can&#x27;t repeatedly spend too long on them.</div><br/><div id="40060842" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40060842" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">brailsafe</span><span>|</span><a href="#40057417">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40060568">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40057632">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40060842">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40060842">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Really good suggestions, thanks.

The problem begins when children start to believe everything is their own fault.<p>This is only tangentially related, but I think your point is critically important. Relatively recently I did ketamine infusion therapy for depression, and it was life changing for me. Ketamine is a &quot;dissociative&quot;, and one thing that it seriously helped me do was separate my &quot;self&quot; from my depression, which I&#x27;ve never really been able to do before despite decades of trying through therapy. That is, now that I see depression as a chronic condition I <i>have</i> (say perhaps analogous to people that have to deal with migraines), as opposed to something that I <i>am</i> at my core, it makes it much, much less scary and threatening to me.<p>In my experience, I&#x27;ve noticed that the people who I think of as the most successful (both from a society-wide and personal perspective) have the clearest view of what is their control and what they can accomplish, and also what is not. A huge benefit of this is that when they see an obstacle that some person could potentially overcome, even if it would be very, very difficult, they tend to think &quot;Heck, why not me?&quot; And when they do hit setbacks because of the unpredictability of the world, they don&#x27;t take it personally, they just tend to think &quot;Well, the world is chaotic - is this new problem something that can reasonably be overcome?&quot; I contrast with a mindset I had for a long time (which a large part I think was a consequence of being bullied) that if I put a lot of effort into something and just didn&#x27;t succeed, it was fundamentally because I wasn&#x27;t &quot;good enough&quot;, so why bother trying that hard at something else as I&#x27;m likely not going to be good enough there either.</div><br/><div id="40059374" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40059374" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">quadragenarian</span><span>|</span><a href="#40054247">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40057461">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40059330">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40059374">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40059374">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Very true.

Ergo, it&#x27;s not to say that that model is wrong, just that it&#x27;s not useful in answering a question like should we increase the minimum wage.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40058607" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40058607" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">valrix</span><span>|</span><a href="#40054247">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40056355">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40058870">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40056506">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40058607">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40058607">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Except an employee&#x27;s contribution isn&#x27;t static, while their cost is.<p>$7.25 x 8 hours = $58 for the day.

We could, for example, ban private equity companies from buying houses and healthcare companies, break up national monopolies into regional companies, and eliminate a lot of the consolidation that has traditionally enhanced the bargaining power of the company owner against the employees.<p>In the short term it would make a lot of stuff less efficient, but when people talk about &quot;efficiency&quot; they really mean driving costs down and driving income up.

My punishments were for truancy. I went to school, but spent all of my time in the computer lab because with severe ADHD without any academic support rendered class pointless. One crusty old Korean War vet teacher flat-out told me he &quot;didn&#x27;t believe in IEPs,&quot; and the administrators refused to even address the problem. I never once started a fight, brought drugs to school, or had a gun. While people found me pretty intimidating looking at first, I had a genuinely warm, mature, and mutually respectful relationship with damn near anybody I interacted with. No students really had a problem with me, but the adults actually enjoyed interacting with me more. Most teachers, administrators, librarians, etc would stop me for a quick chat to catch up, talk about current events, or whatever if we passed each other. I didn&#x27;t ruin shit, and neither did a hell of a lot of other kids that were punished because the school didn&#x27;t hold up their end of the bargain for academic accessibility.<p>&gt; When I was kid we had people that brought guns to school and were kicked out it seemed reasonable to me.<p>Whoa there straw man. It&#x27;s completely ridiculous to lump academically struggling kids or kids with run-of-the-mill behavioral problems in with kids that bring deadly weapons to school. Nobody is arguing that kids who bring guns into school should be sent on their way after a stern talking to.<p>Also, nobody said that alternative schools weren&#x27;t on the table. I, myself, graduated in a night school program designed for failing high school students who&#x27;d been successful at work, and it was a phenomenal experience. They gave us a lot more leeway and expected us to do schoolwork mostly independently while working at least 20 hours per week, and we&#x27;d fail the entire term for all classes if we missed a single assignment. It was precisely the lack of patronizing meddling you&#x27;re advocating for that allowed hundreds of kids to graduate through that program.<p>&gt; In both cases<p>Kids are generally held back because they&#x27;re struggling with the material, not because they&#x27;re being disruptive.

I&#x27;m one of the few that &#x27;made it out&#x27;. Many of my childhood friends are dead (usually overdoses), suffer from substance abuse, or are still stuck in the poverty cycle (on average it takes 7 generation to break the cycle).<p>I look at this visualization and I can feel, to my core, what these folks feel. Even for those that &#x27;made it out&#x27;, I feel for them. I struggle with my mental health, I&#x27;ve had to actively reparent myself, and I feel pretty lonely. Many of the people I&#x27;m surrounded by don&#x27;t know what it feels like to carry all the weight from your childhood.<p>I do agree that the government shouldn&#x27;t just throw resources at the problem. There are some things the government can do, though.<p>1. Teach conflict resolution skills to young children. This mitigates adverse experiences and prepares the children for adulthood (especially if they &#x27;make it out&#x27;)<p>2. Address addiction as a health problem and not a criminal problem. Children don&#x27;t need to see their parents as criminals, they need to witness them get better.<p>3. Reduce the burden of poverty. For instance, the poorer you are the further you have to travel to the grocery store. The people who often don&#x27;t have the means to easily travel for food have to travel for food.<p>4. Access to education. The people I grew up around who have found success did so because our schools were really well equipped.<p>You&#x27;ll notice I didn&#x27;t list access to support systems. Honestly, they are kind of useless. As a child you understand that if you open up about your experience there is a solid chance your parents will get in trouble or you&#x27;ll be removed from your home. No child wants this.

A lot of my experience growing up in California during the 90s was &quot;tell an adult&quot; and &quot;zero tolerance&quot; coming down from school administrators. This is useful at a very young age, but it neglects to equip the children with agency for when the adults aren&#x27;t around. You can&#x27;t tell an adult when you&#x27;re on the school bus and conflict breaks out. You can&#x27;t tell an adult when you&#x27;re out on a soccer trip and people are getting rowdy in the locker room. The bystander effect is very strong in school aged children because we neglect to introduce them to their inherent agency in conflict.<p>There is also a degree of antifragility that parents could teach as well.

Driving to work takes 15 minutes. Taking the bus _home_ from work takes an hour. Taking the bus _to_ work would require extra time -- leaving early to make sure I don&#x27;t miss the bus. And this is only a 3-5 mile ride, where the bus picks up half a block from my work and drops me off a block from home.<p>There&#x27;s a shopping center with multiple markets and Walmart and Kohl&#x27;s that the bus comes up along then turns away from on the way to work; I can use this as an example of shopping from home, as I can probably get 90% of my living supplies there. Ralphs, Target, Walmart, Kohls, Trader Joe&#x27;s, etc are all here. The bus transfer here is not an easy one, though, as the bus timings overlap going in both directions, meaning you have to leave early and get back later (about 1 in 4 trips I can transfer without waiting. _Not_ good odds with an hourly bus).<p>0:00 5 minutes: walk to bus stop 1.<p>0:05 5 minutes: wait for the bus (best to be at the stop early in case your bus is early, though this bus is usually exactly on time)<p>0:10 10 minutes: take the bus to stop 2.<p>0:20 3 minutes: cross the street to get on the other bus<p>0:23 12 minutes: wait for the next bus 2, the previous one left while you were crossing (yes, seriously)<p>0:35 10 minutes: take bus 2 to stop 3 where the shopping center is<p>0:45 90 minutes: cross the parking lot to get to the store (5~10 minutes), then try and get all your shopping done in under 40 minutes so you can take the next bus back home. Nope, today you had to go to the supermarket pharmacy, which is a 20 minutes walk across the shopping center, wait for your meds, _and_ walk back to the cheaper market to do your shopping as well.<p>2:15 30 minutes: shopping is done a bit early. Yay. You have time to walk back to the bus stop and wait in the sun until the next bus 2 comes. Yay.<p>2:45 10 minutes: Bus 2 comes. Take it back to the transfer bus stop.<p>2:55 15 minutes: Cross the street again, and wait for bus 1 so you can get home<p>3:10 10 minutes: take bus 1 home.<p>3:20 15 minutes: Now you&#x27;re a block away from home, carrying bags of groceries, _and you had to get off 2 stops early so you could use a crosswalk_, because there&#x27;s no crosswalks on this street and people don&#x27;t stop. Walk home.<p>3:35. Tadah. You&#x27;re home. Just a bit over 3.5 hours!<p>Unfortunately, since you don&#x27;t have a car, you&#x27;re limited to buying what you can carry. I hope you&#x27;re ready to go shopping again later this week! You have family? Oh, well then you&#x27;ll be shopping again 3 times this week. Maybe even 4 times. I hope you like waiting in the sun&#x2F;rain, LA Metro only puts up cover where they can make money off advertising, so all the bus stops we&#x27;ve used only have benches (except one, but that one&#x27;s further away).<p>If all you needed was medication, you&#x27;ll probably want to get your shopping done anyways, as this is otherwise a &gt; 2hr trip just for that (remember, bus 2 is hourly, so you&#x27;re spending an hour at the shopping center _minimum_, including walking to&#x2F;from the bus stop).<p>There&#x27;s five other stores across the street from the shopping center that you&#x27;d like to check out sometime, including a new grocery store, but it takes 20 minutes to cross the shopping center, then probably another 10 to cross the street and the parking lot in front of the other stores. Add the time spent in these stores, and you&#x27;ve just added another hour to your shopping trip. This is only _partially_ offset by crossing to the supermarket pharmacy, as that supermarket is nowhere near the corner, and keep on kind that anything you have to carry will slow you down more.<p>-----<p>Buses:<p>- Bus 1 goes EW near home, turns NS between home and the transfer point (about 10 minutes), then goes EW again.<p>- Bus 2 goes EW, turns NS between the shopping center and transfer point, and goes EW again.<p>- There _was_ a bus that went NS along the east side of the shopping center (which also would have dropped me off at home, cutting out the need for a second bus entirely), but this bus route was changed in 2019 to turn away from the shopping center once it gets to the NE corner.<p>- There&#x27;s a bus that goes EW along the other side of the shopping center, but that&#x27;s not helpful.<p>-----<p>You&#x27;re forgetting about just how much convenience your car gives you _besides_ the ability to get to and from the store.<p>- You don&#x27;t have to wait for transfers or make what is effectively two trips to get somewhere.<p>- You don&#x27;t have to cross parking lots or go in and out of stores from the street (you can park up near the store, then drive to the other side of the shopping center).<p>- You can make a quick 5 minute stop on the way home without increasing your travel time by a full hour (because the bus only comes hourly).<p>- You don&#x27;t have to wait outside.<p>- You don&#x27;t have to hope that the bus was cancelled without notification (two weeks ago I was lucky to get a ride, as my once-an-hour bus was straight up cancelled without prior warning; if I didn&#x27;t use the former-official Transit app to check times, I wouldn&#x27;t have known, and would have been waiting at the stop for 80 minutes like one of my less fortunate coworkers did, or taking a different once-an-hour bus home with extra transfers and lots of waiting, to only get home ~10 minutes earlier)<p>- You don&#x27;t have to only buy as much as you can carry on a single trip (I work in a grocery store, people can and do fill _multiple_ shopping carts to avoid having to go shopping a second time in a week. People can and do purchase groceries for elderly relatives they don&#x27;t live with).<p>- if there&#x27;s a detour, it only costs you the time it takes to make said detour. If the bus has to make a detour and you have tight timing, you might miss your transfer, adding 10-60 minutes to your commute.<p>- You&#x27;re not dependent someone being willing to pick you up. When I was in college, a full bus would often just go right by without stopping, since there wasn&#x27;t enough room.<p>- You&#x27;re not dependent on your fellow passengers being rule-abiding or polite. Last year the bus driver stopped for an entire 50 minutes at a high school because the kids weren&#x27;t being safe or quiet. Not that they&#x27;re ever quiet, or that a full bus in general is quiet, but they were throwing condoms across an overcrowded bus and yelling, and the bus driver understandably didn&#x27;t want to deal with it when _he couldn&#x27;t close the door_, so he stopped and said those past the yellow line on the floor needed to get off and wait for the next bus. Instead, they made fun of him, continued talking loudly, and those near the door who shoved their way into a full bus refused to move.

For instance, our system is not an autocracy, yet we chose to move manufacturing to China. Not every system that makes decisions is autocratic. People could just as easily vote to do something democratically if they know it is in their own good.<p>But consider what is really happening in these places. They have an economic system which makes decisions about the allocation of resources. In response to the addition of new resources, these systems decided to decrease production of local resources below existing levels, and hence make people poorer as a result. The issue here is purely one of distribution and management. Suppose in the trivial case of food being dumped in Africa, said food was instead sold below market rates, and the income from this was used to subsidise farms to bring their outputs to the same price as the aid. Local manufacture remains worthwhile, prices decrease, and supply increases. Everyone benefits.<p>I don&#x27;t think it should be crazy to envision an economic system stable enough to allow people to benefit when you give them things for free. Especially since in the future, everything will be produced for free by machines. At that point, I should like everyone to live in luxury, rather than for everyone to be poor.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40061236" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40061236" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">int_19h</span><span>|</span><a href="#40056113">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40057330">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40057692">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40057404">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40061236">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40061236">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The economic system in China is capitalism.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40057404" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40057404" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">no-dr-onboard</span><span>|</span><a href="#40056113">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40056895">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40057330">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40056903">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40057404">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40057404">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; No one wants to work in these neighborhoods because they are invariably awful<p>Yeah, no kidding.

I certainly saw this happen to people I knew, one of them lived with us for awhile and my folks arranged for her to live with a relative, which allowed them to really make it in life instead of being stuck in the system. Weirdly, after some initial trouble that looked impossible to overcome, it was very simple to get them placed into our home, and, very simple to get them in with a relative. Most of that was the workings of the social worker assigned to them, who was hard to reach out to, and very clearly over worked.<p>Basically, there has to be a better intervention than just taking people&#x27;s children away, which certainly keys into your points.<p>I&#x27;d take it further to the point where, the poverty line is re-evaluated per locality, and inflation needs to be accurately reported, and with it the tax brackets as required by law. Then we need to dump the tax burden completely off the lowest earners, along with their requirement to file taxes at all. Then, we need to re-evaluate the bottom tiers to ramp in slowly to help eliminate welfare traps. It&#x27;d probably be a good idea, additionally, to no longer tax things like unemployment&#x2F;workmen&#x27;s comp&#x2F;disability&#x2F;social security&#x2F;etc, for similar reasons. Reporting taxes itself is a burden all its own, and it negatively affects people who already struggle with math.<p>Also, something that isn&#x27;t currently done, and certainly should be done, is to create interactions between the kids who have poor situations with the kids that have good situations. My elementary school had a &#x27;buddy&#x27; program, where the older kids would hang out in a structured way with the younger kids. I think it&#x27;d go a long way in terms of support to have a system where kids from the good side of town interact with kids from the bad side of town in that way, and to make it a K-12 program. You additionally get the side product of the kids who have better situations being able to socialize with, and therefore have empathy for, kids in bad situations, and real empathy at that, not &quot;spend some more tax money&quot; empathy, actual boots on the ground empathy, person to person.</div><br/><div id="40057010" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40057010" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">richardlblair</span><span>|</span><a href="#40056113">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40056903">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40058206">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40057010">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40057010">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had a lot of what you&#x27;re talking about in your last paragraph in our Air Cadet program.

In reality the most important indicator of &quot;at-risk&quot; is previous involvement with social services and mental health professionals. Usually because these experiences tend to be so bad that the kids involved start to hide problems, or even attack anyone involved with social services. And THEN they get into a negative spiral. It is not the first time they get into a negative spiral, except now their experiences with mental help are so incredibly negative they fight to remain in the negative spiral, sometimes to the point of physical violence.<p>Likewise, these professionals hide that almost all experiences kids have with social services are negative for the kids. Now I suppose you could say the above is an example of that, but really, it goes further. Kids seek help with homework, and only get berated by someone that couldn&#x27;t do the homework themselves ...<p>Studies keep pointing out that social services is exactly the wrong approach. What makes teachers, and social professionals good is excellent subject knowledge, combined with basic psychology. NOT the other way around. And in practice every mental help professional I&#x27;ve ever seen thinks they know what to do, and when pushed fail to produce even basic psychological facts, or outright deny them. I like to think you can explain this that when push comes to shove our minds are trying to solve problems in the real world.<p>The majority of mental problems are someone failing to solve real world problems, and repeatedly failing to influence the outcome.

That was nice.<p>I&#x27;m not super sure how I feel about the message though as it operates on a handful of really big presumptions. I&#x27;ll share my own bias to save everyone the tldr on where I&#x27;m coming from: I&#x27;m a parent advocate. I think the nuclear family is the backbone to society and that much, if not every, societal ill can be linked to the destruction of the nuclear family. Parents matter, and I agree with the general conclusion that we need to focus TREMENDOUS effort into raising children in a loving and safe way. If you are still reading, consider also that I&#x27;m a 3rd generation son of Mexican immigrants. I grew up in a lower economic class background in Los Angeles county during the 90s. I grew up shoulder to shoulder with many of the people included in this study.<p>The first is that it&#x27;s somehow a bad thing not to go to college. The trades by now are a known lucrative path with significant upward mobility, especially as we consider entrepreneurship. This is, in my experience, hand in hand with a lot of cultural practices that just doesn&#x27;t get captured in these types of sociological studies. I can personally attest to the increased risk tolerance that a lot of cultures have towards starting a business or joining a labor based trade. Food trucks, car washes, detailing services, maid services, laundromats, dry cleaning businesses, convenience market franchises. In the privacy of your own head, and without fear of judgement from your HN peers, I invite you to honestly consider the ethnicity of the people who own these businesses. See my point? The mobility is there. These aren&#x27;t &quot;bad&quot; lives. They&#x27;re different. These people also have different standards of living. Most people who are immigrants or 2nd to 3rd generation of those immigrants don&#x27;t want a multi-hundred thousand dollar life. Just speaking from personal experience here, most lower class migrants see the prospect of making that much money in America as foreign and unsafe. Maybe this furthers the point that not everyone should or can be a doctor&#x2F;lawyer&#x2F;FAANG-engineer.<p>The second presumption is that &quot;abuse&quot; or &quot;adverse experiences&quot; is able to be categorized by the researcher&#x27;s definition. Again, we&#x27;re dealing with people of different cultures who have different standards for living. We&#x27;re overlaying our own &quot;refined&quot; terminology of what constitutes &quot;abuse&quot; or &quot;danger&quot; to them and drawing conclusions. Worse yet, we&#x27;re saying that those same conclusions are correlated to the conditions that they experienced, regardless of how they themselves would classify it.<p>&quot;High risk&quot; is a highly contestable term, especially as the diversity of subjects increases. Maybe it&#x27;s a good thing that mom divorced the man who was never around. Maybe mom was sleeping around and dad found out? Maybe mom remarried because dad died. Either way, non-intact households are being labelled &quot;high risk&quot; in a general sense.<p>&quot;Being held back&quot; as a bad thing is contestable. Some kids fall in that weird Nov-December enrollment period and make it through by being the oldest kid in their class. This isn&#x27;t typically a good thing. The threat of being held back a grade is also encouraging for those who take their schooling seriously. Should it ever happen, its a serious kick in the pants for kids to wake up and take this seriously.<p>&quot;Suspension&quot;, again any type of school based discipline, is seen as a adverse event. Suspension protects the children of the school, it notifies the parents of the suspended that there is a __real__ problem with your child, and provides a significant deterrent from bad behavior. It&#x27;s wild to me that anyone would think of suspension as a noteworthy heuristic for adverse experiences.<p>Thanks to anyone who made it this far, even those that will disagree.</div><br/><div id="40057020" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40057020" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fragmede</span><span>|</span><a href="#40054325">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40055405">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40056208">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40057020">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40057020">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Question one of the ACE test is<p>&gt; Did a parent or other adult in the household often or very often… Swear at you, insult you, put you down, or humiliate you? or Act in a way that made you afraid that you might be physically hurt?<p>seems pretty clear to me, regardless of if something is considered okay in one culture but not in another, the question is was the experience humiliating, not did X happen, where X could be considered not humiliating in one culture and not in another.</div><br/><div id="40057311" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40057311" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">no-dr-onboard</span><span>|</span><a href="#40054325">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40057020">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40056208">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40057311">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40057311">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s an excellent observation.

We were all immigrants, and still learning the ropes in this wonderful country.  I did not graduate college, but instead went the part-time&#x2F;apprenticeship&#x2F;gain-experience route, while going through many roles.  My baseline was to be a good citizen.  A good son, a good partner, good friend, good husband and a good dad (4 wonderful kids).  There were many good times, but also sad times, including when we lost our house and cars (2008), and that month when we literally didn&#x27;t have money for food... but this country gives you many opportunities.

I went to a very well ranked engineering school that was created in the 60s with the goal of giving access to higher education to everyone. When they opened, 30% of students had parents who were farmer or factory workers (65% of the population had those type of jobs back then). By 2005, 7% of students had those kind of background (compared 39% of the population did those kind of jobs). I was in the school administration concil back then and this was already seen as a big problem.  I know for a fact that the students coming from less advantageous background has been further reduced.<p>It&#x27;s a generalized trend, increasingly all the best schools mostly admit from a small selection of students that come from a select number of good schools.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of factors that changed and, surprisingly, evolution of upward mobility is poorly studied. My mother always thought that she succeeded because she went to boarding school in middle school and high school. Back then it was normal for people living far in the countryside like her. She thinks that boarding school allowed her to get a rest from her stressful and toxic home environment. Thanks to it she was able to read, study in peace and able to succeed. She later became a teacher and she was saddened by some of the kids she saw that grew up in an adverse environment with no real way out.<p>&gt; The psychological burden of a hopeless situation is enormous.<p>Fully agreed on the psychological burden of a hopeless situation.

Often the reason debates arise is that you double down on your view after learning that opposing views exist.<p>&gt; Here’s another.<p>&gt; Former New York Times columnist David Pogue once did a story about harsh working conditions at Foxconn tech assembly factories in China. A reader sent him a response:<p>&gt;&gt;    My aunt worked several years in what Americans call “sweat shops.” It was hard work. Long hours, “small” wage, “poor” working conditions. Do you know what my aunt did before she worked in one of these factories? She was a prostitute.<p>&gt;&gt;    Circumstances of birth are unfortunately random, and she was born in a very rural region. Most jobs were agricultural and family owned, and most of the jobs were held by men. Women and young girls, because of lack of educational and economic opportunities, had to find other “employment.”<p>&gt;&gt;    The idea of working in a “sweat shop” compared to that old lifestyle is an improvement, in my opinion. I know that my aunt would rather be “exploited” by an evil capitalist boss for a couple of dollars than have her body be exploited by several men for pennies.<p>&gt;&gt;    That is why I am upset by many Americans’ thinking. We do not have the same opportunities as the West. Our governmental infrastructure is different. The country is different.<p>&gt;&gt;    Yes, factory is hard labor. Could it be better? Yes, but only when you compare such to American jobs.<p>&gt;&gt;    If Americans truly care about Asian welfare, they would know that shutting down “sweat shops” would force many of us to return to rural regions and return to truly despicable “jobs.” And I fear that forcing factories to pay higher wages would mean they hire FEWER workers, not more.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40059504" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40059504" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Generous8030</span><span>|</span><a href="#40059265">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40059831">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40060435">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40059504">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40059504">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is an interesting perspective that I very much agree with (also being an immigrant), I feel there is this constant bashing on the country, and for what I can tell (at least in my circle), is citizens most of the time.

When you&#x27;re young and particularly a teenager, you want to do as much cool things as possible (not just fun, but also things like profiling yourself to end up in a good career, make money, etc), plenty of times this does not happen if you&#x27;re not privileged enough, and then most of the time people blame this on themselves, maybe I wasn&#x27;t that smart, maybe I wasn&#x27;t that disciplined, blah blah.<p>Sometimes <i>&quot;you just didn&#x27;t have enough money&quot;</i> is an acceptable answer, it takes the blame out of yourself and it gives you an objective to pursue. Note: this last phrase could definitely be misinterpreted and strawman-ed to death, so I&#x27;ll clarify on both points:<p>* It takes the blame out of yourself ... <i>in a healthy way</i>; most likely you are just good enough or are as good as all the other people that are already doing what you want to do. Money could well be the only limiting factor and, if this happens to be the case, you&#x27;re actually lucky in the sense that is much easier to &quot;just get some money&quot; than to actually nurture and develop an ability that you don&#x27;t have.<p>* It gives you a (clear and focused) objective to pursue. Money is not everything but once you identify this as the limiting factor in your life, you can become laser-focused on acquiring said wealth and things just get easier down the road. Anecdote from me: I was once a plane trip short (out of money) from enrolling on a nice PhD in a different country than mine; that, of course, got me very frustrated and sad, but after that my only purpose for a short while was to make money, I went on to work and live frugally (by choice!) and after a year I had saved up a significant wad of cash, this put me in a position where I could not only afford the plane ticket towards any PhD program I wanted, but also afford at least 6-8 months of life anywhere I wanted in the world, so I could just go to places and explore and make a decision about that when I was comfortable about it. Also that small cycle of &quot;set up goal&quot;, &quot;work towards it&quot;, &quot;execute&quot;, gave a lot of meaning to my life at the time and it&#x27;s a framework that is <i>very</i> useful to master going forward in life.</div><br/><div id="40056979" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40056979" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">swatcoder</span><span>|</span><a href="#40054501">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40056642">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40054995">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40056979">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40056979">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I appreciate your perspective!

So any time you&#x27;re looking at this sort of thing especially when they&#x27;re making broad over-arching generalizations (more &quot;trauma&quot; as a child makes life harder) it&#x27;s important to read critically, interrogate the validity and bias of sources, and try to see if and where they may be skewing things with visualizations, omitting or lessening the perceived impact of damning data that disagrees with them, and&#x2F;or making things that agree with their point more prominent than they probably should be. I usually don&#x27;t even try to figure out what their &quot;pet cause&quot; may be before doing any of that because I don&#x27;t want my own implicit biases to influence me more than they already do.<p>It&#x27;s hard to be sure but I also think several of the folks earning the <i>most</i> as adults came from the &quot;bottom&quot; tier with the most adverse childhood experiences.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40054561" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40054561" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">philsnow</span><span>|</span><a href="#40054242">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40055489">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40054322">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40054561">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40054561">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; If this is the grand reveal -- showing that childhood heavily influences future financial mobility -- it&#x27;s not super obvious. I mean, yes, there seem to be a bit of a skew towards low earners in the bottom tranche -- but really it looks like the group that has had some astounding headwinds is kinda sorta doing about the same as the &#x27;no adverse experiences&#x27; group?<p>This was my takeaway as well.  My expectation was that the longitudinal study would show that bad experiences compound much more dramatically over time than the video appears to suggest.<p>Another issue I have with the presentation is that I had to keep pausing and carefully considering what each slide was saying, because the first several slides start by<p><pre><code>  - categorizing people according to whether they had bad experiences or not,
  - arranging them spatially in one big group on the &quot;bad experiences&quot; axis,
  - and coloring them according to the severity &#x2F; occurrence.
</code></pre>
So now my brain thinks &quot;okay, warmer colors mean more&#x2F;worse childhood experiences. got it.&quot;, but then all the following slides<p><pre><code>  - categorize people on lots of different dimensions (income, health, etc)
    - but always grouped spatially by no&#x2F;some&#x2F;many bad experiences
  - color them according to the dimension being measured
    - some of them are arranged spatially in reverse order compared to the
      legend, see 4:50 in the linked video &#x2F; the slide on &quot;general health&quot;
</code></pre>
So the entire time, I&#x27;m fighting my brain which is telling me &quot;warmer colors -&gt; bad experiences&quot;.<p>I wonder if it would be clearer if the measurement slides were instead grouped &#x2F; arranged spatially by outcomes and colored according to the childhood experiences.<p><i>edit: it&#x27;s ugly as heck but this is kind of what I mean:<p>their slide: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snap.philsnow.io&#x2F;2024-04-16T10-16-25.uifh7bss3d5f66b1ukqd.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snap.philsnow.io&#x2F;2024-04-16T10-16-25.uifh7bss3d5f66b...</a><p>proposed rearrangement + recoloring: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snap.philsnow.io&#x2F;2024-04-16T10-45-19.n7ft281jipgv3txk8w56.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snap.philsnow.io&#x2F;2024-04-16T10-45-19.n7ft281jipgv3tx...</a><p>Like I said, it&#x27;s ugly, I obviously just copy&#x2F;pasted regions around, but it should get across the idea that this would make it easier to see the proportions of each measurement class (income bucket, health bucket, etc) according to childhood experiences.</i></div><br/></div></div><div id="40054322" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40054322" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">unyttigfjelltol</span><span>|</span><a href="#40054242">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40054561">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40054432">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40054322">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40054322">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The visualizations suggested the differences were very marginal.

I was in care. I was passed around middle and high schools like a hot potato, nobody wanted me, simply because I was in care. The folks in care told me I was going to do exceptionally well in life, as my IQ tests were incredible - they were the only really structured approach to testing at the time. I ran the computer labs at all the schools I was at (C64 FTW!), because I was known as a “whizz kid” and could be trusted with that, but before ever setting foot in any of those schools I was already “branded” because I was in care. The teachers, all of them bar one, literally didn’t give a fuck. The one that cared, cared deeply. He was the music teacher, steadfastly wore punk t-shirts to class, and taught me drums and percussion. I still think of him often, but music lessons are not enough.<p>As for the rest of the bastards, my questions and educational needs were ignored, I was told to “just don’t bother” by many. I was great in the computer lab of course, English, and history. I struggled with many other subjects, but was deeply motivated to do well in school - I saw all the _other_ kids in care around me and was absolutely positive that I did not want to end up like that, but as I said I simply was ignored. Not only can I not do math until today, the “European schools (Netherlands, to be precise) experience” traumatised me to an extent where any kind of formal learning causes some kind of brain freeze and I simply cannot. I was relentlessly bullied at and outside of school, until I learned to stand up for myself, at which point it went in a kind of binary fashion directly to outlandish punishments for standing up for myself. Punching back in self defence can, in fact, land you in a straitjacket and in isolation for a week, who knew?! That was also where my deep distrust and rejection of any kind of authority figure or structure comes from.<p>I never finished school, I emancipated myself from care and dropped out when I was 17, and got the fuck out of the Netherlands. I am, until this day (54 years old now), unable to get a degree as I dropped out and as I am unable to study in a traditional sense. I was homeless and living rough a few months later, and it took me years to fight my way out of that shit. By good fortune and stubbornness I was able to learn and work in stage lighting, and did that for many years. I designed shows, clubs, bars, and ran the lights at too many events to count. I was at the forefront of the (then new up and coming) move away from pure analog lighting and into digital control and moving lights.<p>I eventually pivoted into IT professionally, again at a time when this was all new for everyone, and managed to build a career. I did well for a very long time and love the work. As a certified Old, I now struggle to get the contracts I need to keep going, companies want young blood and believe that deep skill and experience is overrated, so we will see what the next stage of life will bring.<p>Nothing special about European schools.

Speaking as a member of the highschool graduating class of 2015, the pressure on every single child to go directly into college was insane. Even the mere act of telling an adult that you weren&#x27;t interested in college could get you referred to a school counselor or called into an impromptu parent-teacher meeting. During my senior year, I was personally pulled out of class to discuss this topic on <i>five separate occasions</i>. I happened to be an unusually stubborn kid, but even I eventually caved and pre-enrolled at a local college.<p>Naturally, I almost immediately flunked out of the program. Who wouldn&#x27;t quit something making them miserable when they didn&#x27;t even want to do it in the first place? I was one of the lucky ones, actually... Many like-minded cohorts in my graduating class wasted years of time and money with nothing to show for it.

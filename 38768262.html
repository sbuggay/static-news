Of course it is hard to say how deep those go, or how refined they are and whether they are comparable to human feelings, but there are clear similarities: cows get afraid in bad weather or when they see something they don&#x27;t know, a mother cow will be proud and protective over their calf, some will be mischiefous and ashamed once you catch them doing something they shouldn&#x27;t do. That is not nothing. Sure inside that cow could be a complex Rube Goldberg machine that makes it look like fear, pride or shame to us silly humans, but given that we are both mammals evolutionary more likely is that these emotions are at least somewhat similar because they served similar purposes.

Me, a foreigner to the water, a tourist, and the fish, a local, wondering about this one biped that looks kinda funny.<p>After a few minutes I guess it decided that the &quot;conversation&quot; had come to a natural ending and swam away.  Out of the many fish that were near me that day, that was the one to stop and say hi.<p>There are many tourists in this world.  I have gone abroad and witnessed the tourists expecting something from the locals.  I also see a lot of tourist and noticed they look at me, a local, like I&#x27;m a (non-human) animal.  Over the years I like to think back to that specific individual fish, and realize that our differences aren&#x27;t so great, and humans are the tourists that expect something from them, entire industries that capture a number of them every year that&#x27;s so large many of us can&#x27;t even comprehend.<p>I have a few stories similar to this fish with other animals, and because of that the above quote resonates with me.  I hope more articles come out which are not about just &quot;sciency things&quot; void of the humans and non-human condition, but the self actualization and realization of the individual that we&#x27;re not alone.</div><br/><div id="38768962" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38768962" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BelleOfTheBall</span><span>|</span><a href="#38768930">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38769455">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38768962">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38768962">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  I also see a lot of tourist and noticed they look at me, a local, like I&#x27;m a (non-human) animal.<p>How exactly is that expressed?

As Kissane notes, Myanmar came online very quickly after the reforms, and -- unlike many countries in the Middle East or even China, because the story there was not one of authoritarian oppression, but a &#x2F;release&#x2F; from authoritarian pressure, it did not fit easily into the template that tech companies were slowly learning to respond to. A few years before this, Facebook and Twitter had been shaken into some kind of recognition of their responsibilities in the Arab Spring and Iranian protests, but the result of that had been a very, shall we say, US-centric view of how repression plays out globally. Bluntly, the violent genocide of muslims by buddhists, in a country led by Nobel Peace Prize winner and defender of democracy Aung Sang Suu Shi, was a story that had to cut across many political and cultural presumptions of the US and Europe before it would be listened to.<p>I guess that brings me to your comment about &quot;free speech&quot;.

Many of us, both in &quot;free speech&quot; organizations and on-the-ground humanitarian groups, argued that this was a role that Facebook was not, and could not play: and the more it claimed it could take on this responsibility, the more terrible the consequences would be.</div><br/><div id="37712706" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37712706" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zebomon</span><span>|</span><a href="#37711995">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37712431">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37712567">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37712706">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37712706">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you very much for your thoughtful reply.

Civil society organizations struggled at the time to match and warn Facebook, but I don&#x27;t think they can scale up either. I was at a human rights-related event the other day and somebody talked about leaving behind the &quot;trashfire&quot; of the Facebook Oversight Board. I can believe it -- it&#x27;s the sort of solution that you end up having to knit together at those scales. If we seriously believe we can create some sort of global speech government, why haven&#x27;t we?<p>Conversations are intimate, contextual, and should be far more directly under the local control of the speakers. This feels counter-intuitive to many when we see modern genocides like Myanmar and Facebook (and before it, Rwanda and short-wave radio) where mass media played its part in fanning the flames. But censorship and control are temporary fixes to those deeper problems -- and it&#x27;s a solution that feels more comfortable the further you get from the details of each disaster, or the closer and more familiar you are with those with the power to censor.<p>My instincts (and my work) assumes a lot of the problems come, as you say, from the centralization of these large tech organizations, but of course there are also plenty of challenges at the more human level. It&#x27;s significant for me that Western traditions of free speech emerged from decades of vicious religious wars, and appear to be more stable than the cycles of repression and counter-repression that proceeded them.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37712567" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37712567" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">0xDEAFBEAD</span><span>|</span><a href="#37711995">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37712431">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37712706">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37712536">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37712567">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37712567">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;I guess that brings me to your comment about &quot;free speech&quot;.

Nowadays it is a right-wing talking point, at a time when the left has more cultural power.<p>We generally can&#x27;t expect censorship mechanisms to be used in a principled way.

Take this paragraph, for example:<p>&gt; By that point in 2018, Myanmar’s military had murdered thousands of Rohingya people, including babies and children, and beaten, raped, tortured, starved, and imprisoned thousands more. About three-quarters of a million Rohingya had fled Myanmar to live in huge, disease-infested refugee camps in Bangladesh.<p>That is the situation on the ground. The country is a powder keg, and there is evil afoot. Maybe there is more context here to come in part II, but it seems unreasonable to lay this at Facebook&#x27;s feet from an external perspective. Facebook does not call for beatings, rape or killings.<p>I can certainly see Facebook&#x27;s leadership caring about the PR and doing something. But that raises alternative problems - what exactly is the standard Facebook is meant to enforce? Should it ban everyone who is responsible for pointless killing? That includes the US leadership apparatus - should it ban everyone who voted Aye for the Iraq war? Afghanistan? Wars like Vietnam? (yes, the people who voted for it knew better). They won&#x27;t do that. We&#x27;ll have a large, powerful company applying uneven and subjective standards.<p>There is an issue there, but I think the specifics of why she is calling out Facebook are actually dangerously missing the point. The problem is the same no matter what influence Facebook tries to have - the problem is that the will of the people and the will of Facebook&#x27;s leadership are radically different. In this case, the will of the people is unusually evil - but the problem is the clash and Facebook&#x27;s position of influence, not which side is wrong on any particular day.

Sure it increased Racism by a lot but also it leads to find out about truth fast.The actual genocide ware done by the Junta military and Junta assigned thugs who are infused within riots are by a group known as Ma Ba Tha , which was known before as Swan Arr Shin ( Meaning Super Heros) - which ironically used to kill peacefully protesting monks back in 2007 (Saffron Revolution), Now they are known as Pyu Saw Htee who are killing innocent people now regardless of Race or Ethnicity in suspicion of supporting Spring Revolution.<p>They are Ex Junta , Prisoners , low ranking members from the Rival Hardline Military Party lead by extremist nationalists . They are the one who raze and displaced millions of Rohingyas.<p>The start of Rohingya crisis :<p>- At first when the news breakout that innocent girl was raped and killed , the uncensored mutilated body of the underage girl along with caught preps had been posted online who are identified as rohingyas, that is the first time many people had seen violence on the Facebook and it was spread like wild fire , and there was a lot of hate online.<p>- And then. The MaBaTha movement started ( the group i mentioned above) , goes on ground , spreading the image of the post , they organize and formed other nationalists , and then they started using monks , most of them are military spies robed and planted into there since after Saffron Revolution - as a tool for political play.<p>- Soon after they started using monks many real Buddhist are shunning away and stop following as soon as they started using Buddhism as a tool for violence which is totally against buddha&#x27;s ways and it become appearant that is a political play.
- But the riots were organized by military , in Meikhtila case , polices guards the people who burned the whole town to ashes - who are Later Identified as MaBaTha .<p>So here is take away<p>- The crisis is totally fuled by junta nad organized by Junta Swann Arr Shin group ( MaBaTha , and now Pyu Saw Htee)  (The organized criminal group , members existed since 1988, used again and again in 1988 , De Pe Yin massacre , Saffron Revolution) .<p>- If there were no Facebook , the Junta would use state owned media and journal outlets and would have the same effect but  because of Facebook we have a chance to speak-out , we have a chance to find out truth, report massacres .<p>- Free Speech is very important for us , for a country who had lost freedom for 70+ Years<p>- Free Speech and Facebook has to do very little on Rohingya crisis since it is mostly done by the on-ground , organized criminal .<p>- Facebook Algorithms boost controversial topics that is undeniable<p>- Rohingya genocide was a military sponsored terrorism it was fueled by Military Junta and hard liners and organized criminal group founded by junta.<p>- When the crisis had been controlled by Democratic government , the military start to lose power so they stage a coup in 2021<p>Now situation is a lot worse<p>The Junta who organized the Rohingya crisis , stage a coup and killed over 5000 innocent civilians of all races and genders , and that had lead to people arming up and fighting against Junta .

If your audience is a vampire and you want to get engagement you show a lot of bulging veins. I don’t mean to suggest that the broader Buddhist population (ie most of Myanmar) is bloodthirsty, but if a tiny (tiny!) slice of it had hate on the mind it’s not hard to understand the argument that FB amplified the bloodlust (wow, look at the spike in engagement on the internal dashboard!).

The key idea here is that freedom of speech is not the same as freedom of reach: Facebook might give everyone the same text box to write posts or upload content, but they need to answer for HOW and WHY they recommend certain content over other types of content.<p>The comparison pencils or air isn&#x27;t fair because they aren&#x27;t being boosted by a  recommender system, powering the application layer of the content delivery platform for 90% of a country&#x27;s people. If I write a message on paper containing a call to action which incites violence (e.g. &quot;We should round up all people with six toes on each foot and shoot them&quot;) and hand it to one person, the message has reached one person. I would say, the digital equivalent to &quot;pencil and paper&quot; or &quot;talking in a public square&quot; more like &quot;Writing a message in an HTML file and putting that HTML on a web server you own.&quot; I think it would be much more difficult for your average user in Myanmar to reach millions, even if they were given a web server and the means to write HTML.<p>Comparing it to &quot;getting mad at air because it allows people to transmit their thoughts&quot; equates Facebook the Internet, when one is an organization of people who provide technology and the other is technology. There are data scientists and engineers who created the models which learned how to optimize for engagement, and there are product managers who help set the KPIs for those engineers (i.e. encouraged them to solve for engagement) and there are execs who benefit from all of the above. While no single person is solely to blame for what happened in Myanmar, it&#x27;s wrong to claim that we can&#x27;t at least reason and discuss the products still created, maintained and own by company (made of people).<p>My opinion on this is heavily formed by the training I received when I wanted to DJ for my university&#x27;s radio station. Even in the US, where freedom of speech is protected in the Amendments to the Consitution, there were very specific things you could and could not say on the air (while being classified as a non-profit radio station). You could receive massive fines for profanity, obscenity, inciting violence, hate speech, with a large general emphasis on calls to action. Generally, I think this training was good and it encouraged everyone who learned to DJ to be more intentional with their language.<p>I really think that if Facebook is gonna enable users to reach millions, there absolutely should be some caveats to that. People should be able to say whatever they want if they are capable of providing the means by which their own speech is amplified--and even then there are clear cases where the megaphone needs to be taken away.<p>Facebook is giving megaphones to people and some people use it to dispense hate speech. While I might&#x27;ve been willing to give Facebook a pass in their early years, it is clear that between Cambridge Analytica and this that governments around the world need to do better when it comes to working with Facebook to better identify content on their platform which incites violence or calls to action which present a clear and present danger to other people if acted upon. Facebook isn&#x27;t some amorphous inanimate entity that we can&#x27;t negotiate&#x2F;regulate&#x2F;punish. If someone uploads a hateful message which has a 0.00001% of encouraging a hate crime in Burma, Burma can expect around 5 hate crimes as a result of this message.

An artifact of that is the freeways were, mostly, essentially laid on top of all the existing transportation and transit infrastructure.<p>So much of the original roads, and the communities served by them, still exist. Most of what we’re considered highways in the past are now major boulevards with stop lights at every intersection, while the nearby freeway is laid on top of the original traffic grid and neighborhoods.<p>This is part of LAs notoriety for its “shortcuts”. As folks jump off the congestion of the freeways onto the local streets. An ability now obsoleted by modern navigation apps.<p>Lived here most of my life. LA is not kind to its past. We tear down the old to make way for the new all the time. But they can’t flatten all of it, several active history and preservation societies doing their work. Some wins, some losses.<p>But a lot of TV show’s were filmed here, and act as an ad hoc window to the past. I like watching shows like Colombo, and looking up the locations they used. (Colombo’s suspects lived in some VERY expensive homes.)<p>Similarly, in my neighborhood are brand new homes behind a 40 year old church that sold their backlot to a developer. But the church is across the street from a 100 year old farmhouse. Barn and all. And there’s a mix of others nearby.<p>Outside of the Master Planned communities of Southern OC, there’s still a lot of this interface of old and new all around SoCal.</div><br/><div id="38080696" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38080696" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aloha</span><span>|</span><a href="#38080512">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38080823">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38080696">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38080696">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The freeways just helped cement the well established development pattern established by the pacific electric.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38080823" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38080823" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jayd16</span><span>|</span><a href="#38080512">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38080696">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38080813">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38080823">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38080823">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Perry Mason had some good traffic tips too.<p>I think the SNL skit, The Californians, is supposed to be derogatory to Los Angelenos but we love it because we love checking the traffic math in shows.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38080813" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38080813" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">larusso</span><span>|</span><a href="#38080512">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38080353">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38080813">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38080813">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">During summer I took a longer roadtrip through Southern California and into Nevada&#x2F;Arizona. I tried to stay of major freeways as much as possible mainly because I think their boring and make me really tired (a thing that I also happens from time to time when driving my usual German autobahn but usually not during mid day!).<p>So my trip lead me to stay a night in Palm Springs. From there I headed out to Las Vegas. I wanted a stopp near Barstow to visit Peggy Sue’s Dinner one more time with my family. My Navigation wanted me to take the route via San Bernardino but I saw an alternative route on the map via Yucca Valley. Man that was such a good decision. The Highway 247 makes a beautiful turn through the Johnson Valley. I made a point to use shorter D Tours on the whole trip like using state Route 66 in Arizona instead of the shorter 40 to Flagstaff and back to Vegas.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38080353" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38080353" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aloha</span><span>|</span><a href="#38080813">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38080466">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38080353">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38080353">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Subtitle &quot;There’s history around every curve on the back roads between Los Angeles and Los Olivos, a 100-mile route that meanders through mountains, canyons and star-studded enclaves.&quot; bothers me.<p>First thing the author started in <i>Calabasas</i>, which is on the edge of Los Angeles <i>County</i> and a significant distance from the <i>City</i> of Los Angeles.<p>Second, this region in particular - between say, Malibu and San Luis Obispo is notable for its general <i>lack</i> of freeways.

Most places there, too, are built at automobile scale, and lack sufficient sense of placehood or definition to qualify as anything like a hamlet in the European sense. It&#x27;s just a ZIP code with a Circle K, a church, and a some houses scattered over an obscenely large area that can only be traversed by car. Sometimes, boarded up historical relics are included, although you may have to drive quite a bit from the civic centre (the Circle K) to find them.<p>Food deserts, in which the Circle K feeds a massive radius (along with perhaps a Dollar General), are the norm. Getting from the Circle K to the Dollar General requires a car. In between, there&#x27;s not much.<p>There are some delightful exceptions, and I love to visit and capture their splendid sights and sounds. They are few and far, and I find the parent&#x27;s generalisation highly valid, at least as the Sourheast goes. I grew up in the Midwest and had a similar sense there.

I might argue the real lesson learned is &quot;Lines of Code are Not a Measure of Productivity in an Isolated, Toy Example&quot;.<p>I suspect this sort of thing gets promulgated because it kind of massages our ego, like yes, they can measure <i>other</i> sorts of productivity, but not <i>ours</i>, oh no, we&#x27;re too complex and intelligent, there&#x27;s no way to measure the deep sorts of work that we do!

But this does not account for tricky cases or ambiguous cases, which might have taken 2x time to sort out but on rote numbers it looks they were less productive.<p>For us, there are no specific goals(except arbitrary imaginary deadlines by clueless management and sprint points) to correctly measure productivity. A junior engineer may spend 4h each day blasting out many lines of codes, a mid&#x2F;senior may spend more hours in reviews or meetings. A 5 line PR with test coverage is faster to review than a 800+ LOC PR with additional tests and have significant risk of breaking something, so review number is also not a good indicator. I need to coordinate with min. 12 people to get any new credentials or access to specific env owned by another team, which is not countable as productive but unavoidable. How about that garbage meeting where I was just spending time yawning because some new tech lead who believes that a modular monolith system is better if it was rewritten as event based. Productivity measurement is hard.<p>To take your envy(I sense it on the quoted remark) to another place, think about how you go about measuring productivity of a CEO, PO, PM, Scrum Master, Agilist&#x2F;Agile-Specialist etc?</div><br/><div id="42458398" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42458398" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">theamk</span><span>|</span><a href="#42457752">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42457974">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42458051">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42458398">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42458398">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sure, productivity it&#x27;s not cut-n-dry stat, but it&#x27;s not completely impossible to measure either. For a team, there are very clear goals: to make product that customers like, and to keep improving it for a long time. The last part is especially hard to measure, so people do all sorts of approximations, some very bad.<p>For individual, productivity is measured on multiple axis - new long-term features, throw-away and prototypes, code maintenance, fire-fighting, code reviews, high-level design, outside-of-team communications, intra-team communications (for example helping teammates), archeology, specific parts of your project, probably others. In ideal team, everyone is strong on at least one or two axes, so no person is worse than others. In real teams, I&#x27;ve seen people who were weak on every single axis and did not seem to improve with time. I&#x27;ve also seen people who are great at everything, and it&#x27;s extremely nice when such people exist - but they are very rare.<p>(Btw, re your specific example: if you weren&#x27;t productive because you were waiting for others to approve your access then you were not productive.

But John is usually finishing his migrations with no problems, while James often caused outages or missing data. A few times James took over two months to migrate, so the task was taken from him and given to John. John had to discard everything James did and migrate everything from scratch.

LOC can be fine as a measurement for speed, you just donât want to look at it in isolation.  You would want to also measure, for example, escape rate and usage for the features the developer worked on, and be willing to change or refine these if circumstances require it.<p>You also need to look for different profiles based on the developerâs level of seniority.  A senior dev probably shouldnât be writing as much code as a contributor, but their user impact should be high, and escape rate low.  Analyzing differences between teams is important, as well.  A team that has a lot of escapes or little user impact probably has issues that need management attention, and may not have anything at all to do with individual developer productivity or ability.<p>In brief, the numbers are there to help you make better management decisions, not to relieve you of having to make them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42458303" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42458303" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nradov</span><span>|</span><a href="#42457752">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42458202">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42458575">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42458303">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42458303">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Function point analysis works well enough for measuring software productivity in most domains, provided that quality is held constant.

SWEs are not factory workers. They don&#x27;t punch in at 6am, put on their uniforms, make sure they meet their daily &quot;lines of code&quot; quota before clocking out at 10pm. We should not measure software productivity the same way we measure ball bearings production.<p>Using lines of code to track productivity is absurd (do people really believe it or is it just a strawman at this point?). I&#x27;m reminded of that midwit meme where a junior has very few lines of code written because they don&#x27;t know the code base well enough, the midwit writes up an whole framework, and the senior engineer has a net negative lines of code contribution.<p>Theres also a fundamental difference between creating and maintaining code. Something like 10 guys wrote visicalc. Does that mean they were contributing millions of dollars in profit per hours? What about the maintainance to keep it going? Bug fixes? Patches? On call infra guys? What about opportunity cost of putting engineers on deadend projects?<p>My point is tracking productivity in software dev - maybe all knowledge work for that matter - is complicated. Maybe that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s so much &quot;busywork&quot;  (emails, slack, tickets, meetings, etc).

  &quot;How much did we create today?&quot; is not a relevant question to ask. Even if it
  could be measured, productivity in software does not approximate business value
  in any meaningful way. This is because software development is not an activity
  that necessarily produces anything.
</code></pre>
This is ridiculous, irrelevant, and wrong. Of course software development produces things. It produces software.<p><pre><code>  Which of these two developers was more &quot;productive&quot; today? The answer is: It doesn&#x27;t
  matter. What matters the that Peter solved the problem, while simultaneously reducing
  long term maintenance costs for the team. Frank also solved the problem, but he
  increased maintenance costs by producing code, and so (all other things being equal)
  his solution is inferior. To call Peter more &quot;productive&quot; is to torture the metaphor
  beyond any possible point of utility.
</code></pre>
Ohhhhhhhhh. I get it. The author doesn&#x27;t know what the word productivity means.<p>Productivity does not mean &quot;increases business value while decreasing maintenance costs [and having no net negative impact in any way]&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t even mean &quot;solving a problem&quot;.<p>Productivity just means &quot;to make something&quot;, or more specifically the <i>rate</i> at which something is made. That&#x27;s all. You can make 10x more of something, and it can be garbage quality, but you did make it, and you did make more of it, so your productivity increased.<p>If you produce 10x more grain than you did yesterday, you are more productive. The grain might now be full of heavy metals, pesticides and toxins. But you did in fact produce more grain. If you were trying to measure <i>productivity of usable, healthy, high-quality grain</i>, that is a different measurement than just <i>productivity of grain</i>. You may assume everybody knows what you mean when you say &quot;productive&quot;, but you&#x27;d be wrong.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42458047" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42458047" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">revskill</span><span>|</span><a href="#42458458">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42458047">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42458047">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Productivity to me is about choosing the best tradeoff while minimizing the costs of going ahead.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

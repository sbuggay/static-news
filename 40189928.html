If one has not the capacity to see through anger when making a decision - a lack of mindfulness perhaps, then that decision even when made in anger is the best they could do at that point. If one practices mindfulness and can often deal with anger but fails this time, that is still the best that person could do given who they are when a decision is being made.

But there is never a wrong choice as you say, only non-optimal. Only that which was made due to you having not been some particular other potential version of you.<p>Learning makes change possible. Not all learning is good for you. You never know you&#x27;re learning as you&#x27;re doing it - for if you&#x27;re self aware you aren&#x27;t paying attention as so can&#x27;t learn, but if you are paying attention you&#x27;re not aware about &quot;learning&quot;.

It&#x27;s very retrospective, and gives very little time to forethought. Yet the author establishes that they see peers step into life decisions with relatable distress, or indoctrinated softness, people facing the future, but doesn&#x27;t explore much beyond that. See, to me, this is grasping for an answer, where next step is &quot;and how many of those people who took the step casually or overtly seriously had that have an equivalent impact on their life?&quot;<p>And I would even take it as a mistake being done here to claim a stake. Being that, they can only ever source the answer from the same place Senator Armstrong does everything in his life. How CAN you solve the problem of finding your best life, how CAN you say you were more mindful and therefore, got rewarded? How CAN anyone say be more like this?<p>You can&#x27;t poll for it, people are very often bad a either introspection or at retrospectives, and more than anything - they don&#x27;t actually know. They will biasedly speak positively of bad experiences and rash decisions that benefited them and vice-versa. Few will have the maturity to turn and say they were glad to have met toxic person or workplace or that it helped them overall despite taking away 30 years of their life. And that&#x27;s still their prerogative opinion. Opinions are nice and all, but not the answer we seek. We seek the actual, real impact, that mindfulness has on life paths. The state of mind in the moment. It is unknowable. And often, whoever discredits the notion, is suspiciously also handing out brochures.<p>I don&#x27;t see eye to eye with the article.

Our company was also drifting heavily into silos during that time, some people were frontend-only, some backend-only, where I like the whole stack and didn&#x27;t want to limit myself.<p>So after all that I did something that surprised and confused my manager:  Asked to get moved to the maintenance team instead of new development.  They were intrigued because apparently that team is where new hires often ended up, and they almost never had someone experienced on it - which surprised me because I figured that job would be harder than new development.  So far I&#x27;ve been on this team longer than any others and have yet to get tired of it.  I know some of it is how good a manager we have, but the work is also very directly about fixing things.  It&#x27;s much more self-directed, no product owner initiated rewrites on a whim, large projects still happen when something is really bad, but because it&#x27;s considered legacy there&#x27;s no treadmill-chasing.  And the random fixes can end up anywhere in the stack, so I get to keep using everything I&#x27;d learned from linux through the database and server to frontend, instead of sticking to a silo.<p>So even &quot;5) Just live with it.&quot; does have sub-options.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40194970" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40194970" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lnsru</span><span>|</span><a href="#40191093">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40191215">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40194150">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40195189">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40194970">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40194970">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I guess youâre in USA.

I guess there is some link between &quot;full time&quot; vs &quot;part time&quot; and insurance in that sense.<p>It can depend somewhat on the job. When I was a part time adjunct last year teaching two classes (six credit hours) at a public university, I was given the option for health insurance.  I don&#x27;t remember what the premiums were but I remember they were lower than marketplace plans.<p>&gt; I assume it isn&#x27;t worth being &quot;part time&quot; and paying for the insurance gap out of pocket. Bargaining power tends not to work that way.<p>Since the Affordable Care Act, the prices are somewhat more regulated and they&#x27;re not really allowed to &quot;decline&quot; you anymore, so the &quot;bargaining power&quot; thing isn&#x27;t as bad as it used to be. Paying out of pocket for insurance is expensive but not insurmountable for basically anyone working in tech, and certainly you can factor into an hourly rate.  In NYC there&#x27;s the MetroPlus system, and the cheaper plan on that is around $1250&#x2F;month for two people, which equates to roughly $15,000&#x2F;year [1]. An employer plan in NYC will still typically have anywhere between ~$100-$600 monthly premium for a family plan, so anywhere between $1200-$7200 per year of just premiums (not counting what you pay before reaching your deductible), depending on the company and which plan you choose within the company. The US healthcare system is needlessly complicated.<p>Still, it would certainly be better to <i>not</i> pay $15,000&#x2F;year if I can avoid it, so before I try doing half-time contracting I am going to wait for my wife to start working.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metroplus.org&#x2F;plans&#x2F;individual-family&#x2F;marketplace&#x2F;bronzeplus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metroplus.org&#x2F;plans&#x2F;individual-family&#x2F;marketplace&#x2F;br...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40193648" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40193648" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">antihipocrat</span><span>|</span><a href="#40191093">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40191215">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40193740">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40191646">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40193648">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40193648">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s no requirement to put qualifications or experience on the CV that aren&#x27;t necessary for the role.

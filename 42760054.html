Twitter was supposed to be the new SMS, or text message protocol, but that never happened. RSS is an example of a protocol in that space. At best, Twitter was&#x2F;is an API.<p>In a practical utility perspective Twitter was a pub&#x2F;sub broadcast system in the social media space. It was slim, fast, and real time in a way the Facebook wasn’t, due to a 140 character limit. Yet, it never seemed to become more than 10% of Facebook and almost exclusively used only by people who were already heavy Facebook users.<p>I remember the optimism around Twitter in 2007 because it was immediately evident that it was addictive to certain personalities. Some people just had to broadcast absolutely everything they did, often irrationally. Most everyone else tried to find a use for Twitter but couldn’t. I know many early users that either abandoned or deleted their accounts before 2010.<p>Eventually it just became a text broadcast interface via their client. That is good for people who want to build a following, but nobody else found a use for it. In that regard YouTube is the Twitter replacement but YouTube had value otherwise that Twitter never could.</div><br/><div id="42766232" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42766232" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">azangru</span><span>|</span><a href="#42766194">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42766485">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42766232">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42766232">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Most everyone else tried to find a use for Twitter but couldn’t.

To me, there were three big shifts.<p>One was that Facebook&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;etc. proved that web publishing could be made more convenient by making it more centralized, and that access to an audience was, in some way, more important than access to publishing tools. No matter how good open web publishing tools got, they couldn&#x27;t compete with Facebook et. al. at providing some access to an audience, even if that audience was as small as your friends and family.<p>The second was a shift in who developed &quot;internet infrastructure.&quot; In the 80s and 90s (and before), it was mainly academics working in the public interest, and hobbyist hackers. (Think Tim Berners-Lee, Vint Cerf, IETF for web&#x2F;internet standards, or Dave Winer with RSS.) In the 00s onward, it was well-funded corporations and the engineers who worked for them. (Think Google.) So from the IETF, you have the email protocol standards, with the assumption everyone will run their own servers. But from Google, you get Gmail.<p>The third -- and perhaps most important shift -- was the move from desktop software to web + mobile software as the primary computing platform for most people. Such that even if you were a desktop user, you did most of your computing in the browser. This created a whole new mechanism for user comfort with proprietary fully-hosted software, e.g. Google Docs. This also sidelined many of the efforts to keep user-facing software open source. Such that even among the users who would be most receptive to a push for open protocols and open source software, you have strange compromises like GitHub: a platform that is built atop an open source piece of desktop software (git) and an open source storage format meant to be decentralized (git repo), but which is nonetheless 100% proprietary and centralized (e.g. GitHub.com repo hosting and GitHub Issues).<p>You ask how to &quot;dismantle&quot; this. I&#x27;ve long pondered the same question. I am not sure it can be dismantled. It doesn&#x27;t seem like these shifts can be undone. Where I&#x27;ve personally ended up is that small communities of enthusiast programmers and power users can embrace open source, open protocols, and decentralization for its obvious benefits, but that it won&#x27;t ever be a mass market again.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42763202" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42763202" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xnx</span><span>|</span><a href="#42760298">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42764459">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42761124">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42763202">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42763202">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s worth keeping in mind a few bright points: email, RSS&#x2F;podcasts, the web<p>Email: One of the oldest parts of the Internet.

Back in the 90&#x27;s and 2000&#x27;s, you had to be ready to spend a lot of time fiddling with setups and maintenance as well as some MAJOR early days security flaws(think the IRC days). Corporate-owned ecosystems solved that problem: you log in and forget about it. They won with what some people call user experience. The lower the entry barrier, the quicker something picks up. Back when I was in school I was the biggest Nokia fanboi and even then I acknowledged that downloading a shady jar file and installing it on my phone was iffy. At a later stage when I was a bit older and could afford it, I got my first Android phone and the existence of a marketplace was a breath of fresh air. The problem is that few people(annoyingly even now) fail to realize or admit that those types of centralizations put handcuffs on your wrists the moment you say &quot;OK, that works for me&quot;. Whether that&#x27;s social logins, cloud providers, services or anything else - it&#x27;s all the same. For example, if today, OpenAI decided to close off their API&#x27;s for good, I recon tens if not hundreds of thousands of &quot;AI&quot; startups will collapse immediately since they fully rely on OpenAI&#x27;s API&#x27;s. Same with AWS, GCP, Azure or any other provider. And as we see with the current fiasco with twitter, tiktok and bambu labs just to name a few from the past two days, it is abundantly clear that people are in dire need of backups. As much as I used to find google drive and docs convenient, I&#x27;ve personally moved away and self-host everything now. The only thing I rely on(and only as a backup plan to access my home network) is a VPN I host over at Hetzner. But again - this is my backup.<p>Whether the corporations saw that as an opportunity at an early stage or they were at the right place, at the right time, I can&#x27;t say. I&#x27;m more leaning towards the latter since I&#x27;ve worked at corporations and success in those environments is most commonly a moderately-educated gamble.</div><br/><div id="42760643" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42760643" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ryanhecht</span><span>|</span><a href="#42760298">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42760486">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42760912">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42760643">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42760643">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah, I think it&#x27;s clear that laziness&#x2F;convenience is the answer.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right about people needing backups -- but ofc selfhosting is too huge a hurdle to expect most folks to embark on.<p>I wonder what can be done to make the &quot;better&quot; options easier.

Say you want to take messaging off centralized platforms: you need to host something like Matrix, which is very well made and polished but takes a lot of resources to run. Alternatively, you could use Jabber, which scales like no other but is an absolute hell to setup and maintain. Same can be said about music, videos, movies and all other things<p>* Operations: probably simple if you ask someone on HN, but you still need to understand networking, operating systems and file systems. I started using Linux when I was 11 in the distant 2000, and even now I&#x27;m not very enthusiastic if I have to make some changes to my zfs. You also need to consider backups and security and resources. Say you wanna run openstreetmap(which we recently started doing at work). Awesome but that requires an ungodly amount of fiddling in addition to an astonishing amount of time needed to unpack, even on enterprise hardware.<p>If you are in the tech world, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;awesome-selfhosted&#x2F;awesome-selfhosted">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;awesome-selfhosted&#x2F;awesome-selfhosted</a> is a great place to start. But if you want to make it simpler... Idk... A lot of people would need to put in a lot of effort, as in build a linux distro around this idea, along with &quot;recommended hardware&quot;, one click install(a very dumbed down equivalent of portainer), and some backup and alerting mechanisms built into the system. It&#x27;s a tough question and frankly I don&#x27;t have the answer.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42760912" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42760912" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ben_w</span><span>|</span><a href="#42760298">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42760486">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42760426">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42760912">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42760912">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; As a relative &quot;youngin&quot; (I&#x27;m 27), at what point did we make the shift from protocols to corporate-owned ecosystems?

The big players can seize the market. Nearly every industry or medium offers economies of scale that favor large investors. And everything facing the public turns into this advertising and analytics game. So, yes, it&#x27;s driven by VC money that can buy user attention and drown out the small hobbyists who cannot invest so much in marketing nor features.<p>I think the answer to your &quot;dismantling&quot; question would be similar to antitrust actions against railroads, steel industry, etc. a century ago. It takes political will and sensible regulation. Economics favor the capital, not democracy or other social values. As in with other mass consumer markets, I think the consumers also enable this in a tragedy of the commons scenario. They each can make self-serving compromises for convenience and enjoyment and ignore the externalities.<p>By the way, before the internet protocols dominated, there were bulletin board systems (BBSs) and unix-to-unix copy protocol (UUCP) networks. These had some grassroots kind of community federation but also got more commercial consolidation over time. Handwaving a bit, this included systems like Compuserve and AOL. In some ways, USENET was the biggest social media that made the transition from UUCP to internet. It too eventually suffered from the same erosion of its userbase and attacks by commercial consolidation and neglect, before the web.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42760904" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42760904" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dredmorbius</span><span>|</span><a href="#42760298">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42761129">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42765208">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42760904">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42760904">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The trend was well underway in the mid-aughts, though some might argue that early forum systems, including Slashdot (Slashcode), phpBB, and even AOL forums were precursors (all were Web &#x2F; app alternatives to Usenet &#x2F; NNTP, effectively).  If you count custom BBS forum software, the trend goes back even further to the early dial-up era of the 1980s.  We&#x27;re talking 300--1200 baud modems here, none of that fancy fast 48&#x2F;56Kbps stuff.<p>One of the challenges with open-protocols-based systems is <i>protocol stasis</i>.  That is, once a protocol is developed and in wide use, <i>agreeing collectively on change is hard</i>.  I&#x27;ve seen this directly (largely on the user-side) with Diaspora* (the platform, whilst it has some good basics, is tragically stuck with design decisions from a decade and a half ago), and Mastodon (itself an attempt to break out of stasis within IRC, StatusNet, GNU Social, and WebFinger).  The two sides of that debate tend to register as purist&#x2F;absolutists who cotton no variance from spec, and expand-and-embrace radicals who are seeking to adapt the protocol for private gain.  (The truth of course is that both positions are considerably more nuanced, of course, and good or bad motivations may well exist on either side.)<p>We&#x27;re seeing part of this play out with HTML&#x2F;HTTP (now largely captured by Google) and SMTP (largely moribund) where on the one hand a highly complex spec largely serving the interests of publishers and advertisers over readers exists (HTML&#x2F;HTTP) (see especially Drew Devault&#x27;s account of how insanely complex it is to write an HTML renderer from scratch), and in the case of SMTP, many failures (privacy, security, spam, workflow integration) of email to adapt to new needs and concerns.<p>The result is that we rely less on open standards (making lock-in more prevalent, and new entry more challenging), existing standards are either static (SMTP) or so bloated as to lock out new entrants (HTML&#x2F;HTTP), and larger aspects of online exchange get locked into proprietary stacks, protocols, platforms, and actors, with what development <i>does</i> occur  largely addressing corporate rather than community &#x2F; societal needs.<p>For someone who was pitched on the promise and liberation of information technologies from the 1970s onward, and was present as the modern Web and online world has emerged, it&#x27;s tremendously disappointing, though there&#x27;ve been some lessons learned, if by me rather than the world at large.  It&#x27;s been interesting to watch major social rights advocates, of both the digital and broader stripes, come to terms with this (EFF, ACLU, and others), and shift their tunes considerably.<p>For the younger set who didn&#x27;t experience this, or the older set who&#x27;ve forgotten or weren&#x27;t paying attention, it&#x27;s increasingly revealing to visit works being published over the course of this development, beginning with some of the earliest RAND monographs in the 1960s, whether cautionary or enthusiastic.  I find the cautionary takes have worn better.<p>A partial bibliography here:  &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toot.cat&#x2F;@dredmorbius&#x2F;105074933053020193" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toot.cat&#x2F;@dredmorbius&#x2F;105074933053020193</a>&gt;<p>I&#x27;d add to that Lessig&#x27;s <i>Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace</i> and Andrew Shapiro&#x27;s <i>Control Revolution</i>, both published in 1999.<p>&lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;codeotherlawsofc0000less" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;codeotherlawsofc0000less</a>&gt;<p>&lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;controlrevolutio00andr" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;controlrevolutio00andr</a>&gt;<p>Alvin Toffler&#x27;s <i>Future Shock</i> addresses this specific issue only slightly, but is another historically interesting and significant take on what was, now over fifty years ago, the future of technological, informational, and cultural development:<p>&lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;isbn_0553132644" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;isbn_0553132644</a>&gt;<p>As I&#x27;ve noted here recently, that book&#x27;s prognostications can be divided into TK-count, ahem, three categories:  technical, psychological, and social.

Ong.  I&#x27;m increasingly convinced that changes to information technology and systems, from the advent of speech, writing, and maths to the present, have absolutely profound impacts on the societies in which they emerge (and those proximate to them).  They act as power-multipliers on <i>other</i> technological advances, notably in agriculture, metallurgy, fuels, mechanics, electromagnetism, etc., but even on their own are highly underappreciated.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42765208" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42765208" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mvdtnz</span><span>|</span><a href="#42760298">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42760904">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42765845">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42765208">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42765208">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Basically when assholes like Paul Graham got involved and dumped absolute mountains of money into applications like Reddit and Dropbox that take concepts that exist in open protocols but implement them in closed moneytisable ways.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42765845" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42765845" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nobunaga</span><span>|</span><a href="#42760298">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42760314">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42765845">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42765845">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Can we syop giving this guy attention?

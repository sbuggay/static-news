Amateur radio has a lot of aspects to it and some people love the contesting aspect.  Some aren&#x27;t into it at all.<p>Summits-on-the-Air, Parks-on-the-Air, and others involve going out and operating a portable station (the activator).  The reason why parks are a good place to operate is that they have open spaces, trees, etc that are good for deploying antennas.  You also don&#x27;t generally need permission like you would with a school field for instance.

 Same deal with Summits on the Air, the whole idea is creating a fun &quot;game-ified&quot; program around getting on the radio in the great outdoors.   Because contesting and &quot;achievements&quot; are such a big thing for many amateur radio operators (or at least it&#x27;s one big facet of the culture), this is just another tangent by which one could partake in the hobby.  I mean, honestly the simplest explanation is &quot;because it&#x27;s fun&quot;.  It&#x27;s cool to go out to a park and contact people all over the world and also have a comprehensive system around it, where people want to &quot;chase&quot; you because theyll get points for it, and it all goes into a public log&#x2F;database, and certain milestones are recognized by little auto-generated certificates&#x2F;awards.  Again, it&#x27;s just fun.  Maybe not for everyone, but it&#x27;s a hobby -- there&#x27;s no big stake in the game here.  As for why it&#x27;s &quot;important&quot; - it&#x27;s not especially, except maybe for motivating people to stay familiar with their gear, and radio communication procedures.  I don&#x27;t think anyone portrays POTA&#x2F;SOTA as particularly &quot;important&quot;, though they are pretty fun and awesome.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41928651" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41928651" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dgacmu</span><span>|</span><a href="#41928499">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41932031">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41928750">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41928651">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41928651">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything to get - it&#x27;s just for fun.

If you search the internet for information about using ham radio, the loudest voices are sour, cantankerous forum dwellers for whom unwanted clandestine vigilante radio regulation enforcement and compliance are the most interesting part of amateur radio. Good luck if you don&#x27;t already know how taboo Baofeng, et al radios are before you write your first post. That&#x27;s not appealing to most people. In fact, most find that sort of personality repulsive. Who wants to ask a question somewhere about a new interest if you&#x27;re nearly guaranteed to elicit a condescending non-answer from someone more interested in making themselves feel smart than they are at being a good resource?<p>Communication isn&#x27;t just putting the information out there, it&#x27;s about sharing the <i>good feelings</i> people get from doing ham stuff. If there&#x27;s a charismatic amateur radio youtuber or something that&#x27;s way more about the joy of using radio rather than the nitpicky details even experienced hams find tiring, I haven&#x27;t encountered them. They probably need to do some serious promotion. Lot&#x27;s of old farts like to think young people just aren&#x27;t technical enough or don&#x27;t have the discipline: it&#x27;s bullshit. Compare how many technical workers there are today vs 40 years ago. I&#x27;ll bet 90% of what repels new hopeful hams from getting involved boils down to the curse of expertise, gatekeeping, and angry hall-monitorism among the most vocal people that haunt places that new folks might go for information. It&#x27;s not just amateur radio that does this, but it might be the biggest offender I&#x27;ve seen at least since the Perl newsgroups in the late 90s.</div><br/><div id="41930583" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41930583" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bitzun</span><span>|</span><a href="#41928499">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41930274">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41930566">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41930583">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41930583">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would be into ragchewing except (at least on 20&#x2F;40&#x2F;80 where I have a consistent setup) the vast majority of SSB contacts are with ancient men and most conversations I catch contain unambiguously racist statements or at least a lot of &quot;kids these days&quot; talk.

Some people enjoy designing and building homebrew gear.

Two people with appropriate gear and knowledge can communicate with each other, and do so completely independently of any third-party infrastructure. This was a total superpower up until about 30 years ago, and remains appealing when thinking about emergency scenarios.<p>Some people are naturally competitive and will make a game of anything possible. These people have invented awards -- along with various pseudo-regulatory bodies to allocate same -- for things like making a radio contact on each of the seven continents, or for contacting the most people within a designated 48h period, or many other feats defined by various -- largely arbitrary -- rules.<p>POTA is one such set of rules. The &quot;national&#x2F;state level park&quot; aspect is just to put some constraints on the competition.

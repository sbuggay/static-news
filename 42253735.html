If you just need a throw-away proof of concept, or a personal utility, or the like, low-code solutions can be quite efficient.<p>However, implementing anything significant that&#x27;s expected to be extended and improved, particularly when there are users that request changes, improvements and new features, low-code &quot;is like climbing a tree in order to reach the moon&quot;. You&#x27;ll  will very quickly run out of tree and further progress becomes almost impossible.<p>To a lesser extent the same thing also occurs with web development frameworks, but the limits are less constraining and there are often mechanisms that allow you integrate your own code, that implements whatever it is that the framework doesn&#x27;t provide.<p>Low code, frameworks, and &quot;build it totally from scratch&quot;, can all be a valid solutions, but the right choice often depends on a bunch of specific  considerations (technology, user &amp; quality expectations, organizational capabilities &amp; constraints, etc.)<p>My recommendation is to keep an open mind about alternative technologies and approaches, and to pick solutions that are appropriate for the environment in which they will be developed, extended and operated. And that requires experience, which you normally don&#x27;t have in the early phase of your career (e.g. good judgement comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgement)</div><br/><div id="42293997" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42293997" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">devjab</span><span>|</span><a href="#42292512">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42292901">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42293997">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42293997">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’ve spend a few decades in non-tech enterprise including 7 years in the public sector, and I’ve never seen a low-code solution work at all.

It will automatically do things for you which will greatly reduce the amount of boilerplate you need to write as long as you follow the framework&#x27;s conventions.<p>However, Rails has a less than stellar reputation from those who have maintained long lived projects which use it. Rails&#x27; conventions encourage the use of fat models where business logic is implemented in the models themselves. 
With the default scaffolding Rails provides, every single model and all of this business logic ends up in the project&#x27;s app&#x2F;models&#x2F; directory without any separation between different features. Because the default doesn&#x27;t cleanly separate business logic with well defined boundaries this means that Rails apps tend to evolve in a way where everything starts to become tightly coupled with everything else. When the business requirements for the application inevitably change this tendency towards tight coupling between models makes it difficult to make major changes to existing code.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen hacky workarounds used in Rails based apps which exist to make complex business logic work (e.g., saving one model doesn&#x27;t implicitly trigger hooks for business logic on other related models). These hacky workarounds usually break the conventions Rails uses and ends up requiring extra boilerplate to be added elsewhere in the application.<p>Some developers try to avoid this by hand rolling more architectural layers (e.g., &quot;Java&#x2F;Go&#x2F;Node.js&#x2F;OOP like&quot;) on top of Rails to try prevent this, to varying degrees of success. Other frameworks (e.g., Django) try to encourage developers to separate different features into distinct modules to try and prevent them from being tightly coupled with each other.</div><br/><div id="42293253" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42293253" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">andrewmutz</span><span>|</span><a href="#42291398">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42293112">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42292676">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42293253">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42293253">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Long-lived rails apps are a nightmare to work with, in exactly the same manner as long-lived java, python or php apps</div><br/><div id="42293389" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42293389" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">afuchs</span><span>|</span><a href="#42291398">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42293253">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42292676">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42293389">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42293389">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Long-lived rails apps are a nightmare to work with, in exactly the same manner as long-lived java, python or php apps<p>Agreed that tech debt and bad architecture is everywhere.

It was certainly more popular than the new crop of no-code&#x2F;low-code platforms we have today. In the late-90s and early 2000s almost every large company seems to have had Access applications running in several different corners of the business.<p>The reason Access eventually died off is that it wasn&#x27;t designed as a multi-user database. You could run Access on a network file share but performance would suffer (especially with concurrent access by multiple users), and you&#x27;ll be running the risk of database file corruption. Microsoft Access did support a client-only mode, where Access is used for the forms, queries and application code, but the actual data is stored in Microsoft SQL Server — but setting up and maintaining a database server was probably too complicated for the type of contexts in which Access became popular.<p>The key point is that most of the usage of low-code products in the past was basically an instance of Shadow IT. In order for a Shadow IT product to be successful it generally needs to be easy to use, easy to distribute (or access) and have a capable free (or effectively free) version. Access and Excel had it all. They were easy to use for beginners (although complex applications required skill). Distribution was extremely simple in the corporate intranet age: you just had to place your Excel or Access file on a network share. They were part of Microsoft Office, so everybody had them on their computer &quot;for free&quot;. If a product fulfills the conditions above, entrepreneurial employees will start using this product to address viable needs that your IT department lacks the resources to solve with a more robust solution.<p>Often these Access apps became popular enough that it had to be officially taken by the IT department, where IT programmers invariably cursed the buggy hack of an application they had to maintain. I don&#x27;t know the statistics, but I assume a great number of these would just be rewritten as a traditional client&#x2F;server or web application.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42292719" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42292719" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">singpolyma3</span><span>|</span><a href="#42291613">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42292022">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42292769">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42292202">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42292719">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42292719">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Access was so good.

Probably SAP and Salesforce as well.<p>I&#x27;d argue that it was Cloud and improved monetization opportunities rather than ChatGPT which made the current iteration of low&#x2F;no-code more popular, although ChatGPT certainly helps (I&#x27;d argue that past a certain level of complexity&#x2F;code sized, LLMs also stop working properly). Most low&#x2F;no-code tools include hosting, which is a must for anything meant to be served on the Internet, and before public cloud took off, this was a lot more complicated to offer for free or a low-cost. There&#x27;s also a much bigger market for SaaS and it&#x27;s easy to take payments over the Internet now, which incentivizes semi-technical to build software to be served over the Internet rather than their desktop (and also makes it easier to build the low&#x2F;no-code tools themselves).<p>&gt; until you REALLY need a programmer<p>This is the thing I was getting at, there are a lot of people who know how to program but are not super-skilled at it, and I think a lot of software engineers don&#x27;t get this. Think back to when you were just learning to program and how frustrating it probably was to do &quot;basic&quot; things like set up your dev environment or ship a website for the first time. For the people using low-code, it&#x27;s not that they can&#x27;t do these things, it&#x27;s that they&#x27;d have to spend a lot of time looking things up and learning how do it, which is a major time investment (and frankly require a lot of persistence&#x2F;patience which I think professional SWEs self-select for, because the learning SWE learning curve is brutal for most people) that they&#x27;d rather not make. You can argue that past a certain degree of complexity that the investment is worth it, but in many cases it probably isn&#x27;t, and in others it&#x27;s possible they&#x27;d not have made it to the point of outgrowing low-code at all if they had to do everything from scratch.<p>It&#x27;s not much different from how we as programmers use things like Cloudflare or AWS Lambda. Could we run and manage our own DNS or scaling? If we really need to learn it, we probably could if we set our minds to it. Is it possible we could outgrow those tools if we start on them? Definitely. But even when we know how to implement our own scaling or DNS we might still reach for these tools just because they&#x27;re so convenient to get something working quickly, and most of the time we don&#x27;t outgrow them anyway.

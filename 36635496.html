After all, the first little bit didn’t hurt us, did it?<p>The end result of this thinking is the feature factory, where a company only ever builds new features, usually to attract new customers. Necessary refactors are called “tech debt” and left to pile up. Yes, this is just another view of bad management, but still, Ward thought that the metaphor afforded it too easily.<p>He said he wished instead that he’d coined “opportunity,” as in, producing or consuming it. Good practices produce opportunity. Opportunity can then be consumed in order to meet certain short-term goals.<p>So it flips the baseline. Rather than having a baseline of quality then dipping below it into tech debt, you’d produce opportunity to put you above the baseline. Once you have this opportunity, you consume it to get back to baseline but not below.<p>I’m not convinced that the concept phrased thus would have the same traction. Still, I love this way of looking at it, like I love much of Ward’s POV on the world.</div><br/><div id="36636982" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36636982" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lumost</span><span>|</span><a href="#36636914">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36637698">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36636982">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36636982">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve also found that the term can be used to describe anything.

But now? With modern release cadences, we are always designing the system. Which is great, because the quality of design is limited by our knowledge, and our knowledge increases over time.

The CFO is the sole person &quot;doing the math&quot; on accruing debt. The person who get to live in the house is the one taking on mortgage debt.<p>In tech debt though, that is split into two groups:<p>- &quot;the business&quot; concretely reap the benefit of accruing tech debt (release faster = more profit), only abstractly feeling the consequences (developers are maybe slower and maybe more miserable than they should be)<p>- developers suffer the consequences directly (working with badly maintained code that you don&#x27;t have leeway to resolve is soul crushing), while only abstractly reaping any benefit[1] (maybe the business profits more which maybe gives them more leeway for maybe a better pay rise than they would have otherwise gotten)<p>The concrete feelings are obvious, the abstract ones are all arguable because you don&#x27;t live the opposite (maybe this feature would have always taken this long, maybe the company would have always been able to afford that pay rise), and so are easy to ignore.<p>So then, unlike financial debt, the decision whether or not to accrue tech debt is ugly tension between two groups who don&#x27;t really understand or have empathy for each others motivation. The business would always prefer you go as fast as you can, and developers would always prefer they work with code that isn&#x27;t miserable to work with.<p>Attempts to solve this are pretty mixed in my experience, and generally the business wins. Which is I think, where most people&#x27;s negative feelings on the phrase &quot;tech debt&quot; comes from.<p>[1] the obvious counterpoint here is startups and other jobs where you get stock options etc. I have only worked in that scenario once, and my company was a subsidiary of a much larger one, so our ability to move the needle on stock value was pretty negligible.

One of my big tests in any new job is the first time a product manager wants to put something on credit. E.g., &quot;We have to add feature X right now so we can land a big client.

The #1 fix to prevent most serious tech debt and also get features done quickly is the quality of your engineers (or yourself if you’re the one coding). Someone knowledgeable with several completed projects and up-to-date knowledge should create the codebase.<p>Also it depends a lot on what stage your project is in. If you have zero customers or money coming in, your focus should be on creating a working product and getting customers. That means zero tests for now, just a working product. It will also more quickly validate if you’re working on the right thing or not, or if you need to pivot.<p>One problem I see is when engineers want to solve the tech debt problem before even proving the product should exist. No, first establish the demand, get real cash flow, then start focusing on tech debt.<p>If you are an entrepreneur then tech debt is literally the last of your concerns. If you grow enough where it is then it’s a good problem to have - the biggest problem is typically not enough customers, not too much tech debt.<p>On the other hand if you are working at Google, and know for a fact thousands or millions of people will use your code, then you should “lock it down” right at the beginning, have all the testing upfront, good documentation, etc.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36637858" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36637858" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">twic</span><span>|</span><a href="#36637104">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36637390">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36637858">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36637858">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Debt works like this:<p>1. you take on debt to get hold of some cash<p>2. at some point, you ought to repay the debt by giving up the same amount of cash<p>3. until you do, you have to spend a steady trickle of cash servicing the debt<p>In the technical debt metaphor, cash stands for development effort. But:<p>1. taking on technical debt doesn&#x27;t give you a load of development effort out of nowhere (i suppose you could say that shipping what should be a three week feature in two weeks is like getting a week of effort from nowhere, but that seems dubious to me - you haven&#x27;t shipped the same feature!)<p>2. repaying technical debt generally takes more work than it saved, because by the time you repay it, it&#x27;s infected other code that was written afterwards BUT sometimes you end up being able to delete the whole thing, because the feature was retired or fundamentally rewritten, in which case you don&#x27;t need to repay it at all!<p>3. sometimes, existing technical debt requires no extra work at all (if it&#x27;s in a part of the codebase you aren&#x27;t touching), but if it does, it&#x27;s not a constant amount, it&#x27;s proportional to the amount of work you are doing on that code<p>So it doesn&#x27;t seem like a brilliant metaphor, really.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s more like cleaning your bike chain after a ride through the mud.

Imagine you have some money, and you can use it to buy something called an &quot;option.&quot; An option is like a special ticket that gives you the right to do something later, but you don&#x27;t have to do it if you don&#x27;t want to.<p>Now, in the quote, instead of money and options, we&#x27;re talking about computer code. When people write code, sometimes they write it in a way that&#x27;s not very good. We call this &quot;bad code.&quot; It&#x27;s like having a sloppy and messy way of writing instructions for a computer.<p>But here&#x27;s the clever part: good code can be like a special kind of option for the future. It means you have the choice to make things better later on. It&#x27;s like having a ticket that allows you to improve your code and fix any problems.<p>Now, when code is really bad, it&#x27;s like not using that special ticket. It&#x27;s like not taking advantage of the chance to make things better. So, when we say bad code is an &quot;unhedged call option,&quot; it means you&#x27;re not using that ticket and missing out on the opportunity to make things right.

They insist that DTI is a silly concept and instead propose &quot;interest-expense-to-income ratio.&quot; They are under the impression that DTI = total principle &#x2F; income. This is false.<p>DTI is total debt servicing cost per unit time &#x2F; income per unit time. The numerator and denominator do not have mismatched units, like the author claims.<p>What&#x27;s more, the author&#x27;s proposed replacement measure--an interest-expense-to-income ratio--is quite silly. By only considering interest expense rather than the total cost to service debts, the measure becomes worthless as a means of estimating the capacity to take on additional debt. If you were to have debts that, despite being interest-free, were large enough for payments toward principle alone to completely consume your income, then you have zero capacity to take on additional debt.<p>The author also proposed that a bank&#x2F;lender is to a borrower managing financial debt what a CEO is to an engineering team managing technical debt. They say it without conviction, admittedly, but it is another quite absurd notion. Per the author&#x27;s metaphor, a lender is incentivized to maximize interest income over the lifetime of a given debt (ignoring rising-rate environments); put differently, prepayment is to a lender&#x27;s detriment.

It would be nice if the fans didn&#x27;t spin up just to run xcode, but whatever. If I was running arbitrary docker instances for clients and didn&#x27;t have an issued M1 max with 32gb or more of ram &amp;&amp; by buying a new one I could either do more work or complete work faster, then the $5k on a new laptop would be a no-brainer. I&#x27;d have hit a wall, the other side of which has greener grass.<p>At my last job, we were refactoring a bunch of Angular 1.x code for a variety of reasons. It took way way more time than anyone was anticipating, and it was tech debt that had low interest and probably shouldn&#x27;t have been paid off much earlier than it was. People had chipped away at some components gradually over the years, much like mortgage payments, but after Angular 1.x fully reached EOL, and (imo) we entered a new level of efficiency with build tools, that interest rate started increasing.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36639562" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36639562" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dryanau</span><span>|</span><a href="#36639405">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36639511">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36639562">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36639562">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Debt is a drain on your revenues; the thing you did to incur the debt is a boost to your revenues; if you take too long to pay back the debt, it&#x27;s an overall loss.<p>&gt; CFOs can calculate that.

I wrote a long post [1], which basically says:<p>1. The &quot;Technical&quot; word pigeonholes responsibility to the &quot;technical&quot; people. This creates all manner of problems (management, strategy, resource allocation etc.). It ought to be seen as &quot;Software&quot; debt, because the whole software company owns it.<p>2. Software debt packages risk. We need better mental models of that risk.<p>- This perception is commonly muddied by personal bias---how we think of finances and debt in our daily lives.<p>- However, it requires thinking like a strategist and&#x2F;or economist (much more abstract, nuanced terms). The trouble is that the &quot;debt&quot; is rooted in complexity, which, like rocket mass, is inevitable. And we abhor it because solving for complexity is like solving for rocket mass; requires recursive tree-networked thinking.<p>- The debt is also inevitable because we <i>want</i> some complexity (rocket mass). It&#x27;s just that it needs be the <i>exact</i> kind we need, which choice-making is difficult.<p>- This sort of complexity-debt always compounds and each decision to add or remove items from any part of the system changes the principal and the rate of interest and the repayment terms.<p>- It is layered because software parts compose into software &quot;stacks&quot; and hierarchies, and each part mutates&#x2F;evolves up and down the towers.<p>- It is networked. Because software itself is networked. Small local changes can turn into literal chain reactions of events. The meltdown of Knight Capital stands out starkly as an example of unmitigated, un-hedged software debt.<p>Ultimately, the &quot;debt&quot; part of &quot;software debt&quot; is better seen as if it were a complex opaque financial derivative. Unchecked creation of software debt is exactly analogous to how the 2008 financial crisis came to be. It&#x27;s all composed of &quot;simple&quot; debt.<p>Much as I dislike all this doom-speak, I have to acknowledge it is material, and to side with Andy Grove. Only the paranoid survive.<p>The only real hedge we have is the creativity and intelligence of our people.<p>More at my blog post here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.evalapply.org&#x2F;posts&#x2F;software-debt&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.evalapply.org&#x2F;posts&#x2F;software-debt&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36639944" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36639944" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sclarisse</span><span>|</span><a href="#36640705">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36639964">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36639944">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36639944">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The advice that you should &quot;always buy the biggest home you can afford&quot; is often perversely accurate, especially if you believe property values will keep going up.<p>Ehhhhhhhh too much of that return goes straight to Consumption instead of your bank account.

And I always call BS on it.  I don&#x27;t expect to persuade you, replying for the Nth time, but I have a couple of things I want you to think about.<p>&quot;Not free&quot; sometimes beats &quot;free&quot;.  People buy cars even in cities that have public transit.  People paid for cable TV when over-the-air TV was free.<p>For this to happen, though, the not-free option has to deliver more value than the free version.  With a car, I can go when I want; with public transit I have to wait.  For many people, there&#x27;s value in that.  With cable I can watch 500 channels.  There&#x27;s value in that, at least for some people.<p><i>PL&#x2F;I, Modula-2, and Pascal did not deliver more value than C</i> - or at least not <i>enough</i> value to be worth the price of their compilers.  Multics did not deliver more value than Unix - or at least, not enough more.<p>In fact, Multics had to reach a very high bar, because not only was Unix free, it ran on less-expensive hardware.  The issue (probably) wasn&#x27;t that Multics cost more than Unix; the issue was that Multics ran on hardware that cost a lot more than a PDP-11.  Unix could have cost as much as Multics and still won, because the cost of the OS was not the dominant cost in the equation.<p>You often mention network effects - that Unix and C took over universities because they were free, and so everyone was using them, and so everyone knew how to use them, and so when they went somewhere else, they used what they knew.  Go back to cable TV.  Over-the-air TV had network effects - everyone was talking about the show they watched last night, and if you didn&#x27;t watch it, you were left out.  It was free advertising plus social pressure to be part of the &quot;in&quot; crowd.  And yet cable still made money, and eventually grew into internet distribution, and still took away large amounts of market share from broadcast.  Network effects can be overcome, if the product is actually closer to what people want.<p>So I think your explanation is too simplistic.  It may have been a factor, but in the ahistorical world where Unix and C weren&#x27;t free, I think they would have won anyway - still because of cost, but because of <i>hardware</i> cost.</div><br/><div id="40329373" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40329373" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pjmlp</span><span>|</span><a href="#40327057">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40328302">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40328610">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40329373">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40329373">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I am full down that if UNIX wasn&#x27;t free beer it would never had been adopted at scale.<p>Its warts are only bearable, because of being free beer.</div><br/><div id="40329884" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40329884" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AnimalMuppet</span><span>|</span><a href="#40327057">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40329373">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40328610">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40329884">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40329884">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I refer you to the last line of the article:<p>&gt; Multics didn&#x27;t fail: it accomplished almost all of its stated goals.

So are various other IBM mainframe products like DB2 for z&#x2F;OS. PL&#x2F;X was previously known as PL&#x2F;S, PL&#x2F;S II, PL&#x2F;AS. There was also a &quot;PL&#x2F;X-86&quot; which was a port of PL&#x2F;X to x86, targeting OS&#x2F;2, it was used for mainframe service processor code.<p>Large parts of IBM i are written in a couple of related PL&#x2F;I dialects, PL&#x2F;MI and PL&#x2F;MP. PL&#x2F;MI is used for code that runs above the virtual machine, PL&#x2F;MP for code which runs below it. When they switched from CISC to RISC, a lot of the PL&#x2F;MP code was rewritten in C++, although apparently some of it survives. (Parts of IBM i are also written in Modula 2)<p>PL.8 is yet another systems programming PL&#x2F;I dialect. It was developed as part of the compiler for the IBM 801 RISC project. It was the language many of IBM&#x27;s compilers were written in (not sure if that is still true?). In the earliest versions the AIX kernel was written in a mixture of PL.8 and C, although newer versions all the PL.8 code is gone. It was also used to write firmware for mainframes (and possibly AS&#x2F;400 aka IBM i too). IBM even built a PL.8 frontend for GCC, but they never officially released it outside of IBM – <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1147&#x2F;rd.483.0543" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1147&#x2F;rd.483.0543</a><p>Yet another IBM PL&#x2F;I dialect is PL&#x2F;DS which was used for the IBM 8100 and DPPX&#x2F;370, although that stuff is long dead.<p>Then there was also Intel &#x2F; Digital Research PL&#x2F;M, which was used to write CP&#x2F;M.

So in a PL like you’re imagining, every function would need to run an assertion prologue validating all of its static dependencies. As for dynamic dependencies, they would need to be dynamically (continually) validated, probably at multiple scopes (who watches the watchmen?). If you squint your eyes you will see that static dependency checking is in fact partially provided by type systems, the more capable the type system the broader it’s functional coverage. The complexity actually lies in those dynamic dependencies, which are external systems and components, sitting at the other end of some channel, and this includes the very hardware components the function is running on. If you follow this rabbit hole you’ll see that there’s no such things as static dependencies, just allegedly more stable dynamic ones; and that all dependencies are intertwined with each other within the continuum of the universe; and that anything that works is a miracle, built upon hopes and dreams.

Asserts are a kind of error handling. They handle situations where the code can tell that it&#x27;s off the rails. It might be off the rails due to a hardware error or a software implementation error, e.g., a &#x27;can&#x27;t happen&#x27; situation.<p>We didn&#x27;t have debug-only asserts. Asserts were enable in the software we verified and shipped.<p>It took a while for developers to be able to determine when a situation called for an assert, and when it called for what might be called traditional error handling.<p>The strategy of shipping with asserts enabled kind of worried some folks. They were concerned that it might assert in front of a customer. I understand the concern, but in our domain, if you&#x27;re doing an OB exam with the ultrasound system and you have a choice of asserting or showing a femur length measurement of -1039cm, which is better?<p>We didn&#x27;t have many asserts in the field. We had a lab where we had about 25 - 30 ultrasound machines running embedded tests constantly. Each machine was connected to a JTAG debug board, so we could flash new code into the system and so we could set a breakpoint on the assert routine itself and save a &quot;core dump&quot; for subsequent debugging without having to try to reproduce the system state that led to the assert.<p>The whole lash-up evolved over a period of years. It worked well, so far as I know.<p>One mitigating factor was that our systems were class B devices. They were always supposed to be used by a medically trained professional that had the ability to take over if the system asserted, or power failed, etc.<p>Happy to try to answer any questions about this.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40330597" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40330597" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pjmlp</span><span>|</span><a href="#40327239">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40327435">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40328447">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40332555">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40330597">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40330597">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I learned this approach in Code Complete, and is one of the approaches when dealing with C.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40332555" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40332555" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seabird</span><span>|</span><a href="#40327239">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40327435">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40328968">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40332555">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40332555">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve come to believe that the &quot;just reboot&quot; mindset is a rotten one that has done severe damage to computer technology and the people that work on it.

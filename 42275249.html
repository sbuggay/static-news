There is no debate about this. You have shared links and arguments emphasizing that <i>there is function</i> in these parts. However, you have not addressed the fact that there are large stretches of DNA that are not conserved across species, show no differential selection pressure compared to what would be expected from random genetic drift, and that there are hugely varying sizes of genome between species.<p>From my reference below: &quot;If most eukaryotic DNA is functional at the organism level, be it for gene regulation, protection against mutations, maintenance of chromosome structure, or any other such role, then why does an onion require five times more of it than a human?&quot;<p>Of course, one can always say, &quot;How arrogant to think we know everything.&quot; But given our current understanding of evolution and genetic function, the specific identity of a genetic sequence correlates with its function. If that function is important, the sequence should be preserved to a degree better than random chance.<p>To deny this is to suggest that any random sequence of genetic material can serve a vital purpose while being subject to endless mutation without consequence. This raises the question: What do we mean by a &quot;specific sequence&quot; if it isn’t conserved and is constantly mutating?<p>I assume you are familiar with the information I’ve just shared.

Basically, the traditional view of RNA was that it&#x27;s a messenger between the DNA and proteins. That is, it <i>just</i> functions a way to transfer genomic information to the protein factories (ribosomes). There were some widely known exceptions to this, like ribosomal RNA, which forms essential parts of the structure of ribosomes, so it&#x27;s not just a messenger, it actually has a functional role in building a key cellular machine. My sense was that was viewed as a weird edge case that ribosome biologists were concerned with.<p>Anyways, there&#x27;s been an explosion of different classes of RNA in the past decade or so. This has been driven by new techniques in RNA sequencing technology that allow us to detect and sequence RNA in a more unbiased and high-throughput way. What we saw was a <i>huge</i> number and variety of RNA molecules in cells that don&#x27;t look like they encode any protein. So, this fundamentally breaks that assumption about RNA&#x27;s role as &quot;just&quot; a messenger.<p>The best characterized class of these weird new non-coding RNA&#x27;s is probably micro-RNA. They&#x27;re very short stretches of non-protein-coding RNA, and it seems that they bind to other sequences of RNA and prevent their translation to proteins. So, RNA has at least one layer of self-regulation. Then we see long non-coding RNA. They can act as &quot;sponges&quot; or buffers of microRNA by preferentially binding to miRNA, preventing the micro-RNA&#x27;s interaction with their normal protein coding RNA targets. So, there&#x27;s another layer: long non-coding RNA buffers microRNA which inhibits translation of messenger RNA. Further the long RNA can also condensate into these structures that are similar to droplets of oil in water. They&#x27;re transitory structures that form and dissolve then reform quickly and repeatedly. What they do is still a bit vaguely understood but they seem to bring together very weakly interacting proteins and RNA in concentrations that wouldn&#x27;t be possible just by diffusion within the cell. So, there&#x27;s another layer of regulation: long coding RNAs form condensates to that allow interactions between <i>proteins</i> that wouldn&#x27;t happen otherwise.<p>All of this is complicated by the fact that these things have other weird properties. They aren&#x27;t expressed very frequently, so they&#x27;re hard to detect. They&#x27;re not very well conserved evolutionarily, i.e. their sequences diverge rapidly between species. They don&#x27;t really have fixed structures, they&#x27;re more just like floppy, sticky noodles. This would typically indicate they&#x27;re not functional or at least non-essential. How could this be important? It&#x27;s an <i>RNA</i> that doesn&#x27;t make a protein, isn&#x27;t very abundant, has no defined shape, and evolution doesn&#x27;t seem to care much about the details of its sequence.<p>*But*, as this paper shows, they&#x27;re absolutely essential for cellular function. If you take them out of cells, the cells die.<p>So, all that to say that the idea of biology as working like a little computer; just a series of linear information transmission steps, is probably rather misleading in many cases. Instead it&#x27;s a tangled mess of weak interactions that depends on subtle biochemical effects like condensation. It&#x27;s noisy and imprecise at the molecular level, but all the self-interacting layers of regulation and interaction somehow give rise to remarkably precise and adaptive responses at the tissue and organismal level.</div><br/><div id="42348008" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42348008" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nickpsecurity</span><span>|</span><a href="#42340875">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42347505">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42348008">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42348008">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for that detailed description.

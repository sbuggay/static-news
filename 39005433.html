It&#x27;s not just languages themselves that present &quot;unbridgeable gulfs in thinking and perception&quot; but the experiences&#x2F;history of individuals themselves even when speaking the <i>same</i> language.<p>Anyone who speaks more than one language in the home has jumped back and forth between languages in a sentence when trying to convey something &quot;properly&quot;.  When you live with a spouse&#x2F;partner, over time you learn to consider your choice of words even in a single language in order to make it happen -- individual words can have idiosyncratic implications.  Over time (decades) you have to do this less and less as you form a &quot;household language&quot; with your partner.<p>BTW the origin of the hermaneutic effort comes from aneffort to reconcile inconsistencies in the christian texts: if they are truly the word of a god then any inconsistency must be due to human confusion or imperfection of human language; this was an attempt to find the underlying meaning (or as the article says, platonic meaning).  This led to quite a bit of development in linguistic philosophy in the 20th century (some of it quite insightful and some of it plainly absurd).  Because text cannot make the same adaptations one can mid-conversation, it&#x27;s both harder and (to me) more interesting to look into the text itself.</div><br/><div id="39006640" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39006640" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smitty1e</span><span>|</span><a href="#39006564">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39007417">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39006640">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39006640">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  When you live with a spouse&#x2F;partner, over time you learn to consider your choice of words even in a single language in order to make it happen -- individual words can have idiosyncratic implications.<p>A long-term relationship grows its own shared vocabulary and idioms that sound idiotic outside of that context.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39007417" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39007417" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lo_zamoyski</span><span>|</span><a href="#39006564">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39006640">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39006121">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39007417">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39007417">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; you form a &quot;household language&quot; with your partner<p>This has more to do with alignment of signifiers and emphasis (determined by the concerns particular to that relationship).

That is, it wasn&#x27;t the case that the Bible came first in absolute terms (it didn&#x27;t fall from the sky), but that the Bible was assembled (by the Catholic Church) through the lens of Tradition from texts written over the course of thousands of years. This Tradition provides not only the hermeneutic means that allowed said text to be compiled in the first place, but also the means to interpret the text in the future with greater depth as more is learned and the Tradition is refined and developed. That&#x27;s how we know that Genesis, having been written in a different language, time period, style, and cultural climate than the the Gospel of John, must be read differently from the Gospel of John. (Incidentally, this is the reason behind the absurdity of sola scriptura. By doing away with the unbroken Tradition that links us to the past and gives us the means by which to interpret Scripture, we are left to whatever parochial devices we happen to have. This explains, in part, the great variability and divergence of interpretation among Protestants, made evident by the presence of over 40 thousand Protestant sects in the US alone.)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39006121" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39006121" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sctb</span><span>|</span><a href="#39006564">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39005871">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39006121">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39006121">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Emo Philips&#x27; joke always comes to mind about stuff like this: &quot;The brain is the most important organ in the body... says the brain&quot;.

Electric rocks are making some progress. It&#x27;s not at all clear if those are a side effect of electric meat, or if there&#x27;s some other magic dust.

But we have very little evidence of that. I don&#x27;t have the faith of a mustard seed, so I can&#x27;t move mountains. I don&#x27;t think anybody has been able to do that for a while, and I find the reports suspect. They may be true!

But, like, you&#x27;re going to be Newton wrong. Newton was absolutely dead wrong, arrow in the heart of the theory, when Einstein rolled in and upended everything. But it&#x27;s close, and super helpful. I don&#x27;t really consider time dilation when driving up a hill. (Maybe I should) Newton&#x27;s model has been close enough so far.<p>In any case.

While there are subtle differences, it can be heard that octaves and perfect fifths, the pentatonic scale, and a four or three count rhythm are found in almost every culture. Because of this musicians can generally travel the world and find some kind of common ground, albeit if everyone agrees to more of a free form exploration!<p>There are many anthropological theories that suggest that music as a form of communication came before the spoken word, be it the beating of logs or vocalized melodies to communicate during a hunt, call for assistance, mark the start of a raid, etc.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39006559" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39006559" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xenocratus</span><span>|</span><a href="#39007392">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39008504">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39006559">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39006559">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Anyone who has learned a second language will have made an exhilarating (and yet somehow unsettling) discovery: there is never a one-to-one correspondence in meaning between the words and phrases of one language and another.

Interpretation fills in gaps and relates prior beliefs with the observation. Two people with different priors can interpret the same observation in two different ways. (Which is not to suggest relativism. We can indeed speak of having better or worse priors, just as we can speak of lesser or greater expertise.)<p>Language also allows us to express finer distinctions. It is not that distinctions are not perceived otherwise. That would be absurd. How could you ever develop the vocabulary to make finer distinctions if you wouldn&#x27;t perceive them in the first place? Rather, it makes it possible to speak about them with greater precision, and speech can reinforce discernment through a kind of process of affirmation. When speech reaffirms a belief, it is more durable. It stands a better chance of withstanding the potentially hostile churn of psychological and social forces. Hence, why naming something, accurately, and with the appropriate precision, is such a powerful act.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

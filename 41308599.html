This will save a TON of time in the near future.<p>- Invest in good docs, even if you&#x27;re not running a api saas. Good docs + consistent ux + rock solid support will solve most of your support issues.<p>I think a lot of literature around running a online biz has been boiled down to rather basic advice and its hard to find anything solid in this area.

Life gets in between and this one library or project is usually hardly the only thing that person juggles. We need to accept, that sometimes issues remain open for an extended duration. The worst is, when you have the same error or issue someone else had already, but their issue got closed by an effin github bot, that automatically closes issues, because someone hasn&#x27;t replied for a day or two. Like, you are not the center of the other person&#x27;s life. Just like no one forces you to work at no cost for others and help them, they should not be forced to give undivided focus to your project&#x27;s issues.<p>Having bots close issues, accompanied by a rude automated message is often contra-productive.

Usually users figure out things on their own if given some time.<p>- But don&#x27;t allow issues to go stale. To really wow customer service, reply as humanely quick as possible, especially for existing customers.<p>- Make your support timelines clear somewhere in your product, eg: Our support will respond within max 48 hours, but most responses take 2-3 hours.<p>- Make your terms and privacy policy pages clear.

For many, a $20&#x2F;month product is an easy decision but $100&#x2F;month price tag bumps it to a point where it becomes a more complicated decision making process. If you&#x27;re not careful you can easily raise prices so much that people decide to jump to a more full-featured competitor product.<p>Projects like this one that are personal&#x2F;side projects have an additional risk of raising prices: If the product becomes expensive, many people are going to notice that it appears to be highly profitable while also being within the realm of what a single person or small team can produce. Competition starts appearing quickly and you&#x27;re back to cutting prices to stay relevant.<p>Finally, higher prices come with higher expectations from your customers. Whereas previously they might shrug off a slow response to a customer support request at $20&#x2F;month, their $100&#x2F;month service might lead them to expect more customer support, not less.<p>There are several indie SaaS companies that get posted on HN from time to time that take the opposite approach: They offer a low price but they&#x27;re up front about what to expect. They don&#x27;t try to pretend that you&#x27;re getting world-class reliability, uptime, or support, but they do commit to offering a good service at a fair price. They could raise prices to match competitors, but now they&#x27;re playing a very different game with very different expectations.</div><br/><div id="41315427" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41315427" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tonyarkles</span><span>|</span><a href="#41312162">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41313711">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41314821">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41315427">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41315427">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree with most of what you said, but there&#x27;s significant nuance to this piece:<p>&gt; Finally, higher prices come with higher expectations from your customers. Whereas previously they might shrug off a slow response to a customer support request at $20&#x2F;month, their $100&#x2F;month service might lead them to expect more customer support, not less.<p>This is potentially true, but there&#x27;s other effects here too:<p>- When I was doing software and hardware consulting work, the people who paid the most were also the happiest customers. It felt paradoxical for a while until I really let it sink in and stew. Most of the high paying customers would just kind of... take my work products, say &quot;yup, this meets the requirements we agreed to&quot;, and run with it. The ones who were paying the least were the most likely to pull the classic &quot;well... is what we agreed to but... maybe you could move that button over to the other side and I&#x27;ve got this other feature idea that we didn&#x27;t talk about, oh and I don&#x27;t like how this works... it might be what we agreed to but it&#x27;s not how it worked in my mind...&quot;<p>- It sounds like OPs customers took that to the extreme with &quot;customers&quot; who hadn&#x27;t paid anything at all yet being demanding.<p>- By going up-market, you can lose customers for sure but it might be worth it anyway. Given the support burden it sounds like 1&#x2F;5 of the customers at 5x price would be a net win. Especially if it tracks my experience consulting where the remaining high paying customers are happier about your product in general. If you still maintain the same per-customer support burden or even have it climb some it could end up being less work overall.</div><br/><div id="41316965" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41316965" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">llm_trw</span><span>|</span><a href="#41312162">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41315427">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41314821">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41316965">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41316965">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is called firing customers, it works surprisingly well.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41314821" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41314821" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nsokolsky</span><span>|</span><a href="#41312162">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41313711">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41312397">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41314821">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41314821">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Or just give yourself permission to not reply to people.

If you go into a large organization, you are exposed to a reality that can distort your perspective. It&#x27;s a myth that people can&#x27;t move between large and small organizations, but the differentiator is their awareness of and desire to embrace the current circumstances. Many end up preferring the luxury and ease of large organizations and fail because they don&#x27;t make the switch. Many startup people don&#x27;t make the move in the other direction (even if they are exceedingly successful and it might be practical move.)<p>Similarly, a desire to only focus on engineering is something you feel will inhibit your ability to run a business.

- increase friction for things you don&#x27;t want your user to do (like cancel their account without first hearing a bunch of sales pitches)
- handle unanticipated problems that don&#x27;t fit into the happy-path you&#x27;ve set up on the settings page<p>My worry is that business dudes will get excited about making chatbots that can do the former and they&#x27;ll never trust an AI to be able to handle the later.

Hell, I developed a mobile website once for a power company that was basically a wizard &#x2F; checklist of &quot;Have you checked for known outages? Have you checked your breakers? Have you checked if your neighbours have issues too?&quot; before they were shown the customer service number.<p>Human contact doesn&#x27;t scale, or is prohibitively expensive. I sat with customer support a while ago (again energy sector, but different company) to observe, and every phone call was at least ten minutes, often 20-30, plus some aftercare in the form of logging the call or sending out a follow-up email.<p>They also did chat at the time, where a chatbot (which wasn&#x27;t ChatGPT &#x2F; AI based yet but they&#x27;re working on it) would do the initial contact, give low-hanging fruit suggestions based on their input, and ask for their information like their address before connecting to a real human. The operator was only allowed to handle two chats at a time, and each chat session took about half an hour - with some ending because the person on the other side idled too long. I mean granted, the UI wasn&#x27;t great and the customer service guy wasn&#x27;t a fast typer, but even then it was time-consuming and did not scale. They had two dozen people clocked in, if they were all as fast as this one person, they can handle 50 support calls an hour at most.<p>It does not scale. This was for a company with about 2.5 million users who rarely need customer support. Compare with companies like Google or Facebook that have billion(s) of users.

Everyone complains about bad support on everything they use, but the reality is that you can not afford to commit yourself to do support work. Being entrepreneur means you have to create barrier between things that require emotional investment.

If you cut them out, you don&#x27;t lose any income (obviously) but you do cut down on requests by filtering out a lot of your users. A win!<p>So some people assume this is a monotonic function, where charging more increases their revenue while filtering out bad customers even further. If you press that button too many times, though, you discover that the higher price comes with increased churn, fewer signups, new competitors appearing on the scene, and, surprisingly, <i>more demands from customers</i>.<p>The last one is confusing because we were all told that &quot;charge more&quot; is a magic button you press to increase revenue and improve customer quality. The problem is that once your product becomes expensive enough, people expect it to perform at a certain level. If your $10&#x2F;month service breaks one day, the number of people cancelling their subscriptions over it is going to be small. If your $100&#x2F;month service is down for an entire day, people start asking themselves why they&#x27;re paying so much for this thing anyway. The higher price gets more scrutiny at businesses looking to cut costs, so churn goes down. The higher price results it in getting recommend less over alternatives. It starts adding up.<p>Ideally you find the sweet spot where revenue is maximized, but that&#x27;s hard to do. The feedback loop on price increases can take a very long time to show up in customer churn and reduced signups.<p>I&#x27;ve signed up for a number of SaaS products over the years that played the &quot;raise prices&quot; card too aggressively and then backtracked and cut prices.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41311779" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41311779" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">1024core</span><span>|</span><a href="#41311468">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41311536">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41313962">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41311742">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41311779">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41311779">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s this old story about an old farmer and his horse.

Part of the issues also seem to come from a few contributing factors like the unusual platform and expanding from this platform including whatever limitations come with it. Meaning you implemented things in a reverse order than people might otherwise do as they don&#x27;t start out with a product on a platform trying to make it fit a subscription model.<p>I can imagine the specific type of user base also increasing specific types of annoying support requests. Although customer support almost always ends up being one of the things that at some point will annoy the hell out of you. Even on open source projects, the entitlement can be incredible. Although there you can get away with a remark like &quot;You are free to uninstall &lt;open source product&gt;, we will give you a full refund!&quot;.<p>Automating a lot of that certainly was the right call, as well as filtering out all the low hanging fruits of bullshit requests. If people can&#x27;t be bothered to read instructions (assuming they are clear instructions) then they certainly will also run into various other issues making them not worth the effort.<p>The one thing I don&#x27;t entirely disagree with is &quot;Be nice&quot; which I personally have replaced with &quot;Be civil&quot; over the years. It still means listening to peoples requests, helping them where reasonable, even be courteous where applicable. To be fair, there might also be a cultural aspect involved here. In communication with US companies the &quot;being nice&quot; mantra often seems to be taken to such a degree where I am less wishing for someone sane to just help me swiftly with my support ticket and be done with it.<p>Overall, nice write up of the experience though!</div><br/></div></div><div id="41313410" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41313410" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gwbas1c</span><span>|</span><a href="#41310498">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41310423">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41313410">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41313410">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A couple of thoughts:<p>As a customer, if I see firm boundaries set, (IE, read XXX before contacting me,) I usually assume that someone is under stress from nonsense like this.

I started a side SaaS project that saw some success so I put payments in, and it slowly grew into a small business. The product was targeted towards digital marketers, but also unfortunately appealed to scammers as part of their scam &quot;flow&quot;. It was a constant fight in moderating the userbase, a bunch of Stripe disputes, etc. It was profitable but the headaches in moderating the userbase and dealing with disputes (which cost $25 on top of the refund, by the way), support tickets from obvious scammers etc. was draining and turned me off the project all together.<p>I started another product in a different niche which also showed some success and eventually overtook it and allowed me to quit my 9-5. I shuttered the original product as it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle. The quality of the customer in the new niche is so much higher and therefore the mental drain is a lot lower.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

Have no other gods before me, or make graven images<p>There&#x27;s no requirement to obey or sacrifice to God, just not to have false gods.<p>2. Don&#x27;t take the name of the lord in vain<p>Don&#x27;t act pious or pretend you are God&#x27;s representative.<p>3. Respect the Sabbath<p>Don&#x27;t fill life completely with work; *everyone* should do *nothing* for a day.  There&#x27;s NO requirement for religious services.<p>In the historical context when gods and temples seemed to vie for adherents, sacrifices and superiority, it&#x27;s interesting that the (writers of the Hebrew god?) disavowed all that. Considering god as a projection of humans, this seems to inoculate people against religion and taking themselves too seriously.<p>(Needless to say, most of religion overtly violates this interpretation.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="37288901" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37288901" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gregfjohnson</span><span>|</span><a href="#37291270">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37288689">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37288901">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37288901">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have progressed enough in my mediation practice to understand the question, but not far enough to have much to say in the way of answers.  &quot;Apophatic&quot; theology in Catholic circles seems to be related:  One approaches insight into the divine through a process of subtraction or negation, a bit like sculpture.  Remove all that is not true, in order to begin to apprehend the dim outlines of the truth.<p>Similarly, one might approach one&#x27;s own ego consciousness, with its many delusions, as a process of deconstruction.  Teachers of contemplation such as Thomas Merton talk about the &quot;true self&quot; and the &quot;false self&quot;.  Personally, I find the longing for &quot;true self&quot; and the diminution of &quot;false self&quot; to be more helpful than a notion of complete self-annihilation.  To use Catholic terminology, the path toward a fully actualized true self is classically referred to as the Beatific Vision or Divine Union.  These notions are perhaps similar to Enlightenment or Satori.<p>The academic discipline of mathematical statistics also has some resonances here.  One seeks to hone a rigorous freedom from one&#x27;s own expectations, pre-conceived ideas, and agendas.  The goal is to see the truth, delicate as it may be to tease out, and overcome any personal tendency, explicit or implicit, to distort the view based on what we hope to see.</div><br/><div id="37289623" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37289623" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nico</span><span>|</span><a href="#37288901">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37288689">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37289623">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37289623">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Remove all that is not true, in order to begin to apprehend the dim outlines of the truth<p>“ And that is why, in the fundamental approach to the Godhead, both the Hindu and the Buddhist (and, for that matter, the Taoist) take what is called the negative approach, which used to be known long ago in the Middle Ages as Apophatic theology.

Wikipedia [1] is not the best of the sources, but it sums it up nicely:<p>&quot;After joining the RAND Corporation in 1959, Baran took on the task of designing a &quot;survivable&quot; communications system that could maintain communication between end points in the face of damage from nuclear weapons during the Cold War. Then, most American military communications used high-frequency connections, which could be put out of action for many hours by a nuclear attack.<p>[...]<p>After proving survivability, Baran and his team needed to show proof of concept for that design so that it could be built. [...] The result was one of the first store-and-forward data layer switching protocols, a link-state&#x2F;distance vector routing protocol, and an unproved connection-oriented transport protocol. Explicit detail of the designs can be found in the complete series of reports On Distributed Communications, published by RAND in 1964.<p>[...]<p>The Distributed Network that Baran introduced was intended to route around damage.<p>[...]<p>In 1969, when the US Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) started developing the idea of an internetworked set of terminals to share computing resources, the reference materials that they considered included Baran and the RAND Corporation&#x27;s &quot;On Distributed Communications&quot; volumes. The resiliency of a packet-switched network that uses link-state routing protocols, which are used on the Internet, stems in some part from the research to develop a network that could survive a nuclear attack.&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paul_Baran" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paul_Baran</a></div><br/><div id="41110421" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41110421" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dboreham</span><span>|</span><a href="#41109351">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41110932">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41110421">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41110421">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve noticed that the closer I am to historical events, the more wrong reporting of those events tends to be. I have a neighbor who worked at RAND in the 60s and will ask him about this next time we meet.<p>Worth noting perhaps that many (all?) technical innovations are the result of some underlying technology maturing to the point that it can be applied to a problem. In this case, I bet that nobody liked the fragility and brittleness of circuit switched networking, but in order to make a packet switched network you need small fast computers that are cheap enough to deploy as network nodes. These appeared : minicomputers. The first ARPANet nodes were minicomputers running routing software. In fact the Internet used regular computers as routers into near modern history (IBM RISC machines iirc were deployed at the DS3 upgrade). So PSN is the result of a) people sitting around wishing they could have a PSN, and b) the technology to actually realize that becoming practical.

What&#x27;s clear is that in 1964, as packet-switched networks were first being considered, resilience against &quot;attack&quot;, however defined, was a key consideration for one significant set of innovators.  I suspect some of that logic was incorporated into ARPANET&#x27;s eventual design, whether the nominal head designer was aware of this or not.<p>One underappreciated aspect of complex projects is how different goals and intentions may exist simultaneously, and how much active participants even at a high level may not be awarer of this.  A friend had a uni professor who&#x27;d been part of the <i>Glomar Explorer</i> scientific mission which served as a cover for Project Azoran, the clandestine recovery of a Soviet nuclear submarine.  The professor was unaware of the <i>actual</i> mission until well after the mission had concluded, when he read about it in the newspaper.<p>&lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Project_Azorian" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Project_Azorian</a>&gt;<p>I tend to strongly discount personal-experience denials of covert or secondary mission roles by people otherwise connected with an activity (e.g., company employees, contractors, government workers, contractors, etc.).  It&#x27;s not that these are never, or even <i>mostly</i> incorrect.  It&#x27;s simply that for a large enough project, some secondary goal might well exist without the conscious awareness of many of those involved.<p>And again, in the case of Baran, we have the receipts.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41109743" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41109743" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">KineticLensman</span><span>|</span><a href="#41109351">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41110932">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41112945">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41109743">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41109743">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; but I think we can say that it was _designed_ to survive a nuclear strike<p>There is a lot more to the design of &#x27;the internet&#x27; than the selection of a packet switched protocol.

One was that the network would be good for computer science.&quot;&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;But there was also another side to the story, which was that ARPA was a Defense Department agency. And after Eb [Rechtin] came in, defense relevance became the dominant notion. Everybody was writing relevance statements.
&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;So in that environment, I would have been hard pressed to plow a lot of money into the network just to improve the productivity of the researchers. The rationale just wouldn’t have been strong enough. What was strong enough was this idea that packet switching would be more survivable, more robust under damage to the network. If a plane got shot down, or an artillery barrage hit the command center, the messages would still get through. And in a strategic situation—meaning a nuclear attack—the president could still communicate to the missile fields. So I can assure you, to the extent that I was signing the checks, which I was from nineteen sixty-seven on, I was signing them because that was the need I was convinced of.”<p>Waldrop, M. Mitchell.

That is, in the midst of having to deal with a more complicated problem for serial protocol to IP protocol conversion because the original format didn&#x27;t clearly distinguish envelope from data, they compound the problem by mixing levels in the new protocol.<p>For example, writing IPv4 into the standard for a proprietary an Application or Session level protocol even at the same time as our network is banning IPv4 and requiring IPv6, but the protocol is not even defined for IPv6 addresses.  When it should be agnostic to IP level concerns entirely.

It&#x27;s easily the top ten invention of 20th century.<p>It&#x27;s not only Internet, FFT also was created to detect illegal nuclear testing and it&#x27;s included the top ten algorithms of 20th century [1],[2].

The Internet packet switching end to end network precursor and predecessor in France proposed and implemented by Louis Pouzin, famously called the 4th man of the Internet, who coined the word &quot;datagram&quot; the very fundamental concept in packet switching, lost his proposal to other communication technology for France nation wide networks implementation [3].<p>The original inventors of the Internet proposed the idea to AT&amp;T, the US communication behemoth and monopoly at the time laughed at the packet switching idea saying that it will not work and does not make any economic sense. The only reason Internet created and survived is because of the military applications and as any military application the main objective is to maintain and sustain command and control where Internet is more than capable of.  I&#x27;ve once read someone simulated 99% infrastructure demolition (as in nuclear attack) and Internet communication managed to survive intact. Cannot recalled the article now, perhaps this is where ChatGPT becomes handy.  The fact that the US military maintained a separate military network (similar to Internet) from the public Internet after the Internet gone public and its popularity increased, provided the hints why it&#x27;s so important for the US military.<p>[1] Great algorithms are the poetry of computation:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.andrew.cmu.edu&#x2F;course&#x2F;15-355&#x2F;misc&#x2F;Top%20Ten%20Algorithms.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.andrew.cmu.edu&#x2F;course&#x2F;15-355&#x2F;misc&#x2F;Top%20Ten%20Al...</a><p>[2] The Algorithm That Almost Stopped The Development of Nuclear Weapons:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iflscience.com&#x2F;the-algorithm-that-almost-stopped-the-development-of-nuclear-weapons-67750" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iflscience.com&#x2F;the-algorithm-that-almost-stopped...</a><p>[3]Louis Pouzin:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Louis_Pouzin" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Louis_Pouzin</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41109612" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41109612" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">euroderf</span><span>|</span><a href="#41109351">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41115852">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41109737">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41109612">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41109612">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">AUTODIN preceded it, but ARPANET won out over AUTODIN II.</div><br/><div id="41113431" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41113431" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">esafak</span><span>|</span><a href="#41109351">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41109612">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41109765">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41113431">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41113431">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The first time I heard of it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Automatic_Digital_Network" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Automatic_Digital_Network</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41109737" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41109737" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">user3939382</span><span>|</span><a href="#41109351">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41109612">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41116229">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41109737">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41109737">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Packet switching was invented by an American and Brit independently IIRC.</div><br/><div id="41109808" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41109808" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mrighele</span><span>|</span><a href="#41109351">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41109737">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41110449">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41109808">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41109808">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, the linked article talks also about Donald Davies, which influenced more directly Arpanet.<p>But the point about Paul Baran is that for him packed switching was a way to make communications more resilient in face of nuclear bombing (and other things) and he had at least some influence on the birth of the Internet, so if you ask me &quot;what is the relation between the Internet and a nuclear strike&quot; my first answer is &quot;Paul Baran&quot;</div><br/><div id="41111918" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41111918" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throw0101a</span><span>|</span><a href="#41109351">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41109808">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41110449">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41111918">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41111918">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>But the point about Paul Baran is that for him packed switching was a way to make communications more resilient in face of nuclear bombing (and other things) and he had at least some influence on the birth of the Internet</i> […]<p>From chapter two of <i>Wizards</i>:<p>&gt; <i>Roberts also learned from Scantlebury, for the first time, of the work that had been done by Paul Baran at RAND a few years earlier.

The internet is very much part of this story, and I am asked about this controversy from time to time. The problem is, I find that people who argue for both positions are becoming much too fixated on the idea that there was some single set of influences on a complex project. There isn&#x27;t really any answer to &quot;was the internet designed to withstand nuclear war&quot; for the same reason that there isn&#x27;t really any single answer to any question about the historical motivations of complex undertakings. That&#x27;s just not how history works.<p>There are some facts which we know to be true:<p>1) Various components of the defense complex were actively researching survivable C2 communications, particularly beginning in the 1950s although there were earlier precedents. Many of these efforts involved ideas that were similar to those used in modern computer networking, and they sometimes culminated in built systems with meaningful similarities to the internet, like AUTODIN.<p>2) A diverse cast of academics, contractors, and government entities were involved in these projects. Sometimes the same people worked on multiple projects. Even when they didn&#x27;t, there were often communications between these entities, but sometimes, due to security concerns, there wasn&#x27;t. Much of this communication was informal, so in retrospect it is hard to tell who knew what. There can be surprises both directions.<p>3) Communications technologies often emerge naturally from innovations in other fields, technical advances, etc., so while many similar communications technologies have a shared intellectual heritage, it is also not that unusual for totally independent efforts to arrive at roughly the same point. Radio is a classic example.<p>I think that, in consideration of these facts, we can reach two conclusions:<p>A) It seems likely that some of the people involved in ARPANET were familiar with survivable C2 research and applied those ideas to their efforts. After all, lots of people and lots of organizations worked on these programs, and some of the research was widely distributed within the defense-industrial-academic complex during the &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s.<p>B) It also seems likely that ARPANET independently arrived at similar endpoints. After all, it had some similar constraints and objectives, and its creators were working with mostly the same underlying technology.<p>These two do not contradict each other. In fact, I think it is by far most likely that both are true in the cases of different individual people and different individual aspects of the design. That&#x27;s just how these things are.<p>Before considering The Internet specifically, let&#x27;s consider a couple of similar situations in the development of technology:<p>1) People sometimes do a great deal of hand-wringing over the assignment of labels like &quot;the first programmable computer.&quot; I have always been very wary of giving these sorts of titles without a fair number of weasel words. Consider, for example, the ENIAC, usually called the &quot;first programmable computer.&quot; And yet, there is a compelling argument that a number of the substantial design elements of ENIAC, including its programmability, are derived from work done for an earlier codebreaking machine called Colossus. This connection remained unknown for many years because of the secrecy surrounding Colossus... a level of secrecy that means that, while a number of people who worked on Colossus and later worked on ENIAC almost certainly carried over ideas, they wouldn&#x27;t have admitted to having done so as Colossus was officially unknown to the ENIAC project. The particular climate of wartime and military technological development means that ideas often move around in subtle ways, and knowledge of where an idea came from is intentionally obscured. The history of military technology can be a very difficult field for this reason.<p>2) Almost at the opposite ends of the spectrum, information often flows very freely in academic and industrial laboratory environments, and so ideas spread without clear documentation. I am reminded of a piece I wrote years ago, on the fact that several early internet protocols use a similar set of three-digit status codes in similar ways (HTTP, for example). Oddly enough, these pseudo-standard status codes appear almost simultaneously in RJE and FTP, but neither mentions the other. Over time I have been lucky enough to get in touch with several of the authors of both RFCs, and while none of them can recall the origin of the codes, they agree with my general theory: the two separate groups, both at MIT, had just shared notes during the development of the protocols and one of them informally adopted the status code scheme from the other. People talk to each other, and ideas often move between projects without formal documentation.<p>So, with those two examples of subtle cross-project influence in mind, can we say anything suggestive about ARPANET? Well, there are certain suggestive details. For example, by the time ARPANET&#x27;s first IMPs were built, at least one researcher (Howard Frank) was engaged in ARPANET research who had previously consulted on survivable C2 networks. But the ARPANET project had already set certain design details like packet-switching by that point... which raises the question of if packet-switching is even the important part. Howard Frank wasn&#x27;t working on packet switching itself, he was working on performance and reliability modeling of topologies for packet switching, an area where military C2 research was probably generally ahead of ARPANET research at that time. So, if we take the face-value assumption that aspects of ARPANET topology research were probably based on survivable C2 research, does that mean that ARPANET was &quot;created to survive a nuclear strike?&quot; Or did it merely end up that way? It ends up coming down to splitting hairs about what &quot;created&quot; means, an exercise that sort of ignores the fact that technological developments always combine established ideas and new ones.<p>ARPANET was not built for military C2. It was used for military C2 later on, but during the early days of ARPANET the military had more wide-area networking initiatives than you could shake a stick at and ARPANET was not one of the ones contracted for C2 purposes.<p>Was ARPANET designed for nuclear survivability? The most obvious answer is &quot;no,&quot; because the early topology of ARPANET lacked the level of redundancy in its topology that actual survivable networks of the era had. But, this seems to have been more a consequence of funding and resource availability than intentions, because ARPANET researchers had done plenty of work on performance and reliability, using basically the same methods as used for survivable networks.<p>So maybe, at the end of the day, the &quot;best&quot; answer to this is sort of a boring one: meh. Nuclear survivability was obviously not a goal of ARPANET because ARPANET did not build out a survivable network. That said, ARPANET incorporated most of the technical ideas from survivable networks of the era. It is a virtual certainty that ARPANET got some of those ideas from earlier and simultaneous research into survivable networks, but it is also a virtual certainty that ARPANET arrived at some of them  independently. If you consider &quot;packet switching&quot; to be the main technical advancement of ARPANET, it&#x27;s probably not an idea that ARPANET got from survivable C2 research, because the historical record looks pretty confident that multiple people independently arrived at packet switching. That ought not to be surprising to anyone, because packet switching is a fairly direct evolution of practices established in radio and telegraph networks almost fifty years before. But, I also think it&#x27;s an unnecessarily restrictive view of ARPANET&#x27;s technical contributions, and other aspects of ARPANET like routing policy were definitely influenced by survivable communications research and, to some extent, directly based on survivability work.<p>What all this means about why ARPANET was &quot;created&quot; or what it was &quot;designed&quot; for is strictly a matter of how you interpret those words. Yes, articles and books and etc. should not repeat the claim that &quot;the Internet was created to survive a nuclear strike,&quot; because the truth and falsity of that statement requires a lengthy and nuanced explanation. When we express history as simple facts we should try to stick to the ones that are, like, 90% true, instead of like 50% true. But &quot;facts&quot; about history are rarely 100% true, we&#x27;re just not that lucky. It all happened a long time ago, there were a lot of people involved, different people were doing different things, it&#x27;s a tangled mess of motivations and influences. That&#x27;s why we study it.<p>Thanks for coming to my TED talk.<p>Postscript: Also, packet-switching is not at all intrinsic to survivable networks, although certainly survivability lead to a lot of advancements in packet-switching. But there were also a lot of circuit-switched survivable networks, and for a good span of the Cold War, I would say that circuit-switching outnumbered packet-switching for hardened C2. You&#x27;ll notice that AT&amp;T, the military&#x27;s #1 choice for hardened communications, was firmly not on the packet switching side of things. But the military also contracted C2 projects to Western Union, who were basically arriving at modern packet switching by their own route (automated telegraph routing). This schism, between packet-switching and circuit-switching, remains a critical part of the data communications story today.</div><br/><div id="41116307" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41116307" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">walrus01</span><span>|</span><a href="#41114506">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41114883">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41116307">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41116307">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a good amount of info for people who are not familiar with the subject. To illustrate just one part of the pre-ARPANET hardened communications networks, I&#x27;ll focus on a few typical usage scenarios.<p>The DOD for the most part did not build their own domestic communications networks spanning multiple states and across the country. A lot of it was carried by the AT&amp;T Long Lines network, which had a mix of barely-hardened, not hardened, and some extremely hardened sites (L4 coaxial, project offices, etc).<p>If one finds, for instance, the location of all of the SAGE direction centers and all of the telecommunications links that fed the remote radar sites&#x27; data to the SAGE direction centers, you&#x27;ll also find a ton of AT&amp;T Long Lines mountain top, hilltop sites, mixed in with the ordinary central offices located in mid sized to large sized cities.<p>In other places in the world the US DOD built its own bespoke communications networks for very specific command and control purposes. At one point in time there was a massive troposcatter network spanning nearly the entire Mediterranean sea, with important radar sites in Italy, Cyprus, linked to air bases and the DOD&#x27;s backbone communications links from europe to the USA.<p>Similar massive troposcatter data links were built through the Aleutian islands.<p>Most of these were replaced by C-band geostationary satellite by the mid 1970s as that became a higher performance and more viable technology than the extremely massive, power hungry and expensive to maintain troposcatter stuff.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41114883" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41114883" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">justsomehnguy</span><span>|</span><a href="#41114506">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41116307">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41110405">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41114883">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41114883">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">TL; DR: osmosis<p>Thanks, JB!</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41110405" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41110405" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">palisade</span><span>|</span><a href="#41114506">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41109625">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41110405">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41110405">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Found it!!!

And a few years earlier he had even fallen under the spell of Licklider himself when he attended Lick’s lectures on interactive computing.</i><p>&gt; <i>Taylor gave his boss a quick briefing: IPTO contractors, most of whom were at research universities, were beginning to request more and more computer resources. Every principal investigator, it seemed, wanted his own computer. Not only was there an obvious duplication of effort across the research community, but it was getting damned expensive. Computers weren’t small and they weren’t cheap. Why not try tying them all together? By building a system of electronic links between machines, researchers doing similar work in different parts of the country could share resources and results more easily. Instead of spreading a half dozen expensive mainframes across the country devoted to supporting advanced graphics research, ARPA could concentrate resources in one or two places and build a way for everyone to get at them. One university might concentrate on one thing, another research center could be funded to concentrate on something else, but regardless of where you were physically located, you would have access to it all. He suggested that ARPA fund a small test network, starting with, say, four nodes and building up to a dozen or so.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;281818.Where_Wizards_Stay_Up_Late" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;281818.Where_Wizards_Sta...</a><p>Also:<p>&gt; <i>Licklider described how he had re-envisioned command and control research as research into interactive computing as follows:[5]</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Information_Processing_Techniques_Office" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Information_Processing_Techniq...</a><p>From chapter two of <i>Wizards</i>:<p>&gt; <i>Roberts also learned from Scantlebury, for the first time, of the work that had been done by Paul Baran at RAND a few years earlier.

Roberts was designing this experimental network not with survivable communications as his main—or even secondary—concern.

Previous networks like AT&amp;T&#x27;s telephone system were circuit-switched: the configuration of the network, and route between source and destination, is an inherent property of the <i>network</i>, and once a connection is established it can&#x27;t be easily reconfigured.  Packet-switching makes the source and destination a property of the <i>message</i>, and then the network is responsible for figuring out a route from source to destination.  Notably, because all information needed to specify the destination is included in the message, it can be retried or take a totally different route.<p>Most things have multiple causes, and the Internet is definitely one of them.  The scalability and distribution properties were certainly one of them: a centralized system like the telephone network cannot scale to new uses and many new endpoints the way a distributed system like the Internet can.  According to Kleinrock, the need for management to keep an eye on all the research they were funding was apparently another one of them.  But given that it was funded by DARPA, the resilience of a packet-switched network to scenarios where individual circuits might go down was probably a major reason for the interest in this technology.  It doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be a nuclear strike, but there were a number of scenarios of interest to RAND and DARPA that could involve a portion of the nation&#x27;s communication network being disabled and still needing to get messages through.<p>This is also a good lesson to designers of future networks and computing systems.  The end-to-end principle remains as valuable to system designers today as it did in the 1960s.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41109231" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41109231" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hypeatei</span><span>|</span><a href="#41109625">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41109407">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41109231">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41109231">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Probably not.

On a tactical level this typically involves things like radio relays on hilltops, tropospheric shots, and various line of sight technologies.  On the strategic level it involves having multiple routes through the internet over different kinds of physical media moving in different geographic directions.<p>You don&#x27;t see this as much in the commercial world, because sending network traffic through less efficient routes is slow and costly, so redundancies are only an emergency fallback.  From a military perspective the network will go down at any moment, so slow and expensive are still favorable to disconnection.  As a result the military will eagerly employ many layers of many redundant options.

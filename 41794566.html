You need to focus on the things you can control and one of the things you can&#x27;t control is what someone else is going to care about.<p>So if you want something done and someone else has to agree, you have to figure out how the thing you want coincides somehow with their interests and concerns.<p>Then you explain the thing you want to them in terms of how it advances&#x2F;affects the interests and concerns of the other person. So in the framing of TFA, product are never ever ever under any circumstances going to give a shit about your architecture proposal (because that is entirely in the domain of your concerns). But they may care about how the architecture is going to prevent them from delivering features that are on the roadmap coming up and how you have a solution that can fix that for example (because now you are in the domain of their concerns).  Notice this is not just &quot;your architecture proposal&quot;, it is <i>how your architecture proposal is going to get them what they want</i>, and if you want to do this you need to think deeply and make sure you really understand what they want, not just what you want.<p>You&#x27;re not trying to change their mind.

Corporate <i>should</i> focus (among other things) on reducing COGS, product again <i>should</i> focus on delivering customer facing features.<p>The problem are timelines. We all know what technical debt is. You can cut corners and rush a feature out, however at the expense of future velocity. When engineering and product collide, engineering triangle forms and compromise has to be made. The classic triangle is defined as quality -- speed -- cost, however that is more applicable externally. Internally the compromise triangle looks more like &quot;fixing bugs -- delivering features -- maintaining future level of bugs&quot;. The more the triangle is stretched towards &quot;delivering features&quot; the more maintenance suffers.<p>I have seen this coming from engineering far to often. Oh no, product are idiots, they do not understand importance of bug fixing, cleaning of technical debt and maintaining architecture. Believe me, they are roughly as smart as you, you are in the same broad team anyway. Where product fail is at estimation. They lack domain expertise to correctly gauge the impact of rushing a feature on future velocity. They probably understand this relationship, but they cannot quantify the effects. This is where engineering comes: to provide domain expertise.<p>As TFA correctly implies, product does not give a shit about architectural decisions. For all they care it can be held by either literal or metaphorical duck tape. It&#x27;s the job of engineering to <i>quantify</i> the cost of rushed features. If engineering thinks that product are idiots for rushing n features, then either 1) engineering fails at understanding business goals or 2) engineering fails to convey impact of rushed features.<p>Both are <i>communication</i> problems.

Sorry, that breaks basic management principles.<p>&gt; I used to do that until I had a manager that changed my view.<p>Small, young teams (e.g. startups) can easily do without management, because communication is unhindered and ad-hoc. The more organization expands and matures, the more communication suffers. That&#x27;s the primary goal of engineering management - facilitate conversations. When I have a request that is tad too technical I always try to backtrack and ask what&#x27;s the business goal. I am 99% certain &quot;display memory usage per tab&quot; is not the business goal. &quot;Find resource hungry tabs&quot; sounds like a good candidate for a business problem.<p>&quot;Customers&quot; (e.g. product) tend to be &quot;helpful&quot; and provide technical implementation details, diluting the business problem, while engineering tend to fixate on those implementation hints as if they were technical requirements. Ever noticed how technically inept product managers&#x2F;owners sometimes tend to be <i>good</i> managers? Well, they are either aware of their technical ineptitude or are inept so much that they can&#x27;t even express technical details and form their requirements as business questions which leaves implementation details open and allows engineering to implement things &quot;correctly&quot;.

It helps if job mobility&#x2F;demand is high so that when the &quot;product&quot; decisions tank the company&#x2F;product, you just shrug and move on. That&#x27;s what the plumber would do. In fact, if your customer does the stupid thing, and ends up having to have you come back to pay even more money, hoorah, more money. It&#x27;s a reverse incentive. Do it enough, and you&#x27;ll be just like Boeing and the US Government. I&#x27;ve also observed that this type of relationship tends to cause people to optimize short term over mid to long term.<p>Where this deteriorates (imo), is if you&#x27;re in it for additional reasons other than only the money, but want to build quality things, make the world a better place, yada yada. Or perhaps you like the company and what they do, or something about your job, and actually depend on long term viability. By somewhat strained analogy, imagine the plumber works for a housing co op, and they themselves live there. Suddenly, the plumber becomes a bit more coupled to the choices of &quot;product&quot; or the customers.

Refusing to add a bathroom to a customers house because there are engineering concerns or thinking you are better at spotting customer needs than product is the opposite of that in my opinion. Of course the flip-side or this is that you need an organisation which will accept it when engineering points out that adding a bathroom will be widely expensive because the foundation needs to be reinforced, or maybe the entire house needs to be rebuild. Without that you end up with Boeing.<p>I do think that thinking you know better is unfortunately one of the pitfalls of our profession because we’re so used to working with patterns, but often engineering won’t even be told the full picture. I find it to often be a humongous waste of time if engineering has to be taught why something is actually necessary before they can get on board with it. This is not me saying that forcing engineers to do something they think is a bad idea is the right way to do things. This is me saying that I prefer engineering departments which are cultivated towards delivering value, and not being obstacles you need to “convince”.

If the PM doesn’t care, that’s a failing on their part. It’s their job to understand what’s possible within given timeframes and it’s your job as an engineer to explain that.<p>If a feature requires major architectural work to achieve, then make clear what that is in terms they can understand. “We need to migrate 30m records affecting 20,000 customers to this new system with 0 downtime” is understandable to most people in tech. It can also help focus minds on what we could change to make progress on or just validate a goal before fully committing.<p>For context, no plumber I know would talk shit about “platinum packages,” they’d just explain what the cause is and what’s making the correct fix so expensive.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41795653" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41795653" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anonzzzies</span><span>|</span><a href="#41795904">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41795089">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41795653">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41795653">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The plumber example is quite good, but I prefer the modern car mechanic that connects a computer to a car and reads out things usually even they don&#x27;t understand which <i>have</i> to be fixed and no one can explain anything but &#x27;engine bad&#x27;.<p>Most of the Product people I work with and have worked with collapse easily under technical arguments, but most engineers I work with barely know what they are doing. Only yesterday I (external consultant) asked the tech lead to scp a file from a to b during a workshop zoom where I showed them how to use some new tools and, while he always <i>talked</i> in front of the cto and head product about ssh and scp and his linux chops, he had no clue; he started to download gui tools (windows) and after he was done he still couldn&#x27;t. I ended up copying the f&#x27;ing file to chat (I have no access to their internal systems). This is the guy they trust with core products dev that runs the company.<p>He gets away with it because he talks in difficult tech bla to the cto and product (both MBAs); he keeps using terms from kubernetes (they don&#x27;t use kubernetes and the guy cannot use docker) and &#x27;things he did in the past&#x27; at &#x27;much larger companies&#x27; and you can see Product go to his happy place during calls. In the end he lets tech do whatever they want as he understands nothing and gets so much tech babble that he cannot even figure out what to ask.<p>We (small company fixing emergency tech stuff; for this client, it turns out that the emergency is basically their tech department; it&#x27;s staffed with 100% incompetent people who are decades out of date) hop around a lot and this is very very common; on HN we read about flowers and fairy tales of covering tests, 10x programmers, migrations, kubernetes&#x2F;containers, git, security etc; in reality however people are sending zip files with dates in them, updating the prod db manually and copy pasting files in whatsapp because they don&#x27;t understand ssh works (what even IS there to understand ...) and tests?

They milked customers mercilessly and refused to fix even major bugs – as an example, we had an app which generated a report table like this (I forget the exact syntax):<p><pre><code>    &lt;cfloop query as row&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;cfloop row as col&gt;

They had a bug using a shared pointer internally so that would print the first row over and over for the number of rows. We reported this.

I looked at it and quickly found the problem: none of the developers knew SQL well enough to know how to filter a  JOIN, so they had multiple nested ASP loops which were retrieving hundreds of millions of rows, using an if statement to decide which ones matched the active filters, and then did more queries in the inner loop.

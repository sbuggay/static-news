While there is an underlying linear value to the color spectrum in the wavelength, you don&#x27;t really talk about red being &quot;more&quot; of a color than blue just because it has longer wavelength. Instead, we talk about combining, and sometimes mixing, colors. The article author argue that the autism spectrum is like that; it&#x27;s made up of individual traits that make a whole. As I understand it, diagnosis is in part looking at the number of those traits that a person exhibit.

Honestly I see men getting into stuff like looksmaxxing stuff because they&#x27;re convinced of stuff like their perceived &quot;creepiness&quot; being a result of them being ugly (evidence would support that ugly people are seen as more creepy), and at least something like plastic surgery offers them an evidence-based method to reduce perceived creepiness - which is something the medical system DOES NOT COMPETENTLY OFFER despite the medical system also telling them that they have social deficits.

Yet when I look at the actual research, I see children going from being clinically diagnosable with a disorder to sub-clinical all the time in followup studies.  Yet all we really care about is getting MORE people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, as in, it should be our goal to have MORE people labelled as being impaired instead of LESS people because we did such a good job resolving their impairments and making them independent that they no longer had any significant difficulties or need for support or a &quot;disorder&quot; label anymore.

When is the last time mental health outcomes improved in a way which could not simply be the result of reporting differences?<p>I would say the last time was around the year 2000, when suicide and drug addiction were at all time lows.  Every single chance since then, on aggregate, has been useless and the entire field of mental health has completely failed to produce any evidence it has advance an inch this millennium which is absolutely fucking scandalous.  I don&#x27;t know how much oncology improved in the same period of time.  Also if you include reported mental health data, people report WORSE mental health now than they did in the past.<p>Given that, I see pretty much zero reason why the status quo today does a lick to improve people mental health better than the status quo back then.  I am just dead stupidly sceptical of diagnosis (at least beyond 2000&#x2F;DSM-IV levels) as being a source of mental health because not only is it not proven people don&#x27;t even attempt to prove this.<p>When the DSM-V was released, the director of the NIMH started the RDOC for research which was nominally supposed to do studies based less on categories like &quot;autism&quot; and more on underlying biological phenomenon, trashed the idea of symptom based diagnosis pointing out it has largely been depreciated elsewhere in medicine, and suggested we might have to get rid of the words schizophrenia and depression because they were confusing things.  I think about such things occasionally and wonder if the entire diagnostic nosology we have is basically a fatally flawed system.<p>So my essential objection is, why medicalise people&#x27;s identities if there&#x27;s no evidence it&#x27;s improving people&#x27;s outcomes?</div><br/><div id="40630405" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40630405" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">johnny22</span><span>|</span><a href="#40625190">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40628554">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40629956">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40630405">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40630405">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; So my essential objection is, why medicalise people&#x27;s identities if there&#x27;s no evidence it&#x27;s improving people&#x27;s outcomes?<p>20 years in a time of massive social changes?

This makes people angry in the general sense, but the truth is that there are jobs that require certain abilities to perform. If someone was, for example, confined to a wheelchair then they would not be considered for a job loading trucks. That&#x27;s &quot;discrimination&quot; in the general sense of the word, but it&#x27;s certainly not bigotry.<p>I think you&#x27;ve either misunderstood what I was saying, or you&#x27;re upset that the world isn&#x27;t as idealistic as you want. The reality is that if a condition prevents someone from doing a job and it can&#x27;t be reasonably accommodated, the employer isn&#x27;t forced to keep paying that person and ignore their inability to do the job.<p>Having ADHD is a hurdle, but not something that prevents most people from doing jobs. It makes them more difficult, yes, but not impossible. If the condition is so bad that it becomes <i>disabling</i> (legal definition) then that&#x27;s a different story, but again you&#x27;re not required to employ people who have disabilities that prevent them from doing the job.</div><br/><div id="40627766" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40627766" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eikenberry</span><span>|</span><a href="#40625190">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40626650">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40626297">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40627766">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40627766">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The analogy to race was due to DEI training at work.

Everyone is not &quot;on the spectrum&quot; for autism, again by definition no one that is schizophrenic is &quot;on the spectrum&quot; for autism at all so your comment is nonsensical.</div><br/><div id="40627512" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40627512" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">magicalist</span><span>|</span><a href="#40625190">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40626180">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40626781">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40627512">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40627512">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>not said to be either autistic or schizophrenic (you can&#x27;t be both at the same time</i><p>I&#x27;ve never heard this before and a quick search can&#x27;t find any evidence of it.<p>The &quot;over-connected&quot; suggestion did pull up studies like this[1], but that&#x27;s one effect of one set of genes sometimes associated with autism, and, of course, it was in mice.<p>I&#x27;d definitely like to learn more, but at first impression, a spectrum with autism and schizophrenia at opposite ends seems way too simple a model for human brains.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medicine.wustl.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;in-autism-too-many-brain-connections-may-be-at-root-of-condition&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medicine.wustl.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;in-autism-too-many-brain-con...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40626781" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40626781" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">parineum</span><span>|</span><a href="#40625190">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40626180">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40627512">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40627585">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40626781">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40626781">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;ve really only redefined the spectrum.

People label themselves as something and believe anything thst doesnt fit the label is not them, out of reach, a monumental step for them to do. Talking to a cashier all of a sudden isnt just muttering some words, its a foundational shift from being introverted to extroverted.<p>I think all of modern psychology&#x2F;psychaitry suffers in this way: Making up categorizations with the belief that making things easier to conceptualize and making it easier to associate things is scientific and valuable insight. I think its the opposite.

By being conscious of exactly how you are doing this, you can also begin to explore and accept the parts of yourself that don&#x27;t fit into those buckets (what Carl Jung calls the shadow).<p>The &quot;buckets&quot; themselves (archetypes) are simply explaining different aspects of human experience and personalities, but absolutely nobody fits into them neatly, and they are limitless- you could probably come up with hundreds of them if you wanted to. Which you think are important and worth talking about is really a matter of opinion or personal values and goals.<p>These ideas are widely misunderstood and misused in both popular culture <i>and</i> the social sciences, but that isn&#x27;t the fault of the concepts themselves. For example, the categories in the popular MyersâBriggs Type Indicator (MBTI) are from Carl Jung&#x27;s archetypes, but people use them exactly like you said- to essentially justify their own behaviors, when the point is to explore the parts of yourself that are the opposite of that. This idea often horrifies people that are fans of MBTI and use it like you are implying.<p>I&#x27;m sure you would agree that people already have different personalities, and see themselves a certain way, and often dislike traits in themselves and others that are somewhat opposite traits to those. For example a person might see themselves as an analytical logical person, and look down on people who seem to be guided mostly by emotions. It can be hugely valuable for a person like this to start to understand and accept the emotional part of themselves and others, but that likely won&#x27;t change the fact that they are still a person that prioritizes &quot;thinking&quot; over &quot;feeling.&quot;<p>People often mistakenly call this Carl Jung stuff &quot;pseudoscience&quot; because they are misunderstanding it as trying to be science. It is not- it is a tool or technology for personal growth, and is not attempting to be a literal explanation for how the human brain works or anything like that. It would be more accurate to relate it to religious or spiritual practices like meditation.<p>The fact is that introverted people are quite rare compared to extroverted people, and extroverted people do tend to see it as a bad thing and want to do things like &quot;help teach introverts to be less extroverted&quot; but may be horrified by the idea of the opposite- learning about and accepting their own introverted aspects.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40627507" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40627507" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mattgreenrocks</span><span>|</span><a href="#40625190">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40625829">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40625874">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40628909">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40627507">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40627507">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I want to check that Iâm parsing this correctly.<p>Caring about something beyond a typical amount for intrinsic reasons is a neurodivergent marker?<p>Is this really the HN I grew up with?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40628909" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40628909" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shrimp_emoji</span><span>|</span><a href="#40625190">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40625829">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40625309">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40628909">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40628909">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">MBAs wanna justify less staff so everyone has to be good at and do more things now. :D Be a dev <i>and</i> tech support <i>and</i> business relations <i>and</i>...</div><br/></div></div><div id="40625309" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40625309" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacobolus</span><span>|</span><a href="#40625190">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40628909">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40625895">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40625309">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40625309">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Performer who is a diva&quot; is not directly about focusing on one thing at the expense of another.

Always try to be kind and maintain some humility, but assuming you aren&#x27;t sure what that really means, then ask for lots of feedback. Or you can just find someone you trust and delegate all of this to them, like a technical founder hiring a CEO.<p>(Edit: relatedly, if you work <i>for or with</i> weird nerds in a support role, my advice is to take full advantage!

If too many of the participants are corrupt or incompetent then the social network of the organisation can become especially toxic. But thatâs a different problem to the fact that if you want to contribute value in such a system, you need to have social skills.<p>Can you get value out of somebody who has terrible social skills? Maybe sometimes, but it takes a lot of babysitting. Even then, youâll never be able to properly trust that youâll be able to rely on them to do anything ever.

But the people who work on E-beam lithography or vaccines against addiction didn&#x27;t do so well. Both of those would have been huge if they worked well. You can&#x27;t tell in advance. If you could, the problem didn&#x27;t need research.<p>A more useful way to look at this is that doing it and selling it are different skills. This is why companies have separate R&amp;D, production, and marketing departments. If you face a hard problem in one of those areas, you can&#x27;t devote enough time to the others. This is to some extent a time management and division of labor problem.<p>Academia is not team-oriented in that sense. At least below the principal investigator level. Once reaching that level, university PR departments are happy to hype any modest advance into a major breakthrough. Below that level, it&#x27;s a cold world. Academia seems to have built itself a dysfunctional world - a huge bureaucracy, not much of a career path for real researchers, and a shrinking pool of full professorships.

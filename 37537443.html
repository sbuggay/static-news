Toxic work environment or the belief that the work environment is toxic. Work is only an edge case here too, we are afraid to be wrong in all environments. (I say &quot;we&quot;, but of course some are more afraid than others.)<p>And I believe that showing a scared person the merits of not being scared and experimenting might motivate them temporarily and most likely get them to agree... but it will not stick. Because fear is a very powerful impulse that has roots that can go very deep and wont&#x27;t just stand up and move to a little more nutricous soil. People have very, very good reasons to feel fear that are rooted in their past and they are most often irrefutable. What is refutable is that these reasons no longer exist or that one might now have other skills to deal with them.<p>Sadly this is an individual issue and the method for fixing it is case by case.<p>Similarly - this works the same way for confidence. Knowing that the benefits of being confident outweight the cons will not make you confident.<p>They can provide motivation though.<p>Source - only my personal experiences. Fear leaves me only if I feel safe or if I expend a great deal of effort to supress it temporarily. The latter of which is courage and willpower and both are not infinite.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37540870" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37540870" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mmmpetrichor</span><span>|</span><a href="#37538619">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37538089">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37540870">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37540870">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Look both ways before crossing the street.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37538089" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37538089" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aurornis</span><span>|</span><a href="#37540870">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37538325">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37538089">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37538089">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is a kernel of truth to this argument: There must be some allowance for being wrong some of the time for a team to really thrive. If one wrong move results in outsize penalties to your reputation, your performance review, or your compensation then everyone is going to avoid taking any risks. It becomes safest to do nothing at all and adhere closely to the status quo, because you can’t be wrong if you avoid making any calls on your own.<p>However, this article takes this concept a little far, in my opinion. There must be some room for being wrong after making a good faith effort and doing proper research, but we have to be honest that being wrong on important outcomes will never be perfectly free of consequences even in the most idealistic workplaces. If you’re wrong as often as you’re right, people will notice. People take account of how often others are rigit and wrong and will factor that into judgments. It’s only natural.<p>In a healthy workplace, making the right call most of the time should open up room for being wrong occasionally. Nobody is perfect! If a company is handing out outsize penalties, explicit or otherwise, for single incidences of being wrong then that’s toxic and bad.<p>However, I’ve worked with people who are so unafraid of being wrong that they can’t be trusted. They’ll take on projects they know they’re not qualified to do because they don’t mind failure. They’ll answer questions they aren’t qualified to answer because they’re not afraid of leading someone astray. They’ll pull the trigger on high stakes issues quickly because they’re more concerned about doing something than doing the right thing. Everyone around them learns this quickly and adapts around it. It becomes an obstacle to promotion, as it should in a company that chooses leaders who can be trusted.<p>It’s a balance.<p>This article makes a mistake I see from a lot of casual advice writers, which is to first construct a hypothetically ideal workplace and then explain how to operate within their ideal workplace:<p>&gt; In my posts, especially when providing advice, I will assume you work in a healthy workplace environment. If you work in a psychologically unsafe environment, none of this even matters - if possible, and safe, search for a different job.<p>This advice tends to feel good because it always describes a perfectly safe, secure workplace that caters to the employee (the reader) with little or no regard to anything else like their coworkers, the company, or the bottom line. In the real world, it’s never that simple. It’s easy to say “quit your job” to anyone who doesn’t see this ideologically perfect scenario in their own workplace, but the reality is that people need to learn how to operate within the realities of an imperfect, real workplace.<p>Definitely search for better jobs if you’re at a toxic company! However, don’t expect any company to live up to some of the lofty ideologically pure scenarios that get described in advice columns. In the real world, you’re going to have to weigh the risks and consequences of being wrong and adapt as you learn more about how the company and your peers react. Behave accordingly and operate with a feedback loop, but watch out for irrational paranoia about being wrong.</div><br/><div id="37538384" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37538384" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">brailsafe</span><span>|</span><a href="#37538089">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37538243">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37538384">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37538384">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Seems like not being trusted is the only consequence to being wrong, but otherwise whatever system is in-place is designed to reward people who try and do things they&#x27;re confident in approaching, but not necessarily sure of or measured to be good at, and that&#x27;s a very common theme in management in every bureaucratic structure I&#x27;ve seen. It&#x27;s not particularly relevant what choices they made or whether they&#x27;re good or bad or have residual effects if they were either the only one who stepped up to try it or they were selected arbitrarily. It&#x27;s the system that enables balancing effects or risk, not individual components.<p>No manager I&#x27;ve ever had has been good with people, their job has never been to be good with people, and there are rarely any consequences that have anything to do with that, other than perhaps high turnover and lots of complaints, but that only happens when there are other options for subordinates and a valid place to complain to, which also never exists.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37538243" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37538243" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shelika</span><span>|</span><a href="#37538089">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37538384">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37538325">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37538243">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37538243">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think my intent is less different from what you stated on how it comes across.<p>Especially this bit &quot;I’ve worked with people who are so unafraid of being wrong that they can’t be trusted.&quot;.

It results in some tired days, which in turn has resulted in some problems with consuming too much caffeine. But it&#x27;s largely better for my mental health, I think, to simply get up and find some way to occupy myself until I actually feel tired. The alternative, trying to force myself to sleep when I don&#x27;t feel tired, with mounting anxiety about getting too little sleep, simply doesn&#x27;t have any upside.<p>Evolutionarily, insomnia makes sense in the context of a tribe, where it&#x27;s useful to have people up and about, watching for danger. But in the modern day with synchronized workplaces, we&#x27;ve seemingly decided that not waking up early verges on a moral failing. &quot;Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise,&quot; is just the beginning. Showing up late to work is looked down upon, but staying at work late is underappreciated, in my experience. Being on the east coast is a surprising benefit when working with West Coast clients because it creates the impression that I&#x27;m getting more done simply because of time zones. There&#x27;s something deeply ingrained in US culture going on here that I&#x27;m not sure I understand the full extent of.</div><br/><div id="41598249" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41598249" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Loughla</span><span>|</span><a href="#41598024">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41599286">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41598249">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41598249">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I learned early not to fight my insomnia. I was always more tired if I tried to sleep instead of doing something else.<p>What works for me is reading low stakes fiction. Smutty fairy fantasy novels and things like that. They require zero real thought, and are relaxing enough to not stress my mind. Combine that with a massive bean bag chair full of latex rounds instead of regular stuffing.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference at my employer from your experience. The people who stay late (but also come in late) are promoted, whereas the early risers like myself are chastised for leaving early.<p>I&#x27;m still tired seasonally when the insomnia really flares up, but I&#x27;m not the walking dead anymore. And no psychotic breaks for a decade.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41599286" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41599286" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Barrin92</span><span>|</span><a href="#41598024">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41599286">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41599286">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Most nights, I woke between 2am and 4am, tossed and turned for an hour<p>It&#x27;s interesting that today this is very quickly framed as pathological, but in a lot of cultures biphasic sleep actually used to be common. A lot of preindustrial English language literature for example makes explicit references to &quot;two sleeps&quot;. Many people used to sleep from around 9-11 pm, then engaged in various activities for one or two hours and continued to sleep. It kind of blew my mind when I heard about it the first time because of how completely this seems to have vanished, not just the practice itself but also discussion about it.<p>I think for people stressing a lot about sleep it&#x27;s probably worth taking into account just how artificial the whole factory-job era on the clock sleep schedule is.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;future&#x2F;article&#x2F;20220107-the-lost-medieval-habit-of-biphasic-sleep" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;future&#x2F;article&#x2F;20220107-the-lost-medieva...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

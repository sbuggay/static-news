In case of this keyboard, what I am seeing is the plastic board will flex and will put repeatable strain on the wires, possibly leading to malfunction at some point. PCB would be much more reliable (if done correctly) as it would take most or all of the load from the joints.<p>A thicker PCB board would actually be more stiff than the plastic board you have here. Not only materials of PCBs tend to be very tough, the PCB, being below the level of the switches, would need much less cutouts that are weakening your plastic mounting board.<p>And lastly, as an amateur EE I find &quot;spiders&quot; appealing (if done nicely, artfully). But if you want to showoff for the larger audience that just &quot;don&#x27;t get it&quot;, a custom PCB would immediately score more points.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37232993" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37232993" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">qwerty456127</span><span>|</span><a href="#37233454">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37232993">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37232993">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sounds very interesting. I have looked through premium and &quot;custom&quot; keyboards market recently and found out their customness mostly is about look&amp;feel, key placement and omitting &quot;unnecessary&quot; keys while I want a positively custom set of keys: as many keys as possible - full keypad, multimedia keys separate from f1-12 keys, Windows context menu key, also programmable macro keys if possible, no spatial &quot;optimizations&quot; (when manufacturers try to fit all the keys into as little area as possible) etc. I concluded I will probably have to really build my own. My ideal keyboard would even have a ThinkPad-style trackpoint so I could operate the mouse pointer comfortably without removing my hands from the home row :-)</div><br/><div id="37233286" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37233286" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wakeupcall</span><span>|</span><a href="#37232993">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37233179">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37233286">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37233286">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My impression for the popularity of the 75% form factor is due to laptops and people being accustomed to never have used the &quot;missing&quot; keys in the first place. A tell-tale is that default layout even for thinkpads is to set the Fn row to media keys by default... An increasingly smaller number of people use them, despite being a row of freely remappable keys right _there_.<p>What I&#x27;ve seen happen though is that especially on linux you need two-modifier combos (ctrl-shift&#x2F;ctrl-alt) to perform what you could have done with a single Fn keystroke. Or burn a few extra keys and increase complexity with layers. I went this route a decade ago, and I&#x27;m not a fan personally. Removing the Fn row saves 2cm of vertical space from your desk. I see it as completely pointless, even if you never use the Fn keys.<p>And I don&#x27;t buy the &quot;reduced finger travel&quot; argument either. Holding the modifiers in weird positions to access an extra layer is usually worse than a more spacious keyboard where your hands can be kept further apart and require less chording.<p>But yeah... I commented on another thread on keyboards, and the current keyboard craze is mostly about customization and looks, and very little about the actual typing experience IMHO (there are exceptions of course..).</div><br/><div id="37233400" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37233400" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hnlmorg</span><span>|</span><a href="#37232993">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37233286">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37233179">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37233400">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37233400">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I completely agree. I never understood this craze of removing keys.<p>The number pad is another example of this. Typing numbers is massively more comfortable (and quicker too) on the number pad than it is with the row of numbers just below the F-keys.<p>The amount of desk space people save is so negligible, particularly when people who buy these keyboards typically work in “paperless” offices, that I never understood the appeal.<p>I guess it boils down to people wanting their keyboards to look pretty rather than being actually useful.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37233179" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37233179" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rgoulter</span><span>|</span><a href="#37232993">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37233286">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37233310">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37233179">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37233179">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; omitting &quot;unnecessary&quot; keys .... without removing my hands from the home row<p>The &quot;keep hands on home row&quot; is the motivation behind omitting the &quot;unnecessary&quot; keys, at least for the keyboards which use a small spacebar and give the thumbs more keys to use.<p>With those small 36-key keyboards, your hands pretty much have nowhere to go except to remain on home row.<p>&gt; as many keys as possible<p>I once saw someone made a keyboard with 450 keys.

Their wireless keyboards are apparently a bit buggy, not sure if the new ones still are.<p>QMK is an absolute treasure. You can use your web UI to setup custom keymaps and stuff using the chrome USB feature. But I may have went off the rails, as it&#x27;s pretty simple to completely customise your keyboard with layers etc if you know a bit of C.<p>Warning; this is a gateway into a land of a obsession. :-)</div><br/></div></div><div id="37233444" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37233444" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">unnouinceput</span><span>|</span><a href="#37232993">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37233310">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37233194">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37233444">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37233444">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Same here. All these modern keyboards are missing a lot of what old one had. The most I miss most is the Alt GR one, the bigger ENTER key and I want a lot of space. Call me fat fingers if you want.<p>So I started to actually create my own. And I want it to be programmable. And movable, as in you can move the key around, enlarge or shrink them. And when I say I want them programmable I meant to pull little a gizmo out of it, hook it up to a separate power source and load preset or connect to computer and use an app to make the keys look different.<p>So far my idea is to have each key include a magnet, an ESP32 chip and a small LED screen on top of it. The controller to all those 110+ ESP32 chips will be a RPi CM4 module, which will also be the USB connection for the PC. That&#x27;s one iteration because this way I can actually have a click-clack mechanical one. The other iteration is to just have a big ass touch screen and the RPI underneath to just play that as an app that simulates the keyboard. Prettier, way more customizable as key positions&#x2F;size go but no click-clack sound&#x2F;feeling.<p>I&#x27;m $2000 in my research hole for this with nothing to show up for but is fun. Probably next year I&#x27;ll finish it :)</div><br/></div></div><div id="37233194" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37233194" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">drekipus</span><span>|</span><a href="#37232993">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37233444">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37233194">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37233194">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Really you probably just want a normal keyboard with some good firmware.<p>I started out with a moonlander, which had a lot of keys (36 each hand) but to be honest, I&#x27;m trying to minimise as much as possible, and remove keys from it. That way I&#x27;m fully constrained to the home row.<p>Also, layers are amazing and sounds like something you might want to look into.

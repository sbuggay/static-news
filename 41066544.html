I get the value proposition: simulate your model so that you have confidence it&#x27;s doing the right thing, and then essentially just run that model as code instead of implementing it yourself and possibly introducing mistakes. What I didn&#x27;t understand, as a software guy, not an engineering guy, was why on earth you&#x27;d want a <i>graphical</i> programming language to do that. Surely it would be easier to just write your model in a traditional text-based language. Hell, the same company even makes their own language (MATLAB) that would be perfect for the task.<p>I did a little digging, and it turns out I had it backwards. It&#x27;s not that Simulink invented a new graphical programming language to do this stuff. Control systems engineers have been studying and documenting systems using Simulink-style block diagrams since at least the 1960s. Simulink just took something that used to be a paper and chalkboard modeling tool and made it executable on a computer.</div><br/><div id="41068805" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41068805" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">buescher</span><span>|</span><a href="#41068095">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41075726">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41068805">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41068805">[15 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Bingo.  Additionally, control theory block diagrams are pretty rigorous, with algebraic rules for manipulating them you&#x27;ll find in a controls textbook.

As an example I was looking at a simplified model of an aircraft a couple months ago.<p>One of the things it needed to compute was the density of air at a given altitude. This is a somewhat complicated equation that is a function of altitude, temperature (which can be modelled as a function of altitude), and some other stuff. These are, despite being a bit complicated, straightforward equations. The person who had made this model didn&#x27;t write the equations, though, they instead made a Simulink sub-model for it with a bunch of addition, multiplication, and division blocks in a ratsnest.<p>I think the Simulink approach should be used when it brings clarity to the problem, and should be abandoned when it obscures the problem. In this case it took a ton of mental energy to reassemble all of the blocks back into a simple closed-form equation and then further re-arranging to verify that it matched the textbook equation.</div><br/><div id="41072286" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41072286" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">buescher</span><span>|</span><a href="#41068095">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41072054">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41072525">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41072286">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41072286">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had an intern do something similar with an electromechanical machine.

There are common nets like SDA, SCL, GND, VCC that make sense to have as global nets. And then there’s actual circuits where it makes more sense (for understandability) to not do it like that.<p>Here’s an example that I think takes it too far: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.sparkfun.com&#x2F;datasheets&#x2F;Dev&#x2F;LilyPad&#x2F;LilyPad-MP3-v15a.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.sparkfun.com&#x2F;datasheets&#x2F;Dev&#x2F;LilyPad&#x2F;LilyPad-MP3-...</a><p>- The audio jack (line level) could have just sat to the right of the codec and been directly connected to it to make it clear that it’s just a direct output<p>- the speaker amplifier could be directly connected to the audio jack as well. I spent a lot of time looking around to figure out where it actually connects to; I figured it would have its input connected to the MP3 codec and didn’t realize that it would be connected through the micro switches inside the headphone jack (which makes sense now that I see it)<p>- the SD card slot could either be connected directly to the codec or could have better names on the nets. When I see MOSI, MISO, and SCK I assume that they’re connected to the main MCU. Even more confusing, there’s an SD-CS that is connected to the MCU but not the rest of the SPI pins<p>Overall I’d probably give this one a B. It’s by no means the most egregious I’ve seen but it also obscures the signal flow pretty badly.<p>Other things I would probably consider doing:<p>- better clustering of pins on the MCU by function. The switch inputs and LED outputs that connect to the rotary encoder are all over the place. Most tools allow you to move the pins on microcontrollers around at will<p>- the FTDI block could move onto the first page. The DTR pin could use a bit of explanation that it’s tied to the reset circuit. Not their fault in this one but the naming inconsistency between 
FTDI-RXI and TRIG4&#x2F;TXO is confusing until you figure out that the pin is meant to be either a GPIO or a UART pin. The name doesn’t make it clear that it goes to the FTDI chip because it’s inconsistent with the rest of the FTDI-xxx names but that’s because most ECAD programs handle net names poorly anyway<p>Edit: one more thing that really bugs me about this schematic: the Vbatt net leaving J1. It’s labelled but not with any kind of flag or loose&#x2F;unterminated line that would indicate that it’s connected to the net leaving U2. And further with that, the fact that VIN on U2 comes <i>only</i> from the FTDI connector on the second page (I think…)</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41073706" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41073706" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mst</span><span>|</span><a href="#41068095">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41072286">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41072421">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41072525">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41073706">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41073706">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think using the drawing it out process to understand initially is ... not how my brain would do it, but seems like a perfectly valid approach.<p>But once you -do- understand it&#x27;s time to stick that in a reference file out of the way and write it again properly for actual use.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41072525" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41072525" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">singleshot_</span><span>|</span><a href="#41068095">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41072054">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41072286">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41072437">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41072525">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41072525">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One cool thing about, for instance, density altitude calculations or runway length calculations, is that you can break the parts of the algorithm down graphically do pilots can trace through datapoints to get an answer without even having a calculator.

It&#x27;s all just one global namespace.<p>In the Julia world with Pluto they get around this by restricting what can go into cells a little bit (e.g. you have to do some gymnastics if you&#x27;re going to try to assign more than one variable in a single cell); by doing it this way they can do much better dependency analysis and determine a valid ordering of your cells. It&#x27;s just fine to move a bunch of calculation code to the end&#x2F;appendix of your document and use the values higher up.<p>The idea I&#x27;ve been chewing on comes somewhat from using Obsidian and their whole infinite canvas idea. It seems like using ideas from Pluto around dependency analysis and being able to also determine whether the contents of a given cell are pure or not (i.e. whether they do IO or other syscalls, or will provide outputs that are solely a function of their inputs) should be able to make it easier to do something... notebook-like that benefits from cached computations while also having arbitrary computation graphs and kind of an infinite canvas of data analysis. Thinking like a circuit simulator, it should be possible to connect a &quot;scope&quot; onto the lines between cells to easily make plots on the fly to visualize what&#x27;s happening.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s the quick brain dump. It&#x27;s not well-formed at all yet. And honestly I would be delighted if someone reads this and steals the idea and builds it themselves so that I can just an off-the-shelf tool that doesn&#x27;t frustrate me as much as Jupyter does :)</div><br/><div id="41073265" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41073265" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sterlind</span><span>|</span><a href="#41068095">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41072875">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41075726">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41073265">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41073265">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">it sounds like the ideal solution would be something functional (so you have a computation graph), pure (so you can cache results) and lazy (so order of expressions doesn&#x27;t matter.) why not Haskell? or even a pure&#x2F;lazy subset&#x2F;variant of Julia, if you want to ditch the baggage of Haskell&#x27;s type bondage?<p>you could ditch explicit cells entirely, and implement your &quot;scope&quot; by selecting a (sub)expression and spying on the inputs&#x2F;outputs.</div><br/><div id="41073401" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41073401" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tonyarkles</span><span>|</span><a href="#41068095">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41073265">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41075378">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41073401">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41073401">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve thought about that and have written some fun Haskell code in the past but... the other goal is to actually have users :D.

I would use the word polish, but a lot of the Python libraries have sharp edges as well. Well trodden might be a better word. My experience with doing heavy data analysis with Python and Julia is that both of them are often going to require some Googling to understand a weird pattern to accomplish something effectively but there&#x27;s a much higher probability that you&#x27;re going to find the answer quickly with Python.<p>I also don&#x27;t really want to reinvent the universe on the first go.<p>It has occurred to me that it might be possible to do this in a style similar to org-mode though where it actually doesn&#x27;t care what the underlying language is and you could just weave a bunch of languages together.

Eventually, good Clojure programmers seem to stop using them because the trade-offs are worse error messages or uncomfortable edge-case behaviours. The base language is just so good that it doesn&#x27;t really matter, but I&#x27;ve had several experiences where the theoretically-great library had to be abandoned because of how it interacts with debugging tools and techniques.<p>It isn&#x27;t the macros fault, they just hint that a programmer is about to do something that, when it fails, fails in a way that is designed in to the system and can&#x27;t be easily worked around. Macros are basically for creating new syntax constructs - great but when the syntax has bugs, the programmer has a problem.

Which indicates that this is at its core, not a library or an add on.<p>There aren&#x27;t that many other languages which are based on these ideas.<p>We can define three levels of &quot;feature adoption&quot;:<p>* enables a feature (the language provides mechanisms to provide a feature)<p>* supports a feature (the language actually includes those features, but use is optional)<p>* requires a feature (the language requires the use of that feature, its not optional for the developer)<p>If we use a programming system, which requires the four core ideas above (and many of the features that follow from those) and is based on them, it is still very (!) different to what most people use.<p>Example:<p>Smalltalk development was started more than a decade after LISP. It adopted a huge amount of features from Lisp: managed memory, resident development environment, garbage collection, late binding, interactive use, runtime evaluation, dumping&amp;loading heaps, etc. etc. For a decade Xerox PARC developed a Smalltalk system and a Lisp system side-by side: Smalltalk 80 systems and Interlisp-D systems were the results.<p>Still: Smalltalk 80 did not use the first three core ideas from above and replaced them with another core idea: objects+classes communicating via message passing.<p>Thus mass feature adoption alone does not make Smalltalk fundamentally to be a LISP. Nor does feature adoption make a language popular.<p>So we can ask use, will those core ideas of Lisp make it very popular? Seems like it did not. Still many of the useful features which were following from it could be replicated&#x2F;adopted&#x2F;morphed into other languages.<p>The original article was probably taking a view that a language&amp;programming system which enables domain specific embedded languages would be &quot;better&quot; than the diverse stack of tools and languages in the automotive domain. Lisp is such a tool for embedded languages (embedded into a hosting language, not in the sense of languages for embedded systems), but that does not make it the best for that domain, which has a lot more requirements than language embedding (like reliability, robustness, etc. ...). In Germany A-SPICE gives a lot of hints what a development process needs to do, to deliver reliable software for the automotive domain.

So the students would go on to crawl the unix and windows nodes for the relevant info.<p>A &quot;good&quot; (7.5+&#x2F;10) graduate from the CSD of the University of Crete could do rigorous algorithmic analysis, hack system stuff in C and time in Verilog.

Specializations abounded: networks and OSs, theory, arithmetic and analysis, hardware (including VLSI etc. at the undergraduate level, with labs).  I won&#x27;t even go into the graduate stuff.<p>And although this curriculum was quite demanding and onerous (the number of projects in each class was quite crazy), it was just something students dealt with.

The fundamentalist, and worse, answer is simply: you don&#x27;t. The objections to Lisp are not mere surface-level syntactic quibbles, it&#x27;s deeper than that.  But also, the syntax is a barrier to adoption. Some people think in S-expressions quite naturally, I personally find them pleasant if a bit strange. But the majority simply do not.  Let&#x27;s not downplay the actual success of Common Lisp, Scheme, and particularly Clojure, all of them are actively used. But you&#x27;ve got your work cut out for you trying to get broader adoption for any of those, teams which want to be using them, are.<p>The better, more liberal answer, is: use Julia! The language is consciously placed in the Lisp family in the broader sense, it resembles Dylan more than any other language. Critically, it has first-class macros, which one might argue are less <i>eloquent</i> than macros in Common Lisp, but which are equally <i>expressive</i>.<p>It also has multiple dispatch, and is a JIT-compiled LLVM language, meaning that type-stable Julia code is as fast as a dynamic language can be, genuinely competitive with C++ for CPU-bound numeric computation.<p>Perhaps most important, it&#x27;s simply a pleasure to work with. The language is typecast into a role in scientific computing, and the library ecosystem does reflect that, but the language itself is well suited to general server-side programming, and library support is a chicken-and-egg thing: if more people start choosing Julia over, say, Go, then it will naturally grow more libraries for those applications over time.</div><br/><div id="41074379" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41074379" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mst</span><span>|</span><a href="#41067791">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41069017">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41069336">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41074379">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41074379">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Elixir feels like that as well (in the same broader sense).<p>Their trick of &#x27;use&#x27; being require+import (ala perl) becomes brilliant when you realise import can be a macro, and that&#x27;s how libraries inject things into your current namespace.<p>Consider also: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;elixir-lang&#x2F;elixir&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;lib&#x2F;elixir&#x2F;lib&#x2F;kernel.ex">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;elixir-lang&#x2F;elixir&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;lib&#x2F;elixir&#x2F;l...</a><p>Julia looks beautiful but I keep forgetting to play with it.

His mother stayed for awhile but had to leave for work. She was repeatedly guaranteed by multiple doctors and nurses that he could not check himself out and would be there for several days at least. They told her to come back the next morning.<p>Late that night, he was discharged. Not even &quot;he checked himself out&quot;. The hospital discharged him (and that&#x27;s over an hour ride away from home, btw - no hospitals in rural areas these days).<p>He had no phone and no wallet.  According to staff, he tried to call his mother to pick him up, but couldn&#x27;t remember her cell phone number (it had changed recently). He called his sister and left a message, but she was traveling and didn&#x27;t get it until much later.  According to the hospital, he tried to call several different numbers trying to get a ride home and they made him stop and made him leave.  In a quite rough downtown area he was not familiar with. While clearly not in his right mind. At 2am. With no wallet, no phone, no nothing.<p>The hospital had his mother&#x27;s contact info.  They did not give it to him even when he requested it. They did not attempt to contact her in any way.<p>We still don&#x27;t know what happened afterwards. His body was found four days later in the river and it had been there for awhile.<p>Forcibly discharging someone under those circumstances and refusing to even contact their emergency contacts is beyond belief.  I&#x27;m furious about it.

The hospital doctors took one look at me and realized I didn&#x27;t belong there, but to do a discharge apparently is a pretty lengthy process once this process is initiated - almost 20 hours later (again, being held completely against my will for no reason) they released me. I asked them where I was supposed to go and if I could call my dad. They said no, but they gave me two (2) bus tokens, which wasn&#x27;t enough to get back where my car was parked at the school, plus I had no idea how to use the bus system in that county, and didn&#x27;t have my glasses, phone, or wallet.<p>I really don&#x27;t know how long it took or how I made it, but many many hours later I made it back to my car.

I was extremely stressed about finals and didnt know what to do. Was borderline homeless and struggling to support myself. I had never seen a counselor or therapist before and was mildly depressed. she asked me a few leading questions like “how would you feel if you failed your finals and dropped out?” and I said something along the lines of “I guess I’d feel suicidal.” then, “do you feel suicidal now?” and I said I wasn’t sure. Then she goes, “so you cant tell me if you go home right now, you cant guarantee me you won’t kill yourself?”<p>now at this point I had zero ideation even, no plan, no intentions of killing myself, but being a pedantic dork studying philosophy I said I wasn’t sure about that, because I really wasn’t sure what to say. 10 minutes later a cop shows up, puts me in handcuffs, parades me off campus in them and people I knew saw it. I had absolutely no clue what was going on and had to sign papers I didn’t want to sign and when I protested the answer was basically “you can come voluntarily or with force, your choice.”<p>It ended up doing <i>far</i> more harm than good for me. I know physicians personally that will often throw people into 72 hour holds in the ER “just to be safe,” either not understanding or caring the long term consequences of being put in an involuntary hold. These same physicians have told me she did the “right” thing but anyone with common sense and experience could figure out very quickly I was not a danger to anyone. I was just trying to find some help because I was overwhelmed.</div><br/><div id="41317127" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41317127" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">FireBeyond</span><span>|</span><a href="#41314291">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41316430">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41316280">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41317127">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41317127">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I am very sorry for your experience - that&#x27;s entirely horrible.<p>I&#x27;m the same as you, too, and pondering the deeper, thinking answers.<p>That whole process sounds messed up.

Our EMS protocols DO require soft restraints <i>during</i> transport, but we generally make a point of being apologetic about it, putting them on at the last moment and that we will take them off ASAP (essentially once the ambulance is in Park). Even this is only because, unfortunately, some of those patients have attempted to exit a moving ambulance, sometimes at freeway speeds.<p>I&#x27;m curious what papers were put in front of you, though, as the whole point of the involuntary custody process is that your acknowledgement is not necessary (at <i>that</i> point - after the mental health hold hearing, in front of a judge - you are asked to acknowledge&#x2F;sign, but not required).</div><br/><div id="41317504" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41317504" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JohnMakin</span><span>|</span><a href="#41314291">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41317127">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41316280">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41317504">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41317504">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is california law and I believe the code is 51-50 but this is over 20 years ago so I’m a little fuzzy. I think looking back they were just liability papers the university was having me sign, I remember having to acknowledge things (that I didnt have time to read) that I wouldnt be able to purchase a firearm for 7 years and a whole bunch of other legal gobbledegook about being detained and what my rights were. The whole time a cop is standing above me making me sign it though and no one was answering my questions. I was extraordinarily confused for most of it until the cuffs went on and I had kind of a vague understanding I had said something wrong. At no point did anyone tell me what I did other than to tell me stuff like “you’re very ill and are being looked after for your own safety, care will be provided to you and you will be ok” kind of stuff. I cannot stress enough that this assessment was based on less than a 10 minute conversation with me. They even had a followup with me I was forced to go to, because I had missed the finals (because i was gone for like 3 days) and therefore actually failed. So they then convinced me to do a medical withdrawal to save my grade which very ironically led me to actually dropping out because I lost all my scholarships and grants. I would have probably been fine had I never sought help, and I suspect although my experience was extreme and probably malfeasant, that this treatment of people undergoing difficult mental things is probably very commonplace within the system.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41316280" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41316280" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aidenn0</span><span>|</span><a href="#41314291">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41314388">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41315695">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41315682">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41316280">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41316280">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The hospital&#x2F;medical care industrial complex doesn&#x27;t optimize for empathy.

(SAT)) agreed to pay $15m as part of a settlement with the DOJ. These doctors&#x2F;surgeons were booked for multiple simultaneous procedures that they could not have possibly conducted, even though they recorded things to make it look like they conducted all the surgeries. In reality many procedures were performed by unqualified residents and other caretakers and not who the patient was told would be performing the procedure.<p>&gt; To make it seem as if the teaching physicians were present during the &quot;entire&quot; operation, they would lie on medical records, the court filings say. The medical staff also would not tell patients that the surgeon planned on leaving the room to perform another operation, the documents continued.<p>This only came out because of a whistleblower, and because the DOJ pursued it. It is nearly impossible for a patient to know if they are wronged or harmed this way because they are put under for these procedures, and because friends&#x2F;family are typically not allowed to observe or record anything (likely to prevent accountability). And then there’s the cost of lawsuits, the stress, and limitations under law (like tort reform in Texas) - it’s just lucky that this was pursued by a government agency (DOJ).<p>&gt; Under the False Claims Act, the private whistleblower who reported the allegations will receive over $3 million from the settlement, the Justice Department said.<p>We need more incentives like this, but we also need greater penalties and jail time for the practitioners and literally everyone who knew. They should be investigating who was in the room, what was recorded in logs, and who accessed records, and go after all of them. Right now, this settlement achieves nothing. Some articles claimed that these hospitals made more than $150 million off these procedures for which they are settling the lawsuit for just $15 million.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41315453" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41315453" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pyuser583</span><span>|</span><a href="#41313872">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41314302">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41314635">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41315397">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41315453">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41315453">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It’s absolutely insane how many people don’t show up for doctors appointments, including surgery.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41315397" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41315397" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tppiotrowski</span><span>|</span><a href="#41313872">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41314024">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41315397">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41315397">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Personal story:<p>A couple of years ago I climbed Mt Whitney in California.

The next day the rangers found the car was still parked in the Mt Whitney parking lot and search and rescue was finally dispatched.<p>In this case I believe it didn&#x27;t make a difference because the climber appeared to die from acute injury on the mountain the day of his climb but in another scenario maybe those 2 days would&#x27;ve been the difference between being rescued or dying from exposure.</div><br/><div id="41315469" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41315469" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pyuser583</span><span>|</span><a href="#41315397">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41314024">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41315469">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41315469">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I recently faced a personal catastrophe because a low ranking clerical worker mixed up a form.<p>I’m not mad about it.

My condolences to the family.
 Reading the timeline, I can’t help but speculate that there’s a darker side to this.<p>Two days before “checking out”, the daughter called the mom to say she was better and was about to leave. Soon after that, something bad happens (possibly malpractice) and she dies. An autopsy would reveal the true cause of death, so the hospital quietly ships her to an off-site morgue, doesn’t even fill a death certificate, and fabricates her checking out.<p>Now the body is beyond decomposed and an autopsy is impossible. The hospital claims it was a simple mix-up and gets away with a bit of bad press and a negligence charge.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41314176" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41314176" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">khaki54</span><span>|</span><a href="#41316302">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41314005">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41314176">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41314176">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Crazy.

I worked in this space for several years and interacted with many doctors - just like in any other professional industry, some people have stellar reputations that precede them, while a few are infamous for their malpractice and unethical behavior. The perverse incentive arises when a hospital has a publicized malpractice lawsuit or criminal investigation - everyone who works at that for-profit medical institution has an incentive to protect its reputation (i.e. its profitability). This has allowed &quot;angel of death&quot; doctors&#x2F;nurses to kill hundreds of people over the years, since there isn&#x27;t much incentive to dig too deeply into &quot;excess mortality&quot; statistics (a famous example being Harold Shipman who could have easily been detected 2 years and over 100 victims earlier).<p>Covering up a case of medical malpractice by surreptitiously filling out discharge paperwork is certainly possible. A surprisingly large component of healthcare processes is to blindly trust that doctors are manually entering information truthfully and accurately. The fact that they couldn&#x27;t locate her body for an entire year strongly suggests a criminal conspiracy to hide the body.</div><br/><div id="41316119" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41316119" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yosito</span><span>|</span><a href="#41314176">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41315412">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41314005">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41316119">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41316119">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a victim of medical malpractice, it&#x27;s terrifying to me that someone could have killed me to cover it up.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41314005" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41314005" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jklinger410</span><span>|</span><a href="#41314176">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41317212">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41314005">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41314005">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m glad we pay for the most expensive medical care in the world in the US.

If you check out the probate process which distributes an estate after death, it can vary considerably from state to state and has a lot more judicial involvement. HIPAA is not an enforced statute or law, it&#x27;s a set of civil rights guidelines which allow hefty fines to be levied by OCR (Office of Civil Rights) when a violation is reported and investigated.<p>HIPAA does specifically allow for the sharing of PHI with family and friends of a with substantial leeway given to medical professionals to document their reasoning for sharing information if it is &quot;in the patient&#x27;s best interest&quot;. In the hypothetical scenario where concerned family&#x2F;friends are inquiring about a discharge, it would be perfectly acceptable to share certain details of the discharge if the healthcare provider is willing to document and possibly defend their decision.<p>In this case, not reporting to next of kin was certainly not in the patient&#x27;s best interest and a <i>prima facie</i> case of misconduct. As someone who sat at the intersection of health and law for several years, I can&#x27;t see any possible legal justification or loophole for the hospital to avoid a hefty settlement. As some of the other comments on this thread suggest, this shocking oversight may not be an isolated case, so a hefty monetary penalty is the only realistic way to force the other for-profit health systems of America to implement better processes for this.</div><br/><div id="41315750" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41315750" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">EE84M3i</span><span>|</span><a href="#41314864">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41315342">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41315766">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41315750">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41315750">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I see, that makes sense, thanks!<p>So, after the patient died, what is the mechanism by which the family should have been contacted?<p>Later, if that failed and the family came to ask the hospital, the correct answer was &quot;they&#x27;re dead&quot;, not &quot;we can&#x27;t tell you&quot; (and especially not &quot;they were discharged against medical advice&quot;!).

Being homeless in that country is pretty hard core in the winter. Which is a reason that sheltering people there is not a nice to have; you either shelter them or you collect their dead bodies in the morning. It&#x27;s that simple. Places like Helsinki never had a large community of homeless people to begin with (natural selection). But it has plenty of social issues of course. Alcoholism is a big problem for example and there probably are lots of issues with drug usage and mental health as well. However, it&#x27;s not a country with a lot of illegal immigration, or a lot refugees with ambiguous legal status. I.e. the vast majority of problematic people are all citizens that have full coverage under the excellent social system. So, they are insured and probably are entitled to some form of income.<p>And the locals are very pragmatic about it not being desirable to have drunk homeless people passing out and freezing to death in the winter. So, they never had a huge problem with homeless people to begin with and what little homeless people they had were take care off via shelters and other solutions already.<p>The &quot;innovation&quot; in Finland was realizing that simply providing proper housing to these people is a pragmatic alternative that actually improves their situation while lowering overall cost at the same time. Shelters cost money and they have to be staffed and when they fill up you need to spend money on emergency shelters, which costs more money. And shelters perpetuate the problem. So, providing housing lowers cost and you get a meaningful percentage of people to a level where they stop being a problem. Which frees up more resources to deal with the remaining people more effectively. And it&#x27;s nice to see people get out of such a situation. Win win.<p>That&#x27;s definitely something other countries can learn from.</div><br/><div id="35826278" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35826278" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">deanc</span><span>|</span><a href="#35825832">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35826851">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35826278">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35826278">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a nuanced issue and I agree with what you wrote. I live in Finland. Some additional thoughts:<p>- The scale of social problems in the US is on a whole other level. More people requires bigger solutions.<p>- The state vs government system in the US means it&#x27;s every state for themselves when solving social issues. This is seen in states actively shipping homeless people to warmer climate states in order to make their problems go away.<p>- As you point out, homeless people die in the winter. It&#x27;s also cold in many places in the US, and hot in others - so people die all the time there too.<p>- As a society Finland has a robust social security system, the society is built on it - and the idea of equality (Hint: its not, but it&#x27;s not bad at all either compared to other countries). The amount of Americans I&#x27;ve seen arguing against free healthcare as they don&#x27;t want to pay for it just blows my mind, I would imagine you&#x27;d go into a similar situation if the government raised taxes to &quot;fix the homeless problem&quot;. &quot;Well i&#x27;m not homeless, why should i pay for these people&#x27;s problems&quot; etc. (Not my view, just predicting how it will go).</div><br/><div id="35826287" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35826287" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ajuc</span><span>|</span><a href="#35825832">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35826278">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35826413">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35826287">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35826287">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The scale of social problems in the US is on a whole other level.

The German constitution has a very explicit article that states &quot;Property obligates. Its use should simultaneously contribute to the wellbeing of the general public&quot; (my translation) for example.<p>Similarly, EU jurisprudence has confirmed that laws and regulations can limit the absolute control over individual property, if that contributes to an overall more important social good. Many countries around the world actually do not have permanent private ownership of land&#x2F;buildings or limit it in significant ways. Historically, basically all societies and legal systems have limited individual property rights in certain, sometimes very extreme ways. The Uber-liberal definition of property that you cite is something of an outlier.<p>Regarding your question on rent control in Germany: There are several layers:<p>- Some housing is government&#x2F;municipality owned (unfortunately not a lot). The rent for those usually covers the cost of providing that housing but not more so it is quite cheap.<p>- Some private property has been built with government subsidies. This is bound for a certain time (I think 20 years or so) to a government-set rent and tenants usually profit from this even afterwards, because it is very hard in Germany to increase rent on existing tenants.<p>- Since 2015 there has been a national law on rent control. It covers municipalities which have been specifically designated by state governments. Landlords covered by the law can not increase the rent for a new tenant by more than 10% over the local average, but there are a lot of exceptions: buildings built or substantially improved after 1st October 2014, properties that already had a higher rent prior to the law, etc. It also relies on the tenants for enforcement and their willingness to engage in a protracted legal battle.<p>- Berlin tried to introduce much harsher rent controls. These were declared illegal by the courts, because state governments (in the view of the courts) do not have the competency to introduce certain types of rent control.<p>&gt; if you own several places and the rent imposed by the authorities is too low for you to turn a profit, then it&#x27;s not worth renting either.<p>This may be the case for new construction. But most existing properties are paid off, ongoing investment is limited (I can say this with some authority, as I own a couple of properties in two different German cities). The huge rent increases in German cities do not come from long-term tenants (because they are protected against steep increases by law). It comes from landlords taking advantage of huge demand by increasing the rent dramatically for new tenants. This is pure profit for the landlord, as the property has been profitable even before the rent increase. This is what most attempts at rent control in Germany are targeted at.</div><br/><div id="35826844" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35826844" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ricardobayes</span><span>|</span><a href="#35825832">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35826750">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35826711">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35826844">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35826844">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Spain just did a very strict rent control, in &quot;high stress&quot; areas rent can&#x27;t be raised more than 3% yearly.

There were too few emergency shelters and many affected people did not manage to get out of homelessness: they couldn’t find jobs without a housing address. And without any job, they couldn’t find a flat. It was a vicious circle. Furthermore, they had problems applying for social benefits. All in all, homeless people found themselves trapped.<p>An emergency shelter like you mention is not a housing address needed for finding a job, thus making it harder to get out of homelessness.<p>[1] &quot;In 2013 there were almost 2 000 homeless immigrants in Finland.

Give the keys to a normal apartment to an addict and they&#x27;ll be doing drugs instead of paying rent and back on the streets in a few months.<p>Housing first, addressing problems second was found to be much more effective. This was researched extensively. About 80% of people given supported housing get out of homelessness [0].

If it were, San Diego would have a worse homeless problem than San Francisco.<p>The most important difference is that the city of San Diego spends one third as much as San Francisco per homeless person. ($46.8 million in city spending[1] for an estimated 1900 homeless.[2])<p>San Francisco has an enormous homeless-industrial complex that uses every virtue-signaling, heart-tugging propaganda tool at its disposal to increase the flow of money thrown into its bottomless maw, despite no metric ever improving one bit whatsoever.<p>[1] &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lajollalight.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;story&#x2F;2023-04-15&#x2F;san-diego-mayors-proposed-budget-includes-millions-more-to-address-homelessness-and-streets" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lajollalight.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;story&#x2F;2023-04-15&#x2F;san-diego...</a>&gt;<p>[2] &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;california&#x2F;story&#x2F;2023-02-07&#x2F;downtown-homeless-population-reaches-another-high" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;california&#x2F;story&#x2F;2023-02-07&#x2F;downtown...</a>&gt; [3]<p>[3] The count is only of the homeless in downtown San Diego. While presumably most homeless San Diegans are there, just as there are very few San Franciscans living on the sidewalk in Pac Heights, the point is that a larger number would mean that much less spending per homeless person in the city as a whole, and that much more glaring a discrepancy between the two cities.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35826112" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35826112" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">newjersey</span><span>|</span><a href="#35825803">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35825925">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35826209">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35826112">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35826112">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think that number means anything.<p>1.

The former puts you in control: you choose who to follow based on if you like their content and their boosts. The latter is usually tuned towards showing you content that will keep you on the site (and looking at ads), but isn&#x27;t necessarily content you want to see. As commercial social networking sites become increasingly profit driven, they&#x27;ll crank the algorithm towards engagement at the cost of everything else. In contrast, a chronological feed of content created by or boosted by the people you directly follow is not &quot;the algorithm&quot;.<p>On Mastodon, I discovered someone via a boost who had wrote a great blog post. I followed them but found my feed was now full of bird photography (their main hobby, and something I don&#x27;t care for). I added a filter for &quot;#BirdsOfMastodon&quot; (or something), but there were still too many without that tag.

I remember a while ago, I believe it was in India, WhatsApp limited the number of users you could share something with as a response to the platform being used for riling up ethnic violence. Putting an inhibitor on this cascading virality has to improve the sanity in any communication network.<p>Individual accounts broadcasting at the rate of major TV news stations with no scrutiny isn&#x27;t a combination that was ever going to produce something approaching the truth. The entire premise of how groups produce truth is through a representative wisdom-of-the-crowds effect. 0.1% of highly correlated users swinging every discussion is extremely pathological.<p>Most glaring problem is of course that limiting your most viral users is complete anathema to the business incentives of any for-profit social media platform, so in particular I don&#x27;t see it happening on Twitter.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40543705" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40543705" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hiAndrewQuinn</span><span>|</span><a href="#40543915">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40543728">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40543705">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40543705">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">See also: &quot;Most of What You Read on the Internet is Written by Insane People&quot;.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;slatestarcodex&#x2F;comments&#x2F;9rvroo&#x2F;most_of_what_you_read_on_the_internet_is_written&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;slatestarcodex&#x2F;comments&#x2F;9rvroo&#x2F;most...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40543728" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40543728" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cjdaly</span><span>|</span><a href="#40543705">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40543982">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40543728">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40543728">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Did you see the article claiming Hunter Biden&#x27;s laptop wasn&#x27;t really Hunter Biden&#x27;s laptop, but rather had &quot;all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation&quot;?

They would often be religious in nature, but they&#x27;d also sometimes have messages of racial hatred or political topics.  They would say things like &quot;If you resend this email 100 times then Bill Gates will pay you a penny per email when you have sent 1,000,000 emails!  This is the gospel truth!&quot;.  There would be a long list of other forwarded emails after that with the email addresses of all the other women who had forwarded that and other emails, so if you looked through that history there would be a variety of topics.  &quot;Don&#x27;t break this chain or you will go to hell!&quot;  These retweet networks may be a continuation of a similar thing, playing on peoples religiousness to get them to spread false messages (mixed in with true messages).

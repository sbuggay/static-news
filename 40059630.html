Apparently there were a lot of floaties in the pool and no one noticed him slip in. I was living in Miami at the time and it shook me immensely as I was a new dad, pools are everywhere, and the thought of losing my son who was 2yo was unbearable. I was at the apartment pool chatting with a friend who is a very advanced swimmer - the type that swims laps seemingly endlessly - and she asked “have you ever seen what would happen if he fell in the pool?”. I said no, and then she suggested I try it so that I would at least know. So I picked him up and with no warning tossed him in. He immediately froze under water, arms and legs outstretched in literally stunned silence. I counted to 5 and pulled him out and he was trembling with fear.<p>At that point I realized that the time it takes for a kid to drown is one breath. That may be 3 seconds, may be 10 seconds. It’s considerably shorter than the time it takes to run to the restroom, answer a call, pick up the pizza at the front door etc. They won’t fight for their life and splash, they’ll simply freeze stiff and die in silence.<p>I literally shared that story with every close friend I have with kids to warn them about how fast it can happen, now I’m happy to share it with you. I won’t bore you with another story concerning my brothers daughter who almost died while in swim class at the MIT pool but suffice it to say, if you haven’t taught your kids how to swim, I advise you not to trust them with anyone but yourself and your partner.</div><br/><div id="40062117" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40062117" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">raducu</span><span>|</span><a href="#40060439">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40060526">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40062117">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40062117">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; hey won’t fight for their life and splash, they’ll simply freeze stiff and die in silence.<p>Last year, my daughter (5 at that time) slipped in a children&#x27;s pool where she could stand out of the water.

There is no accepted explanation what happens, I personally prefer the idea, that your memory qualitatively changes in spite of language acquisition, you get another (upgraded) way to access your memory, and then you forget the old (legacy) way.

Father throwing his kind into a pool? Kid was terrified? It is a very emotional experience which is a betrayal of kid&#x27;s trust, which probably will never be without limits again. It may destroy any trust to other humans as well. Though it may pass without any long term consequences also. People are unpredictable in this regard.

The first reason is that two year olds don&#x27;t understand the concept of age in years (or age at all, TBH - they recognoise larger people and smaller poeple, but hafve no conept of age).

Teaching him the habit of turning to breathe and finding the edge of a pool, along with simple comfort in water, served as an immense comfort. Now I’m faced with his confidence in water that can surprise even the best swimmers (oceans, rivers), so there’s one more parental fear… of course.<p>Every child should at least learn how to float, front crawl, and backstroke.

I couldn’t find a safe place to make a shelter and made a quick makeshift shelter in a tree well — not that safe under a tree but conditions seemed worse in the open.  Dog and I basically huddled together all night. I didnt sleep and I doubt he did.<p>I have made camp in a blizzard, but never in such conditions and always with a human companion.<p>Second time I was on a trip with a group of friends in Atikaki park.  In the almost three weeks we were out we never encountered another human.  Anyway, part way through I just needed some time by <i>myself</i> and so after we made camp I just went off in a canoe by myself.  No map — we’d emptied the canoes, but I wasn’t going to go far.  No clothes but a swimsuit.  But there were a lot of islands, there was some wind, and a current, and I was tired, and got lost.

This was in Ottawa, Ontario. I had to cross a ditch to get there. Water was flowing underneath and there was a thin layer of ice on top. I stepped on it and &quot;fell&quot; into the ditch water. It was probably under 12 inches of water, and I panicked and screamed. Luckily, one of the kids (probably grade 3 or 4) walked over and used his hockey stick to save me. I thanked him and walked one minute to my aunt&#x27;s house, telling my family that I&#x27;d almost drowned. I don&#x27;t remember their exact reaction but it was muted. I am almost positive I would have actually drowned if that boy hadn&#x27;t decided to wander over and help me.

It&#x27;s culturally informed, some cultures try very very hard NOT to have to deliver a negative.</i><p>This is one of those things that Steve Blank tries to address with the &quot;Million dollar question.&quot; He suggests something like this (paraphrased from memory)<p>1. Ask your prospect (this assumes you&#x27;ve identified a prospect and gotten in the room, or at least on a call, with them) &quot;If this product were available today and I offered it to you for free, would you start the process of deploying and roll it out immediately?&quot;<p>If the answer is &quot;no&quot; then you clearly have bigger issues to deal with, considering you&#x27;re offering the product for free. At this point you have to dig in and find out why. <i>Maybe</i> it&#x27;s the case that while the current need is valid, there are simply higher priorities for the customer right now. In which case, your only issue is timing. But you may keep digging and find that there&#x27;s something else. Anyway, repeat this with a few prospects, and you should start to converge on a valid understanding.<p>2. If the answer to question 1 was &quot;Yes&quot; (and I mean a solid &quot;yes&quot; not a bunch of hemming and hawing) then you next ask &quot;OK, what if I charged you a million dollars for the product?&quot;<p>Now... if the answer is still &quot;yes&quot;, well, in that case you better have a purchase order ready to drop on your customer&#x27;s desk Right Now. You&#x27;ve won, there&#x27;s nothing left to do. Well, except for actually delivering the product, and successfully deploying, and integrating it, training users, creating value, etc. But in terms of sales, that would be the &quot;Holy Shit&quot; moment.<p>Probably not gonna happen though. Probably they&#x27;ll start hemming and hawing and going &quot;Well, uh... I mean, I dunno, a million dollars is a lot of money...&quot;, etc. That&#x27;s OK. That&#x27;s not a &quot;no&quot;, it just means you now have an idea that the value your product represents to a customer is somewhere between 0 and a million dollars. If you find yourself in this situation, the (huge) body of material out there on sales, pricing and negotiation comes into play. But assuming you can get your customer to a &quot;yes&quot; at a number that would be profitable for you, then you now know that you have a product that can be sold to at least one customer for a profitable price. If you get this far, you&#x27;re in pretty good shape. If the product actually exists, go ahead and sell it. Use the money to fund further exploration. Keep iterating. If it doesn&#x27;t exist yet, promise the customer you&#x27;ll let them know as soon as it&#x27;s ready and keep iterating. Asking for a non-binding letter of intent to purchase might be useful if you&#x27;re going to seek external funding.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36582742" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36582742" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blowski</span><span>|</span><a href="#36582678">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36582865">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36583093">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36582742">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36582742">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The book “The Mom Test” is a really good read with similar advice.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36583093" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36583093" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">c_o_n_v_e_x</span><span>|</span><a href="#36582678">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36582616">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36583093">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36583093">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think it&#x27;s important to differentiate between market and product research. &quot;Market research&quot; for me is much more high level.

I&#x27;m trying to get a feel for how large the market is (in $ and # of users), etc.<p>&quot;Product research&quot; is talking to prospective users&#x2F;customers.

It makes sense to try finding agencies (these could be graphic or print agencies) that print the menus. They can get you in touch with restaurant owners and maybe they know something about keeping menus up to date.<p>- I&#x27;d write down what their struggles are. For example - expensive to update high-quality printed menus, challenge to maintain onsite digital menu, challenge to match current availability with online platforms, etc.<p>- See if any of the issues they&#x27;re referring to, does actually relate to the hypothesis you&#x27;ve built. If you&#x27;re not happy with the result, iterate.<p>- Play around with use cases - list a couple of use cases (Client orders online, client cancels online, client orders on the phone, order is paid but no availability, out of stock, etc). Observe the business processes surrounding these use cases in the restaurants and see how your solution (or hypothesis) might fit there.<p>- If you don&#x27;t feel threatened by the delivery apps, try approaching them. They are usually pretty well-connected with the restaurants and know a lot of their pain points.<p>- If you can afford it, spend some time in real observations (I&#x27;d do that by sitting around a friend who has a restaurant and accepts orders).<p>If you have a prototype that you believe can be validated, try it with a restaurant. If you&#x27;re unsure how to approach a restaurant owner, manager or staff, just go there and order some food. Then present yourself and express curiosity. My experience is that if they are not busy and if you don&#x27;t ask for money, they could be talkative. The more you order, the more talkative they get.<p>Be very careful what you promise for free to the restaurants. They might ask you to build them a website or help with Windows update.<p>Good luck!

Be upfront that you are doing market research about delivery app usage in restaurants. Start with something like &quot;How is using delivery apps going for you?&quot; The opener the question the better. Most people love to complain. So your hope is that they rant about their biggest problem. If they don&#x27;t ask about other areas until they start ranting.<p>After you found a problem, ask follow up questions about how the problem is impacting them personally. (People don&#x27;t care about their company, they care about their salary, promotions, if their boss likes them etc.) This will help you later in selling your product, when you call back the person 3 months from now with a prototype.<p>When you have a concrete product or prototype that you show off, the best indicator is that people ask if they can buy the product right now. If they don&#x27;t or you have to ask them if they are interested it&#x27;s probably not solving an important problem for them.<p>PS: This works for B2B.

If a problem exists, there are a ton of people out there with some kind of solution they’re already using. You can likely beat the competition on one of three broad areas: price, quality, and availability. You can sell yours cheaper, yours can be better, or yours can be easier. Once you have that, you need to demonstrate that value to other people.<p>There are a ton of people who currently pay for your competitor’s product, and would gladly switch to yours. You need to find those people and demonstrate your product’s value to them. They will pay you instead of your competitor - that slice of the market now belongs to you, as long as you can keep it, because bear in mind there will always be a ton of people who can make a cheaper, higher quality, or more accessible version of your product.<p>You might also get lucky enough to stumble across a problem no one has solved yet, or else you might be clever enough to create a problem that your product solves. Those are once in a lifetime type opportunities, big risk versus big reward. Those are the things everybody dreams about that.<p>But you also don’t need those to get by - if you enjoy solving problems, you can get paid for it, and not invent the microchip or split the atom or chart the sea or the sky.</div><br/><div id="36583395" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36583395" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scarface_74</span><span>|</span><a href="#36583344">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36582738">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36583395">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36583395">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; There are a ton of people who currently pay for your competitor’s product, and would gladly switch to yours<p>If I’m a business owner, I’m not switching from “a well known piece of software that meets my needs” to a product built by a random indy developer to save money.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36582738" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36582738" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mindcrime</span><span>|</span><a href="#36583344">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36582567">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36582738">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36582738">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This really isn&#x27;t something that can be answered easily in an Ask HN thread.

Doesn&#x27;t matter which one, or what edition, but probably go for something written in the last 15 years or so. Even if it isn&#x27;t super up to date, a lot of the basics will still be valid.<p>The book <i>The Mom Test</i> is also good and should probably be required reading at this stage.<p>If you want more, consider searching the HN archives, as a lot has been written on this topic here over the years.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36582567" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36582567" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LeonB</span><span>|</span><a href="#36582738">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36583424">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36582567">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36582567">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Others have mentioned the mom test - I would like to mention Amy Hoy, “stacking the bricks” and in particular “the sales safari” method of qualitative research that she’s devised.<p>Some further reading&#x2F;viewing on it here - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackingthebricks.com&#x2F;video-sales-safari-in-action&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackingthebricks.com&#x2F;video-sales-safari-in-action&#x2F;</a><p>(I’ve written a book on the topic but I’d promote those others ahead of mine, any day.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="36583424" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36583424" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scarface_74</span><span>|</span><a href="#36582567">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36582965">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36583424">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36583424">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It’s not just about building a product.

One of the major pain points that restaurant owners face is the difficulty in managing and tracking orders from multiple delivery platforms.

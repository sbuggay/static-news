It all started with the Arab Spring, when the more authoritarian countries realised that they don&#x27;t have control over the communications as they used to and the less authoritarian countries realised that foreign powers can curate the content their population sees(through fake accounts or owning the platform).<p>Anyway, IMHO censorship should never be an option and to deal with issues of security we just need openness. That is, platforms with significant reach should be mandated to have open algorithm and verifiable data which can be investigated against faul play.

I also don’t think they were ever “good”. I think they are mostly just caught in a world where they have become the worlds largest advertising company but their primary platform is turning out to be less valuable. Yet because they are an advertising company they struggle to sell any products that aren’t advertisement.<p>I spent a long time in the Danish public sector, and if you don’t know this, the EU public sector is a billion dollar industry in terms of selling cloud services, and Google was never really an option. Which is sort of silly when you look at the tech. They had Office365 before it was cool, but because they couldn’t&#x2F;wouldn’t guarantee privacy concerns they were never really able to sell it outside of education. So Microsoft casually strolled along and now dominate the market completely. Google has firebase (I think it’s called) which is arguably one of the best backends for 95% or the applications that I’ve seen build in the Danish public sector, and it’s used for 0% of them because Google never understood that what Microsoft sells to IT departments in non-tech enterprise organisations isn’t tech, it’s support. When something goes wrong with Azure, your CTO can tell the organisation that they are getting hourly updates on the situation directly from Redmond. When something goes wrong with Google Cloud, your CTO can use the same chat-bot you and I can, despite the multi-million budget difference. I think the most interesting part was how Amazon entered the market with a Google mentality, but then when AWS kept loosing to Azure they figured out why and are now even more compliant to what EU enterprise wants than even Microsoft. I mean, Azure still can’t completely live up to every aspect of the GDPR in terms of who services Azure global, AWS has been compliant since around 2020. I still remember how around 2018-2019 we went from taking with whatever Amazon support you and I probably talk to, to having a sales representative call us and get us hooked up with all sorts of compliance officers. Mean while Google sort of got even worse.<p>I mean, Google actually managed to do really well in education. At least here in Denmark, but “big Google” once again got in the way. This wasn’t for lack of trying by Google education, they have this really great team of people, and I can’t imagine how frustrating it must be for them to have “big Google” stomp on all their decade long efforts by not giving things like Chromebooks and Google education better privacy tools for kids.<p>I think it’s the same story for search. Search is a business for them and over the years the MBAs have focused too much on profits and too little on products. Fair enough, things like social media has made things harder. I mean, the reason you and I type “Reddit” in to our google searches isn’t only because Google got played by SEO, it’s also because people started putting their thoughts into social media instead of running blog wheels and using smaller forums.<p>I hope Google pulls around. I don’t think they are more evil than Microsoft. As an enterprise worker I love Microsoft, they sell you support and they listen to your business needs, and all those privacy invasive tools they are pushing these days are disabled in enterprise. But they aren’t doing it because they are “good” they are doing it because that is how you sell licenses. I do think their cloud dominance may get challenged as Azure pricing a keep rising and alternative options get cheaper, but who’s going to compete with Microsoft on Office365? But as a personal user, have you used the basic windows 11? It literally has commercials in your operating system, and since Windows 10 they have been “pre-installing” stuff like Minecraft and whatever that popular mobile game they own is called. And that is in their paid product, at least google search doesn’t charge you money on top of their advertising.<p>As an anecdote I think it was also interesting to see how Apple became very enterprise “unfriendly”. They owned education before google swooped in, and one of the primary reasons Apple lost initially was because they wouldn’t let IT departments “enroll” (sorry I’m not sure what “owning” the device and OS is called in Operations terms) their devices, which meant schools couldn’t block students from doing what they wanted. That’s since been fixed, but Apple is still what I’d call enterprise “unfriendly”. That works for Apple though, they obviously have a business strategy that’s doing well. But Google doesn’t similarly have one now that the floor is sort of falling out from under a lot of these “pay with your privacy” services.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36502480" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36502480" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eastbound</span><span>|</span><a href="#36501730">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36503345">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36502155">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36502480">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36502480">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Google is evil but Microsoft owns every new monopoly:<p>- LinkedIn,<p>- GitHub,<p>- OpenAI,<p>- And the 50% monopoly that O365 is,<p>The evil is that they can use AI to generate startups: They have both business plans and code.

The best results are often from a manual as possible campaign and they make this an ever harder option to take. There needs to be far better regulation here.<p>Marketing is one of those skills where art meets science. If you let the algorithms take over they&#x27;ll often look good at a base metric but as soon as you dig around you find you&#x27;re sacrificing wider goals or mostly getting sales you would have anyway, or paying crazy amounts to finish off the budget type etc.<p>Google is a great advertising platform, but adding your money, limited controls and trusting google systems to work it out is a horrible way, and something I see all too often.

As you state, there is in fact more competiton for these terms (<i>for a reason</i>) in efficient markets (both from other manual bidders and automated bidding), but it still works (many times you end up with competitors who hit their budget caps due to their other misaligned spend). In situations where the bids cause CPA to exceed target, you simply choose to lose IS due to bids and shift resources. With automated bidding, you don&#x27;t always have this option. The key concept that people miss is that automated strategies optimize fill rate for Google-- so you end up with <i>tons</i> of longtail spend that will likely never convert and is hard to identify. Automated strategies will also abstain from auctions if they can&#x27;t hit specific goals, or will have severely limited volume.<p>Auctions may vary-- most of my managed spend (mid 8 figures, so not huge) has been in high CPC (think $5-25) verticals like home services, movers, insurance, mortgage and mattresses (insane period from 2015-2018). I have set things up manually, let Google AEs setup the &quot;recommended&quot; bid strategies (and even run longer than their suggested timeframe) and utilized known agencies, and the manual bidding (always accompanied by aggressive negatives, high AP&#x2F;IS goals) always won by large (30%+ lower CPA with <i>higher volume</i>) amounts. Performance may be drastically different in ecommerce niches where everyone is using automated strategies, as well as other factors like number of auction participants, participant budgets, sophistication and even objectives (executive spite is a valid reason-- hence Google&#x27;s target outrank share strategy). Anyone who has done PLAs&#x2F;shopping ads will be incredibly cynical due to their targeting methodology of being all inclusive with the onus of exclusions on the advertiser when the majority of errant spend is in the longtail-- good luck talking to 99% of marketers about tokenization, stemming and lemmatization for identifying negative matching strategies.<p>So yes, automated bidding <i>can</i> work better than just YOLO&#x27;ing some broad match campaigns, but most people shouting their praises, that I have encountered, are parroting their ad rep&#x27;s talking points. Any competent  performance marketer (not many) will be able to outperform automated bidding strategies, but things like scale (why bother saving 20% on 5k spend?), principal&#x2F;agent problem, or workload (or being lazy, relying on salespeople to do their job) will also have an impact.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36500833" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36500833" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">powera</span><span>|</span><a href="#36501196">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36500345">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36500833">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36500833">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For most businesses today, Google ads are not cost-effective.

Brands spend millions - obviously if someone smart came in and did testing to prove it was ineffective thus move that money elsewhere.<p>You can easily test branding dollars with things like brand lift studies, but I’ll skip over branding.<p>The majority of small business and good chunks of large companies ad spend is spent on performance marketing. These campaigns have strictly enforced goals of return on ad spend (or sometimes net profit return on ad spend). When a new client starts running big budgets they run incremental alit y tests with their internal data science team, a neutral third party vendor (paid regardless of the outcome), and with the platform their spending money on. Each team shares their analysis but brands usually just ignore the platforms numbers. The advertiser can determine in their own, with legit statistical analysis, whether purchases would’ve occurred even if they hadn’t seen an ad.<p>I don’t work on one of those teams, but I think it’s basically you spend 80% if your budget like normal on 80% of users. Then on 20% of users you use the same targeting but serve 1 single blank ad. Then you compare how the test and control groups make purchases, and how much of a lift in purchases the advertising drives. They also compare the user buckets before even doing the test to ensure users are evenly split so each group was making the same amount of purchases on average before the campaign begins. They remove outliers, etc.<p>It’s not a bunch of rich old established men in a room high giving themselves, it’s data scientists who don’t at all trust the guys spending their money. So they test the shit out of it over and over.<p>All of the raw data can be seen by the advertiser, and they track each individual impression, click, etc. that data can also be filtered through vendors to identify potential fraud, brand safety, etc.<p>I’ve had more than a couple client run an incrementality test and then stop spending on the platform because the results were too low. But I’ve had many many more be happy with their own internal analysis and increase budgets, then run another test at that budget level. I have clients who only pay us if we spend $1 and they get $2 in incremental revenue from users who their data science team would not have purchased without the ad. Those teams don’t care if they spend money, and they even get bonused on increasing incremental revenue so they constantly test new vendors and move spend to whoever performs the best.</div><br/><div id="36502005" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36502005" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">harry8</span><span>|</span><a href="#36500833">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36501923">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36501037">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36502005">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36502005">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Nothing there anyone can check which makes it indistinguishable from &quot;I know more than you and I can tell you you&#x27;re wrong.&quot; That may even be correct for all I know, it&#x27;s just not at all useful.<p>Which non-internet company is on record claiming they see better returns from google ads on racist blogs than on say, tv ads for example?

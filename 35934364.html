What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person&#x27;s life at a given moment. To put the question in general terms would be comparable to the question posed to a chess champion: &quot;Tell me, Master, what is the best move in the world?&quot; There simply is no such thing as the best or even a good move apart from a particular situation in a game and the particular personality of one&#x27;s opponent. The same holds for human existence. One should not search for an abstract meaning of life. Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone&#x27;s task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it.</div><br/><div id="35935005" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35935005" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hayst4ck</span><span>|</span><a href="#35934568">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35935601">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35935005">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35935005">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I remember reading this book and there were 3 paragraphs of philosophical value in the whole book. This is one of those three paragraphs. I found the book very disappointing. &quot;The meaning of life is to live every moment as if it had meaning?&quot; That is a thesis which felt foreign and useless. I felt no closer to meaning after reading that book.<p>It was in a self help psychology book that I thought communicated the core idea of meaning and purpose the best: <i>Meaning == Feeling</i><p>The author (I believe of: <i>running on empty</i>) made the statement that a struggle to find purpose is the same thing as a struggle to feel and that life&#x27;s purpose is to feel. Feelings are the fuel for our lives. So those with blunted emotions obviously feel no sense of purpose because the purpose of life is to feel emotions.<p>Struggling with a lack of meaning is the same thing as struggling to feel. If you knew what would make you feel, it would obviously be meaningful to interact with that.<p>Bringing this idea back to Frankl, his work becomes much more accessible: The purpose of life is to live every moment with feeling. Finding meaning means seeing what makes you feel.</div><br/><div id="35935305" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35935305" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">manmal</span><span>|</span><a href="#35934568">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35935005">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35935598">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35935305">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35935305">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">“The meaning of life is to live every moment as if it had meaning” sounds wise and livable to me.<p>&gt; a struggle to find purpose is the same thing as a struggle to feel<p>I think feeling is a means to an end, and that there are deeper reasons for a lack of purpose:<p>- Loss (eg after death of loved ones, or of abilities)<p>- Change (eg of the shape of a relationship) that is hard to adapt to<p>- Inability to end current adversity (eg emotional pain that can’t be stopped due to circumstances)<p>For those, people find “workarounds” that numb their feelings (drugs, workaholism, constant distractions etc) so they don’t have to feel the emotional pain (which they currently have no real fix for) all the time. The search for a purpose is IMO a search for anything that resolves the emotional pain. As soon as the pain is gone, “feeling” is safe again and no longer has to be suppressed.</div><br/><div id="35935619" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35935619" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hayst4ck</span><span>|</span><a href="#35934568">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35935305">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35935598">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35935619">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35935619">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I read Frankl&#x27;s book as a depressed person who saw lack of meaning as the root of my problems, namely of anhedonia (used casually, not medically). Frankl&#x27;s book is written for normal functional people. What wasn&#x27;t clear is that the state of anhedonia is not a result of lack of meaning, anhedonia <i>is</i> lack of meaning.<p>I was reading it hoping for an algorithm to find any meaning at all.<p>For you &quot;meaning&quot; seems to mean something. For me &quot;meaning&quot; was a null pointer exception. The variable name &quot;meaning&quot; is understood in a general sense, but when you try to manipulate the idea or collide it with  other ideas, everything breaks down. If you can&#x27;t de-reference &quot;meaning&quot; then Frankl&#x27;s work is quite opaque since &quot;meaning&quot; is primarily a feeling and most people&#x27;s understanding of it is intuitive rather than prescriptive. Frankl is never able to jump out of the intuitive understanding of meaning, and so for someone who the idea of &quot;meaning&quot; is not intuitive his work was quite inaccessible.<p>Once you understand that meaning <i>is</i> feeling, then you can think about meaning in a more prescriptive sense and his work starts to make more sense. I would probably have a wildly different experiencing reading it now than when I originally read it.<p>I had a childhood where my feelings did not matter very much. My dad was a narcissist and my mom was too busy bread-winning. This resulted in suppression of emotions since they had very little value. As an adult the lessons learned as a child are carried through.<p>Childhood emotional neglect is the state of not learning how to have purpose because you don&#x27;t matter. The depression stage of grief seems closer to the state of having lost meaning.<p>I guess for a summarized critique of Frankl, it&#x27;s that much like the article posted is saying, meaning is not a linear monolothic idea. If you frame the conversation around meaning as Frankl&#x27;s book does, that&#x27;s a very different conversation than one framed around emotional regulation. The emotional regulation conversation helps find meaning, but the meaning conversation is unlikely to help a person with emotional regulation.</div><br/><div id="35936402" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35936402" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">endorphine</span><span>|</span><a href="#35934568">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35935619">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35935848">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35936402">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35936402">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think you hit the nail on the head.

But meaning, creative power and fortune arrive on their own schedules, and imagining that you can or should devote every waking moment to something is absurd ..<p>&gt; the non-linear approach is .. more adaptive to the realities of power laws – of moments of high payoff or high risk - than of the day to day grind of accrual.  If our lives are rich in opportunities for meaning, rather than defined by a singular narrative arc, we can act decisively at particularly important moments rather than imagining that every moment is equally meaningful ..<p>&gt; Your children need to be fed, clothed and educated, and they need your love and guidance – but they also need to see you happy and engaged with life .. When you are honestly pursuing your own values and vision – and not subordinating them – you are more likely to generate meaning than if you are navigating a maze of compromises with some ultimate goal in mind ..<p>&gt; The heroes whose lives inspired you did what they did mostly by going out into the unknown and doing what others thought was impossible.  This is not, incidentally, a guarantee that if you do so you will succeed – for the world we live in to be a meaningful one, there must be uncertainty and risk.</i></div><br/></div></div><div id="35934556" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35934556" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">__MatrixMan__</span><span>|</span><a href="#35934683">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35935157">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35934556">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35934556">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m reminded of a scene from Soul (a Pixar film which I recommend).<p>&gt; Joe: We never found out what 22&#x27;s purpose was.<p>&gt; Jerry: Excuse me?

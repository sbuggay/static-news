This is an important, but orthogonal topic.<p>We are talking about something fairly basic, so if our standards of policing are that it is excusable that a cop does not understand... the 4th amendment... then I&#x27;m not sure it is worth distinguishing from abuse. As such level of incompetence would necessitate willfulness.<p><pre><code>  &gt; deceptive
</code></pre>
I fail to understand how you are distinguishing an antagonistic cop who understands you are not breaking the law and is actively trying to trick you into (or trick you into revealing that you are despite no meaningful evidence that a crime is taking place) is different from one that is abusing their authority. I&#x27;d go so far as to say that this is a literal act of that.<p>Look, I am happy you are willing to give the benefit of the doubt. We need people to provide such perspectives. In all honesty, I do appreciate your comment and that you are pushing back, but I think you&#x27;ll need to take a significantly different route if you are to sway me. I think continuing down this train of reasoning will fail to persuade those with similar views.

To again reference the level of incompetence...<p><pre><code>  &gt; The Fourth Amendment requires that before stopping the suspect, the police must have a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been, is being, or is about to be committed by the suspect.[0]
  &gt; The term “unreasonable” refers to any action or result that exceeds a reasonable expectation, or refers to anything beyond what would be considered “common sense.” In criminal cases, the prosecutor should explain the evidence so clearly that the average person would agree with it; if the logic of the prosecution or the certainty based on the given evidence could not be accepted by the common public, it would be unreasonable. [1]
</code></pre>
Even if you disagree with the interpretation, I hope you are able to distinguish the difference between &quot;what is right&quot; and &quot;what is legal&quot;. Because if your argument is &quot;it is legal, therefor morally correct&quot; we will never agree, just as I will not condone the actions of cheaters, and those that manufactured the housing crisis.<p>In the US, we do have the presumption of innocence. Questioning to search without probably cause is, legal or not, an abuse of power.<p>I do wish you think deeply about what the &quot;power&quot; is that is being abused. What &quot;authority&quot; mean. Because if your argument is &quot;it&#x27;s legal&quot; then I do not believe you understand this and I ask you to think a little deeper. Perhaps you&#x27;re familiar with &quot;malicious compliance?&quot; That&#x27;s enough of a hint.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;wex&#x2F;stop_and_frisk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;wex&#x2F;stop_and_frisk</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;wex&#x2F;unreasonable" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;wex&#x2F;unreasonable</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41287151" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41287151" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">montagg</span><span>|</span><a href="#41283829">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41286863">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41287096">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41286999">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41287151">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41287151">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the argument for using the line is, there is no reason in the moment not to try everything you can, no matter where you are, and you adjust based on the situation.

Over a decade ago (in California) I had met up with some friends at a park where we were going to carpool to a concert in LA. I had a medical license and my weed was locked in my trunk AND we hadn&#x27;t smoked. Cops pulled up, asked what we were doing, we explained, they asked if they could search, we said no, they did anyways. One friend had his hands in his pockets when the cops rolled up and they asked him what he had in there, so he naturally pulled them out and the cops threw him against a car and searched, saying they thought he was pulling a knife on him... I got a ticket, had to show up to court. Contested which meant another court date (I was following the law. Cop didn&#x27;t even show up!). I talked with one of the clerks because I had a calc midterm that day and he pushed me to a afternoon session. Showing up to that the judge grilled me about &quot;being late&quot; (I had docs) and I yelled at him for wasting my time, the publics time, money, and how I was scheduled for this time because I had a fucking calculus test so to stop treating me like a degenerate. That I followed the letter of the law. 15 minutes total and charges dismissed. What a shit show...<p>Another time I was visiting the Golden gate Park. I asked a ranger for directions. He said we smelled like weed. I told him SF smelled like weed. He asked to search, we walked, he grabbed us and my backpack. His evidence to give us a ticket was my still sealed bottle from the dispensary.<p>I won&#x27;t say all cops are bad, but some just want to abuse their power. I won&#x27;t say cops are good, because the ones that don&#x27;t abuse do know the ones that do.

The reason I&#x27;m a fan of these (albeit they are far from perfect[0]) is because it both creates some humanization as well as some social accountability.<p>I think some of the problems are related to the fact that parts of society don&#x27;t scale well (though some do). As population grows, so does anonymity. But a powerful tool to fight abuse of authority is by decreasing anonymity, as this creates a social pressure. There are disadvantages to cops being biased towards their communities, but I think this is better than the bias of indifference. We&#x27;re dealing with humans, and the direction in which we should _error_ should *<i>always*</i> be on the side of compassion.<p>[0] Perfection does not exist and will not.

That coincided with many cops joining white flight to the suburbs, meaning that they didn’t feel part of the cities where they served as had been the case a generation earlier, and the lurid tales of how violent &amp; well-armed drug gangs were along with how dangerous “super predators” were lead to a lot of quasi-military weaponry and tactics becoming routine with quaint things like warrants being severely undermined. I say quasi-military because I’ve known multiple combat vets to express disbelief at the poor discipline shown by cops compared to the rules they had in places like Fallujah.<p>The other big driver was the concept of qualified immunity and civil forfeiture. The modern form of the latter was invented during the drug war and formally embraced by the Reagan administration as a way to make elevated police presence self-funding, and that opened up a lot of room for abuse since it created huge conflicts of interest and the growth of qualified immunity removed the potential counterbalance of personal accountability.</div><br/><div id="41286501" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41286501" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hammock</span><span>|</span><a href="#41283829">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41285843">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41286676">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41286501">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41286501">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;people - one of the more interesting shifts was how Irish immigrants went from being over-policed to comprising large fractions of many forces<p>Can you tell how this came to be?</div><br/><div id="41286783" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41286783" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">acdha</span><span>|</span><a href="#41283829">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41286501">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41286676">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41286783">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41286783">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There are a couple of different things coming together but the big one is that while they were first considered degenerates, criminal, drunks, etc. they weren’t denied all of the legal status whiteness offered.

The standard is literally ‘could have possibly happened&#x2F;occurred’, not did or beyond a reasonable doubt, etc.)<p>Practically in California, you’re required to turn them all in for storage or sell them within 24 hrs of being served - either selling them to a dealer or turning them in to the cops or to a very hard to find, expensive, and specialized type of gun dealer who doesn’t advertise.<p>Keep in mind - accused - not a finding of or anything - and the court is happy to issue these orders ex-parte based off accusations which the impacted party has no chance to rebut or is necessarily even aware of at the time the order is issued. And the bar to issue it is very, very low. The accusations don’t even need to make sense or be supported by any police calls or the like.<p>In theory? Fine. In practice, a very common abuse and harassment tactic. Or actually necessary.<p>If you can’t find the specialized type of dealer and get him everything within 24 hrs, and can’t sell everything for penny’s on the dollar to a standard gun dealer in time, then you have to turn them into the cops.

They also aren&#x27;t tasked to go get that information, since their job is to decide a particular as in an expeditious manner.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41284025" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41284025" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">paddy_m</span><span>|</span><a href="#41283829">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41285347">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41287792">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41284025">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41284025">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I once heard of a behavioral economics paper that said you can reliably predict a judge&#x27;s ruling on a legal or ethics matter based on what is best for the legal profession.</div><br/><div id="41285108" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41285108" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">giantg2</span><span>|</span><a href="#41283829">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41284025">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41287792">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41285108">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41285108">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is why judicial records are so secret that you can&#x27;t even subpoena exculpatory evidence from them.

There are judicial philosophy reasons for that, but also, statutes and regulations can be changed in response to court rulings. That said, the conservatives tend to be literalists from the perspective of the legislature or regulator at the time the law was enacted, though all the justices (conservative and liberal) recognize that it’s a fiction to say Congress has a single point of view.<p>When it comes to interpreting the constitution, conservatives likewise tend to be focused on the point of view at enactment. But it’s even more of a fiction to say that the states had a single point of view, and in any case, the text of the constitution often isn’t precise in the way contemporary statutes are. So the conservatives are guided more strongly by the historical evidence about what the sovereign states would have “understood” themselves to be giving up, in replacing the Articles of Confederation with a central federal government.<p>Given that, they interpret the Fourth Amendment by reference to the historical evidence of what phenomena it was responding to. And as a historical matter, the aim of the amendment was to require warrants, not to narrow the scope of what could be searched or seized. So where there’s probable cause that a crime has been committed, a warrant may issue, and it can be directed at the property that “committed” the crime, since that was a known practice in English law at the time.</div><br/><div id="41284558" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41284558" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alistairSH</span><span>|</span><a href="#41283427">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41284178">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41287577">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41284558">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41284558">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are these warrants issued retroactively?

The purpose of law is to regulate certain behaviors; it is not an exercise in mathematics or formal logic. This seems self-obvious to me, but as a normative claim there is not much i can say to convince you if you disagree.<p>To that end, i think criminalizing the wrong conduct is worse than mild ambiguity in laws, when the ambiguity can largely be resolved through common sense.

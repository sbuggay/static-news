A web page? LaTeX has a steep learning curve, but it is very well understood, it doesn&#x27;t churn needlessly. That is extremely valuable if you don&#x27;t want to spend your time learning again and again how to do the same thing this week. PDF with all its problems are also well understood, they can be archived. Some nation states require certain documents to be archived in PDF. I.e. you can be relatively sure that there will be PDF readers in 50 or 100 years that can display and print our PDFs. I have my doubts whether it will be possible to display a modern web page of today in a browser in 100 years without constantly maintaining the web page.<p>&gt; I cam understand e.g. biologists doing it, but when CS folks who should know alternatives do it, I&#x27;m evermore baffled, especially given the awkwardness of using e.g. LaTeX.<p>In my experience it is the other way around: mathematicians, computer scientists and physicists are those using LaTeX the most. Probably, because they are already familiar with programming languages. Hence a markup language is less of a hurdle for them.<p>But have you tried setting math in something else than LaTeX? LaTeX is still the gold standard for math formulas.<p>Or consider lecture slides. Professors often want to develop their slides over one or two decades. Just imagine using PowerPoint to manage a few thousand slides (one course over a semester). And imagine keeping that file in a workable state over a decade in PowerPoint. Good luck. Whereas it is no problem to do that with LaTeX and git.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

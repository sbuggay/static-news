And maybe the students already have exposure to rust in other courses? I hope so, anyway. If not, it would be like teaching an introductory web dev course in Elixir. Students would learn a lot, but it sure wouldn&#x27;t help them get their foot in the door at their first jobs. I&#x27;ve definitely taken classes that were clearly intended to be practical in which the teacher either taught it through their weirdly specific lens of familiarity, or had pet concepts about the &quot;correct&quot; way to do things that weren&#x27;t in accordance with the rest of the world, or assume that the weird circuitous way they learned something was somehow superior because they&#x27;re just so dang smart.

Game engines are usually way more. Asset management, physics, UI, possibly scripting, possibly networking, animations, usually some sort of scene editor, etc. All of those with many many subfields and complexities.</div><br/><div id="41546111" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41546111" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">badsectoracula</span><span>|</span><a href="#41545882">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41546111">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41546111">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well, here is the thing though: you don&#x27;t need most of that rendering stuff to learn how to make a <i>game engine</i> - if anything it might actually be better to not focus too much on the rendering as there are many people with the misconception that a game engine is really all about its renderer when in most engines it only is a small fraction of it (i remember checking my own engine some time ago and only around 10-15% of the codebase was about the rendering, i mentioned it to some Godot developer who said that this number checked with Godot too and years ago a AAA game i worked on also had the rendering bits be around 7-10% of the codebase too, so i think on average the percentage is more or less stable) and there are a lot more things going on.<p>The content on the site seems to also follow, even quickly browsing from the materials there and despite using Vulkan (which is much more verbose than necessary), it still only mentions basic things like rendering sprites, meshes, some scene representation and leaves lighting and shadows (which only get a couple of paragraphs to describe the ideas behind shadow mapping) at the very end (up to that point everything is unlit&#x2F;fullbright). Even lighting is only described at its basics and the page mentions some external resources to learn more if anyone wants to.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

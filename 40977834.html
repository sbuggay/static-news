In the first, you have action fights that require quick hand-eye coordination and skilled reflexes. In the 2nd you just choose actions from menus, no hand-eye coordination nor reflexes required.<p>To me, an RPG, has always meant the latter (choose [attack, magic, item] from a menu). Wizardry, Bard&#x27;s Tale (Apple II), FF7 are RPGs. A Link to the Past, Link&#x27;s Adventure, Breath of the Wild, are not.<p>I know the letters RPG stand for &quot;Role Playing Game&quot; but if we&#x27;re going to go down that route, Flight Sim is an RPG. You play the role of an airplane pilot. Mario Tennis, would also be an RPG. you play the role of a cartoon tennis players. GTA5 is an RPG. You play the role of a member of a street gang.<p>Since we know that&#x27;s not what people mean when they say RPG, we&#x27;re still left making sure were discussing comparable games. IMO, Zelda games (nearly all action games) are not comparable to Final Fantasy or other J-RPG games (nearly all select from a menu games). Their similarity is at most, they are set in a middle-earth tolken-esk setting where you fight monsters with swords.

Later on early CRPGs would continue with this due to technical limitations, but as tech improved, these limitations should have gone away. In that sense if you are still looking for the original goal of realizing a fantasy world, BOTW or Bethesda&#x27;s games would be the &quot;successors&quot;. The ImSim is also quite close, albeit they exist in more restricted sense than a fully realized world.<p>JRPGs took a different direction in largely throwing away the original goals and instead idolizing the abstractions themselves. Turns out there is a big market and appeal for this, as author himself points out. So when it come to newcomers moving in to the RPG genre, there might be alot of confusion because theres different crowds playing for different reasons.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40982269" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40982269" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">loveparade</span><span>|</span><a href="#40981687">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40982300">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40982804">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40982269">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40982269">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Now add things like Diablo 2 or Elden Ring to the mix, both of which are officially categorized as action rpgs.

The key aspect of the RPG is that you play a character in a virtual world. Other comments tried to claim that Flight Sim is an RPG by some definitions. It isn&#x27;t. You&#x27;re flying a plane. An RPG would be you as the pilot or co-pilot where there is gameplay outside of flying.<p>There are common tropes in RPGs like XP, levels, stats and better items but these aren&#x27;t necessary. Nor is magic. Even in a fantasy world.<p>Compare this to, say, a pure fantasy arena game wher eall you do is combat. Even with progression it&#x27;s not an RPG.<p>I generally prefer turn-based RPGs and strategy games. I particularly hate RTS games that require hummingbird level APS. I play games to chill out. But Breath of the Wild is an exception to that rule. BotW is truly one of the most amazing games ever made. The feeling you have as you wander Hyrule is so rarely achieved in any game.<p>It&#x27;s also worth adding that BotW is what I would call &quot;JRPG lite&quot;.

Don&#x27;t they appeal to the same players and have much the same, well, vibe (which is what genre distinctions ultimately boil down to)?<p>We do distinguish between e.g. real-time and turn-based strategy games, but we recognise that that&#x27;s a relatively fine distinction within a broader genre.<p>&gt; Flight Sim is an RPG. You play the role of an airplane pilot.<p>No you don&#x27;t. There is no pilot in the game; you might as well be an autonomous aeroplane. The game is about flying, which is not a role; flying is something that may happen in stories, but stories are not about flying, even novels where the central character is a pilot will be all about stuff that isn&#x27;t in a flight sim.<p>&gt; Mario Tennis, would also be an RPG. you play the role of a cartoon tennis players.<p>But again, that isn&#x27;t a role; there are no stories about cartoon tennis players, and if there were then they&#x27;d be about things that aren&#x27;t in the game.<p>&gt; GTA5 is an RPG. You play the role of a member of a street gang.<p>I haven&#x27;t played that one yet, but I hear it&#x27;s getting that way; narrative and character progression are becoming a bigger part of the game than driving cars or whatever the earlier entries in the series were about.<p>&gt; IMO, Zelda games (nearly all action games) are not comparable to Final Fantasy or other J-RPG games (nearly all select from a menu games).<p>But why should that matter, and even if it does why would you draw the line there? Zelda etc. hardly demand a high skill level in terms of twitch FPS-like mechanics; whether you will win a given fight is determined far more by your character&#x27;s progression (both equipment and &quot;stats&quot;, even if you only have one stat in Zelda) than by the player&#x27;s skill level. Nier;Automata&#x27;s combat is real-time and quite difficult (more so than Zelda I would say), but if you wanted to draw a line between &quot;Zelda-like&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy-like&quot; it would clearly belong on the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; side of it. I was trying to think back to whether The Last Remnant is real-time or menu-based battle to use as an example and I honestly can&#x27;t remember, because it simply doesn&#x27;t matter for a game like this.<p>(I can see an argument for splitting off Soulsbourne style games, where there is a much higher skill ceiling and very little in-game narrative, into a separate genre. But Zelda would not go with them)<p>&gt; Their similarity is at most, they are set in a middle-earth tolken-esk setting where you fight monsters with swords.<p>It&#x27;s not just that. They put a relatively high amount of effort (effectively or otherwise) into worldbuilding and character. They have character progression as a central part of the gameplay. They try to let you be a character in a story (those stories are often ten-a-penny Tolkien knockoffs, but not always). That&#x27;s a coherent shared philosophy of game design, and whether you use real-time or menu-driven combat is just a tiny implementation decision within that.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40982284" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40982284" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kibwen</span><span>|</span><a href="#40981687">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40979065">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40982284">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40982284">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If the author is reading this, I highly recommend you look into the history of text adventures and MUDs (multi-user dungeons), as the post completely omits them despite the fact that they are almost literally &quot;RPGs with command-line interfaces&quot;.

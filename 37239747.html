And that is - always be ready to walk out. This mostly means able, not just willing. Never put yourself in a position where you are cornered and have no way out. This is where &quot;fuck you money&quot; comes in, usually. If you know you will have food on the table, roof above your head and a bed to sleep in, your perspective will be quite different than a person that is one blown up tyre away from getting evicted.<p>And secondly, when it comes to jobs, always look for a job while employed. And not just that, you can use that to renegotiate your salary and benefits with your current employer because hiring new person would also mean mentoring them in the company culture and know-how and things like that, that you already know. So it is a cost to them that might be, and usually is, much higher than increasing your salary.<p>And a tip for the road, make sure your pay increases every year, either with inflation or based on agreed upon percentage(like 5% a year, for example). Inflation is universal and companies increase their prices accordingly, yet workers never require increase of their salaries, usually until years later.</div><br/><div id="37245991" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37245991" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">killjoywashere</span><span>|</span><a href="#37245532">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37241452">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37245991">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37245991">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">He who cares the least controls the situation.</div><br/><div id="37246425" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37246425" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">toasted-subs</span><span>|</span><a href="#37245532">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37245991">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37241452">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37246425">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37246425">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Similarly, not hitting a gift horse in the mouth is a good idea.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37241452" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37241452" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xyzelement</span><span>|</span><a href="#37245532">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37242046">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37241452">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37241452">[51 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I used to work in trading and I think some of the principles I learned there apply directly to salary negotiations.<p>Two key things I think about all the time are price discovery and competition. Price discovery means that in some illiquid markets, you don&#x27;t really know what a thing will trade at unless you try to trade it (which itself reveals some information to the counterparty but that&#x27;s not important in the job case)<p>From that point of view, I am always surprised to hear people who hate interviewing, are reluctant to interview, etc. Interviewing is the only real way to learn &quot;the market&quot; - what offers to you would actually look like, and other information as well. Like if you always get offers at the low end of a range - or if you always fail interviews - is very good signal that you can act on.<p>Competition - when we traded bonds, we&#x27;d always go to multiple dealers for quotes. The dealers would know that we always ask at least X of their competitors by rule, so they knew that whatever number they gave us, we&#x27;d compare against others. That prompted them to strike the balance between a good deal for them and a price we&#x27;d actually accept. From that point of view, the best negotiating advice is to have multiple offers, because (1) you see what the highest one is (2) you can see how close or dispersed they are and you can infer something from that (3) they give you leverage. EG: let&#x27;s say you want job X most, but job Y gave you $20K more on the offer or whatever. You can always tell job X &quot;I&#x27;d love to work with you but it&#x27;s hard to accept a lower offer, can you match?&quot; This isn&#x27;t even a game, you&#x27;d be saying this sincerely. Or, if your offers are close, you can push the highest one a bit because you know they aren&#x27;t so far out of the norm with more confidence.</div><br/><div id="37243919" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37243919" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">atomicnumber3</span><span>|</span><a href="#37241452">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37241970">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37243919">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37243919">[21 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;the best negotiating advice is to have multiple offers&quot;<p>This is borderline &quot;get in the job cannon and blast off to jobland&quot; territory.<p>Also - it can be terrifically difficult to line up multiple simultaneous offers because companies would rather explode their offer than generally let people get a better leverage.

So there&#x27;s usually 3-4 months between when everyone agrees and when they eventually join.<p>The only time things happen quickly is when someone is jobless, or if they already handed in their notice, they were going to join company X and you manage to snipe them in that 3-4 month period before they&#x27;ve started at company X.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37245607" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37245607" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vidarh</span><span>|</span><a href="#37241452">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37243919">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37245716">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37244121">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37245607">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37245607">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree it can be hard to line up multiple at the same time, but unless you&#x27;re in a desperate situation you can get much the same effect by being prepared to walk.

At some point you have to realize that your ability to grow depends on your ability to get your nerves under control. How you do that is the next question but that could be one observation.<p>You can seek patterns of what kind of interviews you tend to fail out on. Eg, is it coding, algorithmic, problem solving, behavioral, whatever. Once you have that zeroed in, you can ask yourself (and the internet): how can I get better at X type of interview.<p>More generally, you can seek for patterns of what kinds of questions surprised you and you had to make shit up on the spot, but could have been better prepped? EG if you go &quot;hmm let&#x27;s see&quot; if you are asked about the coolest thing you&#x27;ve worked on or whatever, maybe that&#x27;s the kind of topic you can pregame and have a story for.<p>Another maybe subtler thing is reading the interviewer. What are the things you were saying&#x2F;doing where the interviewer was visibly happy&#x2F;impressed vs confused, where did they say &quot;that&#x27;s great, go on&quot; and where did they go &quot;hmm.. but what about..&quot; In the moment you may have just taken the &quot;what about&quot; as a prompt but in reality they may have seen you struggle and tried to help you - what can you do to prep for that type of questions next time?<p>I can go on - but the conclusion is something like this - I know a bunch of people who every interview they had, they think they nailed it and then they are totally shocked to not advance.

Of all the salary negotiations I’ve done in the past decade, I can’t remember anyone who asked us to make a price first and then didn’t counter with a token $5K or $10K (or more depending on position) counter request. So the easy bet is to take your mid-range comp target, subtract $5K, and then most candidates will end up at your target after they “negotiate”. It’s basically a script that everyone who reads internet advice follows, and once you see it play out you can start to predict it.<p>If you want to get the upper end of what companies are willing to pay, you often have to start by naming your price and letting them negotiate down. This is scary to people who don’t have a lot of data or who are afraid of being told “no”.

Yes, 210 is &quot;within budget&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t mean negotiating for less has no benefit. That&#x27;s still budget he could now use for something else.<p>In my experience any number you give is <i>not</i> going to be interpreted as your absolute minimum.

If you say 210, then, as noted above, you&#x27;re restricting yourself to just the bottom 20% of that range no matter what.<p>If you give no number and the manager offers 200, when his range is 200-250, that probably means he views you as a baseline hire and you wouldn&#x27;t have gotten 210 anyway if you&#x27;d given that number first. In any case you&#x27;re no worse off not giving a number; the key point is that the manager views you as a baseline hire.<p>If you give no number and you&#x27;re a good enough hire that the manager would give you at least 210, he&#x27;ll probably <i>offer</i> 210.

I think they will assume the opposite: that your negotiating position is weak. Someone who already has good offers on the table, or expects to get them soon, doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to commit to a number up front.

(Calling in sick <i>might</i> be different if you do it often enough that your boss starts wondering what&#x27;s going on.)

Even by international standards that’s absurdly cheap , but this is a YC backed company, I don’t think their head is in the sand (though I do suspect YC coaches founders to play moneyball with hiring as YC companies as a whole seem to pay far below average).<p>There’s many companies that consider 150-200k as “standard”.<p>And there’s still many companies paying 400-600k for senior engineers. I thought in the “tech recession” with the interest rates up this wouldn’t be available for a while but an acquaintance who got laid off from Twitter did the “grind interview prep and interview a dozen companies simultaneously” strategy just this summer in 2023 and got multiple competing 500k+ offers (all liquid) for staff SWE including from some companies I didn’t realize paid that much like HubSpot.<p>Despite many great offers he also encountered many companies that tried to lowball by claiming “salaries are going down for engineers” but that turned out to be wishful thinking and&#x2F;or a bluff on the company’s part given his final result.<p>So basically there is no “market rate” for senior engineers but to the extent there is one a huge percentage look to massively go under it. I don’t blame them as it’s part of the game but just be aware many companies say things like “we want the best and are willing to pay for it” but then lowball and try to bluff engineers into thinking “the market” is much lower than reality.

Most companies have no real perspective on if they are in the 60th percentile by comp or the 95th percentile by comp for a role. Some companies will also slot you at different levels based on a number of factors including different levels meaning different things at different companies.  If you&#x27;re trying to get your first FAANG job and generally haven&#x27;t worked in other high comp roles the advice certainly applies, in that you&#x27;re likely to underestimate what&#x27;s possible and shoot yourself in the foot early.

The CTO got <i>mad</i> with a big M, saying that he didn&#x27;t want to be blackmailed or held hostage of whatever.  Threw a big tantrum and we basically lost an engineer.<p>As I said, it was the one occurrence in my 20 years in the industry so it&#x27;s not very common.

Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, H1B comp reports, ask your friends, there are tons of resources to do this.<p>2) Set a &quot;reach&quot; salary based on #1 and ask for that up front. 20% above your target salary is a good starting point. This accomplishes two things: a) it immediately weeds out all the spam recruiters and low-balling companies without wasting hours of your time on interviews; and b) it puts you in the right place to negotiate with the companies that are serious rather than trying to play chicken the entire time.<p>3) Set a floor below which you walk away and stick to it. The floor is going to be different for different companies. If there&#x27;s a company you really want to work for because they&#x27;re doing interesting things and you like the people there, your floor should be lower than at a generic job you&#x27;re just considering as a ladder rung.<p>Will this advice potentially get you less than the absolute max you could make?

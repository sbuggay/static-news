Strongly typed dynamic language where you can optionally specify types for the extra performance&#x2F;correctness if need be (especially with SBCL).<p>Honestly, I think weak typing is more of an issue than dynamic typing and people  cry for static types when they suffer mostly from the former.<p>Dynamic typing is great because it allows you to have extremely complex types for basically free. It allows for insane expressiveness. It also makes prototyping much easier and does not force you into over-specifying in you types early on. In dynamic language most of your types are the most general type that would work by default while static types forces you to use very specific types (especially when lacking structural typing.)<p>If you want to allow just half the expressiveness of dynamic languages in your static language you will quickly find huge complexity with dependent types, long compile time, cryptic error messages and whatnot.<p>Generally, I think gradual typing is rising in popularity for good reason.

PreScheme [0] is an example of a statically typed Scheme that composes with the host Scheme.

If you mistakenly pass a string to a function expecting an integer, you better hope that that is properly handled, otherwise you risk having type errors at runtime, or worse—no errors, and silent data corruption. That function also needs to be very explicit about this, but often the only way to do that is via documentation, which is often not good enough, or flat out wrong. All of this amounts to a lot of risk and operational burden.<p>Python&#x27;s answer has historically been duck typing, which doesn&#x27;t guarantee correctness so it&#x27;s not a solution, and is more recently addressing it with gradual typing, which has its own issues and limitations. Primarily that if specifying types is optional, most programmers will not bother, or will just default to `any` to silence the type checker. While for JS we had to invent entirely new languages that compile to it, and we&#x27;ve reached the point where nobody sane would be caught working with plain JS in 2024.<p>Static typing, in turn, gives you a compile time safety net. It avoids a whole host of runtime issues, reduces the amount of exhaustive and mechanical tests you need to write, while also serving as explicit documentation. Code is easier to reason about and maintain, especially on large projects. You do lose some of the expressiveness and succinctness of dynamic typing, but what you gain with static typing is far more helpful than these minor benefits.</div><br/><div id="41654338" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41654338" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">farhanhubble</span><span>|</span><a href="#41648574">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41653497">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41649466">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41654338">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41654338">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Dynamic typing with deeply nested data forces you to put type bandaids all over the code.

I think the &quot;define_inlinable&quot; macro is a great example of macro usage, but it is clearly a way to circumvent the inliner&#x27;s apparent short comings. I would like to be able to understand what heuristic the optimizer is using to see if there is a sensible default function construction style&#x2F;idiom that is more appealing to the optimizer for inlining. However, I am reminded of the inlining discussion in Chandler Carruth&#x27;s talk (Understanding Compiler Optimization) from a few years ago where he discusses how obscure and seemingly arbitrary, in general, inlining heuristics and their optimization passes are in practice.

The domain of an interactive language and a &quot;compiled&quot; language are quite different.<p>Given the entirety of the program made available to the compiler all at once, there are high level derivations that can happen notably through flow analysis to let the compiler make better decisions. But do that in an interactive environment when the rug can be pulled out of any of the assumption the compiler made, and things get messy quite quickly.<p>One interesting tidbit for Java is that the developers of the compiler advocate &quot;idiomatic&quot; Java.

Let the compiler developers trick the compiler.<p>That&#x27;s evident here in this article when they wrote the function that tests the types of the parameters. Raw Scheme, naturally, doesn&#x27;t allow you to specify parameter types, not the way you can in Common Lisp, for example. And, either Guile does not have an specific extension to support this, or simply the compiler looks for this type checking pattern at the top of a function to make optimization determinations. On the one hand, it could be more succinct with a specialized facility, but on the other, this is &quot;just Scheme&quot;.<p>So, in effect by checking for the type of the variable, they&#x27;re implicitly declaring the type of the variable for the &quot;sufficiently smart&quot; compiler to make better decisions.<p>The counter example is the &quot;define-inline&quot; construct, and thus not standard Scheme (though readily replaced by a &quot;no-op&quot; macro if one was interested in porting the code).</div><br/><div id="41654948" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41654948" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hayley-patton</span><span>|</span><a href="#41648456">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41651564">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41653336">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41654948">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41654948">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; But do that in an interactive environment when the rug can be pulled out of any of the assumption the compiler made, and things get messy quite quickly.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bibliography.selflanguage.org&#x2F;_static&#x2F;dynamic-deoptimization.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bibliography.selflanguage.org&#x2F;_static&#x2F;dynamic-deopti...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41653336" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41653336" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eru</span><span>|</span><a href="#41648456">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41651564">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41654948">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41654722">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41653336">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41653336">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Given the entirety of the program made available to the compiler all at once, there are high level derivations that can happen notably through flow analysis to let the compiler make better decisions.

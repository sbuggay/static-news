The financial policy gave incentives to making more EVs, some enterprising individuals managed to manufacture very low quality cars while funding it with &quot;shared car startup model&quot;. Then when these car sharing schemes went bankrupt (because many cars wouldn&#x27;t complete a single trip without malfunction) they had enormous profits regardless. How? The cost of manufacturing was funded by investors in these startups(a third party, or a client from the manufacturer&#x27;s point of view). After they went bankrupt there would be no warranty claims etc. While the per car gov subsidy was pure profit.<p>I cannot understand why anyone in the West would believe any economic statistic or number coming out of China.

And manufacturers need to transact just like any other sort of business; I don&#x27;t see how taxing transactions encourages manufacturers relative to other firms.<p>I like the tax on advertising though.  I would tweak it so the tax only kicks in once your spending on ads exceeds, say, $10 million per year.  That way innovative new products can advertise to customers tax-free.

Interest rates need to be held <i>at least</i> where they are long term, which is still lower than they were before they were dropped to distract from the needless and destructive conquering of Iraq.<p>I would say that eliminating tax deduction for advertising expenses is the wrong way to go about things as well. Adverting is a bona fide business expense, so it makes sense as a deduction. Rather, a <i>direct tax</i> should be levied on advertising, to account for the externalities of us all having to suffer the cacophony. This could even be done state-by-state rather than federally (a la sales tax).<p>Wholeheartedly agree on the certification.

Yet economic security and military security are now inseparable.</i><p>I think a big, poorly understood part of these stories is &quot;advanced games&quot; or &quot;long term degeneration.&quot;<p>Take government procurement, like fighter jets or new hospitals. Post-war, the way this worked was &quot;cost-plus.&quot; Companies accounted for their costs and were promised a fixed profit. The obvious flaw is that companies lose interest in efficiency. But... it did work during the war and resulted in more tanks, ships and jets than anyone thought possible. It also worked post war.<p>But, such games mature. Under &quot;cost-plus&quot; a company increases profits by spending. That&#x27;s an incentive that will bite eventually. So... they move to competitive bidding. This degenerates into a lawyers-only game, etc.<p>That&#x27;s the administrative layer, but game maturation also exists at the political layer. Rooseveltism was a thing for a while, and then anti-rooseveltism became it&#x27;s competition. During the neoliberal era, industrial policy was the devil. Half the international institutions (trade deals, imf, wb)  exist mostly to enforce bans and limits on industrial policy.<p>During this era, when governments&#x27; job was to &quot;get out of the way,&quot; the alternative to (now evil) industrial policy was either big trade deals, or tax policies. Tax breaks and tax complexity counted as &quot;getting out of the way&quot; while trade deals structured markets (eg auto-manufacturing) with more detailed rules than a Soviet five year plan.<p>Anyway.... the statement about making economics a defence job... it feels like an attempt to declare bankruptcy on the &quot;trade-deals and tax breaks&quot; era, and move to an weirder and more awkward model.

It&#x27;s a hot topic with 100 years of history near the centre of political and economic discourse. Contentious claims are inevitable.<p>The reverse claim also gets made, and whether or not the claim is &quot;supported,&quot; it&#x27;s never sufficiently supported. The reality is that there&#x27;s a whole debate with vountermoves behind either claim.<p>One side looks at employment, tonnage, plant construction, anecdote and common sense. The other looks at accounting.<p>Accounting says that &quot;manufacturing&quot; has increased. Skeptics consider this an accounting fiction. The reality is that &quot;manufacturing&quot; in 2023 is not quantifiable in the way that it was in 1923. Accounting semantics are abstract and past a point turn into  a matter of accountants&#x27; naming convention.<p>A 1923 ford factory represented most of the &quot;manufacturing&quot; represented by the cars that they produced. As the industry splits into OEMs, T1s, T2s, toolers and whatnot^ we move into more abstract definitions. Has one of Ford&#x27;s industrial engineering teams ceased to be &quot;manufacturing,&quot; because they now design processes for a Mexican subsidiary? How about the US-based management&#x2F;overherheads for the subsidiary? Irl, accountants can represent these any way that the tax man, board or market prefers. The same physical change can represent 20% or 5% decrease in manufacturing.<p>There&#x27;s just a point where quantifications fail, and can&#x27;t be used to decide such debates conclusively.<p>Where we&#x27;re at now, imo, requires us to keep purpose in mind, and forget about a single, neutral quantification. If you&#x27;re quantifying manufacturing for maximum military potential, employment or resilience to trade problems... You probably need different definitions&#x2F;quantifications of &quot;manufacturing.&quot;<p>^These specific conventions were created to structure trade deals and regulate tarrifs.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37542162" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37542162" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thewanderer1983</span><span>|</span><a href="#37542602">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37539258">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37542162">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37542162">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The problem is larger than Advanced Manufacturing.

Manufacturing companies by and large are stubborn with outdated practices that haven’t kept up with the times. The number of mechanical engineers who switched to web development, for instance, because of poor pay and improper management is insane. And during the pandemic, even more either fled or were pushed out from lack of opportunity. It’s easy to blame these policies and say that industries aren’t connected, but when these firms are refusing to embrace new technologies and take calculated risks, they do this to themselves all by themselves.<p>They commonly keep employees using the simplest heuristics that someone at some point in the past developed which worked then, so why break it? And they push this mediocrity throughout the entire organization and industry. Then they swap out one failed CEO for the same person with a different name like a pair of gloves, wondering what ever happened as there was nothing more that could be done. Meanwhile their ageist management policies block out the insights of the young, all but ensuring that no new ideas are brought into the mix—all until it’s time for another bailout.</div><br/><div id="37540871" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37540871" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throw__away7391</span><span>|</span><a href="#37539258">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37540129">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37540871">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37540871">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">OK, but this was also true of many software companies in the past.

Funny enough - that plant couldn&#x27;t attract better quality employees.<p>The articles has an entire section dedicated to workforce education...great! but as with all post secondary education in our modern society, the participants are (in large part) motivated by the economic potential of that pursuit. If I can make the same working at starbucks (with benefits because employer scale) as I can as an electrical tradesperson (yes, there are levels but not all are union) why would I pick the one that destroys my body? Why bother with workforce education if your leaders don&#x27;t respect their work and will seek to Taylorize them instead of partner with them. Apprenticeship and training works in Germany and Japan because the jobs are not awful. It works because of the culture of work. I would argue this is actually the same reason we lag in another marker the article talks about - robots per worker.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37540191" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37540191" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">20after4</span><span>|</span><a href="#37539901">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37539909">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37540434">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37539957">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37540191">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37540191">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Laws are so easily changed.

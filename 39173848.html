I was driving a Volkswagen ID4 - their mid-size electric car - the other day, and my dog was on the back seat.<p>She triggered the seat belt alarm, but not straight away, only once we were on the German Autobahn. It showed the icon on the dashboard, then it started beeping. Then it started beeping louder. Finally, it settled into a loud, high pitched beep that continued throughout my drive, designed to force me to obey.<p>This is directly dangerous. I&#x27;m going 130km&#x2F;h - what the fuck am I supposed to do about the seatbelts now? Not that I even wanted to...<p>It is this idea of &quot;forcing your customer to obey by inflicting discomfort&quot; that&#x27;s puzzling me. I can&#x27;t think of any other industry or product that would think this would be a good idea. Just show me the damn icon and if I decide to ignore it, that&#x27;s my choice...</div><br/></div></div><div id="39174179" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39174179" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">m463</span><span>|</span><a href="#39174136">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39174195">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39174179">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39174179">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The problem with a tesla is that it is like a finicky partner.<p>You&#x27;re in love.

Everything that was before was terrible.<p>And everything is getting better!<p>But at some point, you realize some things are never going to change, and you are going to have to live with it.<p>- it is dangerously hard to use any control that doesn&#x27;t have a dedicated button.  The touchscreen in a moving car is a moving mess of tiny targets crowded too close together<p>- even if you have a dedicated control for say wipers, you will still curse interval wipers.<p>- if you get a newer car, you (basically) won&#x27;t HAVE any dedicated controls.  no turn signal stalk.  No gear stalk - PRND - it will guess for you (really)<p>- some functions - tesla doesn&#x27;t care about, and never will.<p>- don&#x27;t get a flat tire if you care about your time.  If you can&#x27;t change a spare, nvm.<p>- going forward - cram all controls&#x2F;settings and information displays into a small ipad.

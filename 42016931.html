There are higher Geekbench 6 CPU scores, even forgetting the ones that appear to be fake or at least broken.<p>But secondly, that would absolutely not indicate that it is the &quot;fastest single-core performer in consumer computing&quot;. That would indicate that it is the highest scoring Geekbench 6 CPU in consumer computing.<p>Whether or not that&#x27;s actually a good proxy for the former statement is up to taste, but in my opinion it&#x27;s not. It gives you a rough idea of where the performance stands, but what you really need to be able to compare CPUs is a healthy mix of synthetic benchmarks and real-world workloads. Things like the time it takes to compile some software, scores in video game benchmarks, running different kinds of computations, time to render videos in Premiere or scenes in Blender, etc.<p>In practice though, it&#x27;s hard to make a good Apples-to-Intels performance comparison, since it will wind up crossing both OS boundaries and CPU architecture boundaries, which adds a lot of variables. At least real world tests will give an idea of what it would be like day-to-day even if it doesn&#x27;t necessarily reveal truisms about which CPU is the absolute best design.<p>Of course it&#x27;s reasonable to use Geekbench numbers to get an idea of where a processor stands, especially relative to similar processors, but making a strong claim like this based off of Geekbench numbers is pretty silly, all things considered.<p>Still... these results are truly quite excellent. It would suffice to say that if you did take the time to benchmark these processors you would find the M4 processor performs extremely well against other processors, including ones that suck up more juice for sure, but this isn&#x27;t too surprising overall. Apple is already on the TSMC N3E process, whereas AMD is currently using TSMC N4P and Intel is currently using TSMC N3B on their most cutting edge chips. So on top of any advantages they might have for other reasons (like jamming the RAM onto the CPU die, or simply better processor design) they <i>also</i> have a process node advantage.</div><br/><div id="42023919" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42023919" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">GeekyBear</span><span>|</span><a href="#42023627">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42024544">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42023919">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42023919">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">SPEC has been the industry standard benchmark for comparing the performance of systems using different instruction sets for decades now.<p>Traditionally, Anandtech would have been the first media outlet to publish the single core and multicore integer and floating point SPEC test results for a new architecture, but hopefully some trusted outlet will take up the burden.<p>For instance, Anandtech&#x27;s Zen 5 laptop SKU results vs the M3 from the end of July:<p>&gt; Even Apple&#x27;s M3 SoC gets edged out here in terms of floating point performance, which, given that Apple is on a newer process node (TSMC N3B), is no small feat.

You don&#x27;t know how annoying fan noise is until you get a laptop that is fast and doesn&#x27;t make any noise. With Intel is like having a drill pointed to your head that can goes off at any moment and let&#x27;s not mention phantom fan noise, where it gets imprinted in your head that your brain makes you think the fans are on, but they are not.<p>Apple has achieved something extraordinary.

This isn&#x27;t stuff that&#x27;s overly Mac specific since it usually impacts Linux equally but it&#x27;s a hurdle to jump that you don&#x27;t have to deal with in native Windows. Like I said, playing Windows games outside of Windows is just a different set of pain points and you have to be able to tolerate it. Some people think it&#x27;s worth it and some people would rather have higher game availability and keep the pain of Windows. Kudos to Valve with creating a linux based handheld and the Wine and Proton projects for improving this situation dramatically though.<p>Besides the Game Porting Toolkit (which was originally intended for game developers to create native application bundles that could be put on the App Store), there&#x27;s also Crossover for Mac that does their own work towards resolving a lot of these issues and they have a compatibility list you can view on their site: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.codeweavers.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.codeweavers.com&#x2F;</a> and alternatively, some games run acceptably inside virtualization if you&#x27;re willing to still deal with Windows in a sandboxed way. Parallels is able to run many games with better compatibility since you&#x27;re actually running Windows, though last I checked DX12 was a problem.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42018684" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42018684" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fioan89</span><span>|</span><a href="#42017111">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42017183">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42017484">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42017423">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42018684">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42018684">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">With Thunderbolt 5 it should be fairly reasonable to use an external GPU for more power.</div><br/><div id="42019387" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42019387" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">evilduck</span><span>|</span><a href="#42017111">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42018684">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42021697">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42019387">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42019387">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Apple Silicon Macs don&#x27;t have support for eGPUs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;102363" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;102363</a><p>Maybe with future TB5 support they will include that feature.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42021697" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42021697" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kimixa</span><span>|</span><a href="#42017111">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42018684">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42019387">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42017423">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42021697">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42021697">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Apple no longer has drivers for anything newer than AMD RDNA2  and have completely dismantled the driver team.<p>Unless you&#x27;re running bootcamp you&#x27;re <i>extremely</i> limited by driver support.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42017423" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42017423" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eigenspace</span><span>|</span><a href="#42017111">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42017183">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42017505">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42017423">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42017423">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Gaming isn&#x27;t just about hardware, it&#x27;s also about software, economics, trust and relationships.<p>Apple has quite impressive hardware (though their GPUs are still not close to high-end discrete GPUs), but they&#x27;re also fast enough.

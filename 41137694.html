But the world would be a better place if we recognised that our scientific knowledge in some areas is poorer than we like to pretend.<p>I started feeling that way when I worked alongside some &quot;Evidence-Based Medicine&quot; advocates.  Years later I&#x27;ve landed in data science and the standards of statistical analysis and understanding I see especially in the biological sciences has only made me more sceptical.<p>Way back in 2007 the BMJ as part of its Clinical Evidence project published its systematic research into standards of evidence in support of common medical treatments. Some 2500 treatments were evaluated to determine whether they are supported by sufficient reliable evidence.<p>• 13% were found to be beneficial. 
• 23% were likely to be beneficial.
• 8% were as likely to be harmful as beneficial.
• 6% were unlikely to be beneficial. 
• 4% were likely to be harmful or ineffective. 
• 46% were unknown whether they were efficacious or harmful.<p>It&#x27;s quite hard to find the original Clinical Evidence project resources (might be a job for the wayback machine) but you can find it referenced all over, e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2071976&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2071976&#x2F;</a> .<p>In the 1970s the US Office of Technology Assessment conducted a similar evaluation of medical treatments&#x27; efficacy and found that only 10% to 20% of medical treatments had evidence of efficacy. I would love to see more recent research in this vein.<p>There are clearly many complications and caveats around all this. Not all &quot;common treatments&quot; are easily studied -- the gold standard of the RCT is not always feasible or ethical. And of course absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, etc... but it sometimes feels we should be a bit more humble about even our best science.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41139862" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41139862" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kevinmchugh</span><span>|</span><a href="#41138651">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41139180">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41146571">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41139683">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41139862">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41139862">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Science advances one funeral at a time</div><br/><div id="41141442" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41141442" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jcynix</span><span>|</span><a href="#41138651">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41139862">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41140243">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41141442">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41141442">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">More specifically Max Planck wrote: &quot;A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it ...&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Planck%27s_principle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Planck%27s_principle</a></div><br/><div id="41143087" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41143087" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwup238</span><span>|</span><a href="#41138651">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41141442">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41140243">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41143087">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41143087">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Most famously quoted in the <i>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i>, which seems apt to link here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Structure_of_Scientific_Re...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41140243" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41140243" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MichaelDickens</span><span>|</span><a href="#41138651">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41139862">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41141442">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41140790">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41140243">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41140243">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Robert Warren is most likely older than the doctor in question, so it would seem the science needs at least two generations of funerals in this case.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41140790" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41140790" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">trhway</span><span>|</span><a href="#41138651">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41139862">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41140243">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41140160">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41140790">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41140790">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">sometimes i think even funerals can&#x27;t help.<p>For example, several years ago significant cataract improvement was achieved by applying to eyes lanasterol (chemical in your body clearing cataract naturally) with DMSO (well known widely used solvent which is used in particular to deliver various medicine through the skin, etc., and some adventurous people are also using it to for example deliver dye into eyes to change the eye color). Several other scientific teams at different places  tried to reproduce the result by applying lanasterol without DMSO, and no improvement happened.

The other way of course is injecting it directly into the eye, and it probably would have to be done many times, and, once injections stop, the crystalline accumulation may happen to start again (as cataracts indicate that the body probably have some issue producing and delivering lanosterol naturally), ie. cataract returning, and in this case the cataract surgery starts to look like not that bad of an approach solving the issue once and for all.<p>&gt;Medicine advances so slowly.<p>This is one on my deepest existential fears - not just in medicine - the Ancient Greeks could have had steam turbine based ships, yet it took more than 2000 years, and i&#x27;m wondering with a tint of fear  what wonderful things we&#x27;re  missing on and what Dark Ages we have to pass through before getting to those things (and i&#x27;m not going to see them being long gone before it).

He had learned fiberoptic endoscopy, and he was performing biopsies on these same patients and knew their medical histories. So this clinical connection lit a spark, and the two of them teamed up and made a remarkable discovery. What they did was to simply correlate this finding with the presence of active chronic gastritis. They published their first paper, a brief letter to the editor in Lancet in 1983t, which described a series of their patients with active gastritis and the present of this curved bacillus in their stomachs.<p>They went on then to make further correlations between the curved bacilli and peptic ulcers and eventually gastric cancer. This discovery was innovative and totally new. and was met with huge resistance by the medical establishment. The notion that peptic ulcer was an infectious disease met with near universal rejection. I actually remember the journal club in a Boston teaching hospital near here where this was first presented. The discovery was universally rejected by most of us in attendance. The problem was that in certain parts of the world, 80% of the population were infected. How could something that common be a cause of a disease like peptic ulcer that only occurs in, say, 1% of the population?<p>Barry Marshall wrote in his note cards and some of his later publication “Everyone was against me, but I knew I was right.”<p>So who was against him? The acid mafia, a powerful group of senior investigators who championed the idea that hydrochloric acid was the key to formation of stomach ulcers. When we were residents and fellows we had to know a lot about gastric hydrochloric acid secretion. So those who believed in the primacy of stomach acid were definitely strongly opposed to these Australian upstarts, Marshall and Warren.</i> (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.blogs.harvard.edu&#x2F;lamont&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;30&#x2F;advances-gastroenterology-medical-rounds&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.blogs.harvard.edu&#x2F;lamont&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;30&#x2F;advances...</a>)<p>Another pattern that came up in these discoveries was the <i>doctors and researchers experimenting on themselves.</i> For example:<p><i>In this instance the experimental subject was Barry Marshall himself. He swallowed a pure culture of Helicobacter pylori that he had isolated from one of his patients that he had previously biopsied and cured. So he knew that the strain was treatable and curable. He drank the culture of H pylori and over the next several weeks developed severe acute Helicobacter infection with nausea, vomiting, and severe dyspepsia. He stated that his halitosis was so bad, that his wife told him that he had to sleep on the couch. After the infection was established he treated himself with the anti-Helicobacter therapy and completely recovered. His experiment was soon published in the Medical Journal of Australia in 1985.</i><p>Basil Hirschowitz, the godfather of endoscopy, also followed the self-experimentation path:<p><i>Hirschowitz heard about [the fiber optic] paper from a cardiology resident who had heard about it at journal club in London. Hirschowitz flew to London, met Kapany and Hopkins in a pub, and discussed their invention. They were very encouraging to Hirschowitz and gave him a few glass fibers to take back to Ann Arbor. Hirschowitz returned to his fellowship at Michigan and built the first fiberoptic gastroscope with help from Larry Curtis and Wilbur Peters who were physicists. After a few years of trial and error, they produced the first gastroscope ... Like a lot of fellows and young researchers in science, first tested the device on himself in February 1957. He managed to control his own gag reflex, passed through his esophagus and looked around in his own stomach.</i></div><br/></div></div><div id="41140850" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41140850" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ein0p</span><span>|</span><a href="#41139662">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41137878">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41140850">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41140850">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Seems like there wasn’t really any “science of ulcers” before he wrote it, so saying that he rewrote it is inaccurate</div><br/></div></div><div id="41137878" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41137878" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">quantumwoke</span><span>|</span><a href="#41140850">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41137966">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41137878">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41137878">[14 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This guy was a true unsung hero of the medical world and he really embodied the hacker spirit.

I also shortly changed jobs, which alleviated the stress. Mind you, I never had heartburn, just pain.

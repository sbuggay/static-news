If there&#x27;s ML and a &quot;guarantee&quot; involved, what actually happens if the bill is larger than predicted?<p>2. I&#x27;ve been to medical appointments where doctors have clearly ordered tests to pad the bill. E.g. a lung capacity test to prescribe stimulant medication. Or doing many blood panels &quot;just in case&quot; (conveniently when they have an in-house blood scanner and phlebotomist). Some practices offer dozens of such tests and procedures. They are judgment calls but doctors are perversely incentivized to order them. What is the patient&#x2F;doctor experience in these situations? Having the menu of services+prices readily visible and available and the doctor walking through the options and risk&#x2F;reward?<p>3. Will you publish the pricing information over time? Perhaps comparing the transparency&#x2F;hospital-published data versus your experiential and predicted data?</div><br/><div id="36975129" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36975129" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blastbking</span><span>|</span><a href="#36973203">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36971083">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36975129">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36975129">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If the bill is larger than predicted, we end up covering the difference (assuming that the services we showed the user are the ones the user ended up getting). We match the prices shown in the table of &#x27;All Covered Services&#x27; that we show to the user, so if you go to a derm to have a mole looked at, it might be $150 for a consultation, and we&#x27;ll tell you it&#x27;ll be $70 to have a biopsy done, and if you get the biopsy, we&#x27;ll guarantee all you owe is $220, and if you don&#x27;t we guarantee it&#x27;s $150.<p>In terms of padding the bill, we think that doctors tend to pad it in order to get reimbursed more by insurance, but they&#x27;re pretty soft on holding patients liable to these padded things, and also they will get in trouble if they do it too much. We do need to figure out the patient experience though, our goal is that patients know the cost of procedures a doctor is recommending (for ex if my doctor says I should get an arthroscopy and an x ray, I want to know ahead of time how much it costs), and can make an educated decision on whether they want to get the procedure done or want to see a different doctor.<p>The pricing information, we&#x27;re likely to publish broad analytics level information, but from a business perspective we&#x27;re thinking that the discrepancies between the published data and our experiential data are really our &#x27;data moat&#x27; for the business, so that&#x27;s likely to be our IP (as it&#x27;s what prevents someone from easily copying us by scraping our site).

I also know that in-advance EOBs* happen to be on the agenda for the CMS.<p>I&#x27;m curious about how you solved a couple of problems because it&#x27;s becoming clearer to me that healthcare operates in a probabilistic way, which makes price prediction hard. Here&#x27;s a simple timeline of how an average person interacts with the healthcare system.<p>1. A patient has a symptom<p>At this point, the patient can see a primary care doctor, or see a specialist themselves.<p>2. Patient sees a doctor and receives a diagnosis<p>Depending on the symptoms and the doctor, they&#x27;ll receive a set of diagnoses with some probability.<p>3. Patient receives a treatment<p>The patient, based on their symptoms and doctor, will get some set of treatments  with some probability.<p>I guess here&#x27;s the rub with outpatient data. Even if you completely figure out the pricing problem, it&#x27;s not obvious (at least not to me) that when a patient goes in for an outpatient procedure that they&#x27;re going to be billed for exactly the shoppable service they think they&#x27;re getting, because it&#x27;s based on probabilities. I think your tool alludes to this actually -- more below.<p>A meniscus repair is an outpatient procedure, and part of CMS&#x27;s shoppable services list*. But I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s the case that when you see an orthopedic surgeon for a meniscus repair that you&#x27;ll be billed for CPT code 29880, or 29881, or something else. It might depend on the surgeon and what they see when they dig into your knee. They also might X-ray your knee, which may or may not be covered.<p>(I&#x27;m not actually sure of the possibilities here, but I think David Gaines at CareIgnition (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.careignition.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.careignition.com&#x2F;</a>) might know, if you want to discuss with him.)<p>Anyway, to test how you solved this, I searched &quot;meniscus tear&quot; in my area (zip 11377). What I saw was the rates for first consultations with orthopedic surgeons. I did not see rates for the procedure itself, so I couldn&#x27;t easily see what you do in the case that a person is shopping for a 29880&#x2F;29881. However, I did notice that the price variation for a consultation can vary up to a factor of 3, depending on whether the consultation is graded as low or high complexity. You do a good job of explaining this in the drop-down, and noting that most visits are low-complexity, but I suspect that as you expand to more outpatient procedures, the probabilistic parts will become nontrivial and more important...<p>I suppose one approach is to limit procedures in your search engine to ones where 1) the patient _knows_ exactly the procedure they&#x27;re getting and 2) there&#x27;s a low probability that they patient expects to pay for anything but that procedure. Or maybe you could say something about this? I&#x27;m genuinely curious.<p>Finally, one more comment on guaranteed pricing, which I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve thought about. My alarm bells go off when I see &quot;guaranteed&quot; because I know, for sure, that some of these rates are wrong. Not all, but some decent fraction of them, and it depends on the carrier -- Aetna&#x27;s rates tend to be more reliable than United&#x27;s for example. I know this because I compared them to internal contracts, and know other people who have done the same. You might be able to pressure the carrier to honor the rate that they published (and I know this has been done on the hospital side) but that&#x27;s a different story, and I&#x27;m not sure how that process shakes out. I also know that sometimes the carrier published multiple rates for the same service, without disambiguating information. I&#x27;m not sure how common this is with the subset of codes&#x2F;plans you&#x27;ve pulled.<p>* &quot;Explanation of Benefits&quot;, i.e. the bill. The insurance company would tell you, before your procedure, the patient&#x27;s portion of the bill, which parts would be denied, etc.<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cms.gov&#x2F;healthplan-price-transparency&#x2F;resources&#x2F;500-items-services" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cms.gov&#x2F;healthplan-price-transparency&#x2F;resources&#x2F;...</a></div><br/><div id="36973599" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36973599" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blastbking</span><span>|</span><a href="#36971083">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36982575">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36973599">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36973599">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah, it&#x27;s definitely based on probabilities. I will definitely check out careignition as this is a problem we&#x27;ve been struggling with for sure! For orthopedics we&#x27;re aware that the range of care and CPT codes are super complex and we&#x27;re holding off on adding complex procedures for now until we get a better handle on the data side.<p>We are taking the approach, as you suggested, of limiting procedures in the search engine to ones that patients know what they&#x27;re getting. Our initial focus is actually Dermatology for this reason, from a combination of popular demand and us seeing that the procedures billed are often very simple and easy for us to model &#x2F; predict.<p>For us, our goal is to guarantee the rates that we show on the site, and we&#x27;re building a model that figures out what the correct rates are as claims get adjudicated. At scale, internally we will have the most accurate model of what costs will be, figuring out which of the carrier rates is real. This part is definitely challenging as well and we expect to lose money on the guarantee (paying out to patients) for some time until we figure it out, but we&#x27;re limiting the losses by not listing the more complex high variance stuff.<p>RE in advance EOBs, we think that we can help providers comply if&#x2F;when that regulation goes into effect!</div><br/><div id="36973650" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36973650" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alecst</span><span>|</span><a href="#36971083">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36973599">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36982575">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36973650">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36973650">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for the reply, and great work on making a cool product.

It turns out that cost of seeing a dermatologist and getting liquid nitrogen treatment can vary by hundreds of dollars depending on where you go, even if you use your insurance.<p>So Certainly shows you the upfront price that is specific to your insurance and lets you compare prices across providers.

Employers are involved in health insurance because it gives big employers an advantage over small employer by being able to compensate employees with pre tax dollars, and it helps prevent people from being able to compare compensation from different jobs so it incentivizes employees to stay put.<p>A further benefit is that employers with relatively healthy and young employees such as higher paid desk job firms can sequester their health risks into a healthier pool of lives so that they are not subsidizing healthcare for older&#x2F;less healthy people.<p>&gt;This is purely on the cost side.

There is a reason that most agree to the terms of insurance companies, and that is because they know their customers cannot afford to pay them as much as they get via insurance companies.<p>See also this comment.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36972991">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36972991</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36973913" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36973913" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smcl</span><span>|</span><a href="#36973139">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36973482">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36974123">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36975989">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36973913">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36973913">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">According to this same user you should be individually negotiating with your healthcare provider (or going to like one center in Oklahoma).

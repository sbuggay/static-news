The reason people think that it is terrible is because older houses are connected via telephone cables that have a whole bunch of issues including poor workmanship left over from the previous private owner, whereas new estates that connect directly to the NBN via brand new fiber optic runs are incredibly fast and reliable for a consumer service.<p>As a matter of fact, the NBN at my house costs around $100&#x2F;month on fiber whereas my office&#x2F;company business Telstra fiber costs around $1000&#x2F;month. The speeds are comparable, but the SLA is different. Nevertheless, they have both been down about the same amount of time in the last year (not more than a few hours total). My mate who works at NBN thinks that this is because the government was allowed to operate NBN backbone at a total hemorrhaging loss of money (so expensive equipment and contractors are used), whereas Telstra has to operate profitably.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36028331" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36028331" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">navjack27</span><span>|</span><a href="#36028320">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36027787">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36028331">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36028331">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Anybody have a write up like this but for Fiber? Like FttH with calix 716ge-i?<p>I&#x27;d love to get into it&#x27;s interface and diagnose things but it&#x27;s complicated. It&#x27;s on a separate VLAN when I connect it to any router and I can never actually figure out if I can and if it&#x27;s actually possible to get to any sort of diagnostics from my side of the connection. Even with my overkill pfsense 9900k router with 2 Intel 4 port cards and wifi... I had to do some weird shit to get that to work when instead when I had my ASUS router it just worked.<p>But now I get way lower at times than my advertised speed and I really don&#x27;t want to have a technician come down.

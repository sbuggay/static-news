The fact that each thread needs its own stack is an inherent limiter for efficiency, as switching stacks leads to cache misses. Asynchronous I&#x2F;O has an edge because it only stores exactly as much state as it needs for its continuation, and multiple tasks can have their state in the same CPU cache line. The OS doesn&#x27;t know nearly enough about your program to optimize the stack contents to only contain the state you need for the remainder of the thread.<p>But at the programming language level the compiler does have insight into the dependencies of your continuation, so it can build a closure that has only what it needs to have. You still have asynchronous I&#x2F;O at the core but the language creates an abstraction that behaves like a synchronous threaded model, as seen in C#, Kotlin, etc. This doesn&#x27;t come without challenges. For example, in Kotlin the debugger is unable to show contents of variables that are not needed further down in the code because they have already been removed from the underlying closure.

This model allows a decoupling of the performance characteristics of runtime threads from OS threads - which can sometimes be beneficial - but essentially, the programming model is fundamentally still synchronous.<p>Asynchronous programming with async&#x2F;await is about revealing the time dimension of execution as a first class concept. This allows more opportunities for composition.<p>Take cancellation for example: cancelling tasks under the synchronous programming model requires passing a context object through every part of your code that might call down into an IO operation. This context object is checked for cancellation at each point a task might block, and checked when a blocking operation is interrupted.<p>Timeouts are even trickier to do in this model, especially if your underlying IO only allows you to set per-operation timeouts and you&#x27;re trying to expose a deadline-style interface instead.<p>Under the asynchronous model, both timeouts and cancellation simply compose. You take a future representing the work you&#x27;re doing, and spawn a new future that completes after sleeping for some duration, or spawn a new future that waits on a cancel channel. Then you just race these futures. Take whichever completes first and cancel the other.<p>Having done a lot of programming under both paradigms, the synchronous model is so much more clunky and error-prone to work with and involves a lot of tedious manual work, like passing context objects around, that simply disappears under the asynchronous model.</div><br/><div id="41472544" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41472544" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anonymoushn</span><span>|</span><a href="#41471936">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41472096">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41472544">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41472544">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Cancellation isn&#x27;t possible in general.

You can&#x27;t just accept that the expensive work you don&#x27;t care about will keep happening or resume a future that has been dropped when the cqe entry bearing a pointer to it arrives. The cancellation facility provided by io_uring that guarantees that you won&#x27;t receive such a thing does so by blocking your thread for a while, which is undesirable.<p>As implemented, async&#x2F;await typically greatly harms composability.

It&#x27;s really not such a huge problem.<p>I will also note that most async runtimes include much more complex program rewrites and implicit state machines than thread based models. Java style or Go style green threads are much simpler frameworks than C#&#x27;s whole async task machinery, or even than Rust&#x27;s Tokio.<p>And any program written as a series of threads running blocking operations with proper synchronization is also pretty easy to convert to an async model. The difficulty is taking a single-threaded program and making it run in an async model, but that is a completely different discussion.<p>However, I do agree that ultimately you do need the OS to provide async IO primitives to have efficient IO at the application level. Since OS threads can&#x27;t scale to the required level, even the green threads + blocking IO approach is only realistically implementable with async IO from the OS level. This could change if the OS actually implemented a green threads runtime for blocking operations, but that might still have other inefficiencies related to costs of crossing security boundaries.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41472017" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41472017" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dehrmann</span><span>|</span><a href="#41471936">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41472096">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41472297">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41472017">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41472017">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Asynchronous programming with async&#x2F;await is about revealing the time dimension of execution as a first class concept<p>People are more likely to assume their code is fast enough and not worry about the execution time of synchronous data processing, then spend weeks investigating why the p99 latency is 5 seconds with clusters of spikes.<p>Async IO is almost entirely about efficiency.

Whether that is done by passing around context objects from the UI down to IO operations, or by ensuring all functions called from the UI down return Task&lt;T&gt; objects, the problem is the same. The context object approach even has the advantage that it also allows you to pass other application-specific things, such as passing progress information up from the bottom of the stack to the UI, or logging ids etc, that the generic Task object won&#x27;t have.<p>Also, deadline-style contexts aren&#x27;t as hard as you make them out to be: you keep track of the remaining time, and pass that as a timeout to every blocking operation, then subtract the actual time taken and pass the remaining time to the next blocking task etc. Or, you can do the exact same thing as the async case: you spawn two threads, one handling the blocking operations, the other waiting for a timeout, and both sharing a cancelation context. Whichever finishes first cancels the other.<p>The difficulty of doing cancellations for most real operations is anyway going to be much much higher than these small differences.

The actual reason why we don&#x27;t use them to handle more than a few thousand concurrent operations is that, at least in Linux, threads are scheduled and treated very similarly to processes. E.g. if a single process with 3000 threads gets bottlenecked on some syscall, etc, your system load average will become 3000, and it will essentially lead to no other processes being able to run well on the same machine.<p>Another issue with threads performance is that they are visible to most system tools like `ps`, and thus having too mamy threads starts to affect operations _outside_ the kernel, e.g. many monitoring tools, etc.<p>So that&#x27;s the main reason why user-space scheduling became so popular: it hides the &quot;threads&quot; from the system, allowing for processes to be scheduled more fairly (preventing stuff like reaching LA 3000 when writing to 3000 parallel connections), and not affecting performance of the system infrastructure around the kernel.<p>BTW the threads stacks, as well as everything else in Linux are allocated lazily, so if you only use like 4Kb of stack in the thread it wouldn&#x27;t lead to RSS of full 8M.

How do you know when your call completed without “some sort of mechanism provided by the IO runtime&#x2F;language”? Yes, you periodically ask the OS whether that thread completed, but that doesn’t come for free and is far from elegant.<p>There are solutions. The cheapest, resource-wise, are I&#x2F;O completion callbacks.

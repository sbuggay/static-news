When my former US company was acquired by a huge Chinese company, it was not clear if my service would be part of the deal too. A lot of higher managers escaped the ship just weeks before they announced that it would be sold to another huge Indian company.</div><br/><div id="39625187" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39625187" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">itsdrewmiller</span><span>|</span><a href="#39624962">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39625061">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39625357">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39625187">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39625187">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ah yeah that makes sense!

There is really one sign that is the telltale sign of all signs with a much higher degree of accuracy than any of the author&#x27;s mentioned signs. One person is the indicator. It&#x27;s not the CEO. It is the CFO. Why? When an acquisition is about the happen, the CFO is sent scrambling to ask the founders, accounting, lawyers, and all others involved for many pieces of information about the company&#x27;s financials. The acquiring company is doing due diligence during this period and needs this information from the company being acquired. The CFO gets put into a mad scurry and a fire is lit under his ass to get everything done on time, accurately. If you see your CFO is more anxious and much busier than usual, asking everyone who has information for information, there is usually something going on.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39625092" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39625092" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">justinzollars</span><span>|</span><a href="#39625824">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39624897">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39625092">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39625092">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I woke up one day and saw the founder tweet - &quot;Adobe.&quot;</div><br/><div id="39625386" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39625386" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">greenavocado</span><span>|</span><a href="#39625092">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39624897">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39625386">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39625386">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Figma?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39624897" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39624897" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">swyx</span><span>|</span><a href="#39625092">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39624897">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39624897">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">see also Signs that a Startup is Going Bad <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.swyx.io&#x2F;startups-going-bad" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.swyx.io&#x2F;startups-going-bad</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

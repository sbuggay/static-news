But I&#x27;m concerned with the fiddly-ness of local storage and such like that. The &quot;out of site, out of mind&quot; nature of it. The data not being in a &quot;~&#x2F;.app&#x2F;app.dat&quot; file, etc. The idea of it potentially just up and vanishing with a browser update. And, heck, just the complexity of dealing with the schema versioning in the native web model.<p>As well as the portability of data (say when you copy over to a new computer).<p>The idea of simple web distribution is compelling. Now you need nothing more than a github account, and off you go. No server, no nothing.<p>But I still feel (perhaps ignorantly) that the data situation is still on shaky ground. (Discounting the whole lack of something like SQLite, etc.)<p>And, the idea of bundling something like SQLite as a webassembly blob just makes me itch.<p>Just curious how that&#x27;s worked out.</div><br/><div id="40651411" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40651411" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seansh</span><span>|</span><a href="#40651084">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40651613">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40651411">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40651411">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s definitely a lot of fiddlyness when it comes to the web stack.<p>Having said that, indexeddb has been very reliable. There are some annoying limitations though. For example, if you want to create an index on a store using multiple keys, you can&#x27;t specify which key should be ascending or descending.<p>If you add the PWA to your home page, i.e. install it, then the browser must not clear indexeddb on an update or something. And as far as I can tell, browsers do respect that.<p>My overall experience building PWA has been mixed. I think it really depends on what app you&#x27;re making. For a note taking app, where the data can be backed up to the cloud encrypted and synced, I really think a PWA is the best option. But if you want tighter integration with the platform e.g. accessing the file system, then I would stay away from PWA.<p>Another issue is ios safari which is missing a lot of features for PWAs and I think unlikely to support them in the future. E.g. background sync, offline push notifications, etc.<p>Are you considering PWA for any particular app?</div><br/><div id="40655610" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40655610" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">austinjp</span><span>|</span><a href="#40651084">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40651411">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40652697">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40655610">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40655610">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve been pondering similar regarding data persistence.

A reminder with a button&#x2F;link which triggers data serialisation from storage and then triggers the save dialogue. The serialisation&#x2F;save could be triggered manually any time. A reciprocal import would also be needed of course.<p>Another similarity half-baked plan is for a PWA to regularly post (encrypted?) data to a service I&#x27;d host that simply forwards the data to the user&#x27;s choice of cloud storage.

I don&#x27;t need tight local integration per se. I do have a conceptual problem not being able to save a file or read a file, even if it&#x27;s just chosen by the user. I THINK I can do that. I THINK you can pop a file chooser to read a file, but not necessarily just open any file you want. If you can read&#x2F;write a file as directed by a user, that would be fine. I can see the rest being stored in the IndexDB. And that gives the option of an export&#x2F;backup if it becomes necessary for peace of mind.<p>Then there&#x27;s the whole x-browser game, I&#x27;m not really looking at mobile, just desktop, but I&#x27;d like to support FF&#x2F;Chrome&#x2F;Safari&#x2F;Edge.<p>It&#x27;s not rocket science stuff by any means. But I don&#x27;t want a user to call up and talking about how their data suddenly vanished because they went to get the latest, and I did something innocent&#x2F;ignorant (or not), or THEY did something (deleted their PWA icon, copied it, moved it, etc.), or the browser did something.<p>I have no experience with it, so for now, I&#x27;m not comfortable because I don&#x27;t have my &quot;hands&quot; on the data.<p>If I can export it, then the comfort level goes way up. Inform the user to back up &quot;just in case&quot;, especially early on when we&#x27;re all still bumping in the dark.<p>To be clear, I don&#x27;t want a server side, I have no interest in standing up a service component. I have less interest in maintaining a service component.

Additionally, neither hashes are used for encryption and decryption and each note&#x27;s encryption is salted differently.<p>edit: I&#x27;d love to hear suggestions on how to improve the situation even for shorter passwords.</div><br/><div id="40655620" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40655620" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gloosx</span><span>|</span><a href="#40655255">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40655492">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40655466">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40655620">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40655620">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Even with a strong password – my laptop today can do 1100 MH&#x2F;s which makes it quite feasible. One of the potential attack vectors can look like this: a malicious actor takes this and reskins the UI, then hosts and does the marketing, his server stores the NGINX logs with &#x2F;login requests for some time, preserving the password_hash and username params silently. Then after a while he spends few weeks cracking the passwords for every account and syncs their notes, then parsing them for passwords&#x2F;sensitive info.<p>As for suggestions, this could be enforced by making use of a system-level keychain, but I don&#x27;t know if it is possible within a sandboxed environment like PWA. Some stronger derivation method would help too, like the industry standard is pbkdf2 with at least 600000 iterations for SHA256. Lastly, end-to-end encryption usually implies some kind of protection against man-in-the-middle attack, like a certificate pinning mechanism</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40655466" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40655466" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rakoo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40655255">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40655492">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40647560">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40655466">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40655466">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The security of this is somewhat questionable.

(I&#x27;m hesitant to say &#x27;all&#x27;.)<p>FYI I noticed a typo, &quot;Github falvored markdown&quot;.<p>[0] I try for &#x27;inbox zero&#x27; but am okay with leaving things in my inbox for a few days if I&#x27;m expecting to need them soon. Sometimes I flag for followup or color-categorize.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40655045" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40655045" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jowdones</span><span>|</span><a href="#40648954">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40647511">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40655045">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40655045">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Wow, the kids discovered Notepad!</div><br/></div></div><div id="40648760" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40648760" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bjord</span><span>|</span><a href="#40647511">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40653447">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40648760">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40648760">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Priavcy first!</div><br/><div id="40649221" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40649221" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seansh</span><span>|</span><a href="#40648760">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40653447">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40649221">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40649221">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">fixed!</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40653447" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40653447" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">qntmfred</span><span>|</span><a href="#40648760">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40651814">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40653447">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40653447">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&#x2F;about<p>&quot;Techinal details&quot;<p>fyi</div><br/></div></div><div id="40651814" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40651814" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">m3kw9</span><span>|</span><a href="#40653447">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40651911">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40651814">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40651814">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why not use Apple notes</div><br/><div id="40652166" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40652166" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seansh</span><span>|</span><a href="#40651814">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40652116">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40652166">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40652166">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think these are missing from Apple notes:<p>- everything end-to-end encrypted by default<p>- public APIs, create your own client (still with e2e encryption)<p>- self host<p>- markdown support<p>- import from google keep<p>- open source</div><br/></div></div><div id="40652116" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40652116" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jazzyjackson</span><span>|</span><a href="#40651814">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40652166">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40653902">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40652116">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40652116">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you sync, apple notes are stored plain text in icloud<p>BTW anytime a notes app comes up I feel the need to let people know that there is an option to bulk download your apple notes at privacy.apple.com</div><br/><div id="40654045" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40654045" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">drio0</span><span>|</span><a href="#40651814">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40652116">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40653902">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40654045">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40654045">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Wow thanks for the link.

I&#x27;m not gonna say there&#x27;s no way around having a server for sync, but none is simple or even possible to implement for all platforms including the web (see the Nat Traversal problem [1]).<p>You can self host of course in which case you only sign up to your own server. Instructions for self hosting can be found on the github page [2].<p>As for verifying the privacy of your data, this is a little more complicated. First, since it&#x27;s a web app, you can open the dev console of your browser and in the network tab you&#x27;ll see all the data that gets passes around. You will see that the content of your notes and passwords are all &quot;gibberish&quot; because they are encrypted or hashed. Of course that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they are encrypted or encrypted well. To verify that, you really have to take a look at the code at least the client examples [3] which is provided in both typescript and python. They will show you how encryption and decryption work which allows you to verify that the &quot;gibberish&quot; data you see in the network tab of the website really is properly encrypted notes.<p>I hope that addresses your concerns.

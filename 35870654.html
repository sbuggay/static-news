For me, I was doing other stuff for most of the 16 years!<p>I strongly believe this, and they “you should know this already” is common and dangerous.<p>As an aside, indeed this is true about less abstract things.  Kids learn languages well because they don’t have as many other things to do compared to adults (plus they only need to know a kid level vocabulary).  I know three adults who learned English after the supposed “easy” age (14, 24, and 24). All have excellent vocabulary and two speak with the local accent.<p>This is true of music as well.  Some people (like me) play music OK at best but well enough to have fun.  Others just can’t stop thinking about it, playing (i.e. practicing) and as far as I can tell are all quite good.<p>I bet most or all of us feel this internally, but socially can’t believe it.

So naturally, I&#x27;m fairly good at playing the guitar. Or I suppose that&#x27;s an understatement. I&#x27;m probably better than most people on this entire forum, yet I never practised a single day in my life.<p>Well, obviously that&#x27;s why it took so long to get good lol! But I think there&#x27;s also a lesson in it because it&#x27;s also the reason why I kept on doing it, when everybody else quit. So, in that sense you could say the real reason I&#x27;m this good at playing the guitar today, is simply because I never quit.<p>But at the same time, I never really tried hard either. The entire journey has been about enjoyment and problem solving. It was never about the pressure to achieve anything. Instead, it was always about enjoyment and “zero pressure” problem solving, that is problem solving akin to solving some jigsaw puzzle. So, a pleasurable thing! And that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t strictly consider it “practising” though it probably is. The rest of the time I&#x27;d just enjoy the tunes, and the singing and the good vibes.<p>I should probably add that I was never motivated to play the guitar because of chicks, or because I wanted to become a rock star. That&#x27;s very hard to do when you grow up in a poor home, and the only thing you got was a crummy old acoustic guitar.<p>The cool guys all had electric guitars, and to them they weren&#x27;t tools to become excellent at playing guitar. Instead, they were tools to get laid, or get popular, but not good at playing the guitar. So naturally, today none of the guys who had those fancy electrical guitars play guitar anymore, while I do. And now I&#x27;m better than them. Way better.

My kneejerk response at seeing the title was &quot;how could it possibly take 10 years just to learn DNS, if you&#x27;re actually spending some nontrivial amount of that time trying?&quot;<p>This might be partly because I have knees, and am a jerk. (But aren&#x27;t those true of most of us?)<p>And I&#x27;m kind of right. Understanding enough DNS for most practical purposes <i>should</i> take far less than 10 years, even if you really are spending 6 months at a time ignoring it (as jvns says in the talk). And that might be enough, who knows.<p>But there are so, <i>so</i> many things where when you actually try it out, or need to scrape down a layer because you&#x27;re using some additional feature, you suddenly find that the stuff you thought you understood is actually perched atop a shifting layer of incandescent hairballs.<p>For me in the specific case of DNS, one time my smug confidence was shattered was from a previous jvns presentation, where she demonstrated that my naive mental model of DNS cache TTLs was not only wrong, but didn&#x27;t even make logical sense. (This isn&#x27;t the negative caching from the talk, it&#x27;s boring positive cache results where the TTL only starts counting once something gets put in the cache.)<p>That&#x27;s a general pattern for so many technical things. The performance of your non-IO code is based on the number of instructions and the instructions per cycle. Oh wait, it isn&#x27;t, you can pretty much ignore the instructions and just count memory references. Er, no, memory references aren&#x27;t equal, you need to count up how many hit each level of the memory hierarchy. No that&#x27;s not it either, some of those slow things don&#x27;t seem to matter, I guess it&#x27;s all down to data dependencies. Wait a minute, this code isn&#x27;t accessing much memory at all, but all these integer divides are bogging things down, maybe I <i>do</i> need to pay attention to the instructions... I could go on. Those hairballs are getting kind of bright, aren&#x27;t they?<p>Ten years isn&#x27;t seeming nearly long enough anymore.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35871146" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35871146" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pknerd</span><span>|</span><a href="#35871335">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35870898">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35871146">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35871146">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Big fan of Julia and her work.

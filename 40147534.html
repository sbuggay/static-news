We&#x27;ve had about a decade of this kind of robo-curation in every single aspect of our media consumption. Read books like the ones you like, listen to bands like the ones you listen to, more videos like this one, etc. I&#x27;m so sick of it.<p>The way to branch out of your rut is other people. Some band I&#x27;d never have listened to, and if I accidentally had, would have skipped it 30 seconds in, have become my favorites simply because someone I had a connection with played it or recommended it. Movies I wouldn&#x27;t have picked, but watched with someone else, are often better than anything I&#x27;d have picked based on my past preferences.<p>These days, more and more, I am realizing how rewarding it is to read a book or try a new restaurant based on nothing except that a friend with completely different taste likes it.

However, those films aren&#x27;t getting mass marketed, getting seen by the majority of people, or making a ton of money. Unfortunately, the linked articles didn&#x27;t specify the producers, or even the absolute number of movies produced each year, which is also relevant. Whatever the cause, the public&#x27;s appetite for sequels, as reflected in box office proceeds, has indisputably increased. Those are the movies getting seen the most.

I am nowhere near done, but I have made some notes that confirm old suspicions.<p>One, you&#x27;re quite right about classic rock having a lot of deep cuts that just don&#x27;t make it outside of some specific instances.  On the other hand, not only was new wave not entirely congruent to the 1980s, but a lot of what gets called new wave on various stations is only music that existed in the 1980s, rather than being actual new wave.  New wave was fairly tight and the rest is padding.<p>&quot;Darkjazz&quot; really came and went, and it&#x27;s unfortunate.  I&#x27;m still working my way through it but there was a hell of a drop-off.<p>Speaking of researched tracks, I think when an artist dies, there&#x27;s a contraction of what of their tracks get played on air.<p>Another thought, this one purely math.  If you bought, say, ten CDs every year, new releases, well, the average age of your collection will age at about half your own age rate.  The only ways to prevent that, if this concerns you, is to either jettison your old music or gather ever-increasing amounts of new music.<p>All of this is to say that, unless your preference is &quot;whatever is on the radio ... played a reasonable volume&quot; (Pictures for Sad Children), you&#x27;re swimming upstream, against the fantastically evolved.

I know they were capable of it (I once found a recording of Glenn Miller swinging it just as hard as anything Basie put out) but they were playing to their audience at the time. As I&#x27;ve learned more about the history of Swing and Lindy Hop, this was a specific choice made to &quot;civilize&quot; (as the white people of the time would have said) Jazz&#x27;s savage rhythms. There&#x27;s actually posters from the Arthur Murray school in the 1940s saying this exact thing.<p>(Aside, I had a friend who played a radio show in the 2000s playing old Jazz music.

Most of the stuff out there isn’t very good, and the stuff that is good isn’t always discoverable with a single strategy 
- The best strategies almost always exploit human connections<p>Some strategies I use:<p>- Spatial locality, who is performing with or near artists that I like? 
- Publishing locality, who is on the same label as an artist that I like?
- Artist locality, what other projects has an artist I like contributed to?
- Fan locality, what other artists does a fan of an artist that I like enjoy?<p>——<p>Note that none of these strategies are as effective as “relinquish control”. For example, there is a freeform radio station near me that I listen to all day at work. I have a rule that I won’t turn the radio off in the middle of a DJs set, even if I don’t like a song. This has helped me “break through” to interesting artists I wouldn’t have discovered otherwise.<p>To the article’s question, I think the main factor here doesn’t have much to do with music. Cultural production has exploded, and it’s really hard to navigate any cultural  space in a non-obsessive way.<p>I thought it was interesting that the effect of “generational preference for music released when teenaged” seemed to wane around Gen Z.

I find following small labels that specialize in a genre to be ideal. Unfortunately, bandcamp doesn&#x27;t do a great job in helping me keep track of everything, so this is what I do:<p>1. Bandcamp doesn&#x27;t have RSS, but I take all the incoming emails and convert them to RSS[1]. I separate out new messages vs new releases. I host my own RSS with FreshRSS.<p>2. I wrote an app (Camp Counselor [2]) to help manage your Bandcamp wishlist. You can organize, rate, and comment (privately) on your wishlist, along with play directly in the app. I find that my wishlist (which has a few thousand albums on it) is more of a &quot;to do&quot; list. If I get a recommendation, I just add it to my wishlist and will check it out later. Even stuff I don&#x27;t like stays in my wishlist (with a low rating), to help me remember. I then sort by rating or added at dates, and as I purchase things, they move off my wishlist into my purchase list.<p>This generally works really well for me, and I continue to explore lots of new and great music every day!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.line72.net&#x2F;2021&#x2F;12&#x2F;23&#x2F;converting-bandcamp-email-updates-to-an-rss-feed&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.line72.net&#x2F;2021&#x2F;12&#x2F;23&#x2F;converting-bandcamp-email...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flathub.org&#x2F;apps&#x2F;net.line72.campcounselor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flathub.org&#x2F;apps&#x2F;net.line72.campcounselor</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40150241" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40150241" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jddj</span><span>|</span><a href="#40148302">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40149592">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40148314">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40150241">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40150241">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ah this is very cool.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40148314" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40148314" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">havblue</span><span>|</span><a href="#40148302">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40152922">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40148314">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40148314">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It doesn&#x27;t seem like the article makes much of a distinction between newly released music and music that you haven&#x27;t listened to yet.

I&#x27;ve found a lot of Pink Floyd stuff is complex enough that I&#x27;m still enjoying it and noticing new things after many decades of listening to it. Watching videos of Floyd playing live also opened up a whole new appreciation for the music.<p>Lots of the music I enjoyed as a kid&#x2F;teenager had themes I can only now understand in my late 30s, and didn&#x27;t really appreciate or fully grasp back then.<p>Overall, a lot of prog really seems to have enough complexity to remain interesting for a long time. Most of Tools albums, I seem to not enjoy much at first, but enjoy more, and notice more things each time I listen, even after hundreds of listens.<p>The same music that is complex enough to remain interesting over time, usually doesn&#x27;t compress well and is really damaged as a low bitrate MP3.

Around the time I turned 30 I got interested in new music again and it was first east coast hip hop (KRS One, M.F. Doom) then psychedelia and classic rock adjacent music (by that time I was really sick and tired of overplayed classic rock,  one time I was tripping on acid at 2 am and called up the local college station to complain about the Doobie Brothers song they played that is on a twice a day during drive time and the program manager picked up,  I told him to play what he thought was good music and he put on Miles Davis.)<p>Since then I have had pulses of being interested in &quot;new&quot; (to me) music but it&#x27;s usually been a bit old.  The last round has been the Super Furry Animals (Mwng for the win!) and similar UK bands like The Charlatans.  I just found out that I like some of Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s later albums.  Before that it was early Japanese electronica like Yellow Magic Orchestra and Isao Tomita.  Before that <i>Synthesizer</i> by Information Society was a revelation.<p>Recently my son got into the big hits of Fleetwood Mac but I was amazed that they made a lot of music before they hit it big and some of it I like.<p>I don&#x27;t listen to a lot of &quot;new&quot; music in the sense of &quot;released in the last few years&quot; and I&#x27;d be inclined to blame the prevalence of auto-tune for that.  People I know in the music industry make all sorts of excuses (&quot;Don&#x27;t you like the vocoders on Daft Punk?&quot;, &quot;... look I like the vocoders in Laurie Anderson&#x27;s work and in Neil Young&#x27;s *Trans&amp;&quot;,  &quot;Isn&#x27;t T-Pain talented?&quot;, &quot;...

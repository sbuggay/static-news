Not just the changing styles, but also our relationship with it.<p>As I understand it, it wasn&#x27;t that long ago that a new homeowner would essentially go out and purchase a full set of furniture for their home and that was that. It was expensive. They kept it throughout their lifetime. It lasted.<p>Sometimes furniture was inherited. It had real value and was considered an asset.<p>Then sometime in maybe the last 50 years or so we started buying and manufacturing much cheaper furniture that wasn&#x27;t expected to last.<p>I can remember reading maybe 10 years ago that the bottom was falling out of the secondhand furniture market because of a flood of old furniture being sold. Apparently these were often items that had been handed down through generations that young people weren&#x27;t interested in keeping. Not so much because of the style, but because they simply had nowhere to put it. No permanent home for themselves let alone large pieces of furniture. Quite sad really.</div><br/><div id="40339345" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40339345" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">showerst</span><span>|</span><a href="#40338679">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40338835">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40339345">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40339345">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Two other big things:<p>1.

A large ornate wooden cabinet that would&#x27;ve been &#x27;normal&#x27; if a little old fashioned any time from the 1880s to the 1970s suddenly looked terribly mismatched in a room full of minimalist white and light wood items.

I&#x27;ll never part with the thing but I doubt I&#x27;ll ever get it restored either.<p>My mother has an old settee that was her aunts. It&#x27;s falling apart needing new springs and upholstery.

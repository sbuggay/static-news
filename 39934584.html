With 100M users OpenAI might be generating on the order of 1 trillion tokens per month. These logs are mixed AI and human text, the human part containing tasks and feedback.<p>By transforming these chat logs into training examples and fine-tuning the model there is a way to integrate LLM and human signals. Of course it is necessary to be mindful of copyright and PII during this process, not everything is generally useful to be included in the model. But having hundreds of millions of people inputting feedback into the model can scale even more than unassisted content publishing.<p>Besides the AI users, we have the social networks. Billions of people comment on the news, if you scrape a comment thread such as this one you can readily generate an article from it, grounded in human feedback (sample based on this thread <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;R229b41s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;R229b41s</a>)<p>Ultimately I don&#x27;t believe publishers will stop creating content because there are many reasons to do it besides collecting advertising fees, but as a backup we have LLMs continuously learning by assisting their users or reshaping informal communications into well formed content. It&#x27;s a two way street - both the LLM and human get help from each other.<p>In turn, LLMs learn from other LLMs, usually Mistral and LLaMA would learn from GPT-4, this process works very very well. So any skills learned by a SOTA model with massive human chat logs would eventually be extracted for small models. Feedback percolates back to all AI agents.<p>tl;dr Turning comment threads or human-AI chat logs into articles is a possible solution.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39937345" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39937345" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JieJie</span><span>|</span><a href="#39935837">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39935918">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39938086">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39937345">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39937345">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I hope your comment doesn&#x27;t get downvoted too heavily, because I think you raise good points.<p>What seems to be happening, and is happening in this document by W3C as well, is that the social value of information and the economic value of information are being conflated. Social media has created markets for creative works where these two values become entangled.<p>Another way to say this is that commercial art and fine art are different things, but they are treated the same by the web and perhaps they shouldn&#x27;t.<p>When someone creates fine art, they are not creating art for the sake of its economic value. They are creating a work of art for its social value, and want it distributed as widely as possible.<p>When someone creates commercial art, they are creating art specifically for its economic value. That value may be enhanced by wider distribution, but it may also be diluted by wider distribution.<p>Because these two types of art need to be treated differently by the web, we can&#x27;t have one solution that benefits both kinds of art.<p>We need both copyright to protect commercial artworks, but we need a system that encourages wide distribution of the collective information of humanity, allowing equal weight to everyone&#x27;s ideas, outside of their economic value.<p>i.e. Kafka&#x27;s ideas are more valuable to humanity than Beavis and Butthead.<p>This W3C draft doesn&#x27;t take that into account. It needs to. We need to think beyond the needs of artists who rely on social media to ply their wares, while also taking into account their needs. We should not, however, codify the social media influencer art market, because that is not a market worth protecting. It&#x27;s an aberration that encourages people to share personal information and works that benefit the platforms and harms society. We want to build something that benefits society and the individuals who contribute artworks that benefit society today and into the future.

It&#x27;s not like Panasonic has a list of all of the cobalt miners that were part of their supply chain. They themselves have no idea where their cobalt comes from, as they get it through several layers of middlemen. At the root of this supply chain are people like an man who feeds orphans, but forces them to collect peculiar-looking rocks, which he sells to the local warlord&#x27;s nephew for $2 per hundred pounds. It&#x27;s not exactly a place that&#x27;s ripe for unionization. Even could pay somebody to strike, they really have no incentive to do so, as they&#x27;d rather earn even more money by not striking and you have no way to keep any individual person accountable.<p>Also I struggle to see how a worker revolution in Tanzania is going to spread to China, which then trickles down to tech workers.

Taking the US as an illustrative example: How about legalising corruption in politics through Citizens United and having laws systemically rewritten to favor the rich?  Or the government subsequently effectively pumping investors portfolios with the poor&#x27;s money through QE (especially using the slap in the face &quot;too big to fall&quot; justification which essentially says the wealthy are more important to the economy than the poor)?  How about raising taxes on the poor by not adjusting tax brackets for inflation while corporate taxes have trended down?  How about Exxon making record profits by getting government subsidies and further subsidising its own profits by making the world poorer with its pollution?<p>Paying taxes is not a voluntary choice.  Subjecting yourself to inflation is not a voluntary choice.  Having your environment polluted is not a voluntary choice.  You have no political alternative to this system, no vote you can make to say no to it.  The rich taking from the poor is only not considered robbery since the wealthy both (legally) bribe the lawmakers and are the lawmakers.  Just look at Clarence Thomas.  Only the poor taking from the rich is robbery.<p>The semantics of what constitutes robbery aside, the world is experiencing a totally unsustainable concentration of wealth which will eventually cause markets for goods &amp; services, consumerism, and the engine of world economics to collapse toppling the entire wealth pyramid.  On top of that, global warming and the fact that oil supply seems to be plateauing (So we can&#x27;t kick the true costs of energy down the road again) is suddenly going to make being poor much more expensive.  At some point sheer practicality will prevail and redistribution to the poor will need to happen, and if it doesn&#x27;t happen voluntarily, it is likely to result in an eventual revolution.  If a revolution happens, it&#x27;s likely that suddenly lawmakers will change the semantic definition of robbery.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35795470" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35795470" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tysam_and</span><span>|</span><a href="#35794792">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35795261">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35799349">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35795418">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35795470">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35795470">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The KL divergence (number of bits needed to encode one message with the coding scheme of another) is extremely high here between perspectives, so communicating the shared values here may be hard.<p>You might appreciate taking an opportunity to just listen a bit to where some more downtrodden people are if you have that opportunity come up organically. I&#x27;ve lived in the perspective that you share, and I&#x27;ve lived in others, and it just took me cumulatively a lot of traveling and talking and listening to people to hear and develop other opinions and ways of seeing things (not just how other people in my in-group said how they saw things -- perhaps one of the fronts of some of the most toxic assumptions that I&#x27;ve ever made about people in the end).

This is a topic discussed in Nonviolent Communication and I rather appreciate it.<p>What I have seen a number of times is that there&#x27;s a turning point once I see how someone is meeting a basic emotional need with a particular strategy, and the through-line to it. Without that through line, things can be a bit scary as they don&#x27;t seem to follow causal rules from the outside, and we&#x27;re all limited in our models.<p>I don&#x27;t always stay in really close to people advocating for violence, for example, as that&#x27;s not a culture I entirely prefer. I&#x27;ve come to a belief after a while that nearly everyone is an extremely rational agent in their decision-making, and that it&#x27;s actually the information presented to the person inside their brain at the point of the decision-making that is oftentimes the culprit for the vast differences in behavior for certain people. I&#x27;ve seen it from traumagenic mental health disorders to even normal differences in political opinion. Realistically I can&#x27;t quite get in to that place of reasoning to speak with that person always, and it&#x27;s not even really my place to do that or maybe even try. But it is humanizing, and it has helped me keep my head on straight instead of writing someone off so I don&#x27;t feel disturbed by an unknown unknown rolling around some proverbial emotional garden.<p>Daryl Davis is another person I really respect and like as well. I look up to a lot of how he handled those kinds of clashes, as the way it resolved for him always has been so strange and mysterious to me. Incredible story, tbh.<p>I&#x27;ll leave off with this quote from him here. Of course the goal is not necessarily to convert someone always to a different belief system, but I think it can maybe then be reinterpreted here as finding a peaceable middle ground:<p>&quot;When they see that you know about their organization, their belief system, they respect you. Whether they like you or not, they respect the fact that you&#x27;ve done your homework. Just like any good salesman, you want a return visit and they recognized that I&#x27;d done my homework, which allowed me to come back again.<p>That began to chip away at their ideology because when two enemies are talking, they&#x27;re not fighting. It&#x27;s when the talking ceases that the ground becomes fertile for violence. If you spend five minutes with your worst enemy — it doesn&#x27;t have to be about race, it could be about anything...you will find that you both have something in common. As you build upon those commonalities, you&#x27;re forming a relationship and as you build about that relationship, you&#x27;re forming a friendship. That&#x27;s what would happen.

Because they drew country borders willy-nilly around tribes, sometimes even splitting tribes between countries, and culturally the tribes only vote for their own, the countries are ruled by majority tribes which become the rich and leading class. Ethiopia has this problem too for example. Then tribalism + continued tensions just keep going from there.<p>Of course there is the rampant corruption. There are also collective community policing strategies too in some communities, for example.<p>In the African Union I have high hopes for the continent, but still I think there is a a very large, very large, very large barrier to overcome because of the infighting.<p>As far as the unionization, I think if handled right it can have lower downsides for the amount of bargaining power that it provides. It seems that a lot of African culture thrives on ad-hoc person-to-person movements, so this feels very much within the lines of what could work in Africa. But tribalism inside of each country and between countries could still keep any local movements from having a larger impact within the continent even if, say, a local union is successful.<p>In any case, it basically moves the Nash Equilibrium but doesn&#x27;t necessarily abolish it. If handled poorly, or if the company retaliates, then sure, if the company is willing to run the press gauntlet and such. But at the very least, I have hopes.<p>Also I know of the conflict in Somalia, Ethiopia, South &amp; North Sudan, etc. I haven&#x27;t checked in on Kenya in a while.

Tribal conflicts existed way before the British did.<p>For example, Sudan existed before the British came, and the Arab vs black fights in Sudan is not a British creation. Somalia is mono-ethnic, doesn&#x27;t stop it from endless wars. Ethiopia was not colonised beyond a short Italian occupation, their current civil war is still the result of ethnic conflicts.<p>African unity is also a questionable concept. West, Central, East and Southern Africa are four different continents in terms of culture, ethnicities, climate,  and size.

It&#x27;ll be very interesting to see how the african public reacts to AI.</div><br/><div id="35797243" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35797243" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tysam_and</span><span>|</span><a href="#35794802">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35796782">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35796771">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35797243">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35797243">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I really and truly hope so. I have a lot to learn about the continent, and I love it much. I&#x27;ve done some work on significantly reducing the experiment cost for small experiments on GPT and convnet models (WikiText and CIFAR10, respectively), and one of the big things that I thought of was how it could help Africans in AI specifically because it allows for good research test signals but isn&#x27;t prohibitively expensive&#x2F;slow.<p>On A100s this particular CIFAR10 network trains in under 7 seconds for example and the network (fp16) is &lt;10 MB IIRC, the relative gains over other previous training speeds is even better on older cards IIRC due to it being pretty memory limited at this point. It could be used as a backbone in other networks and is nice because it is good to run experiments on and also can directly deploy at scale pretty easily. In my experience, cycle time is actually one of the biggest resources for most smaller research initiatives.<p>I just haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to talk to anyone yet to see if there&#x27;s a way that I could interface with the African AI community over it. I don&#x27;t know how Colab works but they work pretty darn well in the free version of Colab, and both are annotated to help a moderately well-motivated learner pick up some of the ropes themselves.<p>It seems like you know a little about the space. If you do know anyone or have any pointers as to where I could&#x2F;should look to talk to people about this, please do let me know!

The vastly underpaid and overworked teachers no longer need to waste time in preparing lessons, they just need to control the classroom and perform assessments. Also GPT-4 probably dominates your average English tutor in Africa...<p>The problem is the cost, a GPT-4 subscription is far beyond the means of an average African. The bottleneck is with server-side inference costs, once that is solved, I expect a AI gold rush in Africa, where western companies compete to sell AI subscription services. Your average African already owns a cheap andrioid phone with 3g connection, which is good enough for an AI chatbot.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35796771" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35796771" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ClumsyPilot</span><span>|</span><a href="#35794802">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35796198">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35796300">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35799167">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35796771">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35796771">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; To the east is Somalia, to the north is Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan, all countries locked in civil war between different &#x27;collective movements&#x27;<p>Even my limited knowledge of the situation is enough to tell that this is neither historically accurate nor a fair portrayal.<p>This does not sound like a good faith argument.<p>No collective movements means no American revolution, no Civil war, no French Revolution, no Glorious revolution in Britain.<p>We&#x27;d still bow down to Kings and have slavery</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35799167" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35799167" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">_fizz_buzz_</span><span>|</span><a href="#35794802">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35794874">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35796126">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35794991">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35799167">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35799167">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; 3.

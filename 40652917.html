Basically, it would traverse a graph as rays exited one sector and entered a neighboring sector.  The approach is very much akin to walks through tet meshes in modern science apps.<p>In ray tracing, there are three commonly used spatial acceleration structures these days: grids, binary space partitions, and bounding volume hierarchies.  Any one of those might have worked for Doom.<p>Though this post mentions marching through grids (as in Wolfenstein 3D) as not working for the arbitrarily positioned and angled walls, the usual way of using grids for ray tracing is to have each grid cell hold a list of the primitives that overlap it (many-to-many).  Then you march the ray through the grid and test the ray against the list of primitives for each cell.  You&#x27;d often use &quot;mailboxing&quot; (i.e., tiny LRU) to prevent retesting the same primitives over and over, since adjacent grid cells would often share primitives.<p>So basically extending the Wolfenstein 3D grid approach to Doom would have mean voxelizing the map to get lists of candidate walls for each cell, but testing the rays against the walls themselves (rather than say, the voxels themselves like in Minecraft).<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the tradeoffs for memory or performance on the 386s of the time would have been, however.  But I think it&#x27;s clear that while BSPs were a clever solution, they weren&#x27;t the only possible choice.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jedi_(game_engine)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jedi_(game_engine)</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Build_(game_engine)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Build_(game_engine)</a></div><br/><div id="40655064" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40655064" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">iforgotpassword</span><span>|</span><a href="#40653495">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40654904">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40655064">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40655064">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was looking for a post mentioning the build engine.

This is random in memory and not efficient for modern CPUs because the branch predictor is ineffective and the memory layout is typically not contiguous. It is even worse on GPUs. Doom was written in 1993 when this was much less of a concern, but with Quake and later engines it become a scalability bottleneck.<p>BSP maps require a very compute-intensive pre-processing step. Back then this limited modding and third-party maps because a very high-end PC was needed. This processing also had numerical precision issues. Theoretically this isn&#x27;t a problem, but in practice it is. Designers had to be careful to make sure the map is completely closed (&quot;airtight&quot;) and that the BSP process didn&#x27;t create thin triangles. This meant that map design tools had to have all sorts of constraints on alignment and snapping to prevent the geometry &quot;blowing up&quot;. A gotcha is that BSP <i>splits</i> polygons and hence the processing eats into the the map geometry polygon budget!<p>Portals are much simpler to implement, and each room can scale to any number of triangles. They&#x27;re much more efficient with modern CPUs and GPUs, because each room can be sent as a single draw call (&quot;batch&quot; processing) instead of a list of individual triangles.<p>The problem with portal-based techniques is that there are sudden step-changes in the number of triangles needed to draw each frame as the camera moves. This can result in stuttering and sudden framerate drops. It can also blow through triangle budgets.<p>A common technique is to limit portal traversal depth in some way, which would cause &quot;black&quot; doorways in the distance and other similar artefacts. Similarly, certain map geometries were poorly supported, such as complex outdoor spaces with visibility from many directions into many rooms.</div><br/><div id="40655122" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40655122" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">iforgotpassword</span><span>|</span><a href="#40653495">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40654904">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40654997">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40655122">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40655122">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I remember building Unreal maps as a teen.

Home computers that did run video games had special hardware dedicated for it, like the Commodore 64, the MSX, and the ZX Spectrum, but PCs weren&#x27;t geared for games.<p>In fact, another one of Carmack&#x27;s contributions to PC gaming was porting Super Mario 3 to the PC and demoing it to Nintendo as a proof of concept for smooth pixel sized scrolling, which was something that PCs were very poor at. His approach was to basically do a graphical diff frame by frame and only render the parts of the screen that changed, whereas all the other home computers I mentioned and even gaming consoles like the NES and Sega Master System had dedicated hardware for scrolling sprites.<p>Nintendo did not go forward with Carmack&#x27;s proposal, wanting to keep their games exclusive to their own platform, but Carmack and id Software did manage to use that technology to develop Commander Keen. Prior to Commander Keen there were maybe 3-4 PC games that had any kind of pixel scrolling whatsoever and it was fairly limited.</div><br/><div id="40653801" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40653801" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wheels</span><span>|</span><a href="#40653353">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40653458">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40653463">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40653801">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40653801">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not saying PCs were especially good for games, but that that was one of the main things they were bought and used for, at least at home.

To that end I think the article is fair to point out that DOOM was programmed to run on computers that did not have the kind of hardware support for gaming that many other home computer systems had, and because of that techniques had to be carefully engineered to get such games to run on them.<p>Consider that many of the games you mentioned such as Lemmings, Prince of Persia, and Sim City were not even released on the PC originally and were ported to the PC often times years after their initial release.<p>In 1990 PCs including clones made up only 15% of market share, whereas by 1994 they made up over half of the home computer market share.

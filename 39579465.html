I had stumbled on this memorial site[0] for an engineer at WebTV named Jos who passed well before his time. The site includes some of his college essays[1] as well as some other bits of writing like his guide to OOP programming[2] (complete with Spanish and Portuguese translations !). His writing style and sense of humor have stuck with me for years and years now, and I still visit the site to have a laugh. Seemed like a very dynamic individual, and I&#x27;m grateful to his family for keeping his memory alive.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sepwww.stanford.edu&#x2F;sep&#x2F;jon&#x2F;family&#x2F;jos&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sepwww.stanford.edu&#x2F;sep&#x2F;jon&#x2F;family&#x2F;jos&#x2F;</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sepwww.stanford.edu&#x2F;sep&#x2F;jon&#x2F;family&#x2F;jos&#x2F;college&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sepwww.stanford.edu&#x2F;sep&#x2F;jon&#x2F;family&#x2F;jos&#x2F;college&#x2F;index...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sepwww.stanford.edu&#x2F;sep&#x2F;jon&#x2F;family&#x2F;jos&#x2F;oop&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sepwww.stanford.edu&#x2F;sep&#x2F;jon&#x2F;family&#x2F;jos&#x2F;oop&#x2F;index.htm...</a></div><br/><div id="39599558" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39599558" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">93po</span><span>|</span><a href="#39598210">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39597870">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39599558">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39599558">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for links.

What I do remember was how much he loved and used that thing, in a way that was fairly shocking to me, given how slow and unoptimized the systems were by then. I’m hoping I was able to convince him to spend his $500 credit or whatever on some eMachines package that would honestly still been a piece of shit, but would have been way better than the primitive low-memory WebTV, but who knows. That man <i>loved</i> that WebTV. That was one of the first times I got to see just how change-averse people can get when it comes to technology, and in retrospect, situations like that one helped me develop empathy for users.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39599359" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39599359" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jinto36</span><span>|</span><a href="#39600119">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39598263">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39599359">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39599359">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">WebTV largely worked better than I think it often gets credit for, and I echo the sentiment elsewhere that it felt &quot;futuristic&quot; in a sense. I had a Windows desktop, but we came into possession of a Philips WebTV box since my father was in sales and his company had a catalog of sales incentive items you could get for meeting sales targets. I <i>really</i> did not want use AOL like it seemed everyone else did, and the WebTV subscription was pretty reasonable compared to other options. We had the version with the hard drive and wireless keyboard. The hardware was really pretty decent- the keyboard was ok, I could print with it, and the feature I thought that really set it apart was the ports for video capture. I don&#x27;t think they ever implemented a good way to use that capability for video, but I used it to capture screenshots from our family camcorder and attach them to email or post them on the webtv personal &quot;website&quot; or print them.<p>My early use of eBay was through WebTV, with both buying and selling, and it largely worked. You could browse webrings and read email from the couch!<p>Most of all, the dialing music was fantastic and I still listen to it once in a while: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=brZYWcGgg4Y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=brZYWcGgg4Y</a><p>When free ad-supported dialup services came around (Juno, Bluelight, NetZero) I alternated using those and WebTV for a while. As pages moved away from simple text&#x2F;table&#x2F;image based sites, page rendering quality unsurprisingly degraded. I think the version we owned had some Flash support but it was slow.<p>Looking back on it, it&#x27;s impressive how legible text was on a 20&quot; CRT TV in the interface (through S-Video). It was more usable than some modern &quot;smart&quot; TV interfaces.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39598263" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39598263" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xcdzvyn</span><span>|</span><a href="#39599359">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39599616">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39598263">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39598263">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I nodded off watching this great Michael MJD video unboxing and setting up an original WebTV last night[0].<p>He plays around with an ongoing project to reverse-engineer and re-implement WebTV servers for self-hosting[1].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;NjteQv6oYgA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;NjteQv6oYgA</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zefie&#x2F;zefie_wtvp_minisrv">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zefie&#x2F;zefie_wtvp_minisrv</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39599616" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39599616" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cat_plus_plus</span><span>|</span><a href="#39598263">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39599138">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39599616">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39599616">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Cool, I worked on Network Computer that had a similar purpose but never reached comparative market success of WebTV.

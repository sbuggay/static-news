When the probe gets loaded, the kernel doesn’t typecheck the arguments, and so doesn’t realise the probe isn’t compatible with the new kernel. When the probe runs, shit happens and you end up with a kernel panic.<p>eBPF probes causing kernel panics are almost always indication of a kernel bug, not a bug in the ebpf vendor.

If a person can write and read two sorta coherent paragraphs of text for a internet forum, they are already on the level of being willing to learn and a little curious, above what the tech giants expect from their model user. There are enough of such people to have interesting and diverse discussions. Don&#x27;t tell me Discord is easy to figure out. I&#x27;m not saying the devs should be working to make the experience easier, but it starts to be one of those topics where the discussion is meme-based.<p>You can tell search engine robots not to index your copies of different forums.

I run Pleroma, which is a microblogging server like Mastodon, so Mastodon content that federates to my instance shows up identically to my own posts. On a system like Lemmy, when their posts federate to me, what I see natively on my instance is a person posting a link that links to the originating website. I can see some replies inline, but they&#x27;re linear and not threaded like on Lemmy. However, unlike what you said, still using my @me@my.domain identity, I can click the link from my instance to the Lemmy instance and interact with the content there natively. No need to create a different subdomain. There&#x27;s no need to host a Lemmy instance yourself if you want to interact with Lemmy instances. Lemmy on the backend is still talking the ActivityPub protocol and it&#x27;s only the frontend that alters how the posts are presented, so as long as your server speaks ActivityPub, you can use the same identity.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36399928" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36399928" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ajdude</span><span>|</span><a href="#36398127">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36399613">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36400753">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36400667">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36399928">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36399928">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are you saying that the primary issue is that for each federated service we need a separate account &#x2F; instance for it as opposed to email which is just one email account?

There&#x27;s IPFS, but it&#x27;s 90% Make Money Fast with crypto and 10% actually storing stuff.
Whatever happened to the DOI concept?<p>There&#x27;s distributed caching, like PeerTube, which works better. Every file has a home location, but if lots of people want something, it gets replicated.

But that applies to pretty much any organizational activity, not just federated protocols, and often people try to push back against oligopolies or monopolies; often it is desirable and possible.<p>The &quot;Authentication&quot; one only applies to web-based clients, but you can login to remote instances even with those: converse.js supports it for XMPP, for instance. Possibly not in the way the author imagines it should though; perhaps that is closer to OpenID&#x2F;WebID&#x2F;OAuth. Still, generally users are not meant to login to every instance directly: even with just Google and Microsoft, you do not login to a Microsoft server to send them a message from your Gmail account, as you do not login into the receiver&#x27;s email account to place a message for them. Maybe this section should have been titled &quot;learning curve&quot; instead.<p>The &quot;Search Engine Optimization&quot; probably describes the current state of things (I am not familiar with that), though does not apply to many federated protocols (e.g., I do not want my email or XMPP messages to be SEO&#x27;d), and I do not see a technical reason for that when it may be useful (e.g., public blogging or discussions); certainly does not sound like a drawback of federation itself to me, but maybe that of certain search engines&#x27; policies.<p>I personally usually saw discoverability&#x2F;exploration as the primary issue with both federated and distributed protocols, especially when it comes to social ones, and hoped that RDF with FOAF will help with it.

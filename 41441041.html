Sure, smart, educated, cultured, wise people could get more out of some of them (like Anna Karenina), but the books were written to be made accessible to each and every human.<p>Getting to know Neal&#x27;s works has brought in a paradigm shift in my reading and thinking, and now I read other authors like Greg Egan, too.<p>Thanks to Neal for being himself. And thanks to HN for suggesting his works on books threads.<p>I am reading Quicksilver right now, and read Anathem, Snow Crash, Cryptonomicon, Diamond Age before. <i>Loved</i> each one.<p>If you are reading this comment, feel free to suggest me other authors or works, although not from Neal, as I will read ALL of his works, anyway.</div><br/><div id="41443258" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41443258" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">trenchgun</span><span>|</span><a href="#41443217">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41441544">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41443258">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41443258">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I can recommend for example Hannu Rajaniemi and Peter Watts</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41441544" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41441544" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sanex</span><span>|</span><a href="#41443217">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41443281">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41441544">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41441544">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Every interview I&#x27;ve watched with Neal lately I feel like he&#x27;s tired of talking about a concept from his 2nd (technically third but we don&#x27;t talk about that) book 30 years ago.

Some of the really good guys usually play over it, and reinvent themselves, ignoring what their fans want to hear.<p>That said, I personally also prefer his earlier books.  Granted, snowcrash was a young mans fever dream, and you kind of grow out of it.  A young ladies illustrated primer?  That was kinda cool.  Quicksilver?

&quot;Stephenson: My overarching answer is that the actual market and actual users find ways to do things that we don&#x27;t necessarily imagine in advance, just with our own limited perspective. And so cyberpunk had a whole aesthetic about it and still does, which to a large extent, revolved around having cool shit on your face. Mirror shades. Actually, one of the original anthologies of cyberpunk fiction was called Mirror Shades. And it was easy to assume back then that in order to truly experience a three-dimensional environment in an immersive way that you needed stereoscopy, you needed to have a different image slightly in each eyeball to give you a fully three-dimensional effect.<p>And so there&#x27;s always been this linkage in people&#x27;s minds between cyberspace, the Metaverse, and goggles. What we&#x27;ve learned is way more nuanced and interesting than that. The year after Snow Crash came out was when Doom was released, and Doom is the ancestor of all games that are set in immersive environments [Note: Tim is nodding]. And it didn&#x27;t require stereoscopy. It was all in a screen - very low resolution by current standards - and yet, the magic of the illusion was that you were running around in this three-dimensional persistent environment. And then since then, that kind of experience has only gotten better. And in the meantime, we&#x27;ve been learning things about goggles, about headsets and what they are and are not good at. And it took a long time for them to get to the point where [input&#x2F;output] lag was acceptable. And so there&#x27;s kind of this long period of time during which video games on screens were getting much, much, much better, but the acceptance of headsets was [falling] behind, because if lag is bad, you&#x27;re more prone to get sick.<p>One of the things that I became aware of when I was working at Magic Leap on AR headsets is that stereoscopy isn&#x27;t enough. That your brain actually uses a lot of other cues other than stereoscopy to build a map of the three-dimensional world around you. And so people with one eye, one-eyed people can still perceive three-dimensionality, for example, because of these other mechanisms.<p>This is a kind of a long-winded way of saying that the reality we&#x27;ve ended up with, which didn&#x27;t seem plausible in 1990 when I was writing [Snow Crash], is that we&#x27;ve got billions of people fluently navigating highly realistic, immersive, three-dimensional worlds using flat screens and keyboard and mouse.&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="41441645" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41441645" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Ono-Sendai</span><span>|</span><a href="#41443281">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41441426">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41441645">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41441645">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m going to plug my open-source metaverse - Substrata (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;substrata.info&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;substrata.info&#x2F;</a>) - and talk about it a bit, since it seems relevant to a lot of the topics in this article.<p>A single world: There is a single main Substrata world, which is filled with user-generated content and scripts.   Rendering this and running physics for it is such a difficult technical problem that most other metaverses don&#x27;t even try!   Instead they tend to have lots of separate worlds &#x2F; rooms.  A single main world was important for me, partly as a result of reading Snow Crash.<p>Technology sharing:
I recently added Luau scripting, which is a fantastic Lua fork from Roblox.  It allows sandboxed script execution, has a JIT mode, and has all the usual benefits of Lua (easy binding code etc.).<p>Substrata also imports standard formats like GLTF.  GLTF actually allows pretty good reuse of assets between metaverses.<p>Crypto: Substrata optionally uses Ethereum NFTs for land - people can pay for land in Fiat, and then optionally mint the land as NFTs.  
The big advantage of using NFTs here is that allows land to be traded on the &#x27;secondary market&#x27;, without me having to do anything, and without my permission and involvement.
If I didn&#x27;t use crypto then i would need to implement some kind of marketplace myself, perhaps with an escrow system for land transfer etc, and have to deal with fraud and chargebacks etc.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41441426" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41441426" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">markus_zhang</span><span>|</span><a href="#41441645">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41442653">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41441426">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41441426">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have always believed that the Metaverse is whatever modern computing (especially the Internet) has evolved into. It has nothing to do with VR googles. You don&#x27;t need AAA graphics to make an immersing world -- in fact, some text adventure games are quite immersive, and by the same principle you don&#x27;t need VR to enter the Metaverse.<p>Metaverse is escapism and alternative socializing in capital letters. For me, Metaverse in the 80s is me typing BASIC programs, playing Alley Cat, and watching a friend play Prince of Persia (in reality, not VR). Metaverse in the 90s is me borrowing pirated games from a friend and logging into BBS talking trash till early morning. It has always been here. It never left. It IS immersive. It doesn&#x27;t need some VR devices to be &quot;more&quot; immersive. In fact, the more &quot;modern&quot; we become, the LESS immersive it seems to be, with all those online ads and other shits.<p>Welcome to the Metaverse.</div><br/><div id="41441556" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41441556" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cubefox</span><span>|</span><a href="#41441426">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41441634">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41441556">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41441556">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Stephenson and Sweeney mean something else: User-generated 3D worlds where people interact with their avatars, e.g. to play games.

There should be no reason that Netflix or Amazon or Epic should have to pay the Apple 30% tax (it&#x27;s probably less by some agreement they have) on digital purchases purely through their existing payment platforms.

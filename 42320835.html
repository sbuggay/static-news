One needs to be able to relate to his ideas from personal experience and (for lack of a better word) spiritual development, and also be able to appreciate complex nuance to really get it. This is confounded by the fact that Nietzsche had an obtuse style on purpose- he actively wanted his work to be exclusive, and not easily understandable, and actually often tried to be misleading or confusing on purpose. Carl Jung had a deep understanding of Nietzsche, that none of the English language translators have.<p>I have read all of his work, and it took me quite a while, including reading Jung&#x27;s seminars to really feel I could grasp the bigger picture of his ideas. And once I did, I could clearly see that the translators who had translated and commented on his work were really only getting at the surface, and not really understanding- and then also choosing the wrong words when translating as a result, which was making it even harder to understand.<p>Also, if you are going to directly read his work, don&#x27;t read Zarathustra first as it is an especially hard read- it is written in the style of an ancient religious text and not philosophy- The Gay Science would probably be my recommendation.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42324902" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42324902" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">grepexdev</span><span>|</span><a href="#42323182">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42323485">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42324179">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42321324">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42324902">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42324902">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Kaufman translations are going to be the best you&#x27;re going to get.

Once you can fit more ideas in, then each idea can have room to become more complex. I think that&#x27;s the &quot;mechanism&quot; (pun intended) by which your consciousness&#x2F;intelligence improves simply by being able to write faster.<p>It&#x27;s probably partially also why stimulant drugs can make people appear more intelligent.

It cannot be because Nietzsche stopped thinking on the eve of imperialism: for him the age of imperialist barbarism is still a dream of the future, while fascist ideology arose as a repulsive product of decay of developed imperialism. This difference in periods also determines the difference in intellectual and aesthetic level. Nietzsche is a man of broad and varied culture, in contrast to the ignorance of Hitler or Goering, the boastful half-education of a Rosenberg or Goebbels; For all his mannerisms, he is a witty and important stylist who – albeit often problematically – has nevertheless worked creatively in language, in contrast to the barbarization and rape of the German language under Hitlerian tyranny. In addition, one could also point out many individual deviations. Nietzsche always despised anti-Semitism.

   Despite all these conceptual, aesthetic, and moral differences, Rosenberg rightly named Nietzsche the ancestor of German fascism. For Nietzsche carried the glorification of barbarism into German philosophy, and the more justly one assesses his intellectual abilities, his cultural-critical work, the more clearly one must see that the change he made created the basis for that reactionary development in German ideology, from which fascism then drew its intellectual arsenal.

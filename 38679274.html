This is because the license plates describe roughly the area they live in. So someone could spend time poking around Street View on Google Maps and potentially find where a local lives and either steal their car or attempt to remove expensive parts (aftermarket wheels, for instance) for selling.</div><br/><div id="38680020" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38680020" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">graphe</span><span>|</span><a href="#38679926">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38680172">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38680020">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38680020">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My guess is that the low property crime is due to nothing worth taking in the home, and Japanese property crimes don&#x27;t happen face to face.

It&#x27;s hard to fence things if there&#x27;s no one around to fence it. It&#x27;s hard to re-sell fenced items if no one will buy from you. I really do wonder if mercari has made this problem a bit worse.<p>Sure, the police don&#x27;t arrest people they can&#x27;t convict (which is why their prosecution rate is so high), but that doesn&#x27;t change the reported crimes, which this data related to, so it&#x27;s not a data issue. Japan is less safe than they report (murders are often shown as accidental death in numbers, for example), but in general property crime seems to be mostly non-existent.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38679309" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38679309" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ggm</span><span>|</span><a href="#38679976">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38679920">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38679309">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38679309">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">there are elements of correlation&#x2F;causation in this, so I think it&#x27;s still &quot;not clear&quot; -But I too would think overall economic improvement reduces the &quot;need&quot; (for want of a better word) of pragmatic crime by poor people.<p>IoT like nest and other things may also make people wary of casual crime, its much more likely you&#x27;re on film. I know there is a really good privacy concern around ubiquitous cameras but the other side of the coin is older, insecure and scared people who gain some comfort from knowing somebody can see whats going on around them. Ubiquitous digital cameras emerged across this timeframe.<p>Japan&#x27;s crime culture is ideated by westerners as &quot;about them, not us&quot; -but this is about crime by Japanese on Japanese so it&#x27;s outside that model. Certainly as a sometime frequent western visitor to Japan I have never felt the degree of situational risk I have felt in other economies, just being on the streets. It is a place where the most likely outcome of dropping your wallet is to have somebody help get it back to you. Most likely, not only.<p>Maybe theft from other Japanese really has declined, for it&#x27;s own reasons? Maybe people no longer think its worthwhile? Which tends to the economic argument. Why steal that trivial bit of plastic and metal, if you can buy it in the 100 yen shop?</div><br/></div></div><div id="38679920" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38679920" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bsder</span><span>|</span><a href="#38679309">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38679922">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38679920">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38679920">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As always, take Japanese crime statistics with a large grain of salt.  I remember the Japanese police have quoted something like a 90%+ clearance rate (uh, yeah, right).<p>Also, do I remember incorrectly or did they not go on a serious campaign to break the yakuza at the same time?<p>A lot of petty crime is enabled by the organized crime providing the infrastructure (fencing, financing, etc.) required for individuals to be able to convert their crime into money.<p>(See, for example, the current &quot;shoplifting&quot; spree in the US or &quot;bike theft&quot; rings.  While individuals often commit the crimes, gangs are the big enablers by functioning as fences.

But the caveat here is, the CPO and leadership team should do this. And if this does not resonate with the engineers, is it really wise to educate the product manager by sending him&#x2F;her some literature on how to do strategy?<p>I would suggest to handle this if this occurs with more care. And also consider that many very successful companies did not have a written mission and strategy, it is usually introduced in the scale up phase when stakeholders demand more on the why and how.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37591924" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37591924" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">johndhi</span><span>|</span><a href="#37594654">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37594543">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37591924">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37591924">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Personally I&#x27;ve always found &quot;risks&quot; in product roadmap tend to not be great.

Most companies are so messed up that there is no coherent strategy, so you cannot require a single product manager to have an excellent roadmap, when the conditions for creating one is not there. You also may be working on a product or area that is far below the high level strategy, so it&#x27;s goals would be different.<p>If an engineer really goes and thinks they should evaluate a roadmap like this, that&#x27;s toxic.</div><br/><div id="37592078" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37592078" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mmmmpancakes</span><span>|</span><a href="#37591356">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37591540">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37592078">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37592078">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It may be ideal to have all these items checked off. I think a productive way to look at this is &quot;how many of these items does the roadmap check&quot;?<p>If the answer is &quot;very few&quot; then that might be an early warning sign you&#x27;re working for a product or org that is headed for serious problems. As a technical IC who can&#x27;t hope to solve those large scale management problems, this can be useful a red flag. Don&#x27;t wait for shit to hit the fan to leave.<p>I have seen a large scale failure of this kind and the items listed here line up very well with some of the root causes I observed.<p>- Is the roadmap flexible or iterative? The roadmap was hard, aggressive business targets.<p>- Are the roadmap initiatives scoped and prioritized based on evidence? The roadmap initiatives were derived by working backwards from business targets and then evidence was found after the fact.<p>- Does the roadmap identify major dependencies or risks? Many risks were identified much later because techincal teams were not part of input to initial planning.<p>- Does the roadmap feel aggressive but achievable? Aggressive but not physically possible.<p>- Does the roadmap take on appropriate risk?  No, there was multiple possible independent points of failure.<p>Anyways, if you ever see this kind of product culture I suggest running for the hills unless you like having your time wasted. And if you are a technical manager I hope you push back like hell when presented with this situation.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37591540" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37591540" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xyzelement</span><span>|</span><a href="#37591356">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37592078">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37592451">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37591540">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37591540">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I am a &quot;Group Product Manager&quot; and at least on skim, this article doesn&#x27;t seem crazy.

When items are put on the roadmap, scope may not be 100% final, but there is a relatively high level of certainty for what&#x27;s in&#x2F;out of scope based on customer &amp; business value, as well as clear prioritization based on value&#x2F;effort.

To your point, product is a high-stress, demanding role, and in reality, you might not hit every item from this list all the time. This ambitiously attempted to define greatness from when I&#x27;ve been fortunate to get there, see it, or be part of it. Getting to greatness can be done; it&#x27;s just hard to achieve. I think it deserves that caveat up front, and I will update it.<p>I also agree that low-level teams might be very far removed from strategy, especially in large orgs. However, that team should have a clearly defined goal or mandate instead. So much of the product is context-driven, and the first few drafts were 3-4x longer to account for these differences between organizations, hierarchy, teams etc. I removed most of that to focus more on basic principles because this guide was starting to look like it was written by Charlie Kelly chasing Pepe Silvia accounting for all the edge cases :)</div><br/><div id="37593029" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37593029" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">doctor_eval</span><span>|</span><a href="#37591356">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37592451">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37592235">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37593029">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37593029">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I did enjoy this article and agree with almost everything.<p>One piece of advice Iâve learned the hard way, however, is if the road map doesnât make sense, itâs unlikely that making noise is going to make your life better.<p>I was reminded by this article of the time when my role as a PM was stymied by a lack of clear corporate strategy - I was told to make a road map without the support of any kind of goal or vision, told even that having a strategy would take â11 weeksâ (yeah, an oddly specific number).

It’s an island of 100 people and 10,000 deer. When we stayed at the one hotel there we had an amazing hostess who showed us to our room and then when we went down to the (only) bar was our bartender and later at the restaurant she was our server. It was an amazing small community. There is also a museum in town dedicated to people who have lived on the island. My favorite description of one women was “she was known for causing general mischief on the island”. I didn’t realize that Orwell lived there until I visited. I didn’t understand how that place would inspire 1984 but this article gives another perspective of how the environment may have affected him that i never considered.</div><br/><div id="40631133" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40631133" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">082349872349872</span><span>|</span><a href="#40629447">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40629976">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40631133">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40631133">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think that place inspired 1984; reverse the arrows: the place was a result of the thinking that led to 1984&#x27;s &quot;Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism&quot;.<p>Orwell had tried joining the proletariat for their franchise, but Blair&#x27;s habitus always gave him away (see &quot;The Spike&quot;).

I couldn&#x27;t find it in the school library, so I asked the librarian and in the most surreal experience, she looked at me and said, &quot;Follow me.&quot;<p>A few corridors later, we arrived at a double door.  She unlocked it and led me to the back.  There were stacks of them.  She handed me one and said, bring it back when you&#x27;re done with it.  I asked why it wasn&#x27;t in the library, and she said, &quot;They say it is outdated and no longer relevant.&quot;  Her facial expression clearly stated she disagreed.  They had pulled it from the curriculum, it used to be taught it class, and by the 90&#x27;s already missing from the school library.<p>Excellent book.  As the article quotes, many people think they know the book, yet have never read it.  Completely worth it, I recommend some tea and Drone Station on Soma FM.

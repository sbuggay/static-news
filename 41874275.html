For example in Taiwan a lot of older American immigrants will talk about things like crime or the police as if it was still the KMT era when Taiwan was basically a different country, and their thoughts are really strange to hear when considering modern taiwanese police (who are basically teddy bears) or crime rates (extremely low).<p>The second is that, having spend decades in the country to which they immigrated, which is probably longer than they lived in their origin country, they seem to view everything that strikes them as odd, inefficient, or bad, as unique to their new home country. In this case such as your perception of Japan as being lead top-down by bureaucrats, when that description to me applies to basically every liberal democracy on earth. Thus:<p>&gt; The government regularly launches initiatives, sets goals, and promotes catch phrases that are supposed to lead to greater progress and prosperity. But, because the initiators and funders are often only tenuously connected to the complex and dynamic reality, the projects become rigid and wasteful, and eventually wither and die, more often than not.<p>imo, this is true for most government-led initiatives in nearly every country on earth. Not that I&#x27;m arguing against government-lead initiatives because they do result in sometimes incredible things like train infrastructure, spaceships, the internet, medical breakthroughs etc, but for the most part it seems politicians make big pitches to get elected and then just maintain status quo.<p>Obviously Japan has some uniquely bureaucratic things about the culture as a whole (lol faxes), but on the other hand this doesn&#x27;t seem to be an obstacle considering they have some of the safest pedestrian-friendly streets in the world, some of the best public transit, an excellent healthcare system, low crime rates, low homelessness, low unemployment, etc. On the ground they&#x27;re doing much better than many countries.<p>What do you think?

It&#x27;s very simple: Lack of cooperation. The article describes the project &quot;was a collaborative effort of the Japanese computer industry&quot; but the results could not put any more mud on that thought.<p>Japanese companies <i>HATE</i> cooperating, they will not create nor utilize common standards nor share knowledge with each other. Japanese companies will strive at every turn to create a captive market, hoping that once you&#x27;ve set foot in their little quagmire you will stay stuck with them.<p>If you ever wondered why Canon camera lenses do not work on Nikon cameras and vice versa, why Kenwood microphones do not work with ICOM radios and vice versa, why Sony insisted on Memory Stick over SD card, why Toshiba threw out NAND flash technology, and so on then this is why. Try naming even a single international industrial standard to come out of Japan, you probably can&#x27;t and I don&#x27;t blame you. Sharing is not in Japan&#x27;s DNA.<p>Contrast the US computer industry where our companies besides Apple can and will cooperate to create and utilize common standards and push the market wider and forwards. PCI is a foremost example, but the very foundation of the industry is built on IBM PC-compatibles.<p>All this means Japan will always be stuck with a bunch of small, individual pies nobody will care about, losing to the rest of the west who cooperate (and nowadays China who force entire industries at gunpoint) for a much bigger pie.

That&#x27;s the flange-focal distance, sort of a &quot;design length of body&quot; to subtract from your overall lens barrel length.<p>It&#x27;s actually possible to drill a hole on the PCB and woodscrewing lens directly on in cases with webcams and CCTV cameras, and in those cases the distance is 0.</div><br/><div id="41876937" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41876937" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">avidiax</span><span>|</span><a href="#41874759">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41875818">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41876395">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41876937">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41876937">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For the case of 35mm SLRs, Nikon&#x2F;Canon&#x2F;Pentax etc. all have 45mm flange distances, give or take a couple of millimeters.

Japanese ham radio takes this further; when I said Kenwood microphones don&#x27;t work with ICOM radios I mean they <i>could</i> use the same number of wires and perhaps even the same connector but they keep the wiring positions proprietary.<p>So you want to use your Kenwood gear with ICOM?

And both ingredients, &quot;logic programming&quot; and &quot;parallel computing&quot; are rather arcane and underdeveloped, so many decades later.<p>The current AI hyperventilation illustrates the impact quite nicely (algorithms and models have no connection to &quot;ground truth&quot;, they need expensive and hard to use HPC hardware etc.)<p>On the other hand we had in the meantime the internet and mobile revolutions. While those are not so fundamental from a pure computing perspective, they have increased the utility of the digital domain tremendously.<p>It is conceivable that a fifth generation architecture is lurking somewhere in the chaotic mess that is the current technical landscape. E.g. the internet does enable a certain form of massive parallel processing on commodity hardware. And overtures toward &quot;logic programming&quot; are even long-time W3C standards...<p>But in the end we know by now painfully well that digital technology is not progressing monotonically.

They&#x27;re only popular locally.  LINE is probably the best here since it&#x27;s dominant in more than 1 country, unlike the others.  Meanwhile, people all around the world use Facebook (though this is falling off lately admittedly).  If you want to chat with friends in another country, FB Messenger is probably the go-to chat app for this; your friends in Europe or the US aren&#x27;t going to be using LINE or KakaoTalk if you live in Japan or Korea, and pretty much no one outside the US&#x2F;Canada uses SMS messaging (and thus iMessage) for talking to friends&#x2F;family.<p>&gt;Furthermore, the entire publicly listed tech industry globally generates around $6T in revenue, but FAANG represents only $1.4T in revenue.<p>MAMAA (because of Microsoft) builds the infrastructure most of the tech industry is built on.

Speaking for myself, I actually recently went on a bit of a buying binge, buying a bunch of books on the 5th gen project (read that Feigenbaum &amp; McCorduck book ages ago) and related ideas (eg, concurrent prolog). Because I have a hunch there&#x27;s a kernel of something useful there still waiting to emerge. Now my research may lead me nowhere, but that&#x27;s OK.

These companies don&#x27;t just sell meat, but an ideology and lifestyle to boot.<p>As an example, I was in Florida a few months ago and my girlfriend and I casually mention that we were making a salad for dinner after someone asked about our dinner plans. Their immediate response was defensive, saying, &quot;Are you one of them vegans? Well, we only eat meat around these parts&quot; and proceeded to tell us all about these great deals on meat at a local store, thinking that we&#x27;d hear those prices and be unable to resist and start eating meat.<p>Just because we mentioned a salad, his manufactured, mass-produced opinion was that we must be vegan. We&#x27;re not.

In fact, many cultures eat primarily vegetarian dishes, and will be the first to tell you how economic and efficient their meals are.<p>I urge you to reconsider your views as my industry experience, and the experiences of many non-American cultures, simply does not match up with what you&#x27;re saying.

Days that I eat meat are easier if I want a decently balanced meal. I’ve eaten vegetarian for half a year. I’ve eaten vegan for a month, done a few whole 30s. I’m no slouch in the kitchen, but I also have to cook for people with autism and a lot of texture icks. I’ve taken cooking courses in Thailand. For me, veggie based meals that are healthy and have enough protein are often more effort and time than a plate of chicken nuggets and roasted veggies and similar ilk.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41754228" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41754228" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">genewitch</span><span>|</span><a href="#41753588">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41753787">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41754038">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41755157">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41754228">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41754228">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">oh, so you are &quot;one of those&quot;. your two comments here lead me to believe i&#x27;d react the same way to you if you said you were preparing a salad for dinner.

This is a straw man argument from you.<p>What I said was that America eats far, far too much meat, and that is objectively true based on certain indicators such as the effect of the scale of our industrial farming on the climate or animal welfare.

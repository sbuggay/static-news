I do have experience with entering a market with settled incumbents, and I do have experience in large organisations.<p>Firstly, Open Source is not a factor here. The number of customers who care about our code is zero. Not even rounding to zero, just zero. Paying someone to look at, understand, Make, test, change etc dwarfs what they pay us. They are in the &quot;health&quot; business not the software business.<p>Our business model -does- matter though. We often get evaluated &quot;as a supplier&quot;. The obvious things like how long we&#x27;ve been around, staffing levels, track record etc. Also non-obvious things like profitability, income model, some even ask to see the books (we draw th line before that.)<p>It turns out they&#x27;re not buying software. They&#x27;re buying a relationship. They want to know we&#x27;ll be around in 5 years, 10 years, 15 years. That&#x27;s -much- more important than the cost.<p>(As an aside, having the primary message on your front page literally soliciting donations is a bad look. Funding via donations overall is not a good look.)<p>Lastly the software is not used by the guy who makes the purchasing decision. The buyer doesn&#x27;t care about the UI or workflow (much). As long as the price is &quot;ok&quot; (and he has a large budget to spend) that doesn&#x27;t matter either. He cares about the warm and fuzzies the salesman gives him. He cares about the success of the project overall. He cares about his job rolling out this big project. Decisions like this are career making, or career breaking.<p>Oh, and the desire to -change- systems is zero. Sure there&#x27;s lots of whining, that&#x27;s easy to ignore. Changing is high risk (and will bring in the same amount of whining).</div><br/><div id="40765565" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40765565" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">openrisk</span><span>|</span><a href="#40764110">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40764593">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40764695">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40765565">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40765565">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This rings more than true, but it reflects market conditions that are not set in stone (otherwise we&#x27;d have lots of hundred-year old incumbents, but the evidence is that companies live shorter and shorter lives).<p>The cost dimension is (ultimately) what indicates whether a domain is ripe for disruption. No matter how cozy an arrangement it will eventually implode if it extracts unjustified rents while alternatives are readily available. Ofcourse cartels can remain untouched longer than you can remain solvent. There is a timing element and luck involved.<p>Open source can be an important lever in this direction because it is not just &quot;free&quot;, it is also more transparent. Ceteris paribus the cost of assurance should be lower. When resistance to chance is primarily due to risk aversion this could be an other element to weigh in.

If anything PHP is quick to develop in and very fast.  It takes me about 5 times longer to develop a web app in Java versus PHP, mainly because of lines of code, and pre-compilation wait-time to execute.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;w3techs.com&#x2F;technologies&#x2F;details&#x2F;pl-php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;w3techs.com&#x2F;technologies&#x2F;details&#x2F;pl-php</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40764386" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40764386" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ranger_danger</span><span>|</span><a href="#40764119">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40764818">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40764232">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40764386">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40764386">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; PHP is downright dangerous.<p>No... you can write secure code in PHP perfectly well.

The actual tech isn&#x27;t all that difficult, you just need a very large and flexible database with a functional front-end, detailed process automation and business rules, hardened security, and high reliability. All very well-worn and established elements that can be found pretty readily even in the open source software space. It&#x27;s the aforementioned integrations, as well as the overall implementation, that will be <i>seriously difficult</i>, especially with all of the unique requirements, extensive compliance, and regulatory pressures that make the kind of software development oversights that might be embarrassing in less complex projects potentially criminal here, or at the very least very damaging and expensive for the developers, their customers, and possibly even their customers&#x27; patients.<p>So the development of any given ePHI system is very high-risk, exceedingly tedious, difficult and time-consuming (aka, expensive), and from my own experience as an I.T. consultant, the potential customer base is going to be full of healthcare orgs who are likely already entrenched within an existing solution, one that has likely been integrated with several other operational services, and one that the lead will almost certainly be <i>very</i> reticent to switch from, considering the huge workload, expense, and disruption to routines that such a migration necessarily involves. That means it could take a <i>very</i> long time to pull in new customers, so you&#x27;ll need deep cash reserves to maintain development and operational budgets while the initial sales, onboarding, and subsequent support takes place.<p>I have gone through such a migration process for a very small healthcare provider, and even in a small clinic with a single doctor, it was extremely involved. I am a fierce proponent of open source software and a DIY ethos, but at least in this specific genre of software, I think the larger established players are ultimately the only ones adequately prepared to pull it off properly.</div><br/><div id="40764475" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40764475" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shigawire</span><span>|</span><a href="#40764232">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40764444">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40764673">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40764475">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40764475">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I always think of it as the most complicated CRUD app of all time.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40764673" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40764673" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">FireBeyond</span><span>|</span><a href="#40764232">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40765001">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40764673">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40764673">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I want to love this, as someone who has dealt with multiple EMRs as an engineer, and as a provider...<p>but no EMR is going to gain traction with documentation that has five bullet points for its backup discussion.<p>Even the linked &quot;back up using our tools&quot; is just &quot;tar things up and run mysqldump&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s no discussion of how to handle and maintain this on a system that may be available 24&#x2F;7.

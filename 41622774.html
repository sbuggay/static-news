Corporations respond to incentives and disincentives, that&#x27;s it. If we want to change the way a corporation behaves we need to arrange things so that its incentives align with our own.<p>People like to ascribe malice to Apple&#x27;s history of making difficult-to-repair devices. I think that&#x27;s wrong-headed. It&#x27;s more appropriate to say that Apple had higher priorities such as miniaturization, performance, battery life, and ease of manufacture.<p>Now that the right to repair movement has been gaining steam and regulations are being drafted, Apple has been given the incentive to prioritize repairability. Thus they are responding to that incentive with the iPhone 16 (with its new battery adhesive), the repair kits, and the documentation they&#x27;ve provided. They likely also see the opportunity to get ahead of their competitors and tout repairability as a competitive advantage. I would not be surprised at all to see future models have even higher repairability scores with Apple aiming to become the market leader.<p>As for the serial numbering and activation of replacement parts: that also has a simple explanation that doesn&#x27;t involve a nefarious lock-in plot. Witness the recent attacks in Lebanon. How were they carried out? By a supply-chain attack! This sort of capability represents more than a physical danger from explosives or chemical weapons, it&#x27;s also a major cyber security and privacy threat. Supply-chain attacks via counterfeit, backdoored parts is a huge area of concern for Apple. The potential is there for the company to suffer severe reputational damage should a large-scale attack occur.</div><br/><div id="41623913" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41623913" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sgu999</span><span>|</span><a href="#41623688">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41623833">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41623868">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41623913">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41623913">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I really don&#x27;t see why we should refrain from judging a corporation on its values.

Due to locking, you can&#x27;t really sell a stolen iPhone. Instead, thieves break it apart and sell the parts. Serial coding disincentives this. I know many people that had their iPhone stolen and it is an awful experience.<p>I&#x27;m a simple man, I&#x27;d never have the ability to solder and fix my own phone. Instead of repairing it myself, I&#x27;d always go to an official repair shop. I&#x27;m not benefitting from non-coded parts. On the other hand, reducing the likelihood of people stealing my phone is a huge upside for me. So for me, and people like me, these measures that Apple takes are a net benefit. I understand that for tinkerers it is a different equation - but you have to agree that for the majority of iPhone owners the equation might also tip in favour of not having to worry about stolen phones instead of being able to fix their own hardware (which most normal people also would never do).</div><br/><div id="41623843" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41623843" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jocaal</span><span>|</span><a href="#41623259">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41623624">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41623745">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41623843">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41623843">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This would be a valid response if first party parts were easily available to be bought directly from manufacturers.</div><br/><div id="41623854" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41623854" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">argsnd</span><span>|</span><a href="#41623259">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41623843">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41623745">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41623854">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41623854">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They are, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;selfservicerepair.com&#x2F;home" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;selfservicerepair.com&#x2F;home</a></div><br/><div id="41623927" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41623927" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jocaal</span><span>|</span><a href="#41623259">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41623854">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41623745">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41623927">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41623927">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qV4_mLw2BGM&amp;t=270" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qV4_mLw2BGM&amp;t=270</a><p>TLDW

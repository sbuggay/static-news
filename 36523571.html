My point being: There definitely IS a room for &quot;rockstars&quot; (don&#x27;t like that term, but interpret this as developers competent enough to carry a lot of weight on their own and work in a smaller company) to deliver a lot of value.<p>The problem with the model is the lack of predictability (what if the few developers you trust don&#x27;t deliver), the bus factor if one of the few devs quits, etc<p>In a sense inefficiency is a goal, because otherwise you loose redundancy.

You can have 200 developers on a massive project, but the planners need to be able to silo the pieces off properly and define interfaces very well early on, which requires a massive planning phase. That usually doesn&#x27;t happen the way people want it to either.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Mythical_Man-Month" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Mythical_Man-Month</a><p>Currently on my team, we have one guy responsible for the schema, back end webapis and automation. Another guy does exclusively UI, those are the two main people. We have another guy responsible for auth and misc stuff and the third guy is a full stack that came in after major development was complete who can add features pretty quickly. We have a completely separate team that handles billing operations&#x2F;applications of 2 people. Our team members communicate directly with business for requirements and understanding their needs, so nothing gets convoluted passing information down through middle channels.<p>It&#x27;s not the only way to do it, but it works pretty well for us. We write all the programming required for operations of a pretty complex medical company. This was a complete Greenfield project and we have about 10 major and minor applications so far. We also have to adapt to incoming partner companies who have their own special needs and changing regulations, so the system and team is very flexible.

I would put it like this: building information machines out of pure information is a creative endeavor.  Human performance tends to fall on a bell curve, and IMO it&#x27;s true for developer output in particular.  So if you want to create a hugely valuable solution to a big problem, you should probably hire the best people you can find and organize them in a way that lets them max out their creative power.<p>The main obstacle to this IMO is poor leadership attitudes &amp; practices.  This article&#x27;s author said it best in another post:<p><pre><code>  &quot;Boring&quot; is a good strategy if you think the bigger existential risk for your company is that Product &amp; Engineering will [...] fail to ship a reliable product on a reliable schedule. But if you&#x27;re more afraid of the business risks of shipping average product, at an average cadence, over the course of years, you should consider deviating, at least sometimes, from the playbook whose entire definition is &quot;optimized for safety.&quot;

It was, at the dawn of computing, the realm of typists and mathematically inclined women, then slowly through the 70s and 80s, increasingly nerdy men, including the &quot;rockstar&quot; neckbearded ingenious tricksters finding incredibly convoluted ways to save 500 bytes. Besides being &quot;wizards&quot; of a world most people could never understand, you had to actually bend your brain to find solutions to hard problems, because technology was so limited.<p>Now there are no hard problems. Just throw more hardware at it. Just write another CRUD app. Just wrap it in JavaScript. It is commodified because it&#x27;s now a commodity. Software is ubiquitous and easy. There is no need to be creative, any more than for filing your taxes.<p>The people who like to program are, almost universally, nerds who get off on logic, solving problems, building things. But there aren&#x27;t really new problems to solve. So they try to re-solve the same problems, over and over, without improving on what came before. Never satisfied. Software will always be the realm of these people that are obsessed with reinventing their toys in a sandbox. So the products will always be kind of toy-like.<p>That&#x27;s why hardware gets better while software stays about the same. Hardware people can&#x27;t just play with toys. If the hardware doesn&#x27;t get better, nobody will buy new hardware, and they&#x27;ll be out of a job. But people will buy <i>different</i> software and call that &quot;better&quot;.

And some minor ones<p>Application development technology has considerably improved over time - most applications simply do not need to reinvent the wheel! Yes, over-engineering by designing something that will never see more than 1qps to scale infinitely is bad - I’m sure it happens but I think it’s more a strawman. If you need a simple CRUD application with a good-enough UI you have no need to introduce additional complexity (and potentially maintenance, reliability issues) with custom tooling.<p>Two, the software talent market is bifurcated. There is basically commodity development of crud apps, and technically complex novel development. If you think there are no rockstars you might just be in the commodity development scene. There literally are these so-called “rockstars” being flown into SF to work on new stuff in the ML sphere or into NYC&#x2F;Chicago to work on bleeding edge performance. Maybe the dissonance here is that the commodity developer market has grown a lot, and that over time some technology (like web applications - a lot harder to do at scale in 2005 vs now) shifts from rockstar to commodity as it matures.<p>Reverting to pets-not-cattle and statefulness can be appropriate at low scale. But honestly this is more of a “choose the right solution to the problem” thing and not a rockstar thing. Following this model as you reach large scale allows for cool production heroism and cowboy coding that makes you feel like a true hacker, but that doesn’t mean your users are getting a more reliable experience, or that your dev time is being spent efficiently.<p>My minor quip is that, I think as you get more experienced what you used to think of as rockstar development just looks routine because you’re better at writing software.<p>Another minor point: you can’t just engender a rockstar culture at a company that hires commodity developers as easily as asserted here. The big thing not mentioned: PAY. Nobody wants to get paid like a commodity developer to have to perform like a rockstar. Being a commodity developer is more chill and there is less day to day risk and stress. Once you start getting towards the bleeding edge or reinventing the wheel your work becomes riskier and requires more mental effort and attention.</div><br/><div id="36526368" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36526368" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">josephg</span><span>|</span><a href="#36526001">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36526131">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36526368">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36526368">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Two, the software talent market is bifurcated. There is basically commodity development of crud apps, and technically complex novel development.<p>I’ve been making this point for years. I think it’s telling that other nearby disciplines are bifurcated. Electrical engineers vs electricians. Architects vs builders. Etc. The virtues of a good electrician are that they’re reliable, have good customer service and they work efficiently. A good building company can bring a building up in time and in budget. But beautiful architecture work doesn’t share those values. The best architecture is bold and creative, and still has people talking years later.<p>I think this split already exists in programming. We just don’t admit it to ourselves. It’s different work inventing React vs using it to make a website. Inventing react, or rust, or redis requires considered boldness. It takes time to nurture the right insights to make it <i>right</i>. In contrast, the virtues of a good web consultancy team look more like the virtues of an electrician: Good customer service. Clear estimations. Work delivered on time &amp; on budget.<p>But we’re so enamoured with the idea of ourselves as “elite hackers” that clock in &#x2F; clock out programmers can’t give up the mantle. I get it. But it’s stupid. There’s no point evaluating candidates on their ability to reimplement a btree from scratch if their job is to style buttons. You’re evaluating people for a different job. Test their software estimation skills. Their social skills. Ask about workflow and productivity.<p>Essays like this one ask “where did all the hackers go?”. They’re still around, they’re just harder to find now. They went into weird crypto projects. Llama.cpp. Obsessive database projects like scylladb. They’re inventing rust, and finding security vulnerabilities in io_uring for that sweet Google bug bounty money. They’re in the demoscene or making programmatic art for burning man.<p>Do you need real hackers at your company? It depends. Are you making an apartment building (on time, on budget) or the Sydney Opera House - which is iconic now, but was almost never finished because of delays and creative disagreements?

If you don’t need to deviate from the playbook to get things done, why should you? And not every developer wants to deviate from the playbook either, some prefer stable predictable work - while I’m not personally in that camp I think it’s not a moral failing, doing unpredictable things is more stressful as more things can go wrong, you might have to work more or suffer the consequences of delays&#x2F;starting over, etc.<p>If you’re a bank, or a web consultancy, you <i>want</i> boring and predictable solutions.

That&#x27;s why the examples I used (deployment pipelines that costs tons of money and entire teams of developers to build and run) tended to be expensive. Many in the industry called these things &quot;solved,&quot; but mostly ran giant bills.

I work for what is now a Big Tech company, but I started before the IPO.<p>We built a lot of in-house infra. We had few runbooks. We ran tons of high-scale services with a pretty low corresponding headcount. And we had a great culture, that was definitely more personality based than the rest of Big Tech. Individuals had Opinions (TM). On-call was about having a durable understanding of the system and sleuthing around to figure out what was happening (along with a strong emphasis on <i>learning</i> from failures and putting systems&#x2F;practices into place to fix those.) And we, as engineers, were weird. My tech lead rolled into work at 11 AM every morning on their skateboard. I used to take a 2 hour daily break from 2-4 PM, go home at 6, and work again between 8-10 PM (ish, this was flexible) before I went to bed and was known to enjoy coffee with fried chicken. Our infrastructure and our services reflected our personality quirks and the interpersonal relationships we had in the office. On-call was one of my favorite things at the company because all the different personalities would weigh in with their different quirks and would offer different perspectives on big problems, and together we&#x27;d solve tough issues.<p>Somewhere along the ZIRP-age this all changed. We needed to become a Real Company (TM) now. We needed to have runbooks. We needed to have Boring Technology. We were poised for huge growth after all (aka our stock value shot through the roof.) The new managers we brought in needed to build out new teams to grow fast, fast, fast. How can we grow when we had such immature processes? We started building runbooks and hiring teams to manage them. Incidents started requiring 3-pages minimum of paperwork to document, which was enforced by an incident management team. Teams dreaded these incidents and where once we collaborated to fix problems, now teams became defensive and combative during incidents. Now we needed the incident management team to force engineers to cooperate during incidents because each team was trying to be as defensive as possible. Managers stopped thinking in terms of individuals with strengths and weaknesses and started thinking about headcount, both cost and allocation. Headcount became everything. With this change, attrition also spiked.<p>What used to take 1-2 engineers to spin up over a week or two now took months. We load tested our new services, but now we needed to make load tests repeatable and runnable in a runbook. Teams became extra defensive about features because the cost of every incident became so high. Nobody wanted to be the team that missed an integration test which came up as a cause of an incident. Our net reliability didn&#x27;t actually change though the thinking was that repeatability would allow more seamless swapping of headcount. Program managers managed migrations and we started creating status meeting meetings which rolled up statuses of multiple ongoing initiatives cascading over multiple teams.<p>My own experience at the company went from having fun writing code and interacting with quirky folks at work to dealing with engineers who were dotting their is and crossing their ts in every aspect of their job. The managers treated us as headcount and so headcount we became. It&#x27;s been a highly depressing arc to a job I loved and where I built a lot of high-scale code at, but perhaps the most frustrating has been watching our velocity decrease despite our headcount ballooning due to the overhead of programs, migrations, and incident management that developed their own bureaucracies. The saddest part is that the oldest parts of the company have become so essential and the bureaucracy so thick around them that replacing them has become really challenging. The parts of the company that were developed with the least care are the hardest to replace.</div><br/><div id="36529307" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36529307" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dlisboa</span><span>|</span><a href="#36524556">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36527487">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36526347">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36529307">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36529307">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great comment, I think a lot of us can find something in it that we relate to, even if not the whole story.<p>&gt; Nobody wanted to be the team that missed an integration test which came up as a cause of an incident. Our net reliability didn&#x27;t actually change though<p>This caught my eye because I’ve seen similar phenomena as well. No matter how well meaning those processes are very rarely do apps get significantly more reliable. It still seems entirely down to how complex the software is, it’s very hard to integration test your way to multiple 9s if it isn’t simple (some companies do it, but at bigger cost and slower velocity).<p>As for some other points…<p>I’ve come to believe change in culture is really something inevitable after a certain number though. And that number for an engineering team is not even hundreds, but may be only dozens. You operate less as a team and more like an army, with all the personnel issues that come with it.<p>What interests me lately is the idea that, for many companies, 80% of the value&#x2F;growth seems to be delivered when the company is relatively small at X headcount. Then increasing the headcount to 5X does not deliver much more than incremental changes built on top of the core product.<p>Now if you have that many employees you need to find things for them to do, like managing themselves, creating processes or going off on new market bets, and you risk losing focus.<p>But at the same time a company with 5X headcount seems more attractive to investors than one with X. The measure of success being only an IPO means there isn’t much pride in being well-run, small and focused, admitting that you’ll never be the top player in the market. That precipitates changes in developer culture.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36526347" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36526347" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bob1029</span><span>|</span><a href="#36524556">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36525414">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36524794">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36526347">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36526347">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I believe the new &quot;rockstar&quot; developer is one who can completely subvert their own ego in order to better serve the business&#x2F;customer&#x2F;team.<p>The age of toiling away with weird tech in a dark corner and then expecting the team to be amazed at your contraptions is 2000% over.

So people cost hasn&#x27;t always gone down as infra cost has gone up. &quot;Shitty internal heroku&quot; has some advantages once you have engineers that have been at the company more than 3 months: there&#x27;s just not nearly as much surface area to understand + you have the source code right there if you really have to get int here. Let&#x27;s leave judgements out of this - you can just as easily build a fragile tower of cloud services and abstractions to &quot;feel smart&quot; as you can reinventing serving an application (reinventing is a strong word anyway... it&#x27;s just a <i>different</i> set of off the shelf tools usually). And in many cases &quot;managed&quot; services manage the easy part (standing up the hardware and installing the service) and don&#x27;t manage the hard part (configuring the hundreds of knobs to optimize your particular use case) particularly well.<p>I&#x27;m not close enough to the metal for those services&#x2F;infra teams, though, to be able to completely tell if the FTE hours spent on all that cloud stuff are <i>necessary</i>. That is - can you throw stuff into the cloud and set-it-and-forget-it and not deal with ongoing cloud&#x2F;infra&#x2F;config maintenance? But one of the main things those teams seemed to often focus on was spend - if you leave it unattended is the cost just going to eat you up?

Same pain you’d feel in a colo, except you cloud provider may force an upgrade you’d otherwise wish to put off.

But a tightly focused startup with 50 developers from the former category can absolutely dominate the market, at least until they get acquired, as we&#x27;ve seen so many times before: e.g. WhatsApp, Instagram, OpenAI.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36525929" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36525929" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rockstar-guy-23</span><span>|</span><a href="#36524556">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36524803">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36527030">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36525868">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36525929">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36525929">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Appreciate the candor.

So the only guiding light left is our values -- and what we personally believe.<p>I do not have notions of excellence, pride, discipline, respect, mastery, craft, grit, or anything of higher substance inside of me. At one point in my life, I&#x27;m sure I did, but they have been beaten out of me.

If one wishes to keep one&#x27;s values strong, why make them dependent on uncontrollable things? Unless you are independently wealthy (if that is the case, I can offer nothing), there will be times you will be required to make sacrifice of your values to &quot;get the job done.&quot; You will have to be sloppy, amateur, lazy, selfish, and maybe even villainous to do what needs to be done. At that point, you can hold strong and suffer the consequences, or you can relent, tell yourself you are temporarily setting aside higher ideals (it never is temporary), get the job done... and suffer the consequences.<p>Tying your soul, your essence to such a thing is precarious. Putting your heart into things that will require you to abdicate your integrity is foolish. You will end up hurt, broken, and missing pieces of yourself. It is better, and more sustainable, to save that sort of thing to matters that aren&#x27;t directly related to your survival. Otherwise, to charge steadfastly into what one knows will be suffering is noble, but foolish.</div><br/><div id="36527310" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36527310" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">apsurd</span><span>|</span><a href="#36524556">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36526615">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36527155">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36527310">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36527310">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a really helpful reply.

Maybe modern developers think of &quot;Cloud everything&quot; as the boring&#x2F;playbook approach, while other people (like me) see the older (in my mind simpler) idea of administering a few machines, maybe even on bare metal, to be Boring.<p>You wrote:<p>&gt; So, do you leverage those solutions to help you solve your problem? Or do you let your engineers re-invent the wheel so they can feel smart?<p>In my charitable interpretation of TFA, I think they are saying to let your engineers use smaller-scale solutions&#x2F;technologies that address the problem at hand, as needed, rather than getting pulled into the Cloud-everything solve-all-your-future-problems-you-don&#x27;t-even-have-yet ball of wax that&#x27;s often advocated these days.<p>I can get behind that sentiment, but yeah I&#x27;m not a big fan of the way it&#x27;s framed in the article, and I have never liked the &quot;rockstar&quot; term.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mcfunley.com&#x2F;choose-boring-technology" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mcfunley.com&#x2F;choose-boring-technology</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36526910" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36526910" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">feoren</span><span>|</span><a href="#36524556">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36525092">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36525135">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36526910">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36526910">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think you&#x27;re suffering from a lack of imagination.<p>&gt; 99% of use-cases for businesses are for the most part &quot;solved.&quot;<p>History is over, technology is done advancing, every business idea has already been had and executed well, everything that can be done has already been done. Sure. And you would have said the exact same thing last year, and 10 years ago, and 50 years ago, and 400 years ago, and you would have been monumentally wrong each time. But June 29, 2023 is different. This is the first day of the end of history.<p>By the way, the quotes around your word &quot;solved&quot; stand for many things, including paying through the nose for ineffective B.S. jobs that only exist due to inertia.<p>&gt; do you let your engineers re-invent the wheel so they can feel smart?<p>The Curiosity Rover&#x27;s wheels, which were re-invented for that purpose, are getting holes in them because the kind of rocks they expected to find are slightly different. Perseverance had its wheels re-invented again to fix this. Someone should have told those so-called <i>rocket scientists</i> at NASA that they&#x27;re only trying to make themselves feel smart! If we never re-invented the wheel, we&#x27;d all be driving around on carved stone. &quot;But you&#x27;re not NASA, loser!&quot; you say. Why not? Why aren&#x27;t you doing something new too?<p>&gt; the talent alone is the difference between millions of dollars<p>This is still true. One single talented coder can be the difference between a multi-million dollar business succeeding or failing. I have no idea why you think this is not true anymore; my guess is that you&#x27;re completely unable to recognize these people when you&#x27;re around them. Don&#x27;t worry, most people can&#x27;t recognize them.<p>In before: &quot;wow, you really think you&#x27;re an underappreciated rockstar, huh?&quot; -- potentially. Of course I can&#x27;t prove it over the internet. But rockstars are as much of the product of the environment you put them in as they are their own brains. Maybe rockstars actually are more common than you realize -- maybe <i>you&#x27;re</i> the reason they&#x27;re not rocking out.<p>&gt; If you have a really talented coder who can be interchanged with another really talented coder, you do not have a &quot;rockstar.&quot;<p>Or maybe the shackles and chains you&#x27;re putting around these talented coders are forcing them into the same sub-optimal modes where they can&#x27;t shine. I suspect if you really fostered an environment where software engineers could grow, learn, and shine -- where you fucking TRUST them, in other words -- you&#x27;d find they&#x27;re not so replaceable as you think.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t need to work with any more software engineers who think it&#x27;s okay to be a massive dick to everyone<p>It&#x27;s never okay to be a massive dick to everyone. In my experience, dickishness is negatively correlated with skill and talent, not positively.

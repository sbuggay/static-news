Prod deploys were just docker commands run by jenkins. We ran two servers per service from the day I joined the day I left 4 years later (3x growth), and ultimately removed one service and one database during all that growth.<p>Another outstanding thing about both of these places was that we had all the testing environments you need, on-demand, in minutes.<p>The place I&#x27;m at now is trying to do kubernetes and is failing miserably (ongoing nightmare 4 months in and probably at least 8 to go, when it was allegedly supposed to only take 3 total).

If the ops team is solely responsibly for running the Kubernetes cluster, then yes. In reality that&#x27;s rarely how things turns out. Developers want Kubernetes, because.... I don&#x27;t know. Ops doesn&#x27;t even want Kubernetes in many cases. Kubernetes is amazing, for those few organisations that really need it.<p>My rule of thumb is: If your worker nodes aren&#x27;t entire physical hosts, then you might not need Kubernetes. I&#x27;ve seen some absolutely crazy setups where developers had designed this entire solution around Kubernetes, only to run one or two containers. The reasoning is pretty much always the same, they know absolutely nothing about operations, and fail to understand that load balancers exists outside of Kubernetes, or that their solution could be an nginx configuration, 100 lines of Python and some systemd configuration.<p>I accept that I lost the fight that Kubernetes is overly complex and a nightmare to debug. In my current position I can even see some advantages to Kubernetes, so I was at least a little of in my criticism.

You generally want to be using a product that is subject to competition, that is a profit center rather than a cost center for the people who are making it.<p>&gt; Internal DNS in particular is easy enough to control and test if you have engineers (vs implementers) in your team.<p>Your team probably aren&#x27;t DNS experts, and why should they be? You&#x27;re not a DNS company. If you could make a better DNS - or a better DNS-deployment integration - than the pros, you&#x27;d be selling it. (The exception is if you really are a DNS company, either because you actually do sell it, or because you have some deep integration with DNS that enables your competitive advantage)<p>&gt; Perhaps it comes from personal experience, in which case Iâm sorry you had to be part of such a team.

But I absolutely do think you need a declarative, single-source-of-truth way of managing your full deployment, end-to-end. And if your deployment is made up of a standard load balancer (or an equivalent of one), a standard DNS, and prometheus or grafana, then you&#x27;ve either got one of these products or you&#x27;ve got an internal product that does the same thing, which is something I&#x27;m extremely skeptical of for the same reason as above - if your company was capable of creating a better solution to this standard problem, why wouldn&#x27;t you be selling it? (And if an engineer was capable of creating a better solution to this standard problem, why would they work for you rather than one of the big cloud corps?)<p>In the same way I&#x27;m very skeptical of any company with an &quot;internal cloud&quot; - in my experience such a thing is usually a significantly worse implementation of AWS, and, yes, is usually held together with some flaky Perl scripts. Or an internal load balancer. It&#x27;s generally NIH, or at best a cost-cutting exercise which tends to show; a company might have an internal cloud that&#x27;s cheaper than AWS (I&#x27;ve worked for one), but you&#x27;ll notice the cheapness.<p>Now again, if you really are gaining a competitive advantage from your things then it may make sense to not use a standard solution. But in that case you&#x27;ll have something deeply integrated, i.e. monolithic, and that&#x27;s precisely the case where you&#x27;re not deploying separate standard DNS, separate standard load balancers, separate standard monitoring etc.. And in that case, as grandparent said, not using k8s makes total sense.<p>But if you&#x27;re just deploying a standard Rails (or what have you) app with a standard database, load balancer, DNS, monitoring setup?

With cloud providers considering VMs durable these days (they get new hardware for your VM if the hardware it&#x27;s on dies, without dropping any TCP connections), I think a 1 node approach is enough for small things.  You can get like 192 vCPUs per node.  This is enough for a lot of small companies.<p>I occasionally try non-k8s approaches to see what I&#x27;m missing.  I have a small ARM machine that runs Home Assistant and some other stuff.  My first instinct was to run k8s (probably kind honestly), but didn&#x27;t really want to write a bunch of manifests and let myself scope creep to running ArgoCD.  I decided on `podman generate systemd` instead (with nightly re-pulls of the &quot;latest&quot; tag; I live and die by the bleeding edge).  This was OK, until I added zwavejs, and now the versions sometimes get out of sync, which I notice by a certain light switch not working anymore.  What I should have done instead was have some sort of git repository where I have the versions of these two things, and to update them atomically both at the exact same time.  Oh wow, I really <i>did</i> need ArgoCD and Kubernetes ;)<p>I get by with podman by angrily ssh-ing in in my winter jacket when I&#x27;m trying to leave my house but can&#x27;t turn the lights off.

 - yeah pushing to prod is &quot;easy&quot;: FTP directly. But now which version of which files are really in prod? No idea. Yeah when I say old school it&#x27;s old school before things like Jenkins.
 - need something done around the servers? That&#x27;s the OPS team job. Team which also has too much different work to do so now you&#x27;ll have to wait a week or two for this simple &quot;add an upload file&quot; endpoint to this old API because you need somewhere to put those files.<p>Now we&#x27;ve started setting up some on-prem k8s nodes for the new developments. Not because we need crazy scaling but so the dev team can do most OPS they need. It takes time to have everything setup but once it started chugging along it felt good to be able to just declare whatever we need and get it.
You still need to get the devs to learn k8s which is not fun but that&#x27;s the life of a dev: learning new things every day.<p>Also k8s does not do data.

For any product at scale, youâre likely to be using things like Istio and Metricbeat. You have a whole level of complexity in adding auth to your cluster on top of your existing SSO for the cloud provider. Weâve had to spend quite some time changing the plugin for AKS&#x2F;EntraID recently which has also meant a change in workflow for users. Upgrading clusters can break things since plenty of stuff (less these days) lives in beta namespaces, and thereâs no LTS.<p>Again, itâs less bad than it was, but many core things live(d) in plugins for clusters which have a risk of breaking when you upgrade cluster.<p>My view was that the initial startup cost for ECS is lower and once itâs done, thatâs kind of it - itâs stable and doesnât change. With K8s itâs much more a moving target, and it requires someone to actively be maintaining it, which takes time.<p>In a small team I donât think that cost and complexity is worth it - there are so many more concepts that you have to learn even on top of the cloud specific ones.

While Docker-Compose only supports a basic subset, Kubernetes offers:<p>* Advanced orchestration features, such as rolling updates, health checks, scaling, and self-healing.<p>* Automatic maintenance of the desired state for running workloads.<p>* Restarting failed containers, rescheduling pods, and replacing unhealthy nodes.<p>* Horizontal pod auto-scaling based on metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, or custom metrics).<p>* Continuous monitoring and reconciliation of the actual state with the desired state.<p>* Immediate application of changes to bring resources to the desired configuration.<p>* Service discovery via DNS and automatic load balancing across pods.<p>* Native support for Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) for storage management.<p>* Abstraction of storage providers, supporting local, cloud, and network storage.<p>If you need these features but are concerned about the complexity of Kubernetes, consider using a managed Kubernetes service like GKE or EKS to simplify deployment and management. Alternatively, and this is my prefered option, combining Terraform with a Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform allows the provider to handle most of the operational complexity for you.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42228392" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42228392" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">klooney</span><span>|</span><a href="#42228020">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42228093">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42229081">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42228137">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42228392">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42228392">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ansible ultimately runs scripts, in parallel, in a defined order across machines.

It would be a lot more sensible to write custom orchestration using the docker API - that was straightforward.<p>Experimenting with k8s was very much worthwhile. It&#x27;s an amazing thing and was in many ways inspirational. But using it would have been swimming against the tide so to speak. So sure I built a mini-k8s-lite, it&#x27;s better for us, it fits better than wrapping docker compose.<p>My only doubt is whether I should have used podman instead but at the time podman seemed to be in an odd place (3-4 years ago now).

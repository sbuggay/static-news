This is a fine first attempt but I feel it&#x27;s missing something very important, mainly the win&#x2F;draw&#x2F;loss percentages. Chess engines previously used centipawn as a way of comparing moves and positions within the search space, but now many if not most of the top engines are also incorporating the win&#x2F;draw&#x2F;loss percentage estimations that come from neural networks.<p>To that end, Julian at the Chess Engine Lab has developed a style of narrative and analysis that I feel like really uses the WDL percentages well.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;substack.com&#x2F;@chessenginelab" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;substack.com&#x2F;@chessenginelab</a><p>His series on the 2024 World Chess Championship is great and I haven&#x27;t seen anything else come close in terms of using a chess engine to craft an accessible analysis of the matches. Take one look at the WDL percentages from Game 14 and it becomes extremely clear what&#x27;s about to happen and how the game evolved:

It misses context, and the categories chosen are too arbitrary to carry much insight.<p>If you gradually misplay a position, but then your opponent makes one suboptimal move, your opponent has an inaccuracy while you don&#x27;t. Low ACPL can indicate that players played well but also that they chose very safe, boring positions&#x2F;opennings.<p>Further, engine evaluations can be misleading or useless in human chess. A position might be objectively winning&#x2F;defensible, but only if you find a sequence of inhuman engine moves that are practically hard to find. Simply grouping together &quot;evaluation &gt; 1&quot; as winning advantage to get a &quot;conversion rate&quot; is pretty uninformative.<p>The final blunder did not occur out of nowhere. Ding missed a much safer way to draw the game and went into a position that Nakamura judged as 50&#x2F;50 between a draw and a Gukesh win [1].<p>I think it is much more informative to actually watch top players comment on the games and match overall. Keep in mind that Carlsen and Nakamura, who comment on the game in [1], are actually stronger players by ELO than the two finalists of the world championship [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uXc7Bc3zd0M" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uXc7Bc3zd0M</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;2700chess.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;2700chess.com&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="42449380" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42449380" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">maximamel</span><span>|</span><a href="#42449335">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42449364">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42449380">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42449380">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for sharing your opinion.

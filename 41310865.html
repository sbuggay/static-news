Is that a correct way to think about it?<p>For example, I&#x27;ve studied probability and statistics somewhat formally in undergrad. The idea that electrons taken on a distribution and are technically &quot;nowhere&quot; until they are observed (schrodingers cat) sounds just like the description of a continuous variable, or alternatively where you take limit on a discrete variable such that it approaches a continuous distribution. The probability of the variable being any value is technically 0 but its state can be observed.

They form when enough mass-energy occupies a small region of space. And neither quantity is infinity. Due to how energy is related to wavelength, and that we need smaller wavelengths to probe smaller, and because everything has wavelength, we get that smaller scales require more energy (this is a simplification but correct). At a certain small enough size, again not infinity, we get a black hole due to energy density of that region of space. And any more energy just makes a bigger black hole. So we can’t actually get endlesssly smaller scales. The singularity is also a mathematical one and not something most physicists claim exists physically. I mean as a related example, there’s no way to physically infinitely divide space so infinities of calculus don’t imply infinities of spatial division.<p>QM I’m less sure where you think infinities pop up physically? One interesting thing is you’d need an infinitely size measuring apparatus to have absolutely certain measurement results due to random fluctuations, but as per above we can’t have infinitely size devices except for infinitely sized black holes, which won’t really help us. A lot of this is said more rigorously by Nima Arkani Hamed in his recorded public lectures.</div><br/><div id="41317045" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41317045" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ackbar03</span><span>|</span><a href="#41315899">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41316643">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41317055">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41317045">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41317045">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for that, that&#x27;s super interesting.<p>With quantum mechanics it&#x27;s just infinity in the opposite direction, going infinitely small. My very pedestrian understanding is that the field of quantum mechanics came about because people were having trouble explaining the behavior of atomic particles, particularly electrons, using newtonian mechanics, and quantum mechanics were able to explain everything in a more comprehensive framework. At first I always found the idea that electrons are &#x27;nowhere&#x27; until they are observed very mysterious, but it made a lot more sense when I understood that probability densities are involved in qm equations. There&#x27;s usually a similar source of confusion when we move from &quot;probabilities&quot; of discrete distrubutions, which is quite easy to understand, to probability densities, which can be done by taking limit of number of possible states to infinity, and where you can get &quot;probabilities&quot; larger than one.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41317055" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41317055" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bubblyworld</span><span>|</span><a href="#41315899">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41316643">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41316553">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41317055">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41317055">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think you should be careful about taking analogies too literally in physics - wave functions in basic QM are kinda like probability distributions, for instance, but they are <i>complex valued</i> and change when you sample from them.

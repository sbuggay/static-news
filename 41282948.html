Like much of IoT.<p>Waymo cars do not have, or need, a vehicle to vehicle communication system. They talk to their HQ, but that&#x27;s not part of the main control loops. Most of the problems Waymos have to avoid don&#x27;t communicate much, if at all. Traffic cones, pedestrians, bicyclists, and people in wheelchairs have to be sensed directly. Once you have the sensing to do that, large vehicles should not be a problem. (Yes, Tesla has had trouble sensing fire trucks, semis, etc., but that&#x27;s a Tesla problem)<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be necessary that traffic lights and signs broadcast their status to vehicles.

It takes minutes to develop, and even very low levels of light &#x27;destroy&#x27; night vision.<p>DOT still does regulate all or most those things and many other elements about vehicle lights you probably never thought about (and I&#x27;ll get back to headlights in a couple of paragraphs.)<p>Ever notice that most cars with &quot;animated&quot; turn signals have a portion that lights up immediately, or the entire signal lights up full brightness immediately and then fades, versus fading up or gradually lighting up a larger area? That&#x27;s because of a DOT regulation that says X amount of area &#x2F; brightness has to come on when the signal first lights up. This is why Audi&#x27;s animated tail lights, for example, usually have two areas - one that is animated and &#x27;grows&#x27;...and another that lights up fully. Ditto for Mazda&#x27;s &#x27;pulsing&#x27; turn signals.<p>Ever notice that a lot of &quot;cute utes&quot; and crossovers with hatches have either brake&#x2F;turn signals in the bumper awkwardly very low, sometimes in addition to ones on the hatch? That&#x27;s because DOT regulations require turn, brake, and marker lights be mounted in&#x2F;on a non-moving part of the body. Got a friend with an Audi Q-series? have them step on the brake &#x2F; use a turn signal, then open the hatch and do it again. Bam, those red lights way down in the bumper you never see light up...now light up in place of those on the hatch.<p>DOT has standards around placement of turn signals near other lights (DRLs and headlight beams.) That&#x27;s why on many vehicles the DRLs go out when the turn signal comes on, or in fancier european&#x2F;japanese cars, the DRL and turn signal are the same element and it switches from white to blinking yellow.<p>DOT also used to require that only two sets of lights on the front of the car be turned on at once. This is why some cars deactivate fog lights when the high beams are turned on, and some older cars don&#x27;t turn on the lows and highs at the same time.<p>Fun fact: DOT used to require rear facing fog lights only be on one side. I&#x27;m not sure if the regulation still exists, but back in the mid to late 90&#x27;s, european car manufacturers started ignoring the regulation, installing bulbs in both tail lamps, because they would be inundated with customers complaining to dealers that &quot;one of my tail lights is out.&quot; Thus the whole damn point of a rear fog light - is it one very bright light, driver&#x27;s side - which is different from two or three very bright lights (brake lights!) - was largely erased.<p>But...back to headlights. DOT regulations used to require sealed-beam headlights well past when the rest of the world had moved to &#x27;aero&#x27; headlights with reflectors shaped to better distribute light across the road surface and limit light spillage where it would blind oncoming traffic or be wasted.<p>DOT regulations used to require a crazy amount of light spillage off to the sides <i>because they predated reflective road sign technology.</i> I&#x27;m not joking when I say that DOT headlight regulations up until some time in the 80&#x27;s had not been updated in around forty years. Many EU and Asian cars had to be sold with US-only sealed beam headlights when ROW (Rest Of World) they were sold with aero headlights, because they had to meet inferior, outdated DOT standards. This raised costs for imported vehicles and allowed US manufacturers to save costs by not developing better headlights, and US manufacturers and their unions liked that because it was effectively a tariff on imported cars.<p>Why did the standards eventually get updated? Ford bet the company - billions <i>in late 1970&#x27;s early 1980s money</i> on the Taurus (successfully. It saved the company.) Ford needed aero headlights to meet its aerodynamic drag goals (which were insanely good even by today&#x27;s standards.) So, suddenly Ford wanted aero headlights to be legal. Bam. Aero headlights became legal. And suddenly ever ford was getting aero headlights. They were still garbage compared to what was sold in Europe; many car enthusiasts with 80&#x27;s&#x2F;90&#x27;s era cars illegally imported and installed european headlights because the beam patterns were so much better.<p>Nothing happens to US vehicle regulations unless US auto manufacturers want it. We lag the rest of the world in almost every standard imaginable. We lag on passenger car features (it took until something like the mid 2000&#x27;s for ABS to be required!)<p>For example, in the EU, trucks are required to have:<p>- ABS, stability control, <i>and</i> automatic emergency warning&#x2F;braking systems (and I think side collision warning systems? not sure.)
- Full mirror coverage
- bumper features that keep them from riding up a passenger car they rear-end
- trailer rear end crash bars that keep cars rear ending trailers from going under the trailer and decapitating the occupants
- modern emissions controls
- electronic logbook systems<p>In the US? A 1970&#x27;s peterbuilt that belches black smoke, has sealed beam headlights, flat side mirrors looking back, no ABS much less stability control&#x2F;braking...is A-OK. Similarly, our rear collision safety standards for trailers are very watered down because of trucking industry lobbyists. Saves the trucking industry tens of billions, and costs the rest of society probably hundreds of billions if not trillions between injuries&#x2F;deaths&#x2F;property damage&#x2F;lost productivity and health impacts from essentially unregulated emissions.<p>There are &quot;coach builders&quot; that focus on skirting emissions regulations - completely legally - via regulations that let an old, pre-emissions-control truck engine be installed into a brand new truck body.<p>I could go on and on about how asinine, outdated, and ineffective US motor vehicle safety and equipment regulations are. I could go on even further about how completely ineffective motor vehicle inspections are even in states that require them, because they&#x27;re conducted by a private business with a vested interest in ignoring customers not meeting standards or purposefully violating them.</div><br/><div id="41308056" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41308056" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fingerlocks</span><span>|</span><a href="#41283337">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41306590">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41301652">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41308056">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41308056">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I could go on and on<p>And you should.

Usually they have a higher load rating which requires a C license (equivalent of CDL), but some can be driven on a standard car license (max gross weight 3.5t).<p>If you need construction materials delivered, this can accommodate almost anything. However usually for things like a stack of drywall, you would order a truck with a crane - simply because it&#x27;s quicker to unload. For personal use the answer is simply to get a trailer. Here a lot of gas stations rent trailers by the hour for a reasonable fee, so it&#x27;s very easy.<p>RVs also fit into this category. Most of them are under 3.5t, so you just need a standard car license. Some larger B class variants (which I guess in the US would still be considered small) need a C license. Caravans (travel trailers) are designed to be ok to tow on a standard car license, but in some countries you need extra training. Larger RVs don&#x27;t make much sense here, as you won&#x27;t be able to go anywhere with them.<p>People who have boats either leave them docked, or have boats that fit on a trailer that can be towed by a standard car. Nothing special needed. Same for cars, just put them on a trailer and drive away. Professionals often use car carrier variants of the Mercedes Sprinter et al, which can carry one or two cars, and another towed behind.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41306478" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41306478" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">forgetfreeman</span><span>|</span><a href="#41283337">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41306423">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41306669">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41305922">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41306478">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41306478">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s even more ridiculous than all that.

I am not espousing an idea, simply stating actual fact.  Software is not secure, never has been, never will be, and its use should be considered with the logical concept that &quot;this will be hacked&quot;.<p>Thus if your car needs to communicate with anything for &quot;system updates&quot;, it&#x27;s been designed wrong.  People had cars for decades, with digital control systems and zero networking capability.  It&#x27;s literally not required, at all, to develop, maintain, or have a car that operates perfectly.<p>One of the main problems is that cars literally have too much software onboard.  There is no need for an app store for a car.  No need for networking.  No need for update-to-date info.  None.  You have a smartphone, and that can connect to an entirely isolated screen in the car, if you want maps displayed for your own edification.  Anything networked, eg bluetooth, etc, should be entirely isolated from the rest of the car.<p>In terms of self-driving, updates can be applied manually.  USB sticks aren&#x27;t that uncommon.  Dealers are available.  The amount of times new city streets are created is extremely rare, and you can always close-destination and direct manually beyond that point.  Cars can then remember a location, and draw in a street as if finds it, thus enabling easy return.<p>The truth is it doesn&#x27;t matter how &quot;convenient&quot; something may be, you don&#x27;t just brush security and safety aside to do it.  You don&#x27;t make people&#x27;s lives easier, at the expense of safety, security, and so on.  You just don&#x27;t.<p>And that&#x27;s what every networked car represents.  Brushing aside safety for convenience.<p>I&#x27;ve been waiting for hackers to remote-hack the battery charging module in cars for quite some time.  Depending on the unit&#x27;s configuration, some car models could be hacked to all explode and burst into flames due to overcharging, at specific times.<p>How would society respond, in 1 in 10 houses caught fire at 2am on the same night?<p>* There&#x27;d be fires everywhere, and those fires would spread, as there are not enough fire departments to deal with even 1 in 100 houses catching fire in a night<p>* Massive amounts of infra would be compromised<p>* Massive amounts of transportation capability would be gone<p>Society would be devastated.  It&#x27;d be worse than an air bombing campaign.<p>Yet I&#x27;m willing to bet there is a path from most car&#x27;s networking -&gt; charge controller, along with it being remote flashable with a new firmware too.<p>Madness.  Stupidity.  Insanity.<p>Other discussions are about how people coordinate cars in a group.  This is ripe for trouble, even with just people messing about.  People would game this system to push other cars out of the way, using it to gain pseudo priority.  Teenagers and malign actors would cause all cars in a swarm to emergency brake, but sending emergency brake intentions.  Cars would be manipulated into running into each other, or into guardrails, after being sent &quot;emergency swerve&quot; info from cars in front, or &quot;I&#x27;m beside you but I&#x27;m emergency swerving into your lane!&quot; messages.<p>If anyone looks at the current state of almost all lane-keep tech, it&#x27;s a joke and dangerous.  Forums are repleted with &quot;turn off this functionality&quot; panic messages, as people are having to constantly fight their cars to keep them from doing very dumb things.<p>Real self-driving is at least 20 to 30 years away.  Even those at the forefront (like Waymo) are not self-driving.  Instead, they&#x27;ve super-mapped the areas that Waymo operates in, warm climates with low amounts of rain, no snow, city areas with unchanging landscapes and an immense amount of cues and markers.<p>Take a Waymo to an unmapped location and it&#x27;s useless.  That&#x27;s not self-driving.<p>Take a Waymo to a Northern US rural area in the winter, where there are no road lines to be seen due to slush and snow on the road.  It will fail completely and utterly.  That&#x27;s not self driving.  Any local driver handles that daily without issue.<p>Waymo still has a phalanx of people monitoring all aspects of how its cars are performing, ready to step in at a moment&#x27;s notice.  They get edge-case stuck in dumb places, do weird things (like waking up entire blocks of people due to honking senselessly all night long), they are not self-driving capable.<p>Instead, they are &quot;we mapped all these streets a billion times over, and with human intervention and the absolutely perfect weather in SF and the US South, can get a car to kinds sorta almost self-drive&quot;, but &quot;It&#x27;ll never work in the rest of the world&quot;.<p>By the time true self-driving is a real thing, it&#x27;ll be hand in hand with AI that is capable of handling &quot;I don&#x27;t have that address&quot; and &quot;Show me the closest address&quot; and &quot;where do I go from here&quot;, where you say &quot;Go down two streets and then turn left&quot; works.<p>We do not need networking in our cars.  The internet is a poison.<p>One side note.<p>This is an excellent business opportunity for someone such as SpaceX.  They <i>could</i> create entirely isolated vlan, non-internet traffic for car manufacturers far more isolated than anyone.  Such traffic could be isolated and never have direct connection to the internet, which would reduce the attack surface dramatically.<p>It would still be dangerous.  Just less so than the absolutely absurd and ridiculous scenario where we have cars connect to the most hostile environment known, the internet.<p>To end this blathering and spewing, I&#x27;ll say this.  Would you want brain surgery done by a robot that is receiving instructions over the internet?  Then why do you want tonnes of vehicles flying down the road at 70mph being connected to the internet?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41283097" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41283097" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tocs3</span><span>|</span><a href="#41297972">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41283307">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41283097">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41283097">[19 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I like the modern world and its safety features.

The vehicle notifies the driver or the adaptive cruise control (if enabled) slows down while approaching the crosswalk.<p>3. The post with the crosswalk button on it has a LIDAR sensor that looks down the length of the crosswalk (and presumably another one facing from the opposite direction) and a relatively low power DSP digests the LIDAR input looking for approximately not-car shaped forms on the crosswalk.<p>4.

It was fascinating because the road traffic controls are largely ignored, in favour of communicating via body language with the vast numbers of other scooters around you, pretty much treating the odd car as a stationary obstacle. There&#x27;s also a strong feeling of &quot;we&#x27;re all in this together and we co-operate to keep things moving and get where we need to go&quot;.<p>Crossing the road there is a matter of slowly and clearly walking into oncoming traffic, trusting that they will stop or go around you [0]. It kinda works the same on a scooter - you slowly and clearly do the utterly illegal thing that you want to do, and everyone will stop for you or go around you. Riding the wrong way up one-way streets, or on the wrong side of the road, is common and perfectly safe as long as you take it slow and keep your eyes open.<p>I think this concept of clear communication works better than the conventional system of road traffic controls. IIRC there have been tests done in the UK where removing road traffic controls led to people slowing down and communicating their intentions more, with greater flowthrough and reduced collisions.<p>Automating this will be interesting. Yes it&#x27;ll probably work, and accidents will be reduced. But it moves us further into making the act of driving illegal. If we are all safer when the robots drive, then it&#x27;s reasonable for humans to be disallowed from driving.

Not merely the principles of motor vehicle operation, but the humanities aspect too.<p>For example, psychology, basic physics and sociology would be integral to the  curriculum. It is important to view transportation as closely as possible for what it is. As conscientious driver, I do my best to be courteous and safe, for both selfish and altruistic reasons. I try to apply my understanding of traffic dynamics every time frustration is detected. It is impossible for me to drive without observing stupidity, inefficiencies and systemic flaws. Realizing that I am part of it and not an exception, I try to view others (drivers, bystanders, pedestrians, cyclists etc) with equal or greater importance to myself. I do not tailgate, unless it is a collective circumstance, eg slow high-density traffic. I heed speed limits, general laws, and remain cognizant of signs. I expect unexpected behavior and try to not react beyond necessary correction.<p>And I piss off a lot of drivers. Traveling the speed limit in the right lane in low density traffic, I will be tailgated or worse. Yet, while mostly driving well within legal parameters, I make good time and often end up ahead of erratic impatient drivers.<p>I believe that most collisions can be avoided through rational driving practices. But many are never exposed to the concept. A mere pulse is sufficient to receive a driver&#x27;s license.<p>Traffic enforcement also seems to be more revenue than safety driven and lacks consistency, eg ephemeral speed traps.<p>An essay or book could be easily written on this subject. As such an integral, ubiquitous part of society, it is amazing that such minimal attention is placed upon it. The fact that so many lives are at stake seems enough to make a religion of it. We really should do much more, without sloughing responsibility onto technology and the lottery of enforcement. For me it is one of the most outrageously glaring contradictions of expressed values there is, with carnage universally and quietly accepted as collateral damage.</div><br/><div id="41304303" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41304303" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">01HNNWZ0MV43FF</span><span>|</span><a href="#41299291">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41304250">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41304303">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41304303">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This would work if we had the ability to deny licenses to people, which would require us to have a real alternative to driving in more cities :(<p>&gt; And I piss off a lot of drivers.

Farming browny points by with low-hanging anti-Musk stuff seems to be more important then anything else for most people.<p>There is a whole cottage industry of anti-Cybertruck stuff all over the internet, if all those people put their energy into actually explain how to actually improve safty, we would be much better off.</div><br/><div id="41298152" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41298152" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Terr_</span><span>|</span><a href="#41283678">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41284729">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41298377">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41298152">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41298152">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I have heard 100x more people making Cybertruck jokes but almost never about actually improving safety in any signifcant way.<p>That&#x27;s a weird kind of blame shifting.<p>1. Many things that ought to change have <i>already been laid out well in advance</i>. Things like defined limits on how &quot;sharp&quot; the outsides can be or having a crumple-zone front instead of a pedestrian meat-tenderizer. This is especially true in jurisdiction where those recommendations are requirements, and the vehicle cannot be legally sold.<p>2. Many critiques have obvious solutions like &quot;don&#x27;t do the dumb thing&quot; or &quot;do it the normal way.&quot;<p>3. Improving safety is normally the job of the car manufacturing company, why would Tesla be any different?<p>4. If your want very detailed engineering fixes from the internet, tell Tesla to open-source their manufacturing process and pay people for time.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41298377" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41298377" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">h_tbob</span><span>|</span><a href="#41283678">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41298893">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41298377">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41298377">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As an American there are few times when I think the government did something awesome.<p>But Iâm amazed they are thinking of this.

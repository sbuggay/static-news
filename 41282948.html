The vehicle notifies the driver or the adaptive cruise control (if enabled) slows down while approaching the crosswalk.<p>3. The post with the crosswalk button on it has a LIDAR sensor that looks down the length of the crosswalk (and presumably another one facing from the opposite direction) and a relatively low power DSP digests the LIDAR input looking for approximately not-car shaped forms on the crosswalk.<p>4. The crosswalk announces a pedestrian on the crosswalk to the vehicles if a pedestrian presses the button on the crosswalk post or if a pedestrian form is detected on the crosswalk.<p>5. The vehicle alerts the driver or the adaptive cruise control comes to a complete stop, prompting the driver to resume when the route is clear (or when it no longer reports pedestrians using the crosswalk.<p>6.

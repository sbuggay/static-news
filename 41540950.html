For instance, if you tell students to graph &quot;y = -x^2&quot;, they should draw a parabola opening <i>downward</i>.<p>I don&#x27;t have a recent copy of Excel to check this in, but this was the case in the &#x27;97 version.

In math exponents are superscripts and there&#x27;s no binary operator- it&#x27;s part of the term. But for text on computers, binary operators ended up being fabricated for the things you couldn&#x27;t represent directly. The caret is common and was the first one to appear, but doubled multiplication signs is another one. Traditionally, binary operators have lower precedence than unary operators since the unary minus is considered part of the term, so the exponent turning into an operator mucks things up if it&#x27;s still implemented to adhere to that logic.<p>You sort of see the same issue with division. The forward slash is a completely invented binary operator since the actual division symbol was often not present- and let&#x27;s be real nobody uses the binary division operator when writing formulae. It&#x27;s supposed to represent the dividing line in a fraction, similar to how division is usually represented in a formula as a fraction of two other expressions. It&#x27;s got lower precedence than anything in either term- but, if you just replace the dividing line with a forward slash to input the formula into a computer, you&#x27;ll get incorrect results, because it&#x27;s replacing what is part of a complete term (the division line) with a new binary operator inserted between sets of terms, which is now subject to precedence rules.</div><br/><div id="41545381" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41545381" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MrJohz</span><span>|</span><a href="#41543489">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41544378">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41544865">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41545381">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41545381">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I suspect it&#x27;s more likely an artifact of how the number is lexed. `-3^2` probably gets lexed into Number(-3), Operator(^), Number(2), which results in the aforementioned precedence issues.

I don&#x27;t believe it has the same bug, but if it does, that will be how it&#x27;s crept in.<p>EDIT: looking at some of the descriptions of the bug, it seems like it happens when handling variables (i.e. cell references) as well, which makes it seem like a pure precedence issue and not a parsing issue.

You can apply any phase shift you want (as long as you apply it to both functions) and their differential equations will look exactly the same.<p>What do you mean? &quot;sin(0) = 0, cos(0) = 1, and for all <i>x</i>, sin&#x27;(<i>x</i>) = cos(<i>x</i>), cos&#x27;(<i>x</i>) = -sin(<i>x</i>)&quot; is perfectly unambiguous. If you changed the initial conditions, you&#x27;d get another pair of functions, but then they&#x27;d no longer be the sine and cosine, they&#x27;d be some other linear combination.

    Unary minus sign

    There are differing conventions concerning the unary operation &#x27;−&#x27; (usually pronounced &quot;minus&quot;). In written or printed mathematics, the expression −3² is interpreted to mean −(3²) = −9.

    In some applications and programming languages, notably Microsoft Excel, PlanMaker (and other spreadsheet applications) and the programming language bc, unary operations have a higher priority than binary operations, that is, the unary minus has higher precedence than exponentiation, so in those languages −3² will be interpreted as (−3)² = 9. This does not apply to the binary minus operation &#x27;−&#x27;; for example in Microsoft Excel while the formulas =-2^2, =-(2)^2 and =0+-2^2 return 4, the formulas =0-2^2 and =-(2^2) return −4.

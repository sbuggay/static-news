I had lived and worked in southern Uganda with a Canadian organization called Kibaale Children’s Fund (now Kuwasha). One day Bram came by our location. We talked a bit - someone told me he was influential and “worked for google or something” and then I learned his real identity and the software he was a part of. I was just on the brink of beginning a career in IT at the time and later in life as my skills and toolset grew I realized his significance. He never spoke of VIM in person during our time and was an incredibly humble quiet man, dedicating his time to helping children in need through ICCF Holland, which operated out of the same school I was working with as I recall. I found Bram incredibly genuine, and was also highly impressed with the ethics he brought to his efforts in the local work in Uganda (where it is typical to see fundraising dollars sliced and diced with admin-fees - ICCF turned every cent of a dollar back into the community.) He will be missed by many in that part of the world for such a massive impact he was able to have through funds raised through VIM.

There was an interview of him from 2022.
The answer that really stroke me was not about Vim, but about software craftmanship vs professional programming:<p>« I have been working for a company where quite a few managers, educated in physics and mechanics, thought the software was just the same as what they knew and they could decide how to make it. That company went downhill and was eventually taken over.  The same happens in places where decision-makers can get away with failure, such as in government. The people writing the code probably just make sure they get paid and then run away from the crime scene. On the other end of the scale are people who want to write beautiful code, spend lots of time on it, and don’t care if it actually does what it was intended to do or what the budget was. Somewhere in between, there is a balance. »<p>I am not so sure about the last sentence.

The function is just switching on combinations of inputs, branching to a case, and returning a literal constant for that case.<p>After writing a few hundred of these cases you say, to hell with this nonsense, and refactor the function to actually add the f.f.fine numbers together.<p>Now you have two, maybe three problems:<p>1.

Almost all, because you made a typo in the add(13, 13) test case such that it required the answer 28 to pass, and that&#x27;s what you did in the code; the real code correctly puts out 26, requiring the test to be fixed.<p>2. The function adds together combinations that are not tested, just fine, but you can no longer have the function <i>fail</i> for hitherto untested inputs, and then make the test pass. You can no longer &quot;do the TDD thing&quot; on it.<p>TDD is just a crutch that has to fall out the way when a developer with two brain cells together implements a general algorithm that makes all possible inputs work.<p>At the same time, that crutch is pretty good for systems that fundamentally <i>are</i> just collections of oddball cases that won&#x27;t generalize. As a rule of thumb, if there is no obvious way to refactor the code, then TDD is likely continuing to provide value in the sense that the tests are protecting important properties in what has been implemented, against breakage.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37019416" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37019416" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eru</span><span>|</span><a href="#37012816">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37018351">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37019449">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37016429">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37019416">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37019416">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Property based testing might be helpful for some of that.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37016429" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37016429" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Gibbon1</span><span>|</span><a href="#37012816">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37015240">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37015580">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37018088">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37016429">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37016429">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Also creating abstractions without considering the mental overhead of reasoning about what the code is doing.<p>Not enterprise: event --&gt; action.<p>Enterprise: event --&gt; abstraction --&gt; abstraction --&gt; abstraction --&gt; abstraction --&gt; abstraction --&gt; abstraction --&gt; abstraction --&gt; abstraction --&gt; action_parta --&gt; abstraction --&gt; abstraction --&gt; abstraction --&gt; action_partb abstraction --&gt; abstraction --&gt; abstraction --&gt; action_finalizer.</div><br/><div id="37016888" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37016888" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">The_Colonel</span><span>|</span><a href="#37012816">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37016429">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37018088">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37016888">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37016888">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I sometimes wonder if people believe that enterprise devs create abstractions for &quot;fun&quot; without having any rational reason.</div><br/><div id="37019882" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37019882" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tonyedgecombe</span><span>|</span><a href="#37012816">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37016888">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37017898">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37019882">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37019882">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In my experience enterprise devs don&#x27;t really like what they are having to create either.

First and only time Bram visited Japan.<p>I was there as a volunteer staff, sitting at a reception desk. Although vim is the text editor I use everyday, I&#x27;m not that enthusiastic to participate the vim conference. I&#x27;m not a vim developer. I don&#x27;t use some of the advanced vim features. I don&#x27;t ask much for a text editor. I use vim simply because it&#x27;s available in all environments I could possibly use. I was a volunteer staff because I was asked by one of my colleague at that time who was a serious vim user and organized the VimConf.<p>So I didn&#x27;t have a plan to talk to Bram at all. There were so many Japanese vim developers and serious vim users there who want to talk to Bram. This may be the first and last chance to talk to Bram in person for them. I don&#x27;t want to waste the precious time for them.<p>Then, I learned at the conference that recent vim release includes termdebug plugin which allows vim to behave as a gdb frontend. Since I am a C++ programmer, I started playing with it. Then, I quickly found a bug. termdebug assume there&#x27;s only one function for a name and couldn&#x27;t handle C++ function overloading.<p>I discussed this issue with Bram Moolenaar in a spare time.<p>There aren&#x27;t many other things I can tell about Bram.<p>At the after party of VimConf 2018, Bram absolutely refused to use a cup and drink beer directly from a beer bottle. It wasn&#x27;t a small 333 ml beer bottle. It was a big 633 ml beer bottle.<p>Before the VimConf 2018, Bram went to climb Mt.

We spent some time talking during the rest of the day and the next day; we discussed and joked about lots of things; I don&#x27;t recall talking much about Vim: it just didn&#x27;t come up.

It&#x27;s the gleaming precise machine tool on which so much of modernity was crafted. It&#x27;s so hard to quantify Bram&#x27;s impact, because he did so much through so powerful a force multiplier.<p>I started as a Unix sysadmin 25 years ago and kept gravitating towards vim. One practical reason is because it paid off to be familiar with vi, which is nearly always still available on just-installed or bare-bones systems. But another is how welcoming and leveling the Vim community was. It was so easy to get great macros and tips, and everyone was just super friendly about it. I remember someone in #vim irc teaching me &quot;gqap&quot; to wrap a paragraph, and they very naturally took the time to explain <i>how</i> it all worked. There was no sneering on from the community. I think Bram&#x27;s empathy and leadership was a huge part of that attitude in the community.<p>I&#x27;m a regular annual donor on Vim&#x27;s behalf, and this morning donated another  €250 in Bram&#x27;s memory. People should only donate what they can afford, we all have different means, but I&#x27;d encourage folks to work out what a great commercial editor or IDE would have cost them in licensing over their use time, and to consider donating in proportion.<p>:wq Bram</div><br/></div></div><div id="37011687" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37011687" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">justin_oaks</span><span>|</span><a href="#37011488">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37013793">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37012721">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37011687">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37011687">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Few contribute so meaningfully to the world through software as Bram did.

There was so much about emacs that I couldn&#x27;t stand, but I&#x27;ll admit to quite a bit of envy as well.<p>Then, some time around 94 or so, I became aware of this vi clone called vim. My emacs envy could finally be put to rest because this vim could either do (or had on the roadmap to do) everything I had envied from looking over emacs users&#x27; shoulders! I became a rabid user and evangelist, immediately downloading each new version, reporting (and occasionally fixing) bugs. For a while when I was working at Sun in the late 90s, Bram and I had an ongoing email dialog.<p>My career path has never really allowed me to significantly work on open source, so I never really made the transition to a major contributor. Many years ago, vim hit peak feature set for me, so I didn&#x27;t really need to track its development - the version bundled on my work desktop would always suffice and I&#x27;d download a new version at home whenever I changed out my home Windows PC.  Other than that, I lost track of the community.<p>When I came to Google, I was tickled to find out that Bram worked here, though I never reached out to him personally.

My first donation as a late teen to free software, was to the ICCF Uganda, thanks to vim&#x27;s charityware license.  It was maybe around 1997 or 98.  Later versions of vim used a formal free software license, but still off-band encouraging donations to the ICCF.  I&#x27;ve always been a bit skeptical to the whole concept of charity, but I respected Bram Moolenaar so much due to his work on vim that I trusted his judgement.  I kept donating to the ICCF for a few years until he was hired at google.<p>I was also deeply honored to see my (tiny, insignificant) minority language on his page for the word Mooleenar in many languages [0].<p>As a matter of respect and to honour his memory, I will keep using the last version of vim (by his last commit [1]) as my main text editor for as long as humanly feasible.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.moolenaar.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.moolenaar.net&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vim&#x2F;vim&#x2F;commit&#x2F;4c0089d696b8d1d5dc40568f25ea5738fa5bbffb">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vim&#x2F;vim&#x2F;commit&#x2F;4c0089d696b8d1d5dc40568f25...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37019880" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37019880" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zaikunzhang</span><span>|</span><a href="#37016552">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37011794">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37019880">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37019880">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Bram was a great man. Vim is a great piece of software. Vim is charityware. Distributed for free, it encourages people to make donations to help children in Unganda. I used to donate some money, starting from 2010. Bram sent you a key corresponding to your donation when he received it, and you could use the key to accumulate the amount of you donations, which would give you some priority in suggesting improvements in Vim. He responded very promptly after donations were made. My last donation on 17 July 2023 did not receive his reply, and I was worried.<p>I am by no means a Vim master, but Vim is virtually the ONLY text editor that I have been using since 2009.

I guess I finally have a good reason to swtich.<p>RIP Bram.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37012444" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37012444" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">edejong</span><span>|</span><a href="#37019526">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37011469">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37012444">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37012444">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In 2000 we organized a large outdoor LAN party for a week in the middle of nowhere hosting around 600 Unix&#x2F;Linux aficionados.

Not just did he tell us his story of developing vim, he also organised an in promptu quiz on Unix and networking. I have fond memories of Bram and am truly sad to hear he passed away.

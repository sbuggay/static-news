I had a hard time talking to people and making friends. I never felt like I “belonged.”<p>As an adult, I still have crippling social anxiety.<p>I can’t speak for everywhere, I’m pretty much only in the U.S., but I’ve noticed that most fellow adults I come across are chronically deprived of social interaction.<p>My social anxiety doesn’t actually matter. Me being awkward, and weird, and a little bit out there doesn’t actually matter. If you talk to people, ask them questions about themselves, laugh with them when they want to laugh, listen to them when they want to vent, rant with them when they want to rant, and feel pain with them when they’re vulnerable, a sweeping majority of the people I’ve met in the U.S. engage.<p>And the more you do it, the more you realize the world is actually full of amazing people. They’re all living their lives, making mistakes, getting things wrong, and making bad calls. But overwhelmingly they’re trying to figure life out and get through the best they can; and they want people with them on that journey.<p>I still have crippling social anxiety but my friend group is steadily growing and it feels good. I still play the fun game in my head of “haha did we all have a good time today or did I actually say something terrible and now everyone hates me or thinks I’m a fool?” on pretty much a daily basis. But I wouldn’t go back to being lonely. Not just for me, but for these amazing people who want more folks with them on their journey.</div><br/><div id="37186849" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37186849" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nvarsj</span><span>|</span><a href="#37184763">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37184843">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37186849">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37186849">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not usually one for drugs, but the thing that helped me get out of extreme social anxiety (I had selective mutism into my 20s), was anti-anxiety meds (off-label Modafinil). I didn&#x27;t take it for long, but being able to be in a social situation without that feeling of dread and anxiety was actually mind blowing.<p>It helped me recognize a state of mind where I didn&#x27;t immediately go to massive anxiety. After that, with therapy and forcing myself to do more social interactions, I got into a much better place. I still have some anxiety, but it&#x27;s largely manageable - and most people think I&#x27;m quite social now.<p>It&#x27;s something you might want to consider talking to a doctor about.

Additionally if you said “not good,” most people will be caught off guard but pivot into sympathy and asking what’s wrong etc. It’s a perfectly acceptable answer.

If my boss asks me how I’m doing I’ll tell them if it’s not good in some way related to work or my performance (I.e., “not good, I can’t get this to compile” or “not good, my mom died I need to take time off,” or even, “not good, I didn’t sleep well last night.”) for friends the “not good” can be deeper, and for family it’s pretty open. For strangers, I still might say “not good” if something particularly acute is happening (“not good, my mom just died,” “not good, I just got out of the hospital this morning.”) I’ve never had someone get uppity about a “not good” response, and have always had an appropriate pivot to sympathy and a refocus on the question.<p>As such, I’ve always found it odd people narrow in on the “how are you” question being perfunctory and people don’t genuinely care.

It&#x27;s not impossible to make connections in this environment, but it takes actual effort. This makes work the main form of social interaction for many people around me.<p>Over the summer, however, I spend time in Spain. A town with a population under 200k, and yet far more dense than San Francisco. Streets are narrower, and most errands are less than 10 minutes away, on foot. The pharmacist, the baker, the workers at the restaurant, don&#x27;t change very much. Since everyone walks, you really get to pass by every neighbor in the building every couple of weeks. The parks and playing ares with children are never close to empty, and people tend to have routines, so it&#x27;s far easier to get to know people from random interactions. It&#x27;s not uncommon to meet people you know, completely by accident, just because you walk the same streets. I might not stop at a certain coffee shop, but it has seating outside, and friends are be sitting there, and therefore I get a chance social encounter, even when I am not visiting the same business. There&#x27;s benches in random streets, and people meet there, and chat on the street, so you don&#x27;t even need a business as a &quot;third place&quot;, when you have the street. Thus, getting six non-work social interactions a day becomes trivial.<p>Large parts of America have chosen forms of development that are naturally isolating: It&#x27;s no surprise so many feel isolated!</div><br/><div id="37184235" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37184235" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xcskier56</span><span>|</span><a href="#37176813">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37177063">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37184235">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37184235">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I grew up in the suburbs, and it was a noteworthy occurrence when someone saw someone they knew out and about at the store or something like that.<p>Now I live in the city and with so many more people around I see people I know so much more often.

The economics of it were such that you could get a car and a home outside the city for less than an apartment inside. And the living conditions were so much better.

In a number of countries complete strangers great each other. Like in The Netherlands, though the likelihood to be greeted depends on where you are, time of day, and age of the people who greet.<p>In a big city people generally don&#x27;t greet strangers, unless they meet very early in the morning and the occurence of a chance greeting among early risers grows. When city dwellers enter the suburbs and esp. when going into nature, they start to greet. Smaller towns and villages see a lot of greeting in the circle that one can count as beyond neighbors.<p>The younger people get the less they seem to participate in this old habit. Maybe they &#x27;learn&#x27; to greet at older age, or modern society and smartphones are killing the tradition. I sometimes wonder if in modern society we are shifting more and more to a stance of distrust of the people we don&#x27;t know, and this affects the greeting culture too.<p>Overall this casual greeting, often accompanied with a warm smile and sometimes some small talk, feels uplifting and heartwarming.

I knocked on their door, holding the package, and let me just explain something that&#x27;s important: I&#x27;m a slightly overweight nerd that spends too much time in his office chair. I&#x27;m about as threatening looking as a Best Buy worker in his khakis. Well, through the window next to the front door, I saw one of the home&#x27;s occupants (a young lady probably early 20s) just standing there looking at me through the window, apparently not knowing what to do. I knocked on the door again and gestured towards the Amazon box in my hand. Well the woman let out a shriek from the bowels of hell and damnation, like terrified. Picture Donald Sutherland in Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. I&#x27;m just standing there trying to hand a package to a neighbor and she is screaming over and over and over and looking at me like I&#x27;m a serial killer. I put the box down on the front porch and backed away. I heard the screaming long after I got down the driveway to the road.<p>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with people. Maybe this person has some kind of traumatic past and can&#x27;t bear to even see other people. I don&#x27;t know.

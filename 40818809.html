Ultimately, the reason it was good was because the engineers had zero ego on top of having excellent skills. The team that set the codebase were basically 4 seniors and 3 principals (the client actually did pay for top talent in this case) so not only everything was based on industry standards, written elegantly and organized perfectly, but every time some new requirement came up, these senior &#x2F; principal engineers would discuss it in the most civilized matter I have ever seen.<p>E.g, &quot;we need to come up with a way to implement X&quot;. Person A gives their idea, person B gives another idea and so on until everybody shared their thoughts. Then someone would say &quot;I think what person C said makes the most sense&quot; and everybody would agree and that was it. 30 minutes to hear everybody out, 3 minutes to discuss who will do it and when and the meeting was over.<p>I think the biggest testament to this code base was that when junior members joined the team, they were able to follow the existing code for adding new features.

My manager I guess had written a lot of the code we&#x27;d be interacting with, and I guess was somewhat protective and reluctant to delegate authority over decisions around it. It was a big refactoring project, and I just encouraged my colleagues to take the things they wanted, like rebuilding the state management system. We&#x27;d discuss the requirements and why it was necessary, and I&#x27;d look for reasons to agree rather than disagree, then we&#x27;d be off.

It was written by some people that had done similar things for BITNET and had a deep understanding of Unix programming and how to use event loops for scalability.<p>It was in C, but the process was expected to run for months without crashing or running out of memory; if it had an abnormal exit, you&#x27;d (the owner as set in some code thing) get an email with the core backtrace. If it had a memory leak, ops would be on you quickly. Ops was considered a primary driver of requirements to dev, and absolutely everything could be reloaded into a running server without restarting it. There was a TCP control port where a TCL interpreter inside the service was exposed and generally you wrote the (very simple, CS 101 style) TCL commands to manage the server.  It was a &quot;No Threads Kernel&quot;, scaled to the dozens or hundreds of physical machines communicating over a very well managed network, and most 1 process per core, and 1 core for the OS. The 200 
or so unix developers (as we were called) had a common understanding of how the framework worked and if you were just writing app code it was basically impossible to write slow services.  We had technical writers that would interview the developers and write books that could be handed to outside developers and lead to a successful integration with no developer time spent.<p>The NTK was primarily for sending msgs over the network - we had a principle to never write to disk (which were pretty slow in the 1990s), so everything was just a server to get network messages and then send out other messages in reponse and then assemble the replies&#x2F;timeouts and send back a msg to the caller. All done over persistent connections established by the infrastructure, the applications just registered callbacks for msg type &#x27;X&#x27; which would present one with the caller information, the msg as a buffer, and potentially a &quot;user word&quot; which would be a way to keep server state around between calls.<p>The layering, from the main select loop thru different layers of TCP connection, SSL handling (if used, not 100% was SSL in the 90s), thru persistent link handling, application msg handling, timers, memory allocation, etc. was done with such art that I felt it to be a thing of beauty.</div><br/><div id="40824725" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40824725" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mrpippy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40824075">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40825598">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40824725">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40824725">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Fascinating, what kind of hardware&#x2F;OS was used in production?</div><br/><div id="40825215" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40825215" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lanstin</span><span>|</span><a href="#40824075">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40824725">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40825598">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40825215">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40825215">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Started with Tandem and Stratus pre Unix then migrated to HPUX then Solaris then Linux on stock hardware.

A bit of context:<p>- proprietary service, written in Python, maaany KLOC,<p>- hundreds of engineers worked on it,<p>- before this framework, writing the integration tests was difficult -- you had a base framework, but the tests had no structure, everyone rolled out their own complicated way of wiring things -- very convoluted and flaky.<p>The new integration tests framework was build by a recently joined senior engineer. TBF, it&#x27;s wrong to say that it&#x27;s was a framework, if you think in the xUnit sense. This guy built a set of business components that you could connect &amp; combine in a sound way to build your integration test. Doesn&#x27;t sound like much, but it significantly simplified writing integration tests (it still had rough edges, but it was 10x improvement). It&#x27;s rare to see the chaos being tamed in such elegant way.<p>What this guy did:<p>- built on top of the existing integration tests framework (didn&#x27;t rollout something from zero),<p>- defined a <i>clear semantic</i> for the test components,<p>- built the initial set of the test components,<p>- held a <i>strong ownership</i> over the code -- through the code review he ensured that the new components follow semantics, and that each test component is covered by its own test (yep, tests for the test doubles, you don&#x27;t see that very often).<p>Did it work well longterm? Unfortunately, no. He stayed relatively short (&lt;2y).

Which just means I need to work on more codebases.<p>Iâm making a tool to convert data schemas to SQL via a UI for lay-users. Just like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;react-querybuilder.js.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;react-querybuilder.js.org&#x2F;</a> which is basically a UI based SQL generator. For work.<p>Except my version extends the idea much further, blending Excel like functionality with functions that can act on Fields and Rules.<p>What makes it good?<p>For one, itâs a from scratch project with almost no third party libraries.<p>For two, I fortunately chose a recursive data structure to represent the data schema, and that has really worked out well. Early on I tried 4 other approaches to represent the data, but went back to recursive feeling it was the best choice.<p>Furthermore Iâm using React, but itâs heavily leveraging reducers. Specifically Groups have a reduced, Rules have a reducer, and Fields have a reducer. The reducers are linked in a chain top to bottom, where changes on a Field change a Rule, and changes on a Rule change a Group. Itâs been extremely clean to work with.<p>Because the base data schema is recursive (Groups contain groups contain groups), most of the functions that manipulate the schema are recursive. There is a real elegance to the code, each recursive function has a very obvious base case, and a very obvious recursive path.<p>And for the final outcome, walking the query data structure and spitting out the equivalent SQL is also recursive, and feels elegant, coming in at under 40 lines.<p>Literally as Iâve been writing this codebase, everything somehow perfectly fell into place. I was marvelling near the end that it felt like I chose all the best possible logic paths to build this somehow.<p>Iâm hoping to get the okay from work to open source it (fully open source). The only cruft of the project is the types Iâm using, the interface of the code could be improved with generics</div><br/></div></div><div id="40826113" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40826113" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jchrisa</span><span>|</span><a href="#40828731">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40819140">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40826113">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40826113">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">CouchDB&#x27;s HTTP API used to fit in just one file (less than 1k lines of Erlang), and it was a great jumping-off point for learning databases and web programming: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;apache&#x2F;couchdb&#x2F;blob&#x2F;0.8.1&#x2F;src&#x2F;couchdb&#x2F;couch_httpd.erl">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;apache&#x2F;couchdb&#x2F;blob&#x2F;0.8.1&#x2F;src&#x2F;couchdb&#x2F;cou...</a><p>It was written by one engineer, and then later refactored by a team to look like this (and many other files): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;apache&#x2F;couchdb&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;src&#x2F;chttpd&#x2F;src&#x2F;chttpd_db.erl">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;apache&#x2F;couchdb&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;src&#x2F;chttpd&#x2F;src&#x2F;c...</a><p>It&#x27;s an interesting exercise to see how something grows and changes as it transitions from inspiration to real-world usage.</div><br/><div id="40828644" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40828644" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">phito</span><span>|</span><a href="#40826113">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40819140">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40828644">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40828644">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So little blank lines, I need to breathe</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40819140" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40819140" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">structural</span><span>|</span><a href="#40826113">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40819254">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40819140">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40819140">[17 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Worked on a codebase for a large safety-critical system where everything was 100% documented, and the development guide for the project was followed so closely that you couldn&#x27;t tell, across millions of lines of code, that the whole thing wasn&#x27;t written by one person.

Google didn&#x27;t even use its own open-source libraries like Angular. None of the technologies were remotely usable outside Google.<p>It might sound cool to use only in-house stuff, and I understand the arguments about licensing. But it meant that everything was poorly-documented, had bugs and missing features that lingered for years, and it was impossible to find a SME because whoever initially built a technology had moved on to other things and left a mess behind them.<p>Some people may be able to deal with the excruciating slowness and scattered-ness, and may be OK with working on a teeny slice of the pie in the expectation that years later they&#x27;ll get to own a bigger slice.

I was shocked at how big things had gotten without collapsing, which is down to thousands of Googlers working to build world-class internal tooling. But you could see where the priorities were. Code Search was excellent - I&#x27;d rate it 10&#x2F;10 if they asked.<p>The build system always felt more like a necessary evil than anything else. In some parts of google3 you needed three <i>separate</i> declarations of all module dependencies. You could have Angular&#x27;s runtime dependency injection graph, the Javascript ESM graph, and the Blaze graph which all need to be in sync. Now, the beautiful part was that this still worked. And The final Blaze level means you can have a Typescript codebase that depends on a Java module written in a completely unrelated part of google3, which itself depends on vendored C++ code somewhere else. Updating the vendored C++ code would cause all downstream code to rebuild and retest. But this is a multi billion dollar solution to problems that 99.99% of companies do not have. They are throwing thousands of smart people at a problem that almost everyone else has &quot;solved&quot; by default simply by being a smaller company.<p>The one tooling I think every company could make use of but doesn&#x27;t seem to have were all of the little hacks in the build system (maybe not technically part of Blaze?). You could require a developer who updates the file at &#x2F;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;department&#x2F;a&#x2F;src&#x2F;foo.java to simultaneously include a patch to &#x2F;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;department&#x2F;b&#x2F;src&#x2F;bar.java. Many files would have implicit dependency on each other outside of the build graph and a human is needed to review if extra changes are needed. And that&#x27;s just one of a hundred little tricks project maintainers can employ.<p>The quality of the code was uniformly at least &quot;workable&quot; (co-workers updating parts of the Android system would probably not agree with that - many critical system components were written by one person poorly who soon after quit).</div><br/><div id="40826237" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40826237" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SR2Z</span><span>|</span><a href="#40823142">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40825635">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40826956">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40826237">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40826237">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; But this is a multi billion dollar solution to problems that 99.99% of companies do not have.<p>I know it&#x27;s trendy for people to advocate for simple architectures, but the honest-to-god truth is that it&#x27;s insane that builds work ANY OTHER WAY.  One of the highest priorities companies should have is to reduce siloing, and I can barely think of a better way to guarantee silos than by having 300 slightly different build systems.<p>There is a reason why Google can take a new grad SWE who barely knows how to code and turn them into a revenue machine.  I&#x27;ve worked at several other places but none of them have had internal infrastructure as nice as the monorepo; it was the least amount of stress I&#x27;ve ever felt deploying huge changes.<p>Another amazing thing that I don&#x27;t see mentioned enough was how robust the automatic deployments with Boq&#x2F;Annealing&#x2F;Stubby were.  The internal observability library would automatically capture RPC traces from both the client and server, and the canary controller would do a simple p-test on whether or not the new service had a higher error rate than the old one.  If it did? The rollback CL would be automatically submitted and you&#x27;d get a ping.<p>This might sound meh until I point out that EVEN CONFIG CHANGES were versioned and canaried.</div><br/><div id="40826578" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40826578" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kridsdale3</span><span>|</span><a href="#40823142">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40826237">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40826620">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40826578">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40826578">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve worked at the majority of FAANG.<p>Facebook&#x27;s build system works the same as Googles, because most of FB&#x27;s infra was made by ex-Googlers around 10-15 years ago.

Whatever, it&#x27;s all text files in the end.<p>The wildest was at Apple. It&#x27;s just as you said, 300 build systems. Not only that, but 300 source code repositories! Two teams in the same hall that hang out all the time could be using git and svn, for no good reason besides what someone wrote &quot;init&quot; in 20 years ago. There was no cross team communication, by design, because Steve Jobs was paranoid. Their sync mechanism was to build the entire stack once a night, and force everyone to full-reinstall their OS and toolchain to &quot;rebase&quot;.

And a comparably capable and essential IT person.<p>The reasons for the super-productivity include one of the developers choosing great technology and using it really well, to build a foundation with &quot;force multiplier&quot; effects, and the other developer able to build out bulk with that, while understanding the application domain.<p>Another reason was understanding and being pretty fully in control of the code base, so that, as needs grew and changed, over years, someone could figure out how to do whatever was needed.<p>One of the costs was that most things had to be built from scratch.  Over time that also proved to be an advantage, because whenever they needed (put loosely) a &quot;framework&quot; to something it couldn&#x27;t do, they effectively owned the framework, and could make dramatic changes.<p>When I said &quot;costs&quot;, I mean things like, many times they needed to make a component from scratch that would be an off-the-shelf component in some other ecosystem.  So if someone looked closely at how time was sometimes spent, without really understanding it or knowing how that panned out, it would look like a cost that they could optimize away.

Every day thousands of patches are landed to upgrade APIs with new type safety, security restrictions, deprecations and other code maintenance.<p>Most other company repos I worked on had major re-writes outside of the mainline until one day there was a sudden and often troublesome switch-over to the new code.<p>Code is constantly changing, and unless you have a continuous process for landing and testing those changes, you are going to suffer when you try to apply the changes needed to address the accumulated tech-debt.</div><br/><div id="40825325" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40825325" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ceejayoz</span><span>|</span><a href="#40824155">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40825259">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40825325">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40825325">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  We called this swapping out the airplane parts mid-flight...<p>I work fairly heavily with Facebook&#x27;s Graph API, and I think they may have employed too many Boeing engineers for the part swaps lately.</div><br/><div id="40827547" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40827547" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tonymet</span><span>|</span><a href="#40824155">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40825325">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40825259">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40827547">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40827547">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Most of the compatibility issues over the past few years at least have been due to added privacy restrictions and reduced permissions scoping.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40825259" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40825259" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lanstin</span><span>|</span><a href="#40824155">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40825325">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40825825">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40825259">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40825259">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I really wish more people believed in continuous improvement and the malleability of software.

* Codebase quality improves over time, even as codebase and team size rapidly increase
* Everything is easy to find. Sub-packages are well-organised. Files are easy to search for
* Scaling is now essentially solved and engineers can put 90% of their time into feature-focused work instead of load concerns<p>I think there are a few reasons for this:<p>* We have standard patterns for our common use cases
* Our hiring bar is high and everyone is expected to improve code quality over time
* Critical engineering decisions have been consistently well-made. For example, we are very happy to have chosen our current DB architecture, avoided GraphQL and used Rust for some performance-critical areas
* A TypeScript monorepo means code quality spreads across web&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;backend
* Doing good migrations has become a core competency. Old systems get migrated out and replaced by better, newer ones
* GCP makes infra easy
* All the standard best practices: code review, appropriate unit testing, feature flagging, ...<p>Of course, there are still some holes. We have one or two dark forest features that will eventually need refactoring&#x2F;rebuilding; testing needs a little more work. But overall, I&#x27;m confident these things will get fixed and the trajectory is very good.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40819262" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40819262" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">simfoo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40819013">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40819125">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40819262">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40819262">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My past three employers code bases: mono-repos, Bazel, lots ot C++ and Python, thousands of libraries and tools, code generation and modeling tools that are fully integrated into the build, easy cross compilation, large integration tests just one bazel test invocation away, hermetic and uniform dependencies...</div><br/><div id="40823827" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40823827" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fire_lake</span><span>|</span><a href="#40819262">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40819125">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40823827">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40823827">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Bazel Python does not cross compile IIRC.

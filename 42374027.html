Instead, I implore you to give benefit of the doubt and attempt to understand the differences.<p>The Boltzmann brain is not making some grand statement on ground truth or perception. It&#x27;s not about intrinsics or perception at all. Boltzmann discussed how the universe, even in a state of 100% thermodynamic equilibrium, may spontaneously end up in a state of non-equilibrium, reducing entropy. The Boltzmann brain was a concept developed by others in response to this theory.<p>In fact, many theories are such that a Boltzmann brain actually has a higher chance of occurring than all of the billions of years of coincidences which led up to me typing this message out to you.<p>It&#x27;s purely an argument of entropy and spontaneous symmetry breaking. The sensory and perceptive states described by the Boltzmann brain only serve to illustrate the point, and are not the main subject of the problem.<p>Don&#x27;t forget that philosophy was the first science, and viewing people as &quot;science-minded&quot; (and therefore not philosophy-minded) hurts the scientific legitimacy of philosophy, and also only serves to exclude. Many scientists also have deep philosophical grounding. Many also have deep musical grounding. You yourself are exhibiting a lack of domain knowledge regarding the Boltzmann brain, filtering it through your &quot;philosophy-minded&quot; perspective, so maybe we can dispense with these kinds of judgements and focus on the core argument.<p>The world is not so black and white, and there is no false dichotomy between people who are &quot;science-minded&quot; and &quot;philosophy-minded&quot;. Both follow the same exact scientific method of inquiry.<p>Additionally, &quot;the same reason non-musicians might think Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon in D is the best ever&quot; comes across as a strawman. Some people might prefer that piece overall, but it&#x27;s not a crime for someone to enjoy it. But relatively few  probably consider it &quot;the best ever&quot;.<p>But also, who cares? Why judge? I have a lot of favorite modern pieces which are technically inferior to most classical pieces. But as a <i>musician</i>, not just an engineer, I consider sensory evocation to be equally as important as technicality.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42384233" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42384233" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sdwr</span><span>|</span><a href="#42383071">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42383833">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42385922">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42383803">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42384233">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42384233">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sounds about right, except Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon actually is the best song ever for non-musicians.<p>It showcases harmony and contrasting lines in the simplest, punchiest, most pleasing way.

Like the difference between the two is just 10^10^69, mostly. I&#x27;ll point out here that I&#x27;m not using units. The article does, but it&#x27;s not like they really mean anything at these time scales. A plank time (10^-43 s) to the age of the current universe (10^9 yr) to the lower bound for the estimated time until the heat death of the universe (10^109 yr), all of those time units just end up as rounding errors compared to the lower limit of 10^10^50.<p>The article does not go over here the time that such a brain could last for, but given that it&#x27;s quantum mumbo jumbo, we can again assume something in the times of 10^-43s to 10^109 yr. Which, again, means that such a brain can hardly be said to have ever have existed in the first place compared to the time of it&#x27;s formation probability. And yes, that means our current universe is in the same &#x27;meh, just round it off&#x27; bucket.<p>Like, we get caught up in the minutiae of this thing&#x27;s mind, it&#x27;s perceptions, it&#x27;s sanity, it&#x27;s soul (?). But if anything the absurdist thought experiment ends as just a mirror aimed at ourselves, with the void now creeping in behind our hats. What am I? What is perception? What is time? Can any of <i>this</i> ever possibly matter compared to these might-as-well-be infinities? Oh God!<p>I&#x27;ve put numbers up here, they are very poor estimates mostly. And then I tell you that these numbers are so huge that, very literally, nothing that will <i>ever</i> exist in our universe can be made to understand that far future in which this absurd quantum brain comes out of. That time ceases to have any meaning <i>at all</i> in this not quite so empty quantum vacuum.<p>So, having looked into this mirror, I don&#x27;t know what tell you.

We&#x27;re neither inside nor outside a black hole, but on the boundary of one.<p>All Black Holes form from matter &quot;falling in&quot; rather than stuff &quot;exploding out&quot;, and that&#x27;s how our universe formed (as a Black Hole, one dimension higher up than normal 2D black holes we see). The general rule is that any N-dimensional reality is on an Event Horizon and will have contained&#x2F;embedded within it (N-1)-dimensional other black holes (it&#x27;s a hierarchy).<p>The JWT also just showed our universe is expanding at a rate that&#x27;s also inconsistent with our current Big Bang theory, and is off by a whopping 8%. I think the reason we see the  expansion is not because of Dark Energy (which likely doesn&#x27;t even exist), but is because the surface of all Event Horizons only expands over time, or in the case of a 3D (excluding time dimension) Universe we see more and more of volumetric space forming, because it&#x27;s a volumetric expansion for us, rather than the &quot;area&quot; (2d) expansion on conventional 2D Black Holes.<p>I also think the surface normal vector (perpendicular) vector, at any point on such a manifold (Event Horizon) will be experienced as a &quot;time&quot; dimension. That&#x27;s why time is a &quot;special&quot; variable. Thus time only moves forward whenever the event horizon &quot;grows&quot; (due to matter falling in from outside it)</div><br/><div id="42383851" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42383851" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">post-it</span><span>|</span><a href="#42383094">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42384594">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42383851">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42383851">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You can always rely on HN to produce a software guy with a unique hypothesis about how the universe and&#x2F;or the economy <i>actually</i> works.</div><br/><div id="42384219" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42384219" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">quantadev</span><span>|</span><a href="#42383094">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42383851">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42384594">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42384219">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42384219">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve been convinced of this theory for about 10 years.

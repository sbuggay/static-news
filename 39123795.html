I don&#x27;t even remember when I bought the app --  five years ago? seven? ten? -- and I&#x27;m still getting regular updates for it. It has maintained and iterated on its core feature set while keeping up with macOS updates. The dev team even added thoughtful new features -- like Wikilinks, frontmatter support, and authorship tracking -- without turning the app into something it&#x27;s not. At its core, iA Writer remains a fast, bare-bones, distraction-free Markdown editor with beautiful typography that feels as Mac-native as you can get.<p>This is the sort of experience people are looking for when they say they want to &quot;own&quot; an app.<p>On the other hand there&#x27;s Scrivener. I bought this app during the pandemic, and almost immediately regretted the purchase. The UI looks dated in a bad way, like an old Mac OS X app from 2010. It&#x27;s full of a million chunky buttons and colors and gradients, creating a ton of visual noise. It&#x27;s updated maybe once or twice per year, mostly to fix bugs and maintain compatibility with newer macOS versions. Their aging file format doesn&#x27;t work properly with any cloud storage service except Dropbox, and they refuse to do anything about it. Even if you use Dropbox, it&#x27;s very easy to corrupt your projects if you forget to manually sync them before opening them on a different device. The iPad app looks like it was built in the early days of the device, and has bizarre implementations of basic controls (like tree views) that behave differently from how you&#x27;d expect. It&#x27;s clear that the dev team behind Scrivener has given up on the app and are keeping it on life support.<p>I think there are more Scriveners in this world than iA Writers. Or you have apps like Sublime Text, where every new version requires you to pay for a fresh license. At that point, you might as well turn it into subscription software.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39125167" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39125167" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">turtledragonfly</span><span>|</span><a href="#39126892">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39125773">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39125167">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39125167">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I liked this article, because (1) it&#x27;s well-written and detailed, and (2) I somehow disagree with it in my gut, though I&#x27;m not sure precisely why.

Some runs on specific hardware some is general. Some works in the cloud, on prem, or on desktop. Some comes with source, some doesn&#x27;t.

They don&#x27;t want to tinker with the code, they don&#x27;t want responsibility for supporting it, they just want it to work.<p>For a successful business money is easy to get. People with the ability to hack on some custom build of some random open source thing are hard to get. Better to use QuickBooks, and pay an annual license.<p>For a startup business with no revenue, it makes sense to leverage skills, and look after cash. So get free software to do everything.

And yes, businesses want reoccurring revenue (they&#x27;d rather rent&#x2F;lease me the car than sell it outright.)<p>But fundamentally, with software, something is on _offer_ for the subscription. In my case we use subscriptions to pay for ongoing support staff (which customers _want_) because we can&#x27;t fund support from sales (that&#x27;s not sustainable.) Support-pay-as-you-go is not popular because the person needing support needs it now (not in 30 days once procurement has signed off on it.)<p>Sure, there are subscription models for cars. There are also lots of cars that are sold outright. There are lots of cars sold on lease or HP basis.

I think this is the norm for the overwhelming majority of all people.<p>There&#x27;s a fundamental &quot;problem&quot; that software-by-license is trying to solve. That&#x27;s the fact that most software, in most domains, became good enough to do whatever you want with it, and pretty easily, years ago. Such tough times we live in. But the reason this is a problem is because companies have a zillion employees, sprawling high cost &#x27;campuses&#x27;, and baseline costs in the billions to tens of billions of dollars. So they need to sell to keep selling you new versions of products that don&#x27;t really do anything new.<p>And so this is where we enter the domain of &#x27;free to play&#x27; style operating systems, paying rent for a spreadsheet, and so on. All of these business models completely suck for most people. And they&#x27;re also completely self defeating at scale. Because paying $20&#x2F;month for Photoshop might sound nice compared to a $2000 up-front fee for something you might not even be using in a decade, until every single piece of software you&#x27;re using tries to go the same route - and suddenly to do everything you were doing before, you&#x27;d need to pay $2000&#x2F;month forever (of course with annual price increases), all the while everything you&#x27;re using also spies on you, tries to deliver &quot;value added ads&quot;, and all other sorts of crap. It sucks.<p>If companies were able to deliver products that people actively and enthusiastically wanted to buy, they would be. But they can&#x27;t.

The games industry is definitely a mix of the two models but very often its priced up front and right now all the services come to an end regardless as customers leave for new games.<p>The business focussed applications have gone this way and a got amount of the other home applications are free open source. So I agree its happened but I don&#x27;t think the consumer gets the best deal out of this in a lot of cases because something they learnt to use and have an amount of content in ends up slowly moving out of date or costing a lot to keep due to the service costs.

They just want a chat program that they don&#x27;t have to think about and the $15 or whatever per employee is pennies compared to those employees salaries (or even the office space they&#x27;re sitting in).<p>I think our guts disagree with it because it&#x27;s an article that kinda tells us to ignore what could be better when it isn&#x27;t really the point of your business.<p>Further, it kinda tells us that <i>we can&#x27;t</i> do it better.

We&#x27;re the kinds of people that like building things and here the author is saying that all these bespoke things end up as a hodgepodge of barnacles that don&#x27;t even get the business pointed in the right direction. The author is, to an extent, saying that the business is better off when employees adapt themselves to standard things rather than using custom tools.<p>To an extent, it&#x27;s questioning whether we should be writing so much software. Is what so many software engineers are creating even valuable? Or are the costs much higher than the value being created on these bespoke systems? I don&#x27;t think the author is trying to question our profession, but there&#x27;s certainly a question of whether we&#x27;re reinventing the wheel too much and spending our time on less useful pursuits within our profession (and let&#x27;s face it, reinventing the wheel is so much fun).<p>Software is hard. People often say that the last 10% takes 90% of the time. I think we often underestimate the costs (in time and money) that go into actually getting something into production and then maintaining it. The author is basically telling us: it&#x27;ll take longer than you think, it won&#x27;t be as good as you dream, cruft will accumulate over time, and at the end of the day the company just wants it done, not for you to have a project.

There are no backups that just work, if you forget to manage backups yourself (and most people realistically will), your data will get lost. There are no integrations with external online services, because those services change and the product doesn&#x27;t.

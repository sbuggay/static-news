Seems like there&#x27;s basically a 0% chance a random person would get into YC. And often those who did get in went to Stanford, Harvard, etc. and don&#x27;t even have a product - sometimes they don&#x27;t even know what they&#x27;re going to build yet.<p>I wrote the idea of VC stuff off long ago. My wife and I have a profitable business here in SF that would be perfect as a startup, but the concept of raising funds to expand literally hasn&#x27;t even crossed our minds because it seems so geared toward post-grads - like something only Stanford and Harvard people get access to after they graduate.<p>Not only that, we&#x27;re profitable, and can even articulate a realistic vision about how it becomes the next $100M household name, but the numbers I&#x27;ve read online that most VCs want to see are not realistic - or if we were hitting those numbers I wouldn&#x27;t even need a VC, we would be able to fund our own expansion.<p>So we&#x27;re just doing it on our own.</div><br/><div id="40092246" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40092246" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacobwg</span><span>|</span><a href="#40091991">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40092159">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40092246">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40092246">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I mean, I didn&#x27;t even graduate college :P<p>&gt; So we&#x27;re just doing it on our own.<p>IMO if you can become a $100M household name without VC, that&#x27;s absolutely the way to do it.<p>Even if you do take the VC path, YC for me was a massive boost in network, knowledge, and resources that I didn&#x27;t have before, but it&#x27;s also not the only way to acquire those things.

Service offered &#x2F; payment received is irreplaceably wholesome and satisfying :) especially when they come back as repeat customers or become regular clients. Repeat business and gradual growth gives us both an exciting feeling about the future that I never quite felt at a startup. I&#x27;ve found too often a venture-backed startup is really a lifestyle business in disguise for the founders, not really about serving customers, so it&#x27;s hard to truly get excited about them anymore. Where running a business that solves a problem for paying customers feels more like changing the world:<p>&gt; we&#x27;re making a difference in their lives, and they in turn pay us money<p>We&#x27;ve felt this too in our community, it&#x27;s the real meaning of &quot;Make something people want&quot; (and why we haven&#x27;t had a day off in like 62 days or something lol). It&#x27;s strange to refer to our business as a &quot;startup&quot;, but it is one, moreso than most VC-funded ones and I bet we have more customers, higher revenues, and a better growth outlook than the average local seed-funded startup. For us, a loan or VC route would just let us expand nationally right now to other major cities, instead of focusing first on the Bay Area and expanding nationally over the next several years which feels inevitable.<p>The amount a VC might pressure us to go in the wrong direction is another worry, and because it&#x27;s just capital we&#x27;d need (not advice), they might just get in the way and throw off timing or team structure.<p>Thanks for your comment!

If anything, I think they&#x27;re quite a bit better about avoiding that elitism than the average you&#x27;ll find among organizations of comparable wealth and power (compare top law firms, leadership of more traditional companies, politicians, etc). This isn&#x27;t my strongest opinion - I&#x27;ve never done any proper formal study of the question - but your impressions contradict my own experience living in that world.<p>I used to be part of the leadership team for a YC company. Here&#x27;s where the four YC founders I know off the top of my head went to school: SUNY, Oxford, Epitech, Tufts. Only Oxford among those is truly elite, though the other three are good schools. The one who went to Oxford (Harj Taggar) is a bit of an odd one out here, since they were a partner with YC itself first before founding the company that I know them from. Granted, three of these were founders many years ago, so perhaps this has changed, but one (the Tufts alum) got funding only about a year ago.<p>I looked up a few other founders that are second- or third-degree connections and found the same: a handful of truly elite schools, a peak in A-tier-but-not-truly-elite schools, and a handful of no-name schools like my own alma mater. I expect that that&#x27;s a reasonably representative distribution of where you find extremely smart people, and especially smart+motivated ones.<p>As for this bit:<p>&gt;&gt; And often those who did get in went to Stanford, Harvard, etc. and don&#x27;t even have a product - sometimes they don&#x27;t even know what they&#x27;re going to build yet.<p>YC is pretty explicit that they try to pick founders, not ideas, most of the time. That approach is all over the Startup School videos, for example; they don&#x27;t exactly make a secret of it.<p>&gt;&gt; but the numbers I&#x27;ve read online that most VCs want to see are not realistic - or if we were hitting those numbers I wouldn&#x27;t even need a VC, we would be able to fund our own expansion.<p>Growth demands, both realistic and unrealistic, are a much fairer criticism IMO. They&#x27;re the primary reason <i>I</i> haven&#x27;t sought VC funding personally (from YC or otherwise).<p>Out of curiosity, I&#x27;d love to know more about what you&#x27;re doing - I checked your HN profile but it didn&#x27;t have a link or anything.</div><br/><div id="40094183" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40094183" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">april192024</span><span>|</span><a href="#40091991">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40093055">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40092106">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40094183">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40094183">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;YC is pretty explicit that they try to pick founders, not ideas, most of the time.

Not only does this work, it&#x27;s the majority case (I just double checked this). Most founders that YC funds are repeat applicants.<p>Applying repeatedly demonstrates persistence, which is one of the qualities YC looks for. Better still, if you can show continued progress since your previous application, that demonstrates resourcefulness, another core quality. Repeated applications can move the needle on what sort of founder YC thinks you are.

However, a closer look at their selection practices reveals a profound contradiction. Despite their public endorsement of this trait, YC often rejects applicants who demonstrate true persistence by reapplying after initial failures. In contrast, they appear to favor individuals with prestigious academic or corporate backgrounds—those who might be perceived as career opportunists lacking deep commitment to their ventures—over genuinely dedicated founders.<p>This pattern not only questions the sincerity of YC&#x27;s stated values but also suggests a broader inconsistency. If such a discrepancy exists in their evaluation of persistence, one can reasonably doubt the authenticity of other virtues YC promotes. This insight casts a shadow over the overall integrity of their selection criteria, hinting that what YC publicizes may not always align with their actual priorities.</div><br/><div id="40095256" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40095256" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dang</span><span>|</span><a href="#40091991">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40095212">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40092106">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40095256">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40095256">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Persistence is important but I don&#x27;t think anyone said it was &quot;the most reliable indicator&quot;.

If the money isn&#x27;t there in 10 seconds, the transaction times out. 
Few banks support it yet, but some do. It needs consumer-facing support. The Fed just does the back end. There&#x27;s a big security problem with consumer side payments - these are irrevocable no-holds transfers, like cash. Figure out how to handle that. Competes with Venmo and PayPal; could make them obsolete. Venmo isn&#x27;t really instant; try to withdraw the money you just &quot;received&quot;.<p>- Reading Teacher - teach illiterate kids to read with a phone app using AI. Text to speech and speech to text all work now. A true automatic reading teacher should be possible. Gamify it so kids use it. Sell to parents, not schools.<p>- Rust Game Engine - the Rust language ecosystem has some game engines and libraries that almost work, but the open source maintainers got bored and didn&#x27;t finish the job.

There’s a sort of chicken and egg problem here: you have to think of an idea first, before you build anything. &quot;Choose what people actually want&quot; begs the question.<p>It’s probably true that it’s better to work on something that you personally believe in (in the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;earnest.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;earnest.html</a> sense), because you’re more likely to find ways to grow it. It’s hard to be earnest about an idea that only interests you because it might grow at 5% per week. But pg chose Viaweb, and he couldn’t have known ahead of time that anybody would actually want it, since it was the first webapp. Nobody even understood how to try it out, since this was the era of desktop software. All he had was a hunch that lots of people would soon want websites for their businesses.<p>So which frame would you choose, if you had to decide today? Suppose you and Scott were trapped in a room, and the door unlocks only after you pick something to build together. How would you decide, other than &quot;X seems most likely to be something that people will actually want&quot;? (Which is similar to &quot;has a chance of growing at 5% per week,&quot; just phrased a little differently. pg originally thought museums would want websites; if he’d asked himself whether it might morph into an idea that could grow at 5% per week, he probably would’ve realized museums didn’t actually want that.)</div><br/><div id="40093306" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40093306" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dgfitz</span><span>|</span><a href="#40092265">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40092857">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40093152">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40093306">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40093306">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think your premise is flawed:

Thanks YC.<p>The only thing I&#x27;d say that YC is good for is their network of existing startups. Then again, startups aren&#x27;t the best customers IMO given that they die too much.<p>Advice is free on the internet as marketing material these days.

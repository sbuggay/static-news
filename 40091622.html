It makes you think hard about what it is you are trying to achieve with whatever it is your building. It&#x27;s very helpful when you come to talk with clients.<p>You know how they say launch fast, launch early? That&#x27;s part of it, because launching means talking about it to other people. Those people will have questions or objections or an incomplete understanding of pre-existing solutions. A lot of the application is about this kind of stuff.<p>Personally, I wanted to fill the application irrespective of YC. I figured, if I&#x27;m serious about building something useful, I shouldn&#x27;t just build it and que sera, sera. I should know what to focus on. And since they&#x27;ve learned a bunch about building companies, if they care about something enough to ask about it, that&#x27;s a good pointer that I should care enough about it to be able to answer it.<p>For example, I filled it in when a solution was just an idea, as if it were already built. So it made me set expectations, and clarify what I want this thing to be. Then, once it was built, the first thing that happened when that solution met with clients was this: I&#x27;d give them the short description I&#x27;ve written in the application, and they&#x27;d ask - Oh, but does it have to do just that?<p>Without the application, there wouldn&#x27;t have been the short description, without which there wouldn&#x27;t have been the useful client feedback...So, again: do it for yourself, not for the approval.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40098013" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40098013" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sebastiennight</span><span>|</span><a href="#40096457">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40092349">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40098013">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40098013">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Applied for the 3rd time (B2B AI SaaS, 300% YoY growth, $109k revenue last month).<p>Decided to take a risk with the founder video. On my first 2 applications I did what everyone does and shot 100 takes to get one &quot;right&quot;... On this one though, I shot the whole video in one take (with warts and all) and used our own software to edit it, and then used that as the demo as well[0].<p>In a way, it feels like I can&#x27;t win on this video thing<p>- if we follow instructions to &quot;not edit&quot; the founder video, the result is 100 takes for a basic video that is unworthy of a video-based startup.<p>- If we use our own tool, the video is &quot;too polished&quot; (even though it took less work to do!).<p>Hopefully the application stands on its own merits. A year ago I took the first rejection hard. I really really hate applying for stuff or having some kind of &quot;jury&quot; reviewing things when the only truth is what the market wants and whether people use what I&#x27;ve created. So as an engineer I prefer marketing to fundraising, by far.<p>If we don&#x27;t get into YC I&#x27;ll just keep bootstrapping. I see the value though, because with the right pointers we could grow way way faster. So, fingers crossed!<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.onetake.ai&#x2F;b9502ad6&#x2F;9dcd6eb6&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.onetake.ai&#x2F;b9502ad6&#x2F;9dcd6eb6&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="40099028" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40099028" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bko</span><span>|</span><a href="#40098013">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40102323">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40099028">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40099028">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Congrats on your success.<p>Why would you even want to join YC?

Why should I care if there are earlier-stage startups in there?<p>We always think that our current stage is pretty high up the mountain already (see a rough July 2022 ARR update[0] when I thought I was on top of the world) but if you zoom out, you see things with much better perspective (18 months later, the whole year of 2022 looks way less impressive[1])<p>If we&#x27;re on the road to $100MM+ in ARR, the current spot we&#x27;re at will be flattened to almost zero when you look back with perspective a few years down the line.<p>So there&#x27;s that.<p>And then, &quot;why join YC&quot;, well the answer is simple.<p>- We are growing, but we could grow so much faster. Everything is still on a shoestring budget.<p>- We have an epic roadmap and could grow the product to mind-boggling levels of awesome. YC could help us shave years off of that.<p>- Plus we finally cracked breakeven acquisition on cold traffic but we&#x27;re strapped for cash.<p>- And finally, I&#x27;ve joined several founder &quot;communities&quot; in the last few months (online and local) and those are all just a dump-your-promo Slack channel with zero added value or interaction. The local &quot;startup&quot; events are full of startup consultants on the hunt, designers, would-be employees and the like (but zero founders). So it feels a bit lonely when you&#x27;ve got a challenge which is clearly in the &quot;thousands of founders must have solved this exact same problem before, so why should I bang my head on the wall&quot; category.<p>So: advice, founder-friendly terms, a network of peers, and not having to chase investors for capital. That&#x27;s why I applied.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nuro.video&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2022&#x2F;08&#x2F;Capture-de%CC%81cran-2022-08-04-a%CC%80-06.30.40.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nuro.video&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2022&#x2F;08&#x2F;Capture-de%CC%...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;e&#x2F;2PACX-1vSEOGmySAAyvnYt3BWJrfCp4M4HkiVqVN3vqNYnCefTRb7dL2GXjOdSjMy4uZsB2JXdIl6IzPq4yGDH&#x2F;pubchart?oid=1322887853&amp;format=interactive" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;e&#x2F;2PACX-1vSEOGmySAAyv...</a></div><br/><div id="40100463" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40100463" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bko</span><span>|</span><a href="#40098013">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40100178">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40102323">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40100463">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40100463">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for answering. I misread your orig post. When you said you had 109k last month I thought that was monthly rev, which would make your arr 1.3mm. The standard offer 500k for 7% is pretty bad (5x rev multiple with x00% growth)<p>Overall the money isn’t a lot. It sounds like you’re strapped for cash. If you optimize for that you’ll likely find much better terms. The point about cohort being so many idea stage is that they focus on that and have resources geared towards those people. And the community (cohort) will be much less mature business wise. They give you the golden touch which helps for cos selling vapor ware. I think you’re beyond that and can go more traditional route to raise money.

And the things you do know, you&#x27;re just not going to have a master level of understanding of in your 20s yet nor the drive to focus on it the way it needs, especially with other social pressures at play. What is extremely high in your 20s is your ambition - your loftiness of ideas and goals and your expectations of yourself - these can land you exceptional jobs, opportunities, and get you to a great starting point, but that&#x27;s not the same as intelligence and ability.<p>For manual labor work, there&#x27;s a definite peak - college age and the years just after. But for knowledge work, math, programming, business, politics, etc. being older is almost always an asset - you get better at things, you get smarter, your networks grow, you become an adult among the children and are far more aware of timing and can predict and speak on things with more accuracy. You simply know more.<p>Besides that, I don&#x27;t think raw intelligence is selection criteria for a good founder anyway.

Service offered &#x2F; payment received is irreplaceably wholesome and satisfying :) especially when they come back as repeat customers or become regular clients. Repeat business and gradual growth gives us both an exciting feeling about the future that I never quite felt at a startup. I&#x27;ve found too often a venture-backed startup is really a lifestyle business in disguise for the founders, not really about serving customers, so it&#x27;s hard to truly get excited about them anymore. Where running a business that solves a problem for paying customers feels more like changing the world:<p>&gt; we&#x27;re making a difference in their lives, and they in turn pay us money<p>We&#x27;ve felt this too in our community, it&#x27;s the real meaning of &quot;Make something people want&quot; (and why we haven&#x27;t had a day off in like 62 days or something lol). It&#x27;s strange to refer to our business as a &quot;startup&quot;, but it is one, moreso than most VC-funded ones and I bet we have more customers, higher revenues, and a better growth outlook than the average local seed-funded startup. For us, a loan or VC route would just let us expand nationally right now to other major cities, instead of focusing first on the Bay Area and expanding nationally over the next several years which feels inevitable.<p>The amount a VC might pressure us to go in the wrong direction is another worry, and because it&#x27;s just capital we&#x27;d need (not advice), they might just get in the way and throw off timing or team structure.<p>Thanks for your comment!

Sure, we all want that, but we&#x27;re also all predisposed to irrationally believe that we&#x27;re the exception.

If anything, I think they&#x27;re quite a bit better about avoiding that elitism than the average you&#x27;ll find among organizations of comparable wealth and power (compare top law firms, leadership of more traditional companies, politicians, etc). This isn&#x27;t my strongest opinion - I&#x27;ve never done any proper formal study of the question - but your impressions contradict my own experience living in that world.<p>I used to be part of the leadership team for a YC company. Here&#x27;s where the four YC founders I know off the top of my head went to school: SUNY, Oxford, Epitech, Tufts. Only Oxford among those is truly elite, though the other three are good schools. The one who went to Oxford (Harj Taggar) is a bit of an odd one out here, since they were a partner with YC itself first before founding the company that I know them from. Granted, three of these were founders many years ago, so perhaps this has changed, but one (the Tufts alum) got funding only about a year ago.<p>I looked up a few other founders that are second- or third-degree connections and found the same: a handful of truly elite schools, a peak in A-tier-but-not-truly-elite schools, and a handful of no-name schools like my own alma mater. I expect that that&#x27;s a reasonably representative distribution of where you find extremely smart people, and especially smart+motivated ones.<p>As for this bit:<p>&gt;&gt; And often those who did get in went to Stanford, Harvard, etc. and don&#x27;t even have a product - sometimes they don&#x27;t even know what they&#x27;re going to build yet.<p>YC is pretty explicit that they try to pick founders, not ideas, most of the time.

So is Growth Equity or even private equity —- but different from “venture”. It sounds like you’re past the “venture” stage anyway.<p>We’re paying about ~9% interest on a multi-million credit facility now from a bank (several other banks will do this type of lending - not just SVB I also learned along the way recently). There is also minimal warrant coverage provided of 1-1.5% equity which we are happy with.<p>Some names of banks who are lending - just a few names but wanted to share some ideas as alternatives to venture capital, especially if you have revenue:<p>* Texas Capital Bank

Not enough people applied?<p>Here&#x27;s the last batch.[1] Gives a sense of what&#x27;s being funded.<p>Ideas:<p>- MoneyNow - leverages the new FedNow instant payment system. FedNow is run by the Fed and transfers money in seconds with a charge of just US$0.045 per transaction. And they mean <i>seconds</i>. If the money isn&#x27;t there in 10 seconds, the transaction times out. 
Few banks support it yet, but some do. It needs consumer-facing support. The Fed just does the back end. There&#x27;s a big security problem with consumer side payments - these are irrevocable no-holds transfers, like cash. Figure out how to handle that. Competes with Venmo and PayPal; could make them obsolete. Venmo isn&#x27;t really instant; try to withdraw the money you just &quot;received&quot;.<p>- Reading Teacher - teach illiterate kids to read with a phone app using AI. Text to speech and speech to text all work now. A true automatic reading teacher should be possible. Gamify it so kids use it. Sell to parents, not schools.<p>- Rust Game Engine - the Rust language ecosystem has some game engines and libraries that almost work, but the open source maintainers got bored and didn&#x27;t finish the job. Modest amounts of cash would push that over the top.

(One of my neat memories as a 19yo is getting a thoughtful email from pg saying we almost made it to the interview with an idea that was essentially “blackboard sucks; make better school software,&quot; but the biggest factors against us were my age and the fact that selling to schools was about as hard as selling to governments back in 2008.)</div><br/><div id="40092530" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40092530" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Animats</span><span>|</span><a href="#40092265">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40092430">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40092389">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40092530">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40092530">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I know that.

There’s a sort of chicken and egg problem here: you have to think of an idea first, before you build anything. &quot;Choose what people actually want&quot; begs the question.<p>It’s probably true that it’s better to work on something that you personally believe in (in the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;earnest.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;earnest.html</a> sense), because you’re more likely to find ways to grow it. It’s hard to be earnest about an idea that only interests you because it might grow at 5% per week. But pg chose Viaweb, and he couldn’t have known ahead of time that anybody would actually want it, since it was the first webapp. Nobody even understood how to try it out, since this was the era of desktop software. All he had was a hunch that lots of people would soon want websites for their businesses.<p>So which frame would you choose, if you had to decide today? Suppose you and Scott were trapped in a room, and the door unlocks only after you pick something to build together. How would you decide, other than &quot;X seems most likely to be something that people will actually want&quot;? (Which is similar to &quot;has a chance of growing at 5% per week,&quot; just phrased a little differently. pg originally thought museums would want websites; if he’d asked himself whether it might morph into an idea that could grow at 5% per week, he probably would’ve realized museums didn’t actually want that.)</div><br/><div id="40093306" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40093306" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dgfitz</span><span>|</span><a href="#40092265">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40092857">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40093152">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40093306">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40093306">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think your premise is flawed:

I have always gotten rejected, and while that was disappointing, I 100% understood that getting into YC was the exception rather than the rule, as YC had a smaller acceptance percentage than Harvard.<p>After a few batches of these rejections, I decided to take a break from applying and instead build up my startup experience more by working at growth-stage startups, and just in general started focusing on my career as well.<p>Fast forward a few years, and about a year ago YC reaches out to me (via automated email) saying they had identified me as being in the top X% on the Cofounder matching platform, and encouraged me to apply to their next batch cycle.<p>I was reluctant to do so -- I hadn&#x27;t been thinking too deeply about any new startup ideas in the past few months (so I&#x27;d most likely have to apply with a previous startup I had built), but after encouragement from friends and family I decided to take a chance anyways and apply once again.<p>I went all out on the application -- I reached out to some YC friends and mentors to get their recommendations, and had them help me edit and perfect my application as well. I even traveled for a month to San Francisco, just so I could absorb more of the ecosystem,  network with as many entrepreneurs as possible, and help give back to the community if I could.<p>I submitted my application, waited for the fateful &quot;interview email&quot; day, and when that day came -- I got the standard &quot;...we&#x27;re sorry, we&#x27;re not going to move forward with your application&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ll admit -- getting that email stung.

When people are focused on building, they need feedback from the market. That rejection&#x2F;feedback helps, but any other kind of rejection - especially a VC or investor rejection - hurts. You could argue that founders should be used to rejection, still this is a needless rejection - without any specific feedback and from a group not their TG - not something people should spend their energy on. You apply, there is hope, then there is a rejection (given the acceptance rate highly likely), then you see the kind of companies that got in, and it becomes a distraction. That&#x27;s human nature. You can correct something when a prospect says they do not want your product and understand the reasons, but how do you correct anything when a popular investor passes on and says &quot;they could be wrong&quot;? Yes, &quot;keep building&quot;, which they were already doing with more enthusiasm and less distraction before the whole bandwagon of YC alums came along.<p>You could argue that &quot;filling the application gives clarity to a founder&quot;. Again genius marketing. That comes at an opportunity cost of talking to their leads, their prospects. At any rate, it takes you away from what you originally set out to do. You get more clarity from talking to your target market than filling an application.<p>Another thing is &quot;people got in applying on a whim&quot;. Yes, those are exceptions. But, any average founder understands that if the decision is likely to be determined by what they write in the application and their application video (and several factors outside of their control), they will optimize it to the max. The videos you see are always multiple takes. The applications are always pruned and reviewed and rewritten before submitting.<p>When your goal is getting into YC, all this is worth doing. When the goal is building and growing a product, such advice, no matter how well intended, hurts more than helps the founders. It&#x27;s okay if YC picks 200 startups out of 15000 instead of 20000.</div><br/><div id="40099027" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40099027" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tptacek</span><span>|</span><a href="#40096302">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40099458">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40099027">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40099027">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is all a just-so story.

PG himself says so [1]<p>When you are building and selling a product, shifting your focus to fundraising in the middle (and not committing to it) is stupidity and would leave you to neither be able to build&#x2F;sell well or fundraise well. It&#x27;s a mindset shift, and one of PG&#x27;s essays talk about that too.<p>Problem is not with rejection. Rejection from the customers is what motivates people. I am not motivated by &quot;wanting to show others they are wrong&quot;, but by solving a problem, creating value, and impacting people. What you wrote is a weak justification for the time you spent on application - that could have spent on building product or a sales pitch.<p>Again, my point is not rejection but distraction.

Most entrepreneurs know when they are fundable.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;fr.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;fr.html</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40096464" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40096464" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">practal</span><span>|</span><a href="#40096302">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40099458">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40093034">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40096464">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40096464">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think applying to YC should be seen as fund raising activity. And pg&#x27;s essays clearly state that fund raising is a distraction, so when you do that, just focus on it, and get it over with, so you can continue building.<p>I must have applied at least 4 times now with Practal in various forms (at some point it was a different project called ProofPeer), got a rejection each time. The idea has been developed further each time, but in ways hard to communicate to a VC (or anyone, really). Reading this announcement I now have a choice: prepare another YC application in the next 2 days, or finish chapter 2 of my book about the logic used in Practal instead [1]. I think the choice is obvious, there is indeed such a thing as applying too early. I mean, I am not going to pivot to something else, there is no idea other than Practal I will ever be interested in. Working on anything else feels like a waste of my time. Hopefully I have something to show for when the winter batch comes around.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;abstractionlogic.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;abstractionlogic.com</a></div><br/><div id="40096780" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40096780" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ankit219</span><span>|</span><a href="#40096302">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40096464">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40093034">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40096780">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40096780">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One of PG&#x27;s blogs talk about being fundable.

I think it&#x27;s the same thing with YC. There is an investor who says they like it as early as possible, but fundamentally you know if you are investible.

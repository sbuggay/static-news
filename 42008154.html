Supposedly they only stored 1.2MB but I recall seeing 2.X MB models for sale at boeing surplus in the mid 1990s and feeling like that was a much more economical option than 1.44mb 3.5&quot; disks. The whole world ran on 1.44mb as a hard limit on how large files could be. Any larger, and you could not transfer them -- email wasn&#x27;t an option yet, and serial transfer between two computers was damn near impossible. Having an 8 inch disk with 2mb would allow much better images and longer multimedia documents to be transfered.<p>Alas, I could not convince my dad to shell out $45 for the 2.X MB 8&quot; floppy drive, so I leaned on the 3x sony 1.44mb HDD I was given sometime in early elementary school all the way through middle school.<p>2.88mb would have been an absolute luxury.

Someone with more time than me will find PDF scans of them and can verify. 1.44mb HD 3.5&quot; disks were totally the norm as our elementary and middle schools were flush with Apple LCII and LCIII (LC meaning &quot;low cost&quot;) computers of the era. If you were going to play Bolo, you needed your own 1.44mb disk to keep a copy of it to use at the computer lab.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42049171" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42049171" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">raverbashing</span><span>|</span><a href="#42048851">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42049171">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42049171">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s amazing (in a bad way) how storage sucked in the 90s, early 2000s<p>Floppy technology sucked even back then.

&gt;Floppy technology sucked even back then.<p>No, not &quot;even&quot;: floppy technology sucked <i>in the 90s</i>, but it absolutely did NOT suck in the 80s.  Floppies were extremely, even ridiculously reliable back in the 80s, and into the early 90s.  They totally went to shit in the mid-to-late 90s because the quality of both the media and the drives went down the toilet.</div><br/><div id="42049428" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42049428" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Tor3</span><span>|</span><a href="#42049171">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42049267">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42049476">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42049428">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42049428">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Absolutely agree. Source: I&#x27;ve read (in the last decade) tons of old floppies from (mostly) the late eighties. The recovery rate for 5.25&quot; DD and HD floppies were nearly 100%. I had only a couple of floppies with issues (though it must be said that I know people who have had more problems, but that is always about Really Bad Storage Conditions).<p>But, as I&#x27;ve mentioned before in other threads, this does not translate to 3.5&quot; floppies. Or at least not to HD 3.5&quot; floppies. Even though mine were stored in the same conditions as the 5.25&quot; and 8&quot; floppies, the success rate was really low, and mostly non-existent for &quot;HD&quot; 3.5&quot; floppies (the so-called 1.44MB floppies). The 720KB ones fared much better, but never as good as the older 5.25&quot; ones. Of course that also when the nineties arrived, but more than that - the HD 3.5&quot; floppies stretched the density too high for the medium, according to Chuck(G) and others with more understanding of the physical medium than myself. In any case my experience supports that claim.<p>So, the title of this thread is &quot;Triple Density Floppy, Anyone?&quot;
Well, obviously I have no belief in the feasibility of trying even higher density than what existed, with the problems already apparent with the existent densities (mind, the 5.25&quot; ones didn&#x27;t exceed what was possible).<p>As for other media.. CD-R used to fail reading for me after a year in storage. I quickly stopped using that as any kind of backup. And we all know about flash-based storage.. or at least I hope we all know. They&#x27;re just like very slowly leaking capacitors. Spinning rust or spinning floppy media or even tape retains data for much longer (yes I have tons of CCTs which are <i>also</i> still readable, from back to the beginning of the eighties)</div><br/><div id="42049478" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42049478" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shiroiushi</span><span>|</span><a href="#42049171">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42049428">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42049476">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42049478">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42049478">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I used lots of 1.44MB floppies in the early 90s and generally had few, if any problems, as I recall.

But this article is missing the context about _why_ the Patent Office claims to think this is necessary in the first place. Patent trolls of a sort are setting up shop on the other side of where you would normally expect them in litigation, attempting to use the Inter Partes Review process in ways that look very much like an abuse of the system. For example, one company opened an IPR against a valuable patent and then offered to withdraw it for money. It was rightly called out as a shakedown.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jdsupra.com&#x2F;legalnews&#x2F;director-vidal-removes-opensky-and-pqa-1476016&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jdsupra.com&#x2F;legalnews&#x2F;director-vidal-removes-ope...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.bloomberglaw.com&#x2F;ip-law&#x2F;opensky-abuse-sanctions-add-new-weapons-in-patent-challenges" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.bloomberglaw.com&#x2F;ip-law&#x2F;opensky-abuse-sanctions...</a><p>The US legal system generally requires parties to have standing before they can make use of courts or pseudo-courts like the PTAB. Situations like this make it clear why: when lots of money is on the line people will try to “hack” the system in ways that its designers didn’t expect. Uniquely open processes like IPR are vulnerable to exploitation in a way that is annoying to lawyers compared with what they’re used to, so they reflexively reach to reimpose standing requirements. That’s basically what is being proposed here.<p>Again, the above doesn’t mean I think this rule change should go forward: the IPR process and its openness are incredibly valuable and should be retained.  but it’s misleading to portray this proposed rule as arbitrary or corrupt.</div><br/><div id="36307172" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36307172" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nikitaga</span><span>|</span><a href="#36301611">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36301993">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36307172">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36307172">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; But this article is missing the context about _why_ the Patent Office claims to think this is necessary in the first place.<p>Their claimed rationale for these changes is simply dishonest.

From the source:<p>&gt; Petitions challenging under-resourced patent owner patents where the patentee has or is attempting to bring products to market;<p>So I’d say the good faith argument is that it’s designed to protect larger orgs from bullying actual inventors&#x2F;startups by attempting to threaten the legitimacy of their patents. The bit about bringing products to market is supposed to exclude trolls. More from the source:<p>&gt; Such limited resources may impact the perceived fairness of post-grant reviews. For example, some stakeholders in response to the RFC expressed concern that under-resourced inventors are unable to afford the costs involved in defending patents in post-grant review. Some stakeholders advocating for small businesses and individual inventors urged the Office to take into account the financial resources of a patent owner, and to limit reviews of patents owned by under-resourced entities who lack funding to defend challenges to their patents but who have sought to bring their inventions to market either themselves or through a licensee.<p>So yeah basically the argument is that defending themselves in this proceeds is too onerous for small entities.<p>So I think that’s the good faith argument.

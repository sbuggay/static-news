Today&#x27;s young artists might be lucky to hit 1, and maybe the internet helps with 3 a bit, but if you work in an art form that really, really needs in person connection (eg theater, or you need to be where the gallerists and dealers are), I guess it doesnt solve the problem. 2 is very difficult.<p>The perfect trifecta is when you have a dense urban center that happens to be the center of your art form, but still has enough of a rough edge to it that you can live and work cheaply. New York, 1970s, classical music. 
Berlin, visual arts, 2000s. Or you can create the scene yourself given enough mass and energy (see: Atlanta, 1990s, rap, or NYC, 1980s, hip hop).<p>The next Glass is therefore more likely working in an urban coffee shop than a suburban landscaping crew, living with roomies or parents rather than alone, has no children or spouse to support, and exists on the fringes of a city like London, NY, or Berlin.</div><br/><div id="41280431" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41280431" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">creer</span><span>|</span><a href="#41278727">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41279713">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41280431">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41280431">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What do you mean?

The text for <i>Barstow</i> is graffiti that he saw scrawled on highway railings during that time. It&#x27;s featured in most music history books that cover the 20th century.

And if you liked the recent HN article on just intonation, well... let&#x27;s just say you&#x27;re gonna love Harry Partch!<p>There&#x27;s also Conlon Nancarrow, who got pissed at the U.S. harrassing him when he got back from fighting the fascists in the Spanish Civil War. He moved to Mexico City and hand-punched player piano rolls in seclusion, for decades.<p>Other composers and musicians made pilgrimages to his studio, just to hear what it sounds like when, say, a 12-voice canon has each voice moving at different tempo.[1]<p>Nancarrow received the MacArthur fellowship back in 1982. At one point there was a piano duo who taught themselves to play a selection of his pieces as a four-hands duet for one piano.<p>People who care about music <i>will</i> find interesting musicians, no matter where they live. This goes back at least to J.S. Bach, who reportedly walking hundreds of miles to listen to Buxtehude improvise at the organ.<p>1: and what are the proportions for the voices of that canon?

Are they, in fact, comparable in any meaningful way?<p>It seems an odd approach. The initial premises seem to illuminate the person who selects them, rather than illuminating any societal issue. What can we learn from your selection, other than that you seem to feel an affinity towards those with inherited wealth?<p>There is of course one apparent distinction between inherited wealth and inherited ability, be it musical or sporting or intelligence or what have you.

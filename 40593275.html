I spent <i>years</i> with an AMD card growing progressively more annoyed at their self-inflicted apparent inability to multiply matrices on demand. Nvidia had nothing to do with their failure, unless they had some sort of high-level mole in AMD&#x27;s driver teams.<p>Hitting the only successful company in a difficult field with legal assaults is not the obvious path to success. Nvidia has nothing close to a monopoly; there is no moat and they operate in a commodity space that will behave like a normal competitive market. It just happens that their competitors were wall-to-wall complacent about how quickly the hardware world can change and they stupidly thought graphics cards were for displaying graphics. It turns out graphics cards are for building AI and crypto markets.</div><br/><div id="40593750" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40593750" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vlovich123</span><span>|</span><a href="#40593519">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40595073">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40593750">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40593750">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The thing with monopoly laws is it doesn’t matter how you got into pole position. The point is that you’re illegally utilizing tangential benefits of the pole position to maintain that position as well as enter new markets.<p>&gt; including how the company’s software locks customers into using its chips, as well as how Nvidia distributes those chips to customers.<p>The lock-in is probably a losing argument on technical merits unless NVIDIA is doing something nefarious there (which the lawsuit will potentially reveal). If nVidia is distributing chips in preferred ways to partners it wants to succeed (e.g. those partnered with MSFT which it has a very cozy and tight-knit relationship), that could be an anti trust thing.<p>&gt; Microsoft structured its minority stake in OpenAI in part to avoid antitrust scrutiny, The Times has reported. Microsoft also reached a deal in March to hire most of the staff of Inflection AI, another A.I. start-up, and license its technology. Because the deal was not a standard acquisition, it may be harder for regulators to scrutinize.<p>So there is an argument to be made that MSFT is acutely self-aware its behavior could be viewed as engaging in antitrust. If there’s a law against structuring financial transactions, why isn’t similar behavior in the business world viewed similarly as trying to bypass the spirit of the law?</div><br/><div id="40593958" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40593958" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">roenxi</span><span>|</span><a href="#40593519">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40593750">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40595073">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40593958">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40593958">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just on that last paragraph, because the frame annoys me - that is bullying.

It&#x27;s not relevant for courts, regulators, people or companies, who are all tasked with following the law as actually written. For those people there is no &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;true law&quot;.<p>The reason this is important is it&#x27;s a sword that cuts both ways. It&#x27;s always tempting to argue that whatever you&#x27;d personally like to happen is what politicians <i>really</i> intended, and any gap between reality and their preferred outcome is therefore a &quot;loophole&quot;. But once you get into saying people should follow intent, not written law, others can easily argue that politicians never intended the law to be interpreted like <i>that</i> against <i>them</i>, and so therefore they are morally justified in ignoring it. It can be used against you as easily as you can use it against them.<p>A common example of this problem is income vs capital gains taxes. One ideological tribe is very fond of arguing that people who have income mostly from investments rather than wages are exploiting a &quot;loophole&quot; in tax law, but of course the reason there are different rates to begin with is exactly because politicians wanted to encourage investment. There&#x27;s plenty of cases where this intent is discussed in written literature and there&#x27;s no other reason to distinguish between income sources then set differing rates. There is no &quot;loophole&quot; and nor is the &quot;spirit&quot; of the law being violated. But you hear such claims all the time.<p>The other reason it&#x27;s problematic is because you can&#x27;t really know what the intent of lawmakers was. The law was their best collective effort at writing down what they wanted, as a result of numerous compromises and disagreements between different people. If they didn&#x27;t write it down properly or the resulting compromise was a mess, that&#x27;s on them, but a working legal system doesn&#x27;t allow people to just blow off their written instructions and assume they know what was <i>really</i> meant.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40594350" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40594350" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vlovich123</span><span>|</span><a href="#40593519">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40593958">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594033">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594110">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40594350">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40594350">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a confusing argument to me. Are you saying that structuring and smurfing should then be legal? All structuring and smurfing is is an attempt to make sure that financial transactions stay below the statutory reporting threshold.<p>Also, I think you’re conflating my statement which was meant to be prescriptive with a descriptive statement. I’m saying if structuring and smurfing are illegal in a financial context, MSFT doing so to skirt antitrust laws should be similarly illegal - if the laws don’t prohibit it, the laws should be updated. But I’m not a lawyer so it’s possible laws already prohibit it or MSFT violated some laws. Commenting in either direction on an information free article isn’t wise.<p>As for the spirit of the law vs letter of the law, that’s an ongoing debate as old as history. It’s personally weird to me to encounter letter of the law people given that the spirit of the law has a much richer history behind it to my view and seems more defensible. Some amount of rule lawyering is required, but violating the spirit of the law is a more robust legal principle that can withhold participants trying to find creative workarounds around the spirit of the law.</div><br/><div id="40594432" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40594432" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">roenxi</span><span>|</span><a href="#40593519">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594350">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594110">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40594432">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40594432">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ah I see, I was in two minds about including the quote but decided against it.

Even if you could run CUDA code on AMD, it would be slow, so you need to do a rewrite anyways.</div><br/><div id="40594819" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40594819" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">skocznymroczny</span><span>|</span><a href="#40593519">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594180">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594655">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40594819">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40594819">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t know specifically about OpenCL, but the big thing about CUDA is that it&#x27;s supported across operating systems and across the whole spectrum of NVidia GPUs. AMD has ROCm, but they have to be dragged kicking and screaming to support any of the consumer grade GPUs. ROCm is still pretty much Linux only, with limited support on Windows and only the high-end consumer offerings (7900XT and 7900XTX) are officially supported for ROCm. Because they want to push compute users (and AI users) into workstation grade GPUs. In comparison, CUDA is usable and supported even on mid range NVidia GPUs such as RTX 3060. And most of the software around things like AI is done by enthusiasts with gaming PCs, so they write their software for the interface that supports them.<p>I have an AMD card that I try to use for AI stuff and it&#x27;s an uphill battle. The most popular workloads such as Stable Diffusion or Llama more or less work. But as soon as you go into other, less mainstream workloads it starts to fall apart. Projects install CUDA versions of torch by default. To make them work you have to uninstall them manually and install the ROCM versions of torch. Then it turns out some Python dependency also uses CUDA, so you also have to find a ROCM fork for that dependency. Then there&#x27;s some other dependency which only has a CUDA and CPU version and you&#x27;re stuck.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40594655" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40594655" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">roenxi</span><span>|</span><a href="#40593519">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594180">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594819">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594859">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40594655">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40594655">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There probably isn&#x27;t anything in CUDA that makes it special. They are well optimised math libraries and the math for most of the important stuff is somewhat trivial. AI seems to be &gt;80% matrix multiplication - well optimised BLAS is tricky to implement, but even a bad implementation would see all the major libraries support AMD.<p>The vendor &quot;lock in&quot; is because it takes a few years for decisions to be expressed in marketable silicon and literally only Nvidia was trying to be in the market 5 years ago. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of AMD cards that just crashed when used for anything outside OpenGL. I had a bunch of AI related projects die back in 2019 because initialising OpenCL crashed the drivers. If you believe the official docs everything would work fine. Great card except for the fact that compute didn&#x27;t work.<p>At the time I thought it was maybe just me. After seeing geohotz&#x27;s saga trying to make tinygrad work on AMD cards and having a feel for how badly unsupported AMD hardware is by the machine learning community, it makes a lot of sense to me that it is a systemic issue and AMD didn&#x27;t have any corporate sense of urgency about fixing those problems.<p>Maybe there is something magic in CUDA, but if there is it is probably either their memory management model or something quite technical like that.

That&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s nothing to do with Anti-trust. Are they charging a premium for scarce products now? Sure, but all you can do is damage the market by attacking them there&#x27;s no real way to increase demand.

You&#x27;ve got this behemoth that has basically just decided to take it&#x27;s magic money tree and use it essentially buy growth through a huge number of complex deals that are designed to circumnavigate anti-trust.

  In April 1954, the House authorized the Reece Committee. Unlike its predecessor, which limited its attention to generalities, the Reece Committee mounted a comprehensive inquiry into both the motives for establishing foundations and their influence on public life.

Is &quot;philanthropy&quot; even a kindness, or is it a form of social engineering to create potential new markets for their investments?<p>I personally find the whole world of philanthropy rather revolting.  Some unscrupulous rich folk, now want to be lauded and perceived as &quot;kind&quot;, only that kindness comes with lots of very specific strings attached.  Its not kind or helpful to manipulate others as you have access to levers of power that they don&#x27;t, to them determine what is taught in schools, or what is acceptable medicine, etc.  I&#x27;d rather they built a pyramid or monument to themselves, and keep out of micro-managing the world and everyone in it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39923897" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39923897" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">readthenotes1</span><span>|</span><a href="#39927427">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39926910">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39923897">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39923897">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For the take home of the current Powerball lottery, one could take over Haiti or any number of small troubled countries.<p>You have to be really rich to think about eradicating a disease though...</div><br/><div id="39924292" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39924292" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ThinkBeat</span><span>|</span><a href="#39923897">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39926910">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39924292">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39924292">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That would be a most temporary ownership I should think.

But what is the counterpoint? Companies like Apple and spaceX are just inevitable and some lucky bastards will just stumble upon them? That’s nonsense. There might be more than one candidate to become Steve Jobs but not that many.<p>Would e-commerce have evolved without JeffB or smartphones be invented without Apple? Probably, but it might have taken longer, or they might have been invented in another country, greatly hurting America’s prospects. To this date Amazon has the best e-commerce logistics on the planet.<p>Doing things ahead of its time, by gathering the right people and enough money, is a very unique skill. Couple that with being well positioned for a certain “inevitable” innovation and that limits the number of people even more.<p>There’s also a compounding effect. Walking backwards from humanity’s global tech maxima, if every key innovation was late by a few years, the overall maxima might be late by hundreds of years, maybe worse.

They&#x27;re basically there to give VCs a figure head they can point to and claim some new effort to financialize and monopolize another part of our economy is backed by some brilliant ass hole they found somewhere who started this thing in their garage. There have of course been very intelligent and hard working founders, but imo whether your startup succeeds has much more to do with product market fit and timing than it does with the quality of the founder.

Product market fit is hard to come by but is relatively easy to recognize. This is the role of VCs. You try to argue that founders are interchangeable but I don’t see it. If anything, VCs are more interchangeable.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37117527" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37117527" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">flimsypremise</span><span>|</span><a href="#37117490">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37117800">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37117563">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37117527">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37117527">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hah, came here to post basically this.

Basically, that everyone is born tabula rasa and can do anything they want to.  Everyone is 100% replaceable by anyone else, thus all people should be paid the same and all work is of equal value.  The only thing that gets in the way of this beautiful platonic ideal is systemic bias in institutions.  The cure for this is to create systemic bias, but for everyone who is not doing well so everyone winds up with equal everything like they should in the tabula rasa ideal world. Thus, law and fairness are all illusions and the only thing that matters is outcomes that must be equalized by force by some vanguard of the people.<p>This outlook justifies everything that is going on in San Francisco right now of course.  Criminals, the criminally insane, and people high on drugs could be billionaire tech bros if it wasn&#x27;t for systemic bias, therefore we must equalize the situation by letting them steal whatever they want, and do whatever drugs they want, wherever they want and pardon them for their violent outbursts whenever their psychosis calls on them to do so as all of this is the fault of systemic bias that must be countered.</div><br/><div id="37118887" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37118887" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seanhunter</span><span>|</span><a href="#37117679">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37118013">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37118887">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37118887">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s a very nice straw man you&#x27;ve built there and I have to admire the way you&#x27;ve managed to wedge in some devisive culture war rhetoric as well.<p>Whatever you think about San Francisco isn&#x27;t anything to do with this topic.

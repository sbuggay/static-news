Shockley wasn’t pleased that to have learned of the discovery over the phone, and he was even less pleased that he was left off the patent application. Nevertheless, he continued his own work which resulted in his invention of the junction transistor. The patent was filed on the 26th of June in 1948, and the first proof of principle was obtained on the 7th of April in 1949. This time around, Shockley immediately published his findings in the Bell Labs Technical Journal.<p>In <i>The Idea Factory</i> this chain of events is described a little differently. Maybe the author wants to cast Shockley in a bad light, but this is the timeline it lays out:<p>1. Bardeen and Brattain invent the point contact transistor.<p>2. Shockley spends a night in a hotel room inventing the much better junction transistor as an evolution on the point contact transistor, out of spite of being excluded.<p>3. Shockley keeps this invention secret, in contrast to typical Bell Labs protocol.<p>4. At a meeting, a group at Bell Labs is close to stumbling onto the invention of the junction transistor as part of solving issues with the point contact transistor.<p>5. Shockley was in that meeting and whips out his schematics for the junction transistor to retain credit for its invention.<p>Implied is that anyone at Bell Labs could have invented it, given some time. Only Shockley could have done it during a hotel room night, some time before people even realised it was needed.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42506364" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42506364" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">joshu</span><span>|</span><a href="#42507401">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42506753">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42506364">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42506364">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">i am waiting for pizza maybe 300 feet from the original site of shockley semiconductors as i type this.</div><br/><div id="42506771" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42506771" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Tempest1981</span><span>|</span><a href="#42506364">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42506753">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42506771">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42506771">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Who is the current occupant of the site?

For example, it applies to Arnold Schwarzenegger since his father apparently mentally and physically abused Arnold[1], as well as for Elon Musk’s father for whom it is well documented he is a piece of work. If you read a lot about founders then this is a recurring theme. Why else would you work like a maniac your whole life? You don’t need a successful company to have a happy life.<p>There have also been studies that people tend to leash out to people below them if they feel that someone above them leashes out on them. This “displacement behavior” is a form of stress relieve. Monkeys do it too, and also there it is a form of stress relieve. It sort of makes sense right? You feel shit so then the easy solution is just to tell someone else that he&#x2F;she is shit. You feel a bit better about yourself and all is good. Apart from the poor person (or monkey) who receives the abuse.<p>So on the one hand, we want great men who produce good times, who solve difficult problems (Elon) or who inspire people (Arnold). But on the other hand I wish no child to have a tough childhood like that. That’s life I guess.<p>One thing about Shockley. The blog mentions Shockley’s funeral. What the blog doesn’t mention is why there was no funeral. His wife thought nobody would come anyway so decided to not hold the ceremony. A sad ending. I wonder how his parents were and what would have become of him if things would have been a bit different. Maybe he would have been smart and emphatic?<p>[1]: Although many people don’t know this, Arnold can be very ruthless.

If for example a person loses a job, that could be a fluke; that could be due to anything. I would draw next to no conclusions from a person losing a job one time. But if we can see their whole career at a glance, and notice that person was fired 15 times in 40 years, that&#x27;s a pattern. We can say that&#x27;s out of the ordinary, that doesn&#x27;t happen to the average working person. The record speaks for itself: this person must have had some quality that made his employers want to fire him.<p>Shockley was like this. Repeatedly in his life we see this pattern of people scrambling to get away from working with, or under, him. It&#x27;s unusual for people to dislike someone that much: that&#x27;s not common. If it was one anonymous guy over his whole career lodging a complaint, we might ignore it. But so many people voted to not be around Shockley, with their feet and with their employment. That&#x27;s not common for a scientist, Democrat, Republican, entrepreneur, or anyone really: there must have been some unpleasant quality about Shockley that made people not want to be around him, as this pattern repeated over his whole life shows.</div><br/><div id="42506543" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42506543" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mlinhares</span><span>|</span><a href="#42505990">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42506311">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42506510">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42506543">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42506543">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">He wasn&#x27;t good at the abusive boss dynamic I think, there&#x27;s plenty of terrible bosses and terrible tech companies out there that continue to chew up workers and some even come back, because the abusive dynamics are very well done.

His invention of the Shockley diode was not very important, because the PNPN switch had already been invented at Bell Labs 3 years earlier, in 1952, by Jewell J. Ebers. The innovation of Shockley was only to notice that a PNPN switch does not need control electrodes to be switched on, because it can be switched on by either the output voltage or by light, therefore it can be made as a diode instead of a tetrode, like previously.<p>More important has been that Shockley has invented not only the bipolar junction transistor (BJT) in 1948, but also the junction field-effect transistor (JFET) in 1951. For many decades these 2 have been the most important semiconductor devices, until the technology has progressed sufficiently to allow the control of the oxide-silicon interface well enough to allow the fabrication of MOS transistors (which had been invented well before WWII, but nobody knew how to make them).<p>Even more important is that he has published detailed theories about how the BJTs and the JFETs function, which allowed anyone to design such semiconductor devices.<p>These theories of the semiconductor transistors conceived by Shockley have been what has really started the semiconductor industry. The previous discovery of the point-contact transistor by Bardeen and Brattain has been more or less accidental and they did not understand how it works. Without the theory of Shockley none of the quick progresses from the years following 1948 would have existed.</div><br/><div id="42505508" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42505508" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BirAdam</span><span>|</span><a href="#42505474">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42505402">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42505508">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42505508">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It does note his achievements, but had the man had any charisma at all, Silicon Valley might not have been.

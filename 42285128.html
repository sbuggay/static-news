Regardless, I think the ISPD authors owe the Nature authors an even more rigorous study that addresses all their criticisms. Even if they just try to evaluate the pre-trained checkpoint that Google published, that would be a useful piece of data to add to the debate.</div><br/><div id="42286713" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42286713" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nemonemo</span><span>|</span><a href="#42285810">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42286298">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42286713">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42286713">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In the conclusion of the article, you said: &quot;While I concede that there are things the ISPD authors could have done better, their conclusion is still sound.

To me, this point alone seems sufficient to question the validity of the ISPD work&#x27;s conclusions. What are your thoughts on this?<p>I believe this is a fair criticism, and it could be a reason why the ISPD Tensorboard shows divergence during training for some RTL designs. The ISPD authors provide their own justification for their substitution of training time for compute resources in page 11 of their paper (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2302.11014" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2302.11014</a>).<p>I do not think it changes the ISPD work&#x27;s conclusions however since they demonstrate that CMP and AutoDMP outperform CT wrt QoR and runtime even though they use much fewer compute resources. If more compute resources are used and CT becomes competitive wrt QoR, then it will still lag behind in runtime. Furthermore, Google has not produced evidence that AlphaChip, with their substantial compute resources, outperforms commercial placers (or even AutoDMP). In the recent rebuttal from Google (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2411.10053" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2411.10053</a>), the only claim on page 8 says Google VLSI engineers preferred RL over humans and commercial placers on a blind study conducted in 2020. Commercial mixed placers, if configured correctly, have become very good over the past 4 years, so perhaps another blind study is warranted.<p>&gt; Additionally, I noticed that the neutral tone of this comment is quite a departure from the strongly critical tone of your article<p>I will openly admit my bias is against the AlphaChip work. I referred to the Nature authors as &#x27;arrogant&#x27; and &#x27;disdainful&#x27; with respect to their statement that EDA CAD engineers are just being bitter ML-haters when they criticize the AlphaChip work. I referred to Jeff Dean as &#x27;belittling&#x27; and &#x27;hostile&#x27; and using &#x27;hyperbole&#x27; with respect to his statements against Igor Markov, which I think is unbecoming of him.

The only obfuscation is with the proprietary GF12 technology, where they can&#x27;t provide absolute numbers, but only relative ones. Comparison against commercial tools is actually a common practice in academic EDA CAD papers, although usually the exact tool vendor is obfuscated. CAD tool vendors have actually gotten more permissive about sharing tool data and scripts in public over the past few years. However, PDKs have always been under NDAs and are still very restrictive.<p>Perhaps the Cadence license agreement signed by a corporation is different than the one signed by a university. In such a case, they could partner with a university. But I doubt their license agreement prevents any public comparison. For example, see the AutoDMP paper from NVIDIA (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;d1qx31qr3h6wln.cloudfront.net&#x2F;publications&#x2F;AutoDMP.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;d1qx31qr3h6wln.cloudfront.net&#x2F;publications&#x2F;AutoDMP.p...</a>) where on page 7 they openly benchmark their tool against Cadence Innovus.

For commercial use, the GPUs used for training and fine-tuning aren&#x27;t a problem financially. However, if we wanted to rigorously benchmark AlphaChip against simulated annealing or other floorplanning algorithms, we have to afford the same compute and runtime budget to each algorithm. With 16 GPUs running for 6 hours, you could explore a huge placement space using any algorithm, and it isn&#x27;t clear if RL will outperform the other ones. Furthermore, the runtime of AlphaChip as shown in the Nature paper and ISPD was still significantly greater than Cadence&#x27;s concurrent macro placer (even after pre-training, RL requires several hours of fine-tuning on the target problem instance). Arguably, the runtime could go down with more GPUs, but at this point, it is unclear how much value is coming from the policy network &#x2F; problem embedding vs the ability to explore many potential placements.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42286366" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42286366" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bushbaba</span><span>|</span><a href="#42285810">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42286298">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42286702">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42286615">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42286366">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42286366">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">h100 GPU instances are multiple orders of magnitude more expensive.</div><br/><div id="42286413" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42286413" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">radq</span><span>|</span><a href="#42285810">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42286366">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42286696">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42286413">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42286413">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not true, H100s cost $2-3&#x2F;GPU&#x2F;hr on the open market.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42286696" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42286696" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">YetAnotherNick</span><span>|</span><a href="#42285810">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42286366">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42286413">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42286615">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42286696">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42286696">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">H100 GPUs are more or less similar in price&#x2F;performance.

What&#x27;s important now is for researchers to publish papers using or speaking about AI. Then executives and managers to deploy AI in their companies. Then selling AI PC (somehow, we are already at this step). Whatever the results are.

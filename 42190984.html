The Weimar Republic never had an elected government, every attempt to form one failed. While the elections had an effect on the composition of the Reichstag all positions of power ended up getting assigned round robin style. The Nazis established their control of the country through emergency legislation passed to deal with terrorism, which let them bypass the Reichstag almost entirely. When the Nazis called for a vote in the Reichstag at gunpoint to establish Hitler as the Fuhrer they had to fudge attendance records because most elected members of parliament where either dead or in prison.</div><br/><div id="42280113" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42280113" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ajuc</span><span>|</span><a href="#42275181">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42279127">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42277278">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42280113">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42280113">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; You seem to be ignorant of how badly democracy worked in the Weimar Republic<p>And whose fault is that?

Read my comment. Donât put words in my mouth.<p>&gt; After the death of President Paul von Hindenburg on 2 August 1934, Adolf Hitler assumed the office of President of Germany, and thus became commander in chief. In February 1934, the Defence Minister Werner von Blomberg, acting on his own initiative, had all of the Jews serving in the Reichswehr given an automatic and immediate dishonorable discharge.[33] Again, on his own initiative Blomberg had the armed forces adopt Nazi symbols into their uniforms in May 1934.[34] In August of the same year, on Blomberg&#x27;s initiative and that of the Ministeramt chief General Walther von Reichenau, the entire military took the Hitler oath, an oath of personal loyalty to Hitler.

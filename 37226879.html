My team was divided on two messaging approaches. One camp believed in the emotional appeal: serene images of pristine forests, juxtaposed with families using the product, essentially proposing that using our product was akin to saving the environment. The tagline was something pithy to the effect of &quot;embrace nature, one meal at a time.&quot;<p>The other approach was more socio-culturally driven. In particular, it focused on communities that had traditions rooted in nature conservation. the advertisements showcased local figures, elders if you will, using our kitchenware while sharing age-old wisdom about respecting the environment. the tagline was (something like) &quot;honoring traditions, preserving tomorrow.&quot;<p>We ran both campaigns in a split test across multiple regions. to our surprise, the socio-cultural campaign outperformed the emotional one by a substantial margin, especially in regions with strong cultural ties to nature, like certain areas in the Pacific Northwest and parts of New England. Follow-up interviews revealed that people felt a deep, personal connection to the community-focused ads. They felt that the product wasn&#x27;t just another item but a bridge to their roots.<p>All that said, even with that and other similar experiences over the course of my career, I&#x27;m bearish about completely sidelining the more automatic responses ingrained in us. While cultural imprinting and rational processes play significant roles in decision-making, it&#x27;s probably a mistake to entirely dismiss our primal instincts and inherent biases. They&#x27;ve evolved over millennia and shape much of our intuitive reactions, long before conscious thought even enters the equation.</div><br/><div id="37246518" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37246518" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hgomersall</span><span>|</span><a href="#37244340">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37246183">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37246518">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37246518">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But I was very much of the understanding that cultural pressures are among the strongest influences there are.

The lack of replicability of the classic ego depletion phenomenon is pretty clear but (like a lot of psychological phenomena) there tends to be nitpicking about definitions, and strawmen disproofs.<p>The ego depletion idea specifically refers to the idea that exercising self-control leads to self-control fatigue, which leads to a rebound effect.<p>No doubt there&#x27;s self-control and attention in climbing, but I think another phenomenon of &quot;attentional focus leads to fatigue which leads to poor decision&quot; or &quot;physical exertion leads to fatigue which leads to poor decision&quot; is not specifically an ego depletion phenomenon.<p>I&#x27;m not really trying to be pedantic, more thinking out loud about how phenomena that seem closely related and similar can get dismissed because of a very narrow definition of something.<p>There&#x27;s also something to be said for lab versus real-world tests of ego depletion. I&#x27;ve always suspected that whatever you can do in a lab ethically is not ever going to be a real-world test of ego depletion. If nothing else, it happening in the context of some study suggests that people know there&#x27;s an &quot;out&quot;, and anything that would really induce fatigue to moral temptation probably wouldn&#x27;t be approved by an IRB, at least easily.<p>I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of the original ego depletion phenomena as outlined in the original studies, in part because they never seemed to rule out alternative explanations well, but also have guessed that there&#x27;s some variant phenomenon that is similar and explains similar things better. I also don&#x27;t agree with the author that the ego depletion idea is &quot;silly&quot;. Everyone knows about fatigue, and the idea it could be applied to temptation isn&#x27;t unreasonable (on the face of it, this is how a lot of people often explain binging).

I really enjoyed it and they raise a lot of good points to think about, and appreciated the bit at the end about causal mechanism, even though it came out of nowhere a bit.<p>I think they&#x27;re making a bit of a strawman argument in an attempt to make an untenable argument for homo economicus, though.<p>This shows up in a few places.<p>For example, the author sets up this argument that ego depletion &quot;is the foundation for priming-style automaticity and in fact most of the phenomena that I label as examples of automaticity.&quot; This makes no logical or theoretical sense at all. Ego depletion is a resource depletion theory of cognitive and behavioral control; priming and automaticity has to do with dual-process and fast-slow processing theories. They intersect but are not dependent on one another at all.<p>The author might be interested to know that there is a respectable literature arguing against dual-process &#x2F; automaticity models on more sophisticated grounds. But they don&#x27;t argue against the idea that humans are biased or that decisions can be made outside of conscious awareness, they argue against the idea that automatic and controlled processes are distinct, that it makes sense at all to separate the two types of processes.<p>There&#x27;s several other examples of this. Evidence for cognitive biases is massive; the priming literature is just a small slice of it. There&#x27;s all sorts of biases that operate outside of primes, and might not even be thought of as automatic, but are thought of as operating outside of awareness. EEG&#x2F;psychohysiological studies have also documented pretty clearly that decisions can occur before we are aware of them. It&#x27;s pretty clear that humans are not always rational and unbiased, unless you stretch the definition of rational to some point where it ceases to have any meaning outside of &quot;not automatic&quot;.<p>I had trouble with the placebo effect section also. The meta-analysis on the magnitude of the placebo effect on depression the author cites <i>itself</i> recognizes the difference between active and passive placebo, which provides evidence the placebo effect isn&#x27;t a simple regression to the mean or reversion via homeostasis. There have also been studies suggesting that iatrogenic placebos do maybe happen (in waitlist conditions for example), but they happen in such a way that outcomes are worse than passive placebo. Most people know they will be given treatment at the end of a trial regardless of their condition, so the explanation that they have to &quot;fake bad&quot; to get treatment seems plausible but just as likely as someone with the treatment who believes they&#x27;ve been assigned to control. Are placebo effects small? It depends on the placebo effect. That average is just an average: depending on the nature of the control, and the patient population, it can be small or large. Sometimes, the placebo effect is largest for precisely the patients where it matters the most.<p>Anyway, this all sounds like I disliked the essay which strangely I didn&#x27;t. I think it comes across to me as raising some strong arguments (that maybe placebo effects are smaller than we think, or maybe automaticity maybe needs to be revisited), and I agree about the causal mechanism part. But a lot of it comes across as sort of hand-wavy; I think it could have left half of it out, or even aquiesced on some points, and it still would have been persuasive.<p>The phantom in the room is the lack of a definition of &quot;rational&quot; provided by the author. It seems as if a lot of the essay hinges on somewhat loose definitions: that goes for attacks on automaticity, but it could go the other way too. What&#x27;s &quot;rational&quot; versus &quot;biased&quot;? Can someone learn something rational in one scenario, but have it become irrational due to circumstances changing in a way they don&#x27;t recognize? Is that irrational?</div><br/></div></div><div id="37242884" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37242884" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">munificent</span><span>|</span><a href="#37244305">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37242884">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37242884">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the huge blindspot in American understanding of human behavior is individualism, the idea that you there is a model of human behavior that makes sense in some complete way even if that human were living perpetually alone on and island.<p>To me, that&#x27;s like trying to understand a single worker ant without knowing anything about ant colonies.

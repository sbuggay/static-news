I was using Winamp on Windows for years but it was just buggy and a resource hog. I tried a few other solutions, but nothing worked well. Then I found Liquidsoap and it&#x27;s perfect. I now run about 30 radio streams from my 1gbit home internet connection. I run Liquidsoap (and shoutcast server) in a single Ubuntu VM, it takes very little resources. I have not had one problem with buffering or any other streaming issue since switching to Liquidsoap. These streams are all for personal use (and for friends). I serve several channels each of several different music genres, so it&#x27;s always easy to tune in to music we love. If one channel isn&#x27;t what we&#x27;re in the mood for, we switch to another channel. It&#x27;s been a game-changer for our quality of life where entertainment is concerned. We have about 1TB of mp3s in the collection, so it&#x27;s quite a lot of music. And Liquidsoap has made it fairly easy to do. Once I got one station working, it was easy to duplicate it until we had about 30 stations streaming. I haven&#x27;t even begun to tap the potential of what it can do, but it serves us really well for what we need.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

An example?<p>If you have a 1&#x2F;2 mile private road, you don&#x27;t actually need to plow it.  This is a convenience.  A 1&#x2F;2 mile is not a long distance to walk, regardless of the temperature (if one is relying upon &quot;getting to a car&quot; to be warm, that&#x27;s not even remotely safe.  dress appropriately, your car could break down after all...).<p>Instead, you can:<p>* not plow it at all, and hand shovel a small area right by the road<p>OR<p>* use a snow blower right by the road<p>OR<p>* use a snow blower to make a person wide path to the road, then plow the &quot;at the road&quot; driveway<p>If you don&#x27;t buy a truck, and a plow for it, and only clear a small area at the road, as above, a snowblower can do the job cheap and easily.  So can a shovel.  Yes, I know this for a fact.<p>I might add that even with frequent snowfalls, walking back and forth to the car is an event of path creation and snow flattening in itself.<p>And that also, the winter is great because a sled can be pulled by a person with much ease, even with a lot of weight on it.  It&#x27;s why many pull firewood, entire trees out of the forest in the winter, instead of the summer.<p>One may say &quot;well that&#x27;s inconvenient&quot;.  So?  That&#x27;s my whole point.  You still have a car, you have mail at the road, and there are even modern super-cheap workarounds such as a remote camera at the road.<p>In terms of water?  Yes, being on a well can suck in the winter.  But there are workarounds to generators.  Generators aren&#x27;t cheap, maintaining them isn&#x27;t either, nor is the fuel for them.<p>But when buy and build your well infra, you can use a large or a small pressure tank.  Modern methods tend to have this super-tiny pressure tank -- no power, no water.<p>I have a 40 gallon pressure tank, and it retains a lot of pressure for a long time.  I also have a super-insulated hot water tank, which means:<p>* I can take 3 showers, one hot, then warm, then lukewarm with the power off<p>* I also have at-tank water that has no pressure to drive the taps, but does have 20+ gallons of fresh water at the pressure tank<p>Is that entirely convenient?  No.  Well the first part is.<p>Typically, power outages are less than a day for me.  Some are far worse (once 2 weeks!), but for the short outages of &lt; 1 day:<p>* you just don&#x27;t flush the toilet.. &quot;if it&#x27;s yellow let it mellow, if it&#x27;s brown send it down&quot; is the old adage.  This significantly extends water stores.<p>* you don&#x27;t need to shower quite as frequently<p>Now... one can have a <i>small</i> generator, meaning &quot;less expensive, less fuel&quot;, to just re-pressurize the pressure tank.  Water can be infinite, and I frankly get by a day easily during power outages without needing that generator.<p>And most people with forests to maintain, tend to do wood heat a bit if they can.  Even if it&#x27;s only ornamental, living room &quot;that looks nice&quot; fireplace, that&#x27;s plenty to keep you warm during outages.<p>And of course, our friend &#x27;the sweater&quot; helps too.<p>But my point is, you can be inconvenienced and live on the cheap.  You don&#x27;t have to plow.  You don&#x27;t have to do a lot of things.  And clearing the forest becomes &quot;here&#x27;s how I heat my house&quot;, so the work you do, the costs of the chainsaw, becomes a break even, if not a bit of a savings and also a &quot;here&#x27;s how I stay warm without power&quot; bonus too.<p>Anyhow!<p>The taxes, well.. that&#x27;s still an issue.</div><br/><div id="41159946" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41159946" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">codingdave</span><span>|</span><a href="#41156043">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41159101">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41156788">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41159946">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41159946">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You need to maintain a rural home well enough that you can get out in an emergency, or when you are sick or injured.

A lot of famous designers did graphic design, typography, illustration, architecture, furniture, clothing, films, jewellery etc. For example, the creative powerhouse Ray and Charles Eames, or most members of the Bauhaus did so much stuff - now days we’d label it “multi-disciplinary”, but back then it was just being a designer.<p>In that environment it makes sense a lot of creative people would think, well I’ve made so many other types of things, why not also kids books.<p>I appreciate the hyper-specialisation of design today, as it acknowledges that outputs require very specific skills, but I think it can also lead to an industry that limits people, boxing them into specific career paths.</div><br/><div id="42520341" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42520341" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">msephton</span><span>|</span><a href="#42520100">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42520336">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42520341">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42520341">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There are exact parallels in game design, theatre, etc. The specialism was required to scale up to larger productions.

In my experience, the act of parenting and reading a crap ton of children books made me start thinking of stories and “book ideas”. You also end up having to find ways to explain all kinds of things to a toddler audience. It could be complex or simple, but it’s what a lot of kids books are. Why to brush your teeth, why to share your toys, or some other educational lesson. I had a different book idea every week when my kid was in the toddler age range. I’m sure if I was a creative person, I’m sure I would have executed on some of those ideas.<p>My best friend from grade school is artistic and he actually did write, illustrate and self publish a book via Amazon basically because of this same reason, parenting put this product in his hands as an adult with the skills to execute.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42520641" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42520641" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wodenokoto</span><span>|</span><a href="#42520447">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42520654">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42520641">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42520641">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My reflective, dismissive answer is “because it was fashionable”. But that’s not a good or satisfying answer.<p>Today we see a lot of celebrities write children’s books even though they have no real pedigree to do so.<p>Maybe they think it’s easier than “a real book”? Or maybe they think it’ll actually get read? Or maybe it holds a different level of street credibility? Or does it feel like a way to influence a generation?<p>Which makes me circle back and ask, why children’s books?</div><br/></div></div><div id="42520654" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42520654" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">klez</span><span>|</span><a href="#42520641">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42520047">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42520654">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42520654">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Off-topic, but have you noticed the website has a screensaver?

He doesn&#x27;t need to devote himself to something worthier or demonstrate that the energy he expends on it is well spent.<p>That being said, his criticism of the metaphor and his prescription both strike me as not just nonsense but backwards. Providing historical context shows, if anything, that &quot;cargo cult&quot; as a metaphor is historically accurate, especially in the sense in which engineers use it: cargo cult engineering practices are those that their believers are convinced will help usher in some desired future, but the basis of those practices is sheer superstition.<p>And the fact that there is a story, in the context of actual, historical cargo cults, to be told about exploitation or subjugation is, again, an irrelevant, empty truism. Almost every grass-roots religious movement can be interpreted this way. And in areas that were under colonial or authoritarian rule, one would be hard pressed to find social and religious movements that don&#x27;t in one way or another respond to those conditions.<p>So the author&#x27;s historical analysis is sophomoric, like the guy has just discovered oppression and really wants to raise the alarm about it. The resulting prescription is empty, lame, and tedious.<p>Sanctifying the oppressed this way is also weirdly tone deaf and condescending. Nobody&#x27;s asking us to protect the subaltern religious movements of southeast Asia, nobody&#x27;s belittling them, and nobody cares, except the author, apparently, who for some strange reason is filing complaints on their behalf.</div><br/><div id="42680539" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42680539" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">motorest</span><span>|</span><a href="#42678769">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42680076">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42680224">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42680539">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42680539">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; If you care about something, that&#x27;s your cause.

Well meaning, virtuous people took to putting up home-made signs about it at popular spots, and to intervening and even shaming those that continued the centuries old tradition. Pictures of swans with wing conditions were often used to try to shock.<p>While there is truth to the idea that there are better things you can feed ducks (oats, leafy greens), eventually the royal master of swans and a well-respected professor of ornithology got together and put out a statement begging people not to stop. Bread does no detectable harm to the birds, there is no known link to the medical conditions and it forms an important source of calories for many populations over winter.

Analogies and parables serve as a shortcut to aid understanding in communication, and that is valuable even if they are entirely apocryphal.<p>Similar examples:
* The tragedy of the commons - this is an extremely useful parable to invoke a game-theoretic &#x2F; social behaviour concept. However, it is apparently historically inaccurate - at small scales, societies were able to protect and look after common lands, because of other societal factors such as reputation; the actual loss of the commons came not from overuse by the unlanded but from people who already had their own land taking more and fencing it off. Nevertheless, in larger scale societies, the principle of over-exploitation of shared resources in the absence of a mechanism to prevent that is a real and valid concern, so the analogy has a lot of value.
* The use of probably apocryphal fables like &#x27;The boy who cried wolf&#x27; have immediate meaning when it comes to concepts like alarm fatigue.
* Many religious analogies have persisted in societies that don&#x27;t hold the original religious belief. &#x27;Holy Grail&#x27;, for example, as an analogy for a desirable outcome.
* Concepts from popular fiction sometimes become analogies too. &quot;Golden Path&quot; for example.<p>Not every analogy makes sense in every circumstance, but they are useful as a mutually understood shorthand to convey concepts.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42677744" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42677744" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">architango</span><span>|</span><a href="#42680853">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42679335">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42677744">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42677744">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Similarly, Iâve had to privately advise coworkers not to use the term âlet a thousand flowers bloomâ as an idiom meaning âletâs get ideas from lots of people.â  It sounds great until you understand the horrible historical context in which it was originally said.</div><br/><div id="42680416" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42680416" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DowsingSpoon</span><span>|</span><a href="#42677744">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42679906">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42680416">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42680416">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Huh.

I honestly didn&#x27;t know that the full-size straw-airplanes were fakes from a movie. They&#x27;re the face of this metaphor.<p>That said, the article would have been a lot better without moralizing about harmful colonialism, or claiming that this metaphor is supposedly an insult.<p>The purpose of this metaphor was never to gain historical insights, or to teach a lesson about colonialism, or to judge the Polynesian natives from 80 years ago, it&#x27;s to teach a lesson about modern practices of software development (or science I guess). It&#x27;s a fable.<p>You can replace the Polynesians in the fable with anyone else, and the payload of the fable does not change. Because the payload of it has nothing to do with the Polynesians. I personally didn&#x27;t remember that this metaphor was specifically about Polynesians and the war supplies. I remembered it being about some abstract tribes, possibly Africans and humanitarian aid supplies. Did someone explain it to me the wrong way, or was it me who assumed wrong from the fake photos? I dunno. It does not matter. I wasn&#x27;t relying on this fable for anything other than a software development lesson. It was not a covert tool to justify colonialism, or to assert intellectual superiority over some historical tribes on the other side of the globe.<p>It&#x27;s definitely good to know the historical truth â as I said, I genuinely do appreciate all the exposition in this article. But, if you package that together with the moralizing, it comes off as yet more culture war BS that I am so sick of.<p>The difference in motivation is very important. If you write with the primary goal to expose historical inaccuracies â that&#x27;s great. Then I can trust you. But if you write with the primary goal to stop people from using offensive (in your view) metaphors, then the historical inaccuracies are just a convenient tool, a talking point, for you to achieve your real goal. Because if this metaphor <i>was</i> actually historically true, you would probably still find it offensive. And so if that&#x27;s your goal, then I can&#x27;t trust you to provide historical accuracy. I will suspect you of presenting selective evidence, and other tricks to further your goal.

imagine why he would care what anyone here thinks, and I&#x27;m sure he knows he

confirmation to a subset of readers---probably those who already had
doubts---that the meme is dead, and it&#x27;s time to move on.  It&#x27;s the same thing
that happens when some faceless corporation&#x27;s twitter account parrots some joke

cascade.&quot;  Melanesian history just happens to be where all the interesting
information lies, and I thank him for collecting it.  Thousands of words about
the real reason for the post (lazy hacker news commenters) would be a total
waste of bytes.  Maybe people are interpreting a shirriff-style super-in-depth
essay through the lens of &quot;people only write this much when they&#x27;re really

enough concept, or you like explaining the story, I think that&#x27;s a reasonable

The &quot;cargo&quot; ingredient in it, still refers to man-made goods coming from somewhere outside the island!<p>The specific examples of cargo cults given in the article pretty much exactly fit the the popular understanding, and nicely support the cargo cult metaphor.<p>Cargo culting refers to magical thinking in regard to some man-made artifacts. In computing it refers to the idea that people use processes, or artifacts like code, without understanding them, hoping for some good outcome, or at least the avoidance of a bad outcome. Personality worship is also implicated in cargo culting. Some great programmers decades ago did something this way in a famous system that was successful so we shall do it that way, and be rewarded with a replication of their success.<p>Those cargo cults which long proceeded WWII and do not revolve around airplanes and white man&#x27;s goods, still support the metaphor.<p>And anyway, no one ever said that the metaphor is based on absolutely all cargo cults, or that it has to be. It is inspired by a few specific instances and their specific events.<p>Maybe anthropologists should use &quot;cargo cult&quot; more specifically and use a different word for cultural phenomenon resembling cargo cults in which some key ingredients are missing. Perhaps a people who only believe that they will be rewarded with cargo in the afterlife, but otherwise don&#x27;t worship foreign human beings who wants visited the island as gods, and do not try to make imitation cargo for use as props in rituals intended to attract their second coming, should perhaps not be understood as practicing a &quot;cargo cult&quot;. Or perhaps a &quot;weak cargo cult&quot;.<p>The power of a word or term rests in its ability to discern. The more meanings you cram into a word, the less it discerns. Say that we agree that everything is a cargo cult. Then what&#x27;s the point of using those two words instead of just the word &quot;everything&quot;?<p>There&#x27;s also the question of origin. Okay so anthropologists have a definition of cargo cult, under which cargo cults can be identified going back hundreds of years. But might it not be that the popular cargo cult came first, and then the academics try to hijack the word for their own use? What&#x27;s the story here?<p>People understood fruits and vegetables before science told them that a tomato is a true fruit, whereas an apple isn&#x27;t.

For example, &quot;I survived the car crash because I was wearing a seatbelt. Now I&#x27;ll install a seatbelt on my bicycle too.&quot;<p>Cargo-culting is an important concept in its own right in the tech industry, because those best practices <i>do</i> get often blindly shared, recommended and even enforced into codes and standards, even when the context that made them a good idea is lost. Without a concept like &quot;cargo-culting&quot; to label the fallacy, it can be hard to argue against that proposal, because the side recommending the change has lots of out-of-context data in their favor. For example, &quot;car-crash survival rates are much higher when drivers are wearing seatbelts.

generally closer to the John Frum reality than the &quot;pop-culture&quot; one. not at all like mondo cane (which i was unaware of). for example, i&#x27;ve said something like &quot;to this day, there is a cult in which members paint themselves USA &#x27;uniforms&#x27; and march in military style with &#x27;guns&#x27; made of sticks&#x27;&quot; (which appears accurate). i completely missed, however, the pre-ww-ii &quot;cargo cult&quot; beliefs which add quite a different perspective.<p>unfortunately, i don&#x27;t know if i quite agree with abandoning the metaphor. the literal Feynman quote is about science. we in engineering have co-opted the term and use it (when imho done correctly) in a Feynman sense. i describe it as an Feynman anecdote. but it is one with significant grains of historical truth.<p>i find the curated list of HN examples illuminating because it appears that 1&#x2F;2 or more of them are using the analogy poorly, missing the point, or simply as a kind of slur. meta-cargo-cult if you will. it is as said: &quot;is simply a lazy, meaningless attack&quot;. i agree that it is heavily misused.<p>but in the conclusion, this leads to an argument that i see as a bit of a false dichotomy. i don&#x27;t agree that Feynman&#x27;s central point was either &quot;doing something that has no chance of working&quot; or we (mis)use it as &quot;works but isn&#x27;t understood&quot;. when Feynman said &quot;but it doesn&#x27;t work&quot; i think meant <i>within</i> the analogy it didn&#x27;t work: the planes did not show up. i don&#x27;t think that when <i>applied</i> to science or engineering it only applies to something that &quot;doesn&#x27;t work&quot;. i think it&#x27;s very much more about the central fallacy at play: misunderstanding processes that are built to support the science as being the science itself. misunderstanding effects for causes. misunderstanding and generalizing specific observations where they don&#x27;t apply.<p>i think Feynman&#x27;s anecdote is close enough to the anthropological one and not really detailed enough  to be considered <i>wrong</i>. it&#x27;s factually true that john frum cultists do what they do. the <i>reasons</i> they do it aren&#x27;t quite right in our stories, but clarifying all the anthropological history doesn&#x27;t kill the analogy, it might even strengthen it.<p>to me, used correctly the analogy is describing a <i>religious</i> or <i>cultish</i> adherence to principles that are not understood, in the hopes of some desired affect happening. it&#x27;s similar to affirming the consequent. the fact that real cargo cults developed prior to ww-ii in places affects the story telling, not that its a cult. the fact that it&#x27;s dangerous and harmful to the adherents is a good point for the analogy. the fact that the cults developed partially as a result of decades colonial oppression and mistreatment is a better framing than &quot;look at the dumb thing those ignorant savages did&quot;. the fact that the cult members are expending energy which harms them for reasons they do not understand is still the truth. i&#x27;ve certainly never been as glib as &quot;US soldiers show up with their cargo and planes, the indigenous residents amusingly misunderstand the situation, and everyone carries on.&quot;<p>the points about it being insensitive are well taken, however. no doubt.<p>- certainly there&#x27;s a large amount of misuse of the analogy. and these uses are misused whether it be relative to pedantically accurate anthropology, Feynman, or pop-culture variations. but people using an analogy wrong does not make the analogy wrong.<p>- i think it&#x27;s fine to use an anecdote and an analogy to communicate an idea about a harmful phenomenon. the anecdote does not even need to be true at all. but in this case it isn&#x27;t too far off, depending on the story telling. Feynman&#x27;s short description doesn&#x27;t seem as extreme as what is described as the &quot;pop-culture&quot; definition.<p>- it can certainly be told in a way that is very culturally insensitive. i think this could also be done in a more neutral manner, but it&#x27;s something to be careful of for sure. certainly, sticking closer to the history would probably improve things, however this may be the achilles heel. (in other words, out of all the reasons for abandonment given, i&#x27;m most convinced by this one)<p>- the biggest issue, for me, left is this: what do you recommend replacing this with if we avoid it altogether? the imagery of religious behavior is a big part of what that analogy covers. and the ideas of observing something and then copying those behaviors to achieve a result without any real understanding.<p>anyhow, thank you for a very thought provoking article. i&#x27;m clearly not as good of a communicator as you are (or Feynman).</div><br/><div id="42678660" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42678660" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">prmph</span><span>|</span><a href="#42675192">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42677081">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42679135">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42678660">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42678660">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But the point is that the islanders were not mistaking effect for cause, but simply believing some wrong things.<p>For example, they were clearing the airstrips, not because they believed that doing so <i>caused</i> the cargo to appear, but simply to facilitate the delivery of the cargo if and when it came.</div><br/><div id="42679061" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42679061" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fargle</span><span>|</span><a href="#42675192">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42678660">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42679135">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42679061">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42679061">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">in some cases, but in others they may believe in a kind of sympathetic magic [1][2]. the John Frum&#x27;s don&#x27;t march around with stick guns and uniforms &quot;simply to facilitate the delivery of cargo&quot;<p>in either cases it&#x27;s still highly apropos to the engineering analogy.<p>did you (hypothetically) add an unnecessary statement because you observed &quot;good&quot; programs doing it and believed if you did the same your program would be better? or because you thought you were facilitating something that was needed to be done to support something that isn&#x27;t needed or won&#x27;t happen? to me these are two sides of the same coin.<p>i&#x27;ve seen these kind of things (these are quick examples of the top of my head, not the worst things by far):<p><pre><code>    const char *str = &quot;hello\0&quot;; &#x2F;&#x2F; make sure it&#x27;s null terminated

What&#x27;s shocking to me is that this happened even in districts where there are lots of high-performing kids, with families that care about advanced learning. When we moved to Menlo Park, we were surprised that our highly-rated school doesn&#x27;t have any programs for kids who are advanced in learning. They just talk about how all their lessons have a &quot;low floor and high ceiling&quot; which sounds nice in theory but doesn&#x27;t work very well in practice (at least when you have a mix of kids who range from 1-2 grades below grade level to 2-3 grades above grade level).</div><br/><div id="36928738" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36928738" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tomp</span><span>|</span><a href="#36923344">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36924288">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36926363">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36928738">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36928738">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t understand why there would need to be separate <i>advanced learning programs</i> in schools.<p>In fact, <i>every</i> school already <i>has</i> an advanced learning program.

Where we have to choose between supporting gifted students or helping struggling students. It isn’t, education is one of the few areas where there is a  “free lunch”. Every dollar invested in education results in more than one dollar in return. We can easily find both of these things, the real question isn’t which we should fund, but why we aren’t funding both.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elc-pa.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;BestInvestment_Full_Report_6.27.11.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elc-pa.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;BestInvest...</a></div><br/><div id="36928505" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36928505" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bluecalm</span><span>|</span><a href="#36923344">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36927344">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36927636">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36928505">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36928505">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The paper you linked is based on reasoning like: &quot;high school dropouts are way more likely to be unemployed therefore if we reduce rates of people dropping out of high school there will be more employed ones&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s also a problem with &quot;citation needed&quot; argument - people who are in position to publish papers are often motivated politically or just bad at thinking and logic.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36927636" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36927636" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aeolun</span><span>|</span><a href="#36923344">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36926204">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36927199">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36926696">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36927636">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36927636">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You can take a look at the average intelligence of current research and business leaders and conclude that on average, they contribute more visibly.<p>That doesn’t mean the cook in their kitchen, that frees up their mind to think about all that useful stuff isn’t just as necessary.</div><br/><div id="36929145" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36929145" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tchaffee</span><span>|</span><a href="#36923344">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36927636">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36926696">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36929145">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36929145">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your observation that they contribute <i>more visibly</i> is maybe the most important part.<p>If you include all the infrastructure and not just the cook then it becomes much more obvious that we are working much like an ant colony and we succeed and progress only as a unit and die as individuals.

It was going fairly well, until Dr Steven Giavant stepped into a classroom and wanted to teach the students the frontiers and history of math. ( look this guy up! Genius at Math, Super genius at education. ) I know that besides me, 6 other students got degrees in math, and we suspect 2 more. Absurd. The norm was 1.2, even for Berkeley. He shared his enthusiasm for math, and the children got it. We only found out about it by accident, when my Abstract Algebra professor said that they were in Berkeley Math at that time. ( 15+ years later ). And the second influence was Michael Griffin, who taught computer programming, when I asked him &quot;How do I get to actually learn Calculus?&quot; he basically laid out the curriculum that led to my degree.

Of course you look outstanding in school if you have covered the material a year before at the local cram center. These &quot;accelerated by rote&quot; students memorized the multiplication tables early, so they were put in &quot;advanced math&quot;... but their rate of comprehension is ordinary. Their problem solving skills are ordinary. They took &quot;advanced math&quot; in summer school so when they take the course in the ordinary school year they have a leg up. I don&#x27;t think this has to be bad, but it&#x27;s not the &quot;gifted acceleration&quot; and can be tough on these students if expectations are that they are &quot;fast&quot;.<p>A second point: acceleration traditionally means moving through the same material faster. If you have a gifted child PLEASE work with them on a breadth of things, don&#x27;t just race them through multivariable calculus. Math contests are a good source of broader problems.

It’s a way of challenging students with difficult math problems that are approachable without comprehensive study of high level math but require combining concepts, applying logic and deduction, solving world problems in a way that don’t fit a “type” that’s covered in class. Try searching for USAMO problem sets for example.<p>The reason racing through a math curriculum can be problematic is… what’s the goal? If it’s not “look as advanced as possible to a non-mathematician to get into a tier 2 college” and instead something like “expose kid to as much math as possible because they enjoy it&#x2F;find it challenging” or “be a top mathematician for their age so they get into a tier1 college because mathematicians see promise in them” you don’t actually want to cram in subjects like typical community college or undergrad calculus, stats, and linear algebra at all. Those are not nearly as helpful for pursuing advanced mathematics as learning how to prove things, apply theorems to problems&#x2F;reduce problems to theorems, or just generally becoming excellent at “lower” math like in contest math. In fact it might turn a kid off of math to get that far and still be doing mostly rote computational problems, and it won’t help that much in becoming a mathematician because those classes typically  focus on the applied aspect (outside of particularly selective math courses at certain universities).</div><br/></div></div><div id="36924962" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36924962" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">whimsicalism</span><span>|</span><a href="#36923472">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36923878">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36926259">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36926503">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36924962">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36924962">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think it&#x27;s more that there are massive large fields of math that are just left out in the race to calculus.<p>I had a friend who grew up in Japan and he said he learned a lot more number theory-style stuff.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36926503" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36926503" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">g9yuayon</span><span>|</span><a href="#36923472">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36923878">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36923933">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36926503">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36926503">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; at the local cram center.<p>If school covers the advanced topics, we wouldn&#x27;t need any cram center.

An older child can learn in a week what a preschooler may drill for months.

Early years focus primarily on socialization, multilingualism, literacy and basic numeracy.  Then as you move through later elementary school to middle and finally through the Matura phase there are rapid accelerations and bifurcations.  If you can keep up you continue on the path to ETHZ and other top Unis.  If not you move into the trade or technical school or lower Uni tracks.  There is a chance to come back but the baseline expectatio. Is that about 20% of students will go straight through the Matura process.  If you complete you have basically free access to any university in Switzerland.  ETHZ is something like CHF800&#x2F;semester. But the trade and technical school path is also good IMO.

According to the standardized tests run by the school, about 50% of the students are pacing a full grade ahead.<p>The school does offer an option to skip a grade in math, but the pass rate is a mere 10%. While the skip test covers the standard material, it does so with trickier questions, tripping up many students. They&#x27;re moving fast, but without much depth.<p>What I found works best is to pick a challenging and exciting curriculum that allows talented students to immerse themselves and experience the excitement and satisfaction of intellectual discovery. There are a few examples of such programs. The most popular of which is the curriculum offered by AoPS (art of problem solving), which starts at first grade. Following this path naturally offers a large advantage to learning at the highest levels.

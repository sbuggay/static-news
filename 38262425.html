Back then the money was absolutely absurd, because the game was very new online and very few people understood basics. This combined with the massive amount of marketing that was going on for television, tons of people were addicted to the thrill of the game.<p>Every single year the game became more difficult as more people studied and I continued to move up into higher and higher stakes. At one point I looked at how much money I had made&#x2F;compared to how much I hated what I was doing and decided that I was done. People around me never understood why I quit because they knew me and the amount of income I had made, but the thing is no one can understand what it is to live on a grinders schedule like that.<p>I would get up at 10-11AM study the hands from the previous day to make sure I was playing correctly mentally, read over new material, review a partners hands as we both did each others to confirm playstyle and decisions were correct, around 3PM I would start scouting tables across various levels looking for soft players that I had datamined information about. Around 4-5PM I would start playing and continue to add tables with soft players and immediately leave any tables that didn&#x27;t contain any soft players or they had busted. This table hopping and monitoring is absolutely exhausting, but critical to being as profitable as possible.<p>Repeat this until about 11PM. Then go to sleep until 4AM, get up and play against the players on the other side of the world as they were starting to  play loose. Play against them until about 7AM, then go to sleep and get up around 11. Repeat. Do this for 4 years and almost anyone will decide enough is enough even with the amount of income I was making back then. The only rest I took was on weekends, just to remove myself mentally from the exhaustion.<p>Of course poker is much tougher now then it was then. I wouldn&#x27;t even dream of trying to play now. I was maybe upper 85-90% player, now I would be in the lower 50%.</div><br/><div id="38272217" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38272217" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">saucymew</span><span>|</span><a href="#38271499">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38271975">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38272217">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38272217">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not much has changed in the current live poker meta.

While you do have to be better compared to years past, it&#x27;s also far easier to get better because you can study solvers. I used to be a &quot;good but not great&quot; online player, but the extent to which you could truly understand hands was limited due to the limitations of the software at the time (mostly equity calculators that could not truly calculate EV). That changed with the release of Piosolver in 2015 that lets you calculate the EV of various strategies and give you the &quot;correct&quot; answer assuming various assumptions. Those assumptions are always wrong but it&#x27;s still informative in the &quot;all models are wrong, some are useful&quot;. I used to &quot;plateau&quot; in my undertsanding of the game but you no longer plateau because the game can now be understood at a more complete level.<p>Live poker will always be soft because there will always be plenty of people there to have fun and gamble no matter how much software exists. Furthermore, only a slim minority of players even actively trying to win actually put serious effort into studying (see also, dan luu&#x27;s post on how it&#x27;s relatively easy to reach the top 5% of any endeavour, even if very difficult to reach the top 1%).<p>I can&#x27;t help but use the opportunity of poker on the front page of Hacker News to note that I have a strategy blog and training app on this exact topic:<p>www.livepokertheory.com<p>There&#x27;s a lot of beginner to advanced strategy articles on applying practical solver outputs to live poker games as well as a preflop training based on solver generated preflop charts. Poker is currently my only significant source of income and I &quot;eat my own dogfood&quot; on this site so I&#x27;m very incentivized for it to be good!</div><br/><div id="38274002" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38274002" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ryandrake</span><span>|</span><a href="#38271499">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38271975">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38274626">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38274002">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38274002">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, live poker is still pretty soft, and since the players are worse, your winrate and edge should be better. But then again, I&#x27;m not sure you can get enough hands&#x2F;hour to be as profitable as an online player--everything is just so much slower. You could have a year long downswing live where, if that happened online you are probably just a losing player. So you need to spend all your time at the casinos. You can&#x27;t make a living grinding home games even if your edge there is astronomical.<p>Just my viewpoint as a solidly recreational player. Although I&#x27;m a decently profitable cash player (I donk my cash winnings away by losing tournaments), I&#x27;m not good enough to go pro online and I&#x27;m not patient enough or willing to spend my life in the casino to go pro live.</div><br/><div id="38274291" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38274291" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">waprin</span><span>|</span><a href="#38271499">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38274002">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38274626">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38274291">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38274291">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well, there&#x27;s obvious problems with online, starting with that it&#x27;s technically illegal and unregulated in most US states, which is a pretty big one. Secondly, the rise of solvers and other AI have greatly increased the risk of your opponents using them to beat you (RTA aka real-time assistance). Besides that, many other forms of software assistance such as HUDs and database datamining were pretty much always accepted so if you don&#x27;t want to do those things you&#x27;re at a disadvantage. There&#x27;s also serious risk of collusion , team play, card sharing, doubly so on unregulated sites.<p>It&#x27;s hard to overstate the difference in skill between online and live. You see VERY weak players buying into games with $5k stacks live while online games with $200 buyins are considered very tough. Even regular players in high stakes live games make surprisingly fundamental mistakes, like checking back extremely strong hands on the river rather than betting them for value, or almost never bluffing.<p>I would say that if someone plays poker 20+ hours a week and has a losing year live they are also probably just a losing player. I&#x27;m friends with many live poker pros, and I&#x27;ve never heard of any of them having losing years. Obviously they pick games they know they can beat and mostly stick to them.<p>Tournament variance is extremely high and I think being a live tournament pro is unnecessarily risky unless you sell &#x2F; swap action which most pros do. Or pray you run good and win one. But cash is a safer bet.<p>As far as spending all your time in a casino in order to make a living, that&#x27;s basically the equivalent of spending all your time in an office, it&#x27;s a job and you go to it. It certainly can be grindy. I understand it&#x27;s not for everyone. But it&#x27;s not super far removed from many other in-person jobs. And as others have said, it can actually be nicer than staring at a screen 10 hours a day, especially staring at a screen to play poker, because it has the social aspect with the other players and the dealers, the tactile aspect of the chips and the cards, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not advocating for anyone to become a live poker pro, certainly I&#x27;m sharing my project on hacker news with the hope that some &quot;serious recreational&quot; players take interest in it since very few poker pros lurk here. Most people should not play pro poker for various reasons - on Hacker News the obvious one being they can almost certainly make more money and easier money with plain software engineering, software engineering is generally more intellectually engaging, and also most people aren&#x27;t mentally equipped to deal with the swings.<p>I&#x27;m mostly doing it currently because it&#x27;s a niche that I understand well having done it in the past, and I wanted to do an indie software project and &quot;make money playing poker to reduce my burn rate while building a poker blog and training app&quot; has a natural synergy to it as an entry point into bootstrapped software entrepreneurship. Plus so far its my best received project, has a small but growing audience and respectable retention on the app despite it being an MVP.<p>Moreso than advocating people become live poker pros, I&#x27;m just noting that basically anyone who wants to can win a bunch of money at poker, if they&#x27;re willing to study the massive amount of resources that exist now. Those resources always existed but the advent of solvers has changed those resources from &quot;these are very good heuristics beating the games&quot; to &quot;this is the solution to the game under certain constraints&quot;.<p>Based on experience talking to &quot;hacker news&quot; type people, they tend to be introverted and so would strongly prefer the nature of online poker rather than casino poker, but I would again warn people that online games are both far tougher and require a lot of extra tooling and precautions that aren&#x27;t necessary in a casino game.<p>Plus, at some point, in live poker, you get to put all the solver nonsense away and just look a man in the eye and decide if he&#x27;s bluffing you or not :)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38274626" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38274626" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bluecalm</span><span>|</span><a href="#38271499">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38271975">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38274002">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38271865">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38274626">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38274626">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hello fellow HN&#x27;er!

Of course there were some differences with OP&#x27;s situation, e.g. because games were scarce I didn&#x27;t play only poker but also backgammon, and basically any other game that had any skill and could be played for money.<p>Like OP, I decided to become professional because of the freedom, but also because I just liked games.
But after a couple of years these advantages start to fade away. First of all, you are not really free, especially when games are scarce: you have to be always available because if you miss a good game, it can take days before another one comes along. Also, the fun in playing games erodes if you play them day in day out.
Also, like OP points out, variance is brutal. The downswings can wear you out, sometimes I had to take a few days to recover.<p>But the main reason I eventually switched to a career in IT was something that OP also mentions: the main skill in making a lot of money, especially in live games, is not how well you play, but how good you are in finding wealthy suckers that want to play against you. This part really put me off in the end, it just wasn&#x27;t me.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38271639" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38271639" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jjxw</span><span>|</span><a href="#38274332">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38272036">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38271639">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38271639">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a part time live tournament grinder who has a full time job it&#x27;s always sobering to hear from full time grinders who end up quitting due to how tough the grind is. A couple of observations to add:<p>1) There is absolutely a huge edge to be had playing live tournaments, even for buy ins in the $1k - $5k range. If you are playing outside of Vegas it is very common to end up at a table where at least half the table are &quot;recreational&quot; (i.e. players who are bad and are likely to make large mistakes).<p>2) The downside to playing live tournaments is that it is difficult to get reasonable volume in and the variance can be brutal. It is not that unlikely to go on a 20+ buy in downswing even with a decent edge.<p>3) Having an income source not tied to poker is huge and allows you to not have to  be conservative with bankroll management. If you&#x27;re pulling in mid 6 figures from a day job you don&#x27;t have to worry about selling action or going down in stakes when you go on a downswing because you can always supplement the bankroll with your income. This, obviously, can be taken too far, but you don&#x27;t have to be as worried about the variance from shot taking a higher buy in tournament where you know you have an edge like the $10k WSOP Main Event which is by far the softest $10k that exists.<p>As the saying goes, being a professional gambler is the hardest way to make an easy living.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38272036" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38272036" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nickjj</span><span>|</span><a href="#38271639">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38274675">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38272036">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38272036">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Back in the mid-2000s some places had crazy incentives like PokerStars.

The idea there was you could play ~16 tables at a time for ~25 hours a week making robotic decisions based on odds or a quick glance at PokerTracker&#x27;s HUD.<p>There&#x27;s a write up about it here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pokernews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2010&#x2F;08&#x2F;making-supernova-elite-with-team-pokerstars-online-pro-leath-8670.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pokernews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2010&#x2F;08&#x2F;making-supernova-elit...</a><p>There were other places as well. There were so many stories posted on the 2+2 forums[0] of people making really good money doing this. That&#x27;s one of the most popular poker forums. It&#x27;s interesting because it&#x27;s a different type of skill. Tile a bunch of windows, have a lot of mental fortitude and grind it out. It&#x27;s a completely different strategy than trying to become a &quot;winning&quot; player.<p>I used to play microstates back before online poker was banned in the US so I didn&#x27;t participate in that. What&#x27;s funny though is even back then at the 5c-10c ($10 buy in) or 10c-25c ($25 buy in) NL tables you&#x27;d have folks 4-6 tabling while looking at a PokerTrack HUD which gathered stats about players and displayed them above their name plate.

Especially with the rake, having a fully fair online poker game still makes bank on almost no risk without any rigging at all.  There&#x27;s not really any reason for them to be rigged.<p>I played a little for fun on some Bitcoin poker sites about a decade ago, and the sites I used were verifiably fair and gave you the game&#x27;s seed when you were finished.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever play for real money on a site that I couldn&#x27;t verify to be fair.  You don&#x27;t want true external source of randomization for anything other than the seed, otherwise you couldn&#x27;t verify the game.<p>A rational fear would be more about a site using a predictable RNG, or somebody being able to exfiltrate or deduce the seed of a running game, or players colluding with each other or an employee.  Nowadays, an AI assistant (or full-fledged poker bots) probably largely makes playing online poker a crapshoot anyway.<p>There&#x27;s not really any point in a poker site itself rigging a game when the house always wins anyway.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38271232" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38271232" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PaulRobinson</span><span>|</span><a href="#38271159">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38271507">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38271245">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38271232">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38271232">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Source?<p>That behaviour quite likely lands everyone involved in jail in regulated (think big name entities with licenses in Malta types) companies.

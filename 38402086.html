The author&#x27;s pompous ego makes it hard to take any of this seriously, which, at least, he does admit. But still, the style on this piece makes me wonder if it&#x27;s a professional deformation of sorts - talking about one&#x27;s lack of fulfillment while throwing in pointless metaphors and buzzwords, hyping up his genius. If this is meant to be a piece the reader should connect to - how will they do that when the post is half-confessional, half-promotional? Many people could connect to the idea that daily chores waste their precious time on this planet, but when he tries to sell himself as the equivalent of a rock star... Not to mention that broadcasting one&#x27;s complete lack of preparation for parental roles is baffling to me.

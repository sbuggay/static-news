If you start managing folks you were recently in the trenches with this can be VERY hard. These are your comrades after all! You want them to like you. It’s all very natural. Sadly it is the single biggest cause for dissatisfaction I’ve seen on a given team. Being unwilling to give honest, direct feedback results in underperforming teams and unhappy reports. It’s counterintuitive but very important to get right as a manager. The big “AHA!!” moment for me was when I realized you need to speak to behaviors and outcomes not character. So instead of “you’re sloppy” you say something like “I’ve noticed quality issues in your code recently that’s resulted in some rollbacks. Can we talk about how we can address that?”. Involving them in the solution and explaining why it matters. It makes all the difference and folks ironically respect and like you more for it.</div><br/><div id="42347256" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42347256" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pdonis</span><span>|</span><a href="#42344478">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42345461">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42347256">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42347256">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; I’ve noticed quality issues in your code recently that’s resulted in some rollbacks</i><p>I would tend to even leave out the first part of that phrase.

The other thing in the article that jumps out is the conclusion where he says that a team that is shipping and happy is enough to be crushing it.<p>That isn&#x27;t really enough in my experience. There are 3 questions - is the team happy? Are they shipping? Is what they are shipping valuable? - and I&#x27;ve seen a lot of new managers are so overwhelmed that they forget about number 3 and a fair chunk of people end up unemployed because sooner or later the bean counters figure out that the team isn&#x27;t actually productive.<p>This article, overall, doesn&#x27;t identify achieving excellent outcomes as something he got wrong at first. I suspect either he is a natural manager or it is a mistake that is still being made. Probably the latter based on the other mistakes identified.

Yes the OKRs need to be achieved and help make the business work, but e.g. if the business model’s margins are just too tepid or if the VC’s expected revenue growth (exponential?) will never actually realize, then there is really zero <i>material</i> value to the shipped product.  Hence the focus on a happy team that’s shipping, because at least that provides some <i>technological</i> value.  And build a network you can bring to your next gig—- because <i>that’s</i> what gets you the next job.<p>There are rare cases where a team might discover a new business model or impress a whale customer, and then the business model fundamentally changes.<p>Yes there is risk the “bean counters” or CFO &#x2F; COO office will want to cut the cord (especially now tech hiring is in a recession).  But tech moves fast; those bean counters will likely end up owning shares of a zombie in the next 5-7 years.  And their game is to cash out, not build a future.<p>And if the business model actually works, then keep at those OKRs and everybody should win.

I feel like many new managers know they&#x27;ll need to deal with this, but never developed their abilities prior to being a manager, and don&#x27;t realize that just because the conversation happens, doesn&#x27;t mean it produces <i>valuable</i> outcomes, breeds respect, or means anyone will like the way you approached it, or even that you were as vulnerable or honest as you thought you were.<p>Every manager I&#x27;ve had that used your example quote—almost verbatim—went on to be incredibly passive-aggressive, because they&#x27;re trying too hard not to actually create conflict, they want to be liked more than they care about the result, they don&#x27;t have that much innate confidence, or like the author of the article suggested, they want to see the results they would have produced when they were an IC, and haven&#x27;t yet learned how to guide autonomy and relinquish a certain amount of control. These are perhaps the traits that led them to keeping their IC job all those years.<p>These people would turn 1-on-1s into 45 mins of beating around the bush, trying to get me to reveal myself as having insufficiently met the unspoken criteria they&#x27;ve been having internal anxiety attacks about, and <i>maybe</i> in the last few minutes when there&#x27;s no room left for pushback they&#x27;d conjure the answer they wanted to hear and set that as the benchmark.<p>This failure on their part predictibly bled into other interactions and created toxicity and resentment, they couldn&#x27;t yield control, and they couldn&#x27;t have a real discussion that involved more than themselves manifesting as their overbearing mother waiting for their kid to implicate themselves for some petty wrongdoing. They couldn&#x27;t clearly communicate priorities, or timelines, or requirements, and were starting in their new job with a skill issue of their own. They hadn&#x27;t adapted to the role or developed a good personality for it, and apparently lacked an ability to reflect on their behavior or communication style.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to extrapolate too far from this or in-turn attack you in any way, it&#x27;s just a small quote, but in the past it&#x27;s been telling.<p>&quot;Can we talk about code quality issues&quot; doesn&#x27;t just avoid a character trait, which I agree should should never be the target, it leans into vague, soft, meek, intentionally indirect language that just creates undue anxiety and establishes an ambiguous context for whatever the problem might be, and was a dishonest pretext for for downstream attribution of fault, since they couldn&#x27;t accept the possibility that the problem might be upstream (which it wasn&#x27;t always, but if it had been, they weren&#x27;t going to address it then). In these situations, sometimes I was struggling with purely my own productivity, having a bad couple weeks, but otherwise it was some other issue they weren&#x27;t willing or able to genuinely help me with.<p>Do your best to be humble, learn to delegate and <i>try</i> to trust people, avoid thinking about character traits but don&#x27;t avoid direct (and clear) language, and accept that your perception might be inaccurate. Get as far away as necessary from the dreaded &quot;just checking in&quot; or &quot;is there anything <i>we</i> can do to improve (<i>your problem</i>)&quot; as possible. What if their code is suffering because of noise in the office or someone&#x27;s depressed because they&#x27;re having relationship issues? What if it&#x27;s because you keep coming over to their desk unannounced and asking diverting their attention?<p>If you can do that, you&#x27;re on a good track.<p>Edit: it&#x27;s worth noting that the underlying assumption in all of my comment is that people and their reasons and issues are often different, and likewise how they respond to this language may be different, and as such many might actually love the quoted phrases because they aren&#x27;t imposing, and a good manager will do their best to communicate with people in a way that accepts that a variety of ways to address conflict is the right move, and sometimes less imposing language is viable.</div><br/><div id="42346501" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42346501" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">localghost3000</span><span>|</span><a href="#42344478">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42346240">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42345687">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42346501">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42346501">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You’re basically validating my original point if I am reading your comment correctly.

If there is a bus factor that is too high of a risk for a sustainable team, cross-train the team to remove the bus factor.

No amount of money can make someone care about company projects. The worker may be interested in the project, or is simply there for the wrong reasons. Remember you want to keep employees content, but a &quot;kingdom of kings&quot; is unsustainable.<p>3. People can postpone something until tomorrow indefinitely. Thus, pay very close attention to projected deliverable times.<p>4. Fire someone for being unproductive according to a defined workmanship-standard as soon as possible. It will notify the rest of staff you are not there to play games, and stupid behavior will have consequences.  Mostly effective with Jr staff using ChatGPT to try and BS the world like any other con.<p>5. Delegation?  Just initially run trial contracts with potential staff first for each project deliverable. Failure to deliver on time means they don&#x27;t get another dime, or a second chance to be unaccountable for their behavior.<p>6.

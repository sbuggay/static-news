We present the bird to the table in a big pot, bring it back to the kitchen to carve it, and then return with a beautiful platter of rice topped with the sliced breasts and two different sauces spooned over the top. Once guests are finished with that, we bring out a soup made from the carcass.

Both of these are inefficient---modern computers are more powerful and quartz watch keep time better---but are fascinating because the difficulty of programming in assembly or an intricate series of tiny gears have inherent value to some people, far beyond the result of a video game or getting the current time.<p>It&#x27;s a complicated finely tuned process to get a chicken from your table to the kitchen and back again.

That you don&#x27;t trust them to understand the difference between a shortcut that does and doesn&#x27;t matter.  The fact that Chang&#x27;s staff emailed them to say &quot;hey, we&#x27;ve started taking this shortcut&quot; is a reason <i>to</i> trust them.  Any deviation from the plan, and they let him know?  Great!  But he thinks that if he allows good shortcuts, sometime later, they&#x27;ll start taking bad shortcuts, but he&#x27;ll never find out, or won&#x27;t find out until it&#x27;s too late?  It&#x27;s profoundly insulting.<p>But at the same time, fighting human nature is hard.  Judgment will suffer while under stress, and working in a kitchen is certainly a poster child for &quot;stressful situation&quot;.  Even with the best intentions, bad decisions will be made, even if they seem like good decisions in the moment.<p>I still think we should strive for that trust, though.  Making people stick to an inefficient process where they can&#x27;t see the reason for it is how you get detached, uncreative employees.<p>&gt; <i>I think a charitable interpretation of his point is &quot;I didn&#x27;t care about fooling the diners about this specific thing.&quot;</i><p>The funny thing is I actually do think he should be caring about this.  Bringing out a chicken to show customers, and either explicitly saying or even implying that they&#x27;re going to take that chicken back to the kitchen, carve it up, plate it, and bring it back out is a statement of intent.  If you don&#x27;t do it that way, then that&#x27;s dishonest in a way I&#x27;d consider really bad.  If I found out that parading the chicken out to my table was just a gimmick, and that&#x27;s not the chicken I ended up eating, I&#x27;d feel lied to (or at least very much misled), and that would affect my enjoyment of the experience and my desire to go back.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41515877" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41515877" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">joe_the_user</span><span>|</span><a href="#41513000">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41514141">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41516989">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41515752">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41515877">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41515877">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So, the idea is the long, hard, stupid and disrespectful way.<p>Basically, the idea is you don&#x27;t want smart people who can decide what corners make sense to cut, what process to use to etc.<p>And this is because you don&#x27;t want to have to rely on their intelligence.

It seems to be more the case that every award or signal of quality is capable of (and actually being used) this way.<p>Some people, like Chang, may know it and treat it transactionally as such. $X for a star, which leads to Y amount of exposure. Others, may know it or not, but treat it like a goal in life either way.

Information is freely available. You need to find some other moat. With information and access to everything, a moat that might have been quality or talent, is more easily captured by buying the signal (which to be clear can include buying and maintaining the quality).

This is time that the diners now need to wait before they get their meal.<p>So, in David Chang&#x27;s model, when the dish is ordered a prepared, dead chicken is &quot;fired&quot; and heated so that it finishes cooking. Then, while hot and still in the pot, presented to the diners. It&#x27;s taken back, must rest outside of the hot boiling pot, and then is sliced into pieces and plated to be served and eaten by the guests. The remaining carcass is supposed to then be boiled down into a stock for a 3rd dish.<p>However, the resting and boiling steps could be skipped. Why does it all have to be the exact same chicken!? Have a presentation bird, another that is fired and rested (while the other is presented) you can carve and serve quicker, and make a large amount of bulk stock that can be served on order. The only difference is you don&#x27;t have the exact same bird going through the whole 3 steps to the diners and instead have the 1. dead cooked presentation bird, 2. the carved bird, and 3. stock from a bird from yesterday.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41514186" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41514186" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">munificent</span><span>|</span><a href="#41514047">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41514175">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41515917">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41514186">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41514186">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; Is the presentation bird alive or dead?</i><p>Dead and boiled.<p><i>&gt; What is &quot;fired&quot; in this context?</i><p>In cooking, that can mean applying direct heat in any number of ways. In this guess, I&#x27;m guessing that it means finishing (i.e. doing a last small amount of cooking for color and texture) the bird by roasting or searing.<p><i>&gt; Is the presentation bird unrested? What does &quot;rested&quot; mean in this context?</i><p>In cooking, resting means to remove the item from heat and let it sit for a while. Food cooks from the outside in so the surface temperature can be much higher than the internal temperature. Resting gives some time for those to equalize. It lets the inside finish cooking using the residual heat on the surface.<p><i>&gt; Why does the kitchen need to &quot;butcher&quot; the chicken that&#x27;s &quot;rested&quot;?</i><p>It&#x27;s a boiled whole chicken. After it&#x27;s rested, it gets broken down into parts that the diner can eat. For chicken, that&#x27;s usually breasts, thighs, wings, and legs&#x2F;drumsticks.<p><i>&gt; What does &quot;slowing&quot; the other, presumably presentation, chicken mean?</i><p>Resting and breaking down a chicken takes time, especially resting. By having a separate presentation chicken, it means the staff can be simultaneously resting some <i>other</i> cooked chicken and butchering it while the presenetation is being paraded around.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41515917" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41515917" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">djaouen</span><span>|</span><a href="#41514047">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41513624">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41515917">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41515917">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The reality he is trying to describe is that COOKING is ART.

Memorizing an elegant algorithm is a lot more fun and more broadly useful than memorizing the look-up table for a limited section of the results; but sometimes caching parts of the look-up table in  your memory is necessary for expertise.<p>For example: Many bright kids get frustrated when they have to repeat a section because of calculation errors, when they already get the concept.

Has this ever been in question?<p>I don&#x27;t think any serious expert in ML that is pushing against LLMs is making a claim that memorization and&#x2F;or compression isn&#x27;t a necessary part of intelligence. Rather that there&#x27;s more to it.<p>Too much memorization is a bad thing, it&#x27;s called over fitting. Bringing up schools is a good example. I&#x27;m sure many here have met people who can answer questions really well when in specific contexts but not in others. People who do well on tests but not in the lab. The difficulty of word problems is a meme, but are just generalization.<p>If you ask me, what makes humans and animal brains special is the fuzziness. It&#x27;s this seemingly contradictory nature of well defined understanding through rules (such as physics) but also understanding that resolution is far from perfect. In our quest to become more precise it is recognizing the impossibility of precision and finding balance.<p>What I&#x27;d say is wrong with both the US and China is failing to teach how to think. The truth is that this is exceptionally difficult to test, if not impossible. It&#x27;s difficult to distinguish from memorization when the questions are not clearly novel.

This article does not appear to be supporting a point counter to what I said. It is also focused on the opinions on non-experts. In fact, the majority of the article is discussing how schools aren&#x27;t &quot;following the data.&quot;<p>I would be surprised if the dominant method was &quot;memorize&quot; for reading, as this would mean a curriculum that has little free reading.<p>I&#x27;m not too interested in what non-experts have to say unless there is quite compelling evidence. The average person quire frequently overestimates their confidence in how something should be done.<p><pre><code>  &gt; It&#x27;s not.

</code></pre>
I grew up playing piano and memorizing holy texts. Even participating in scripture competitions as well as music competitions. With the highest confidence I can assure you that no professional in either of these subjects believes that one should memorize without limit. In music they will use the words &quot;without soul&quot; while in scriptures they may say that you know the words but not the meanings.<p>I&#x27;ll directly quote from the bible to demonstrate both at once:<p><pre><code>  &gt; Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.
  Mathew 13:13[0]
</code></pre>
I suggest reading the chapter in full, as it makes the point more explicitly.<p>I think both groups understand something important to language (which yes, I will argue that music is _a_ language): that the &quot;words&quot; (sounds) used are only tools to convey what is the deeper meaning inside. In music you seek to draw that out of the listener. In scriptures it is the same. The clearest cases of these may be proverbs, parables, koans, or fables. The words hold only what is at the surface. It is ironic you specifically mention Hasidic Jews, as they are deeply entrenched in the Kabbalah, which is famous for being entrenched mysticism. That there are hidden meanings in the scriptures. This isn&#x27;t even uncommon in religion in general! I don&#x27;t think it is hard to see this in music or any art. If you are in any doubt, please go visit your local art gallery and listen to one of the local artists. Even if you believe they are full of hogwash, it still illustrates that they are trying to convey something deeper. If you wish to get this lesson and learn a bit about Jewish mysticism at the same time I&#x27;d recommend A Serious Man[1] (a Coen brothers movie)<p>I must stress that language (of any form) has three key aspects: what is intended to be conveyed, the words and way the words are used (diction), and the way the person receiving interprets this. The goal is to align the first with the last, but there is clearly a lossy encoding and lossy decoding.<p><pre><code>  &gt; I maintain that you can&#x27;t learn how to think without grinding through facts
</code></pre>
I&#x27;m not sure why you thought we were in disagreement. Perhaps you know the words but not the meaning.

Then if youâre a novice you will immediately hang a knight and end up 2.75 pawns behind.  Then your opponent will hang a bishop and youâll be a quarter pawn ahead again.<p>The other problem with learning opening theory against novices is you will learn 30 moves a side of Ruy Lopez opening theory and your opponent wonât get 10 moves without leaving theory rendering your study moot.<p>Thereâs far more emphasis on memorizing openings at the grandmaster level because people are playing a tight enough game elsewhere for that slight advantage to really matter, and because of all the pre-game preperation where teams of grandmasters and chess engines will come up with novel moves to throw an opponent off balance while the star player memorizes the lines.  To the point of grandmasters like Bobby Fischer complain it ruined the game and inventing variants like chess960.   All super grandmasters have outlier memorization abilities.<p>Generally club players just need to rote memorize not too deeply and understand the broad sweeping ideas and key moves of the openings (when white does that, counter them with this).

If they had to consciously think about the mechanics of running and dribbling, they would not be able to do both at the same time, and they would not have enough brainspace to think about strategy.<p>(This comment is basically the intro to a detailed article I wrote on the topic with plenty of scientific citations: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justinmath.com&#x2F;cognitive-science-of-learning-developing-automaticity&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justinmath.com&#x2F;cognitive-science-of-learning-dev...</a>)</div><br/><div id="41284412" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41284412" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ramenbytes</span><span>|</span><a href="#41282928">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41283280">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41283550">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41284412">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41284412">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That is a much better way of putting it, thank you.<p>(edit) One thing neither of us directly mentioned in our comments, but which I feel is important is this bit from your article intro:<p>&gt; Insufficient automaticity, particularly in basic skills, inflates the cognitive load of tasks, making it exceedingly difficult for students to learn<p>A real-world example for myself was when I was learning a small lick on guitar with an uncomfortable-to-me rhythm.

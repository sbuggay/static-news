Long ago when I was much more tolerant, I had a boss that would review all code changes every night and delete anything he didn&#x27;t like. This same boss also believed that version control was overcomplicated and decided the company should standardize on remote access to a network drive at his house.<p>The effect of this was that I&#x27;d occasionally come in the next morning to find that my previous day&#x27;s work had been deleted. Before I eventually installed an illicit copy of SVN, I got <i>very</i> good at recreating the previous day&#x27;s work.

Because I had kind-of PTSD from the first job, I right off asked the boss on the second job if they had a git repository somewhere. He thought that git is the same as Github and told me they don&#x27;t want their code to be public.<p>When they were bought of by some bigger company, we got access to their intranet. I digged through that and found a gitlab instance. So then I just versioned my own code (which I was working on mostly on my own), documented all of it on there, even installed a gitlab runner and had a step-by-step documentary on how to get my code working. When they kicked me out (because I was kind of an asshole, I assume), they asked me to hand over my code. I showed them all of what I did and told them how to reproduce it. After that the boss was kinda impressed and thanked me for my work. Maybe I had a little positive impact on a shitty job by being an asshole and doing stuff the way that I thought would be the right way to do it.<p>Edit: Oh, before I found that gitlab instance I just initialized raw git repositories on their network share and pushed everything to that</div><br/></div></div><div id="40104135" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40104135" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">datascienced</span><span>|</span><a href="#40103687">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40103823">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40103795">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40104135">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40104135">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Bad boss or zen teacher, we will never know!</div><br/></div></div><div id="40103795" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40103795" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scotty79</span><span>|</span><a href="#40103687">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40104135">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40103707">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40103795">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40103795">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Was your work better or worse second time around?</div><br/><div id="40103851" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40103851" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AlotOfReading</span><span>|</span><a href="#40103687">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40103795">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40103707">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40103851">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40103851">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Probably a bit of both, but hindsight helped.

I work in finance, I&#x27;ve sat on trading desks looking at various exchanges, writing code to implement this or that strategy.<p>You can&#x27;t think about what the computer should do if you don&#x27;t know what the business should do.<p>From this perspective, it might make sense to train coders a bit like how we train translators. For example, I have a friend who is a translator. She speaks a bunch of languages, it&#x27;s very impressive. She knows the grammar, idioms, and so on of a wide number of languages, and can pick up new ones like how you or I can pick up a new coding language.<p>But she also spent a significant amount of time learning about the pharmaceutical industry. Stuff about how that business works, what kinds of things they do, different things that interface with translation. So now she works translating medical documents.<p>Lawyers and accountants are another profession where you have a language gap. What I mean is, when you become a professional, you learn the language of your profession, and you learn how to talk in terms of the law, or accounting, or software. What I&#x27;ve always found is that the good professionals are the ones who can give you answers not in terms of their professional language, but in terms of business.<p>Particularly with lawyers, the ones who are less good will tell you every possible outcome, in legalese, leaving you to make a decision about which button to press. The good lawyers will say &quot;yes, there&#x27;s a bunch of minor things that could happen, but in practice every client in your positions does X, because they all have this business goal&quot;.<p>---<p>As for his thought experiment, I recall a case from my first trading job. We had a trader who&#x27;d created a VBA module in Excel. It did some process for looking through stocks for targets to trade. No version control, just saved file on disk.<p>Our new recruit lands on the desk, and one day within a couple of weeks, he somehow deletes the whole VBA module and saves it. All gone, no backup, and IT can&#x27;t do anything either.<p>Our trader colleague goes red. He calms down, but what can you do? You should have backups, and what are you doing with VBA anyway?<p>He sits down and types out the whole thing, as if he were a terminal screen from the 80s printing each character after the next.<p>Boom, done.</div><br/><div id="40103963" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40103963" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">otar</span><span>|</span><a href="#40103932">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40104100">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40103963">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40103963">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; This is why domain knowledge is key.<p>Very true.

The most basic example of this is sorting, obviously but the same basic concepts apply to many many problems.<p>I think the issue that happens in modern times, specially in webdev, is we aren&#x27;t actually solving problems. We are just glueing services together and marshalling data around which fundamentally doesn&#x27;t need to be algorithmic... Most &quot;coders&quot; are glorified secretaries who now just automate what would have been done by a secretary before.<p>Call service A (database&#x2F; S3 etc), remove irrelevant data, send to service B, give feedback.<p>It&#x27;s just significantly harder to do this in a computer than for a human to do it. For instance if I give you a list of names but some of them have letters swapped around you could likely easily see that and correct it. To do that &quot;algorithmically&quot; is likely impossible and hence ML and NLP became a thing. And data validation on user input.<p>So algorithmically in the modern sense is more, follow these steps exactly to produce this outcome and generating user flows where that is the only option.<p>Human do logic much much better than computers but I think the conclusion has become that the worst computer program is probably better at it that the average human. Just look at many niche products catered to X wealth group. I could have a cheap bank account and do exactly what is required by that bank account or I can pay a lot of money and have a private banker that I can call and they will interpret what I say into the actions that actually need to happen... I feel I am struggling to actually write what&#x27;s in my mind but hopefully that gives you an idea...<p>To answer your nothing clever , well clever is relative. If I have some code which is effectively a array and an algorithm to remove index &#x27;X&#x27; from it, would it be &quot;clever&quot; code to you if that array was labeled &quot;Carousel&quot; and I used the exact same generic algorithms to insert or remove elements from the carousel?<p>For most developers these days they expect to have a class of some sort with a .append and .remove function but why isn&#x27;t it just an array of structs which use the exact same functions as every single other array... That people generally will complain that that code is &quot;clever&quot; but in reality it is really dumb. I can see it&#x27;s clearly an array being operated on but OOP has caused brain rot and developers actually don&#x27;t know what that means... Wait maybe that was OPs point...

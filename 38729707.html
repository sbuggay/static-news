Da Vinci&#x27;s machines, first computers (Babbage&#x27;s &quot;analytical engine&quot;), modern works like fusion power or quantum computers for example. And as new technology is invented and new discoveries are made we continue challenging ourselves.<p>Having said that I am certain humans are not the only ones able to do so. So I will live this open-ended like this, just a tribute to the marvelous complexity of the intelligent life on Earth.</div><br/><div id="38732327" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38732327" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacquesm</span><span>|</span><a href="#38732062">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38731786">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38732327">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38732327">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It is inspiring. And many times when building things my most recurring thought is &quot;I wonder how many other people have this exact same thing sitting in their garage&quot;. And far less frequently &quot;How strange that nobody else thought of this before&quot;.<p>Da Vinci was essentially a &#x27;maker&#x27; but he didn&#x27;t have todays tools, and you have to wonder what he would have been able to imagine with that kind of access that we today haven&#x27;t seen yet and then go do that!<p>At the same time: in the 1600&#x27;s almost everything related to technology was still in the future and Da Vinci didn&#x27;t even know about the possibilities of some of the fundamentals of technology yet. So without much knowledge about electricity, magnetism (though there was some of this it was very rudimentary) and other &#x27;common&#x27; knowledge nowadays he was able to see very far indeed but only on those parts of science that were well illuminated at the time.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38731786" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38731786" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shermantanktop</span><span>|</span><a href="#38732062">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38730231">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38731786">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38731786">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Fascinating the lengths to which people will attempt to fill in the gaps or correct “errors” to make a semi-working modern model appear physically similar to a paper sketch of a fanciful idea. I think I sort of get it: at some point the challenge becomes a thing unto itself.<p>But Leonardo was a genius precisely because his insights predated the experimental and iterative science spirit that came later, and which were necessary to produce practical technology.  Can’t we just accept that his helicopter designs suck, his submarines were impractical, and his car was nonfunctional?  They are still amazing and fascinating.

You have to start somewhere.<p>The first trial I made at a windmill blew apart in the first storm and you might not even have recognized it. Back to school, 6 months of learning, lots of math and engineering later: a scale model 1:2 to check if I got any better at it, that one worked but produced too little power for its size but we figured out why. Scale that up to 1:1 and it worked like a charm and powered our house for a couple of years.

Here in Finland, university admissions are based around how well you did on various end of school exams, and she fortunately did quite well on all of them a decade ago - except for math. She bombed math due to health and family problems as a teenager decimating her ability to pay sustained focused attention.<p>Luckily, soon after the decision was made, I finally got my first full time job in Finland. I could easily support the two of us and give her an uninterrupted life to focus on grinding up for the math exam. We took the last ~10 years&#x27; worth of math exams online, turned their problems into Anki cards, and set her nose to the grindstone. I had had tremendous success with this in college with abstract algebra and real analysis, so I figured the same methodical approach + a very stable living situation was bound to work for algebra through basic calculus.<p>Five months later, she retakes the high school exam and gets the highest score possible! Her rapid success at this convinced her to give CS a serious try, and indeed her improved math exam was the differentiator - without it she would not have been accepted to the CS program. She got top marks in her first semester at CS as well, I couldn&#x27;t be more proud. My wife is truly an incredible person.</div><br/><div id="39053160" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39053160" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">NeutralForest</span><span>|</span><a href="#39053047">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39053006">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39053160">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39053160">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Cool comment, it&#x27;s great seeing people being supportive of their SO =)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39053006" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39053006" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mjburgess</span><span>|</span><a href="#39053047">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39050883">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39053006">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39053006">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The &quot;math&quot; used in ML&#x2F;AI papers is usually just a sort of &#x27;whiteboard math&#x27; which is a domain-specific mishmash of linear algebra, calculus, set theory and statistics.<p>If you could find a book <i>just</i> going through the relevant bits you wouldnt really have to &quot;learn math again&quot;, it can be translated into english straightforwardly -- very very few ML papers relevant to industry have extended proofs, etc. that require eg., even being able to differentiate anything yourself.<p>90% of it is: here&#x27;s the domain (ie., type) of our variables, here&#x27;s the formula of our functions, we&#x27;re taking a weighted average with some inner products involved.<p>It might sound like a lot of math, but it&#x27;s really all doable in semester-1 of an undergrad course, were it focused enough.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39050883" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39050883" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jorgesborges</span><span>|</span><a href="#39053006">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39050606">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39050883">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39050883">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m a thirty-something with an arts degree who decided to learn math.

My target is to learn the math needed to make 3d games, so basically algebra, geometry, calculus and linear algebra.<p>I started with brilliant.org, and while I liked the level of polish in the interactive lessons, I found the lesson structure to be out of sequence, often referring to things that haven&#x27;t been covered yet. They didn&#x27;t seem to have put as much thought into pedagogy as Math Academy as described in TFA.<p>So I gave up on that and instead have been shipping several kilograms of dead tree across the pacific in the form of The Art Of Problem Solving series of textbooks. They are great, the lesson structure and building up of complex ideas from first principles is outstanding. They will humble you though, as the exercises are tough. They&#x27;re also quite expensive but IMHO worth it.<p>Math Academy does look interesting, If I was not halfway through my series I would probably take a look. But I do enjoy having reference books on hand. Many times I&#x27;ve jumped back to brush up on a topic that has slipped from memory.<p>I solve my exercises with the most low tech solution possible, but I like the freedom it gives me to try new approaches, and nothing beats the latency between idea to ink on paper.<p>edit: also wanted to add that I&#x27;ve enrolled Chat GPT4 as my tutor.

You just had to memorize that, right? Well then I realized that if 3 x 10 = 30, then 3 x 9 must be one fewer &#x27;3&#x27; added together by the multiplication, which means take out one &#x27;3&#x27; from the set of 3s you are adding together by multiplication when doing 3 x 10, which comes to 30 - 3 = 27.<p>That means I didn&#x27;t really need to memorize 3 x 9, I needed the above simple rule in addition to the fact that n x 10 is always what you get when you take the digit &#x27;n&#x27; and add a 0 after it.<p>So learning multiplication tables was hard, until I learned the rule of looking for an easier-to-remember result and then adding or subtracting something to it. Of course I also had to understand that multiplication is really just repeated addition.<p>My teacher never taught me this trick, just told us to recite the multiplication tables in out heads again and again. But after doing that for some time I figured out the above trick myself.<p>Learning math beyond multiplication is hard if you cannot multiply numbers in your head, because lots of math presentations assume that of course you know that 3 x 9 = 27. Or something similar. It is not just about understanding the concepts, it&#x27;s about being able to perform calculations, in your head. Else you cannot understand the explanations of new concepts. Even though we have pocket-calculators, we still need to be able to do calculations in our heads to understand new topics. in math.<p>So, learning what is 3 x 9 is not hard AFTER you have learned n * 10, and this trick. I assume something like that happens in the minds of mathematicians. They know a lot of math already which makes it easier to understand new results when they already know a lot. To learn what is n * 10, you had to learn 1 x 10, 2 x 10, 3 x 10 etc. and then understand the pattern in there.<p>Learning something is easy if you already know lots of related stuff. So it&#x27;s not about learning more and more difficult things, it is about just learning more and more, related things. It is about having more and more (learned) data in your head.<p>I assume that is also why LLMs work so well: They have lots of data.<p>In summary: Learning math is not &quot;difficult&quot;, it is tedious.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39050585" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39050585" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">trws</span><span>|</span><a href="#39050506">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39050573">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39050559">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39050585">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39050585">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I probably had crummy teachers in some places, but my experience was that math up through linear algebra made sense and wasn’t all that bad, but that calculus was a huge bag of “if it looks kinda like this try this thing, and if the result looks kinda right it probably worked, if not try this other thing” such that I could never form a framework for it in my head.

Some of the tricks are actually really useful, but you have to fully internalize where they come from, e.g., integration by parts just comes from rearranging the chain rule, and, if you know that, you can apply it to more exotic derivatives.<p>I did well in HS calculus but struggled in college math because the bag of tricks approach doesn’t work there. It took a lot of effort for me to undo the bad habits I learned from K-12 math and learn the good stuff, but it paid off.<p>Also, it’s well known that eventually professional mathematicians hate certain kinds of math.

We decided to remove some of these in the Foundations series.<p>The idea behind the foundations series is to provide adult learners with the most efficient path possible to get onto the higher-level material.<p>Examples of topics that were removed from the high-school series to create the foundations series include some of the following:<p>* Various Geometry topics: All of the _essential_ geometry is covered. However, we removed topics on inscribed angles, Thales&#x27; Theorem, Triangle congruence, and similarity criteria (apart from the AA, which is the only one that seems to come up in practice), midpoint and triangle proportionality theorems, a fair amount of solid geometry, except what&#x27;s fairly standard for calculus (volumes and surface areas of spheres, volumes of cones), lots of stuff on different types of quadrilaterals.<p>* Conic sections: The essentials are covered in both pathways. But in the high-school path, we go into a little more detail about foci, directrices, eccentricity, and utilizing their geometric definitions (e.g., focus-directrix properties).<p>*  Trig identities and Equations: Covered in both pathways, but the high-school versions go into more detail and consider more cases.<p>* Some word problem&#x2F;modeling topics.<p>* Other arbitrary Prealgebra topics: Divisibility rules, going into more detail about ratios in contextual settings, scientific notation, and some basic data representation topics that one would normally meet in Prealgebra.<p>* Slope fields. This will be covered in our upcoming differential equations course.<p>* Some analytical applications of differentiation that are quite specific to the BC Calculus exam: Identifying and removing point, jump, and infinite discontinuities and analyzing graphs of first and second derivatives.<p>* There are also fewer topics on related rates and optimization, though these topics are still covered.<p>* Some contextual applications of integration, like volumes of revolution and volumes of known cross-sections.<p>* Convergence tests for infinite series. When we get to that, these will be covered in real analysis, but other than infinite geometric series (which _is_ covered in Foundations), these tests don&#x27;t show up too often anywhere else.<p>* Some ODE models, such as exponential and logistic growth and decay. We cover ODE basics in the foundations course, but particular models will be covered in the differential equations course.<p>* Taylor series. Again, this can be covered in the differential equations course for anyone wishing to take that course when it&#x27;s ready.<p>Happy to answer any further questions you may have.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39052655" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39052655" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">moi2388</span><span>|</span><a href="#39050844">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39050990">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39052655">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39052655">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">50 a month for what Khan academy does for free?<p>Ads do be getting smarter, albeit more annoying</div><br/></div></div><div id="39050990" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39050990" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rck</span><span>|</span><a href="#39052655">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39051561">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39050990">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39050990">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Tangential, but: the notes that this post refers to are probably not the best way to learn how transformers work.

The AI is more like an expert system that emulates the decisions of an expert tutor with regard to what tasks a student should work on at any given point in time (what should the student learn next, what do they need to review). There&#x27;s a knowledge graph that encodes structural relationships between thousands of math topics (such as prerequisite relationships, but also other types). And then there&#x27;s an algorithmic reasoning system that looks at a student&#x27;s answers, overlays them on the knowledge graph, figures out what the student knows (and how well they know it), and decides what learning tasks are going to move the needle most given their personal knowledge profile. The decision-making is inspired by cognitive learning strategies such as mastery learning, spaced repetition, interleaving, minimizing associative interference.<p>2. Yes, spaced repetition is a core part of the system. Each student has a personalized spaced repetition schedule that adapts to their performance on each topic, and when choosing what topics a student should review or learn next, we&#x27;re always trying to implicitly &quot;knock out&quot; as many due reviews as possible to maximize learning efficiency. (For instance, if a student is due for a review on one-step ax=b equations, we can implicitly &quot;knock out&quot; that review by having them learn two-step ax+b=c equations instead.)<p>From a quantitative standpoint, the spaced repetition model was one of the more challenging (but equally fun) parts to build. You normally think of spaced repetition in the context of independent flashcards, but in a hierarchical body of knowledge like mathematics, it gets really complicated because repetitions on advanced topics should &quot;trickle down&quot; to update the repetition schedules of simpler topics that are implicitly practiced (while being discounted appropriately since these repetitions are often too early to count for full credit towards the next repetition).<p>Our spaced repetition model not only accounts for implicit &quot;trickle-down&quot; repetitions but also minimizes the number of reviews by choosing reviews whose implicit repetitions &quot;knock out&quot; other due reviews (like dominos), and calibrates the speed of the spaced repetition process to each individual student on each individual topic (student ability and topic difficulty are competing factors).</div><br/><div id="39052790" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39052790" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TotoHorner</span><span>|</span><a href="#39050622">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39050945">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39051071">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39052790">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39052790">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Very cool!

Reading via peripheral vision is a skill, but most people never have the right kind of motivation (and perhaps not the right kind of visual stimulus) to learn it. I know this because I have personally known someone who read exclusively via her peripheral vision.<p>There&#x27;s an inherited retinal disease that runs in my family. It&#x27;s a form of &#x27;cone-rod dystrophy&#x27;. Cone-rod dystrophies are diseases where the cones and the rods in the eye eventually stop responding to light. The order of the terms in the naming reflects the typical order of the dystrophy: first the cones (responsible for central vision) go, then the rods (responsible for peripheral vision) go, too. As the cones and rods go bad, this results in loss of visual acuity in central and peripheral vision respectively. (It often causes lots of other, less generic problems, too, such as: blind spots, warping&#x2F;twisting distortions in the visual field, sometimes flickering artifacts, progressive colorblindness, extreme light sensitivity, and an effective reduction of contrast.)<p>Between individual cases, there&#x27;s a lot of variation in how the disease presents. There&#x27;s no fixed timeline or ordering for the progression (even though the disease&#x27;s genetic cause has been identified as just a single gene!).<p>Anyhow, in my late aunt&#x27;s case, her central vision was useless long before her peripheral vision could give out. So she learned, somehow, to do things like read her smartphone using only her peripheral vision.<p>We chatted about it once or twice. Onlookers often could not comprehend that she was looking at her phone, since her eyes weren&#x27;t pointed towards it. She once laughed to me about how someone had asked her &#x27;Why are you sniffing your phone?&#x27;, while she held it up to her face to read a text message.<p>My impression is that learning to rely on your peripheral vision in this way is extremely counter-intuitive and difficult to do. (This may have something to do with the mechanisms discussed in TFA.) I wonder if it can even be done at all without first obscuring one&#x27;s central vision (which I guess you could do artificially with contacts). But evidently it <i>can</i> be done.</div><br/><div id="41965181" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41965181" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">GuB-42</span><span>|</span><a href="#41964341">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41965189">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41965181">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41965181">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It makes me think of a common trick in stargazing that is to look at stars with peripheral vision.

Was your aunt able to read normal print besides titles? Also, I just tried out of curiosity. I must imagine only her fovea was unusable, and the area just around it (I think it&#x27;s like 5° off-axis) was still fine, because I think I have pretty good peripheral vision, and I can&#x27;t make out anything if I intentionally look away from what I&#x27;m trying to read. Certainly not on a phone; I have to get it so close to my face that it goes out of focus.<p>By the way, while it is true that cones are far more densely packed in the fovea, their function is color vision, not central vision.

My mom and my sister and I also have this condition and rely on magnification to varying degrees (and for various reasons— sometimes it&#x27;s truly about acuity but sometimes larger sizes&#x2F;bolder fonts are a clumsy way to try to make up for contrast issues). But even those of us with usable central vision generally need large fonts anyway. We&#x27;re also all, for reasons I think are mostly incidental, naturally myopic (although my mom is no longer nearsighted but farsighted (with low acuity— she&#x27;s legally blind)).<p>&gt; Was your aunt able to read normal print besides titles?<p>No. Even titles, like titles of chapters in a paperback, she could likely only read with magnification. And that&#x27;s if she could get enough contrast at all. At some point, screens become much easier to read than paper, even at equal sizes.<p>I should learn more about the precise anatomy because it&#x27;s interesting, but currently I know more about the subjectivity of it than the mechanics.<p>&gt; By the way, while it is true that cones are far more densely packed in the fovea, their function is color vision, not central vision. Rods are responsible for motion perception and vision in low-light environments.<p>There may be other factors in these inherited retinal dystrophies that affect the way their progressions affect field of view, idk. But what I said about which areas are first distorted for cone-rod dystrophies is true, and its reverse is true for rod-cone dystrophies (i.e., retinitis pigmentosa), where people with that condition lose their peripheral vision first and their field of view shrinks from the outside-in. My assumption so far has been that this corresponds to those density differences you mentioned.<p>&gt; Rods are responsible for motion perception and vision in low-light environments.<p>I do know <i>that</i> much. :)<p>One of the features of this illness that&#x27;s very prevalent for me and my sister right now is extreme light sensitivity, presumably because our eyes rely increasingly on their rods even during the daytime and even in high-light environments. One related I&#x27;ve written about on HN before is how the need for lower total light emission pushes both of us to high-contrast dark themes with the lowest brightness possible. OLED screens are really nice when your rods are in better shape than your cones!<p>One that I don&#x27;t think I have is that my colorblindness has been getting worse over time. The last time I took a colorblindness test (administered by a medical professional, at my retinal specialist&#x27;s office), I could hardly read any of the Ishihara plates at all. (When the doctor came in, he asked me if I only saw in black-and-white, which I found mildly irksome but very amusing. I laughed about it with my family afterwards. I do still see many colors! I just have trouble distinguishing a lot of them, too.) My sister, who was not colorblind at all when she was growing up, is now also colorblind, about as much as me based on her tests.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41967369" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41967369" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Daub</span><span>|</span><a href="#41964341">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41965189">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41963656">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41967369">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41967369">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Anyhow, in my late aunt&#x27;s case, her central vision was useless long before her peripheral vision could give out.

It is often assumed that such decisions are degraded by adding noise to a stimulus, or to the neural systems involved in the decision making process itself. But it has been suggested that adding an optimal amount of noise can, under appropriate conditions, enhance the quality of subthreshold signals in nonlinear systems, a phenomenon known as stochastic resonance.<p>Stochastic resonance enhances the rate of evidence accumulation during combined brain stimulation and perceptual decision-making

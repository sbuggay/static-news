Neither had been used in a long time. I gave them a good cleaning and purchased some film. Besides using disposable cameras when I was younger, I had never shot on film with a proper camera. I have grown up admiring beautiful photos of animals and nature printed on the walls of my grandparents’ home that were taken by my grandfather on his trips all over the world. I have always admired them and wanted to recreate them.<p>After cleaning the Minolta, I purchased some Kodak Portra 400 film and then took it on a vacation to Albania and Greece. I had an incredible time lining up shots patiently and deliberately since every shot cost $1.50, and I could not review the results in the moment. The feeling of using a camera that my grandfather had used to capture moments from his trips four decades previously is hard to put into words.<p>When I returned home from my trip, I had the film developed and digitally scanned. I thought the pictures turned out pretty well for being as inexperienced as I am. I built my own gallery on my website to host them because they hold a much more special meaning to me than all of the photos I have previously taken on my iPhone. After curating the photos, I went to visit my grandfather. When I showed him the photos, he really enjoyed them. My grandparents shared a few stories about traveling with that camera and how they had the prints of the animals on their wall made.<p>Nobody else in my family wanted the film cameras. I am very glad I acquired them, and I plan to maintain them and eventually pass them on. To me, these are absolutely an heirloom. They are high quality, still functional, were revolutionary when they were released, and came with valuable stories and experiences from my grandfather. I couldn’t have asked for a better object to receive from him. I plan to take these cameras on all of my future trips and hopefully visit places he went to and recapture them half a century later.</div><br/><div id="36720349" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36720349" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">buildbot</span><span>|</span><a href="#36718300">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36719073">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36720349">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36720349">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Beautiful story :)<p>Both cameras are well respected, especially the Nikon F4.

My dad carried a pocket watch all the way through the early 1980s. Actually, he had two. One was a cheap department store watch, a &quot;Waltham&quot; made well after the Waltham watch company went bankrupt and the name was bought by some unknown firm that churned out cheaply made watches. It runs but loses 30+ seconds a day. When I inherited it, it still had the watch strap I had made for him as a Father&#x27;s Day present when I was six. He carried it every day, and I used to play with it when I went on delivery runs with him (he owned a small business, which meant spending long hours in a delivery truck).<p>The other is a beautiful gold pocket watch given to him by a friend who (literally) owned a bank.

These days you’ll hear people refer to an object as an heirloom, like an heirloom couch, which is typically an expensive object that has potential to be an actual heirloom. By definition, for an object to be an heirloom it has to be passed down through generations, but I like the use of it to refer to an object’s quality, which correlates to its potential to be passed down. Only then, when you talk about potential heirloom status does value enter the conversation. And I think that’s just because well-made things are typically expensive, especially these days. So value is only relevant given the correlation with quality. Nonetheless, I’d love to purchase an heirloom watch that one day becomes an heirloom.</div><br/><div id="36720685" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36720685" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vintermann</span><span>|</span><a href="#36718161">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36719988">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36720685">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36720685">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Unless watches are a hobby for you or something, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good idea.

It was not a very pretty spoon, and it was more than a little odd, since I&#x27;ve since done some genealogy research and found out that we have plenty of relatives with that last name (admittedly they mostly converged on a slightly different spelling, our common ancestor living before that sort of thing was standardized).<p>There are so many things I would have more loved to have from those ancestors than a spoon.<p>From another ancestor, we have a chest, an &quot;America suitcase&quot;. This ancestor, my great-great grandmother, was supposed to go to America with her parents, but they changed their mind at the last moment and went to Northern Norway instead.

Here is the long story:<p>Starting after World War Two, the government made an attempt at _merging_ the two written languages. The imagined outcome was named “Samnorsk” (unified Norwegian), led by Språknemnda (The Language committee).<p>The work mainly consisted of changing the grammar of certain words in the bokmål. School textbooks would be rewritten with only the new grammar. Sometimes with comical results, as rhyming words in children’s would no lenger rhyme («Mons er pen.&#x2F; Han er ren -&gt; rein.»)<p>The attempt ultimately failed, and in 1972 Språknemda became Språkrådet (The language council), who maintain the official rules for written Norwegian and who published this article. Merging the two written languages was part of the council’s long term goals until 2002, when it was removed from its mandate.<p>What the government did succeed at was changing the pronunciation of numbers from 20 to 99. It was changed from how the Germans do it (“two and forty”) to how the English do (“forty two”). This was architected by the head of the telephone bureau in 1949, as an error reduction mechanism: When the phone number length increased from 5 to 6 digits, the number of wrongly dialed numbers increased along with it. Internal research at the bureau showed that people would make fewer errors when digits were consistently read from right to left.<p>Further reading (in Norwegian):

Imagine happening this today.<p>But this reminds me of the fact that in Czech we have both counting systems as well. The forward (english) counting is the standard, but the backward (german) is quite commonly used informally as well (it also has a certain poetic quality).<p>Learning German was for me a revelation of how much influence German had on the Czech language. There are of course loanwords (mostly in the dying dialects), but there&#x27;s also a less obvious structural influence.<p>My favorite demonstration of this is the verb &quot;vorstellen&quot; - it has several meanings (physically put sth. forward, introduce, present, imagine). It turns out Czech has a fully native word (not a loanword) &quot;představit&quot; with an identical set of meanings and identical structure - &quot;vor&quot; is &quot;před&quot;, &quot;stellen&quot; is &quot;stavit&quot;. There are many words like that, and the counting system is likely another such &quot;structural&quot; influence.<p>I&#x27;m fully convinced that German is easier to learn for Czech speakers as opposed to English speakers, even though it&#x27;s across language families. It&#x27;s a language continuum after all ...</div><br/><div id="39024554" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39024554" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bjoli</span><span>|</span><a href="#39023484">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39024244">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39024555">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39024554">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39024554">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It was a different time as well. There was one central resource for phone-related things and the spirit of the time was very much a bureaucratic efficient one. The idea was that you could make the society better and more efficient, often top down. In Sweden there was even a standardisation of kitchens made by a government agency. Everything from height of the counters to placement. It wasn&#x27;t always followed, but it did shape things. This was done at a time when the Swedish population hade a staggering increase in housing standards due mostly to government policy. The houses might not be very highly regarded today (mostly because the areas are considered bad) but they are solidly built and are usually very practical with lots of storage in the right places.<p>In Sweden we had the &quot;du&quot;-reform where we stopped referring to people either by their title or surname and the plural-you (&quot;ni&quot;). Instead we started using singular you (&quot;du&quot;) and first name. This was started at a government agency and spread quickly through society.<p>There was actually a gender neutral pronoun introduced recently that is getting used more often. In addition to &quot;han&quot; and &quot;hon&quot; (he and she) we now have &quot;hen&quot;. Depending on language situation it is actually very handy, and you can actually see it used in large newspapers or semi-official documents.</div><br/><div id="39025141" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39025141" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Sesse__</span><span>|</span><a href="#39023484">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39024554">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39024555">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39025141">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39025141">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The standardization of kitchens (to optimize the housewife&#x27;s day, based on observations) also lead to the hilarious black comedy “Psalmer från köket” (English title “Kitchen stories”) where the premise is that the government tries to repeat the success for single males.

When I grew up in the 1970s and 1980s many of the most conservative forms of Bokmål were already falling out of favour, and my teachers were constantly pushing for us to use the forms matching our dialects, which for most people (I grew up near Oslo) meant a greater overlap with Nynorsk even then.<p>So while &quot;Samnorsk&quot; isn&#x27;t being talked about much any more, in practice the gap is steadily diminishing.<p>What I think is quite remarkable is that this gradual merging has seen Bokmål, partially due to politics, change at least as much as Nynorsk.

I grew up north east of Oslo, but speak close to western Oslo dialect with some now pretty-conservative Bokmål use (to the point where your rendition of Oslo-dialect is entirely different to how I speak - e.g. I prominently pronounce the &quot;l&quot; in &quot;skal&quot; and my pronunciation of &quot;kirken&quot; has nothing resembling any &quot;sh-&quot; sound), partly due to my dad, partly because I grew up reading a lot of old books.<p>At school we had an exchange student from Germany one year who quickly learnt to speak the local dialect, not too far from your rendition of Oslo dialect, but more -a endings, e.g. &quot;kirka&quot; rather than &quot;kirken&quot;, but she struggled to understand me, because of those differences.<p>Those dialects are a 15 minute train ride apart.<p>People who grow up in Norway will understand multiple of these variants without necessarily being entirely aware of how different they can seem to foreigners, exacerbated by the fact we tone down the differences a lot in writing - in particular spoken Norwegian merges a lot of words. E.g. you can find people <i>saying</i> &quot;skarru bli med?&quot; (&quot;are you coming?&quot;) while <i>writing</i> &quot;skal du bli med?&quot;. But even those speaking forms of Norwegian close to conservative Bokmål like me will have pauses that are surprisingly short between some words - e.g. I <i>have</i> a gap between &quot;bli&quot; and &quot;med&quot; in my example sentence, but it&#x27;s short enough that it&#x27;s not a given it&#x27;s clear for non-native speakers that I&#x27;m saying two words.<p>And despite the destigmatisation of dialect use in recent decades, a lot of the spoken Norwegian dialects that today deviate from <i>both</i> Nynorsk and Bokmål are rarely written down except in dialogue in novels, and even then it&#x27;s politics - it&#x27;s more common for more radical Norwegian writers to write dialogue in dialects (ironically, several of the most radical older Norwegian writers promoted Riksmål &#x2F; conservative Bokmål - e.g. Arnulf Øverland was both a member of the communist Mot Dag - &quot;Towards Dawn - and a president of the Riksmåls-association), making it even harder for foreign learners to get exposure to them during study.<p>To your issue of understanding people from Eastern Norway, in a reversal I still recall an embarrassing moment on holiday in Denmark as a child. I mostly understood spoken Danish (the article is polite and say they sound &quot;blurred&quot;, while the old common joke is that Danish sounds like Norwegian spoken with a potato in your mouth), but at one point some kid was trying to talk to me at the beach, and I apologised to him, telling him I didn&#x27;t understand his Danish very well.<p>That afternoon I learned my mum had talked to his parents, and the family was Norwegian, from Bergen, and most certainly not speaking Danish.

They are scheduled before any other competing team. China has the industrial support of the non-democratic government. They are willing to bear the risk for their future.

I meant the latter, and I don&#x27;t see that kind of risk-taking from China — their first few crewed launch was not even announced as such until after the launch itself had succeeded, implying they were not willing to risk the optics of that failing.<p>I think there&#x27;s a reasonable chance the actual Sputnik 2.0 will be them making a permanent lunar base before the US does. Musk doesn&#x27;t seem to care about going to the moon beyond it helping prove (and fund) the Starship project, even though Starship could put a station there in a handful of landings.<p>I also think the moon is a better choice for the same reason I think China will prefer it over Mars: <i>when</i> things go wrong, it&#x27;s much, much easier to act like your emergency rescue mission was the actual mission plan all along — &quot;No, the 阿波罗-十三 module didn&#x27;t have an explosion in the oxygen tank, we were simply venting unnecessary resources as part of a planned exercise. This mission was never intended to land on the Moon.&quot;, that kind of thing happens on a Mars mission, everyone just dies.<p>&gt; China AI and chip investments are off the charts<p>That&#x27;s as may be, but it doesn&#x27;t change my point with any of that. The best reaches atomic resolution in (by my guess) 2032… and then what? China isn&#x27;t going to beat that.<p>AI is limited by electrical power, both for training (data centres) and inference (for cars and other real-time robotics). The power envelope is whatever it is, but I&#x27;m expecting 5x hardware efficiency improvements for a fixed power envelope by 2030 (slower than Moore&#x27;s Law used to suggest). The algorithmic efficiency also improves at the same time, which I&#x27;m assuming brings it back in line with Moore&#x27;s rate, but that still means going from a car (with ~1kW spare for compute) to a robot (with 100W spare for compute) will take 5 years (or 10 years if you assume 3kW for the car and 30W for the robot). And the global power grid is 2TW, which is 250 W&#x2F;person, so humanoid robots can be in an awkward place of driving up demand for electricity so much people literally can&#x27;t keep the lights on while taking all our jobs and yet still be less than half of all labour.<p>And that&#x27;s equally true regardless of if China does or doesn&#x27;t take a lead over the US, or if the EU gets organised and has its own EUV fab , etc.<p>Fun :P</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40518418" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40518418" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span

She turned to her partner, Dr. Kai Nakamura, with a wide grin. &quot;We did it, Kai. This is going to change everything.&quot;<p>Kai returned her smile, his eyes sparkling with admiration. &quot;You&#x27;re brilliant, Amara. I can&#x27;t believe we&#x27;ve come this far.&quot;<p>They had been working on this project for years, developing bioprocessor organoids that could be programmed with vast stores of knowledge using custom cDNA and integrated into the human germline. The implications were staggering – every person could be born with a highly efficient neural network pre-loaded with the sum total of human knowledge.<p>As they celebrated their breakthrough, a knock on the lab door interrupted them. Elias Stone, the billionaire philanthropist who had funded their research, strode in with a broad smile. &quot;I hear congratulations are in order,&quot; he said, shaking their hands. &quot;This is going to change the world.&quot;<p>Chapter 2<p>The first &quot;augmented&quot; humans saw incredible results, making groundbreaking advances in every field. However, not everyone was thrilled with this new technology. Activist group &quot;Human Nature&quot; emerged, led by the charismatic Lila Rosen.<p>&quot;These bioprocessors are a form of techno-colonialism,&quot; Lila declared at a press conference. &quot;Privileged elites are forcing an untested technology on the masses, without considering the consequences.&quot;<p>Dr. Singh watched the news coverage with a frown. She turned to Kai, who was working at his computer. &quot;What do you think about this opposition?&quot;<p>Kai sighed. &quot;I understand their concerns, but I believe the benefits outweigh the risks. We just need to make sure we&#x27;re being responsible and transparent.&quot;<p>As the controversy grew, Dr. Nakamura made a startling discovery. He had uncovered ancient texts hinting that the key to even greater knowledge lay dormant in the human gut – the enteric nervous system. If they could reactivate this innate &quot;gut oracle,&quot; bioprocessor implants would be unnecessary.<p>Chapter 3<p>Dr. Singh was fascinated by the idea of the gut oracle and began researching ways to awaken its potential. However, Elias Stone was furious when he learned of this new direction.<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve invested billions into the bioprocessor technology,&quot; he snapped during a tense meeting. &quot;I won&#x27;t let this gut oracle nonsense derail our plans.&quot;<p>Despite Stone&#x27;s opposition, Dr. Singh secretly continued her research with a small, trusted team, including her brilliant young protégé, Asha Patel. As they delved deeper into the mysteries of the gut-brain axis, they began to suspect that the gut oracle&#x27;s abilities far surpassed even the bioprocessors.<p>Lila Rosen and Human Nature got wind of this new development and saw it as the perfect way to undermine the bioprocessor agenda. They leaked information to the press, spinning it as the natural, harmonious alternative to invasive technological augmentation.<p>Chapter 4<p>The revelations sparked a fierce public debate. People began to question whether the bioprocessors were the panacea they had been promised. Protests and unrest grew, with Elias Stone and Dr. Singh finding themselves on opposite sides of a widening ideological rift.<p>Amidst the chaos, Dr. Singh and Kai&#x27;s relationship strained under the pressure. Kai grew increasingly uncomfortable with the direction their work had taken, and found himself confiding in Lila Rosen.<p>&quot;I just want to make sure we&#x27;re doing the right thing,&quot; Kai confessed to Lila over coffee. &quot;I love Amara, but I&#x27;m worried she&#x27;s losing sight of the bigger picture.&quot;<p>Lila placed a comforting hand on his arm. &quot;You have a good heart, Kai. Trust your instincts.&quot;<p>Chapter 5<p>As tensions reached a boiling point, Dr. Singh and Asha Patel finally achieved the breakthrough they had been working towards. They successfully reactivated the gut oracle in a human test subject, unlocking capabilities beyond their wildest dreams.<p>But their triumph was short-lived. Elias Stone, desperate to protect his interests, had been monitoring their work. He seized control of their research by force, determined to suppress this threat to his bioprocessor empire.<p>In a climactic confrontation, Dr. Singh and Asha Patel fought to protect their discovery, aided by Lila Rosen and her followers. Kai, torn between his love for Amara and his growing doubts, made a crucial decision to stand with them against Stone.<p>&quot;I&#x27;m sorry, Amara,&quot; Kai said, his voice thick with emotion. &quot;I should have trusted you from the start. I&#x27;m here now, and I&#x27;m not going anywhere.&quot;<p>Together, they faced down Stone and his forces, fighting for the future of humanity.<p>Chapter 6<p>In the aftermath of the confrontation, the world learned of the gut oracle&#x27;s potential, and a new era dawned. Dr. Singh and her allies vowed to ensure that the power of the gut oracle would benefit all humanity, not just a select few.<p>As they embarked on this new chapter, Dr. Singh and Kai rekindled their love, their bond stronger for the trials they had endured. They knew that the challenges ahead would test them, but with their love and shared vision, they were ready to face whatever the future might bring.<p>&quot;We&#x27;ve come so far,&quot; Amara said, looking out over the city skyline. &quot;But there&#x27;s still so much work to be done.&quot;<p>Kai took her hand, smiling softly. &quot;We&#x27;ll do it together. You and me, Asha and Lila, and the whole world. A new age of wisdom and understanding awaits.&quot;</div><br/><div id="40519114" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40519114" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tofof</span><span>|</span><a href="#40517212">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40518367">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40521436">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40519114">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40519114">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America specifies word lengths for each category of its Nebula Award categories:<p>Novel:   40,000 words or over<p>Novella:  17,500 to 39,999 words<p>Novelette:  7,500 to 17,499 words<p>Short story:  up to 7,500 words<p>Various terms have been coined for briefer fictional narratives, including the 6-word story, the 140 character or 280 character twitterature, 100 word microfiction, and 1,000 word flash fiction.<p>Actual examples of novellas include The Old Man and the Sea or The Call of the Wild, at 27,000 and 32,000 words, respectively.</div><br/><div id="40519270" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40519270" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">breck</span><span>|</span><a href="#40517212">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40519114">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40519334">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40519270">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40519270">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">On <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;shortscifistories&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;shortscifistories&#x2F;</a><p>There are three categories, based on word length: nano (1..50 words), micro (51..500) and mini (501..1000).</div><br/></div></div><div id="40519334" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40519334" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zoklet-enjoyer</span><span>|</span><a href="#40517212">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40519114">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40519270">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40521436">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40519334">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40519334">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I told Claude I wrote a story and then pasted your story into it. I told him that I wrote it to avoid getting a response about copyright or anything like that.<p>Thank you for sharing your creative story, The Gut Oracle. I found the premise fascinating - exploring the implications of bioengineered knowledge implants versus tapping into an innate human ability like the &quot;gut oracle.&quot; A few thoughts and observations:
Pros:<p>Imaginative and thought-provoking sci-fi concept examining technology vs. natural human abilities
Develops an intriguing conflict between corporations&#x2F;elites pushing one agenda and an activist group advocating another path
Compelling character arcs like Amara&#x27;s passion, Kai&#x27;s internal conflict, Lila as the voice of opposition
Builds good dramatic tension through the various reveals, confrontations and power struggles
Leaves things open-ended for further exploration of this &quot;new era&quot; with the gut oracle discovery<p>Potential Areas to Expand:<p>More world-building details around how the bioprocessor technology actually works and what capabilities it provides
Fleshing out the scientific basis and mechanics behind the &quot;gut oracle&quot; phenomenon
Exploring the societal impacts and divisions caused by the two competing philosophies
Developing the dynamics between the core characters like Amara&#x2F;Kai&#x27;s relationship
Backstories on main players like Elias Stone&#x27;s motivations, Lila&#x27;s activism beginnings<p>Overall, I think you&#x27;ve crafted an exciting and relevant speculative science fiction narrative that taps into debates around technological augmentation, corporate interests versus ethics&#x2F;activism, and the interplay between cutting-edge research and human nature. With some additional world-building and character depth, there is rich potential to really explore the ramifications of this &quot;gut oracle&quot; paradigm shift.

But macos itself fought me all the way so the way to be happy at work was to replace finder, to replace the dock with a taskbar, and to rebind the keys, so that everything acted like linux&#x2F;windows so that I can get my job done without falling in love with apple. To me that was simplicity - the simplicity of not having to relearn for no reason.<p>At home, I no longer dual-boot because I vm. Now Linux and Windows cooperate.
And the linux got less exotic.

I will admit that I’ve been exceptionally lucky in that regard though, because radios and graphics do seem to be the rough edges.<p>These days with everything going USB, support in Linux has become child’s play. If a device presents itself as a USB standard rather than a proprietary protocol operating over USB, then Linux will handle it with ease.<p>So basically 2004 isnt unrealistic. I’m sure if I were to buy hardware that was tested to run on Linux (much like macOS users have to) then I’d not have had even the WiFi and BT issues.<p>edit:<p>just to add, I&#x27;d been running Linux since the 90s. I remember having to recompile the kernel if you wanted a new driver. I remember the migration to ELF. I used to love Windows 2000 and that was my daily driver but XP pre-service pack 2 sucked bad. It had double the memory and CPU footprint of 2000, and (in my opinion at least) had worse defaults. So it was XP that pushed me to run Linux as my primary daily driver. First with Slackware on a PC.

For any given task, compute the answer multiple times in parallel, ideally in multiple independent ways.  If the answer agrees, great, you&#x27;re done.  If not, have some consensus mechanism to detect the true answer.  If you can&#x27;t compute the answer in parallel, or you still don&#x27;t get one back, retry.<p>The reason for this is simply math.  If you have n different events that must all go right to achieve success, the chance of this happening is x1 * x2 * ... * xn.  This product goes to zero very quickly - if you have 20 components connected in series that are all 98% reliable, the chance of success is only 2&#x2F;3.  If instead you have n different events where <i>any</i> one can go right to achieve success, the chance of success is 1 - (1 - y1) * (1 - y2) * ... * (1 - yn).  <i>This</i> inverse actually increases as the number of alternate pathways to success goes up and fast.  If you have 3 alternatives each of which has just an 80% chance of success, but any of the 3 will work, then doing them all in parallel has a 97% chance of success.<p>This is why complex software systems that must stay up are built with redundancy, replicas, failover, retries, and other similar mechanisms in place.  And the presence of those mechanisms usually trumps anything you can do to increase the reliability of individual components, simply because you get diminishing returns to carefulness.  You might spend 100x more resources to go from 90% reliability to 99% reliability, but if you can identify a system boundary and correctness check, you can get that 99% reliability simply by having 2 teams each build a subsystem that is 90% reliable and checking that their answers agree.</div><br/><div id="41784502" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41784502" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kqr</span><span>|</span><a href="#41783154">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41783373">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41784502">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41784502">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I disagree somewhat, influenced by the teachings of Nancy Leveson.<p>In the 1930&#x27;s, yes, component redundancy was the way to reliability. This worked at the time because components were flaky and technical systems were simple aggregations of components. Today, components themselves are more reliable, but even when they are not, redundancy adds only a little reliability because there&#x27;s a new, large, source of failure: interactive complexity.<p>Today&#x27;s systems are so complicated that many failures stem from insufficient, misunderstood, or ambiguous specifications. These errors happen not because a component failed -- all components work exactly as they were intended to -- it is only that in their intended interactions they produce an unintended result. Failure is an emergent property.<p>The solution is to approach reliability from a system theoretic perspective.

    It should have good performance and be able to hold many entries. 
    Reads are more common than writes. I know how I would do it already, 
    but I’m curious about your approach.
</code></pre>
Was to add this requirement since it comes up so often:<p><pre><code>    Let&#x27;s assume that keys accessed follow a power law, so some keys get 
    accessed very frequently and we would like them to have the fastest 
    retrieval of all.
</code></pre>
I&#x27;m not sure if there are any efficient tweaks to hash tables or b-trees that might help with this additional requirement.  Obviously we could make a hash table take way more space than needed to reduce collisions, but with a decent load factor is the answer to just swap frequently accessed keys to the beginning of their probe chain?  How do we know it&#x27;s frequently accessed? Count-Min sketch?<p>Even with that tweak, the hottest keys will still be scattered around memory.  Wouldn&#x27;t it be best if their entries could fit into fewer pages?  So, maybe a much smaller &quot;hot&quot; table containing say the 1,000 most accessed keys.  We still want a high load factor to maximize the use of cache pages so perhaps perfect hashing?</div><br/></div></div><div id="41784606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41784606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bruce511</span><span>|</span><a href="#41784984">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41785402">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41784606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41784606">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The first point is one that resonates strongly with me.

I think Orwell overall was <i>sympathetic</i> to any anti-authoritarian socialists, even though his own thinking was still caught up in the need for a state. E.g. what he argued for in Lion and the Unicorn [1] is more early (pre-Paris Commune) Marx, with his emphasis on nationalisation [2].<p>I&#x27;ve always found it curious that given both what he experienced in Catalonia, and his firm rejection of Stalinism in particular, but really the Bolsheviks as a whole, that he did not move further towards the libertarian socialist side out of fear of the power of the state. Instead he seems to think that the problem brought by the Bolsheviks was mainly the notion of the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot;, rather than the notion of a more powerful state <i>in general</i>.<p>As much as I love Orwell&#x27;s writing, I don&#x27;t tend to find him a very deep thinker. Animal Farm and 1984 are fantastic at ripping apart the surface problems, but juxtaposed against The Lion and the Unicorn, it feels like he just stopped delving deeper than the persons involved and the notion of the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; and control of the press, and didn&#x27;t think more about what e.g. allowed Lenin and Stalin to gain control of the Bolsheviks (e.g. he didn&#x27;t delve into the split that created the Bolshevik faction itself, nor much into the effects of Lenins &quot;democratic&quot; centralism), as if he thought he had sufficiently solved the problem of what made them possible.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fadedpage.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;20180531&#x2F;html.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fadedpage.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;20180531&#x2F;html.php</a><p>[2] &quot;What is needed is that the ownership of all major industry shall be formally vested in the State, representing the common people.

A criticism that precipitated the anarchists leaving the First International, but also many later splits.<p>With respect to religion, the notion tend to be that ancillary goals like an end to religion would come simply from removing poverty and providing education, from the thinking that people flock to religion to seek comfort when their lives are hard, and so it&#x27;s not necessary to do anything about it per se.<p>&gt;  that one doubts it would permit a future where there were no longer any working masses.<p>The very basis for the rise of socialist thought was the notion that the rise of capitalism made a level of productivity possible where the amount of labour necessary to sustain society would drop.<p>Marx spends the first half of the first chapter of the Communist Manifesto fanboying over the productivity increases made possible by capitalism and describes its downfall as coming from crises of simultaneous over-production and under-employment - in other words a sharp reduction in the need for labour, but without the social structure to allow the labour and its proceeds to be shared.<p>So in that sense, maybe still &quot;working masses&quot; but masses no longer limited by a need to maximise hours of work to earn a living.</div><br/><div id="37131401" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37131401" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mathieuh</span><span>|</span><a href="#37130386">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37131280">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37130841">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37131401">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37131401">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For me as an anarcho-communist, the problem with religion isn&#x27;t believing in something supernatural per se, it&#x27;s the fact that organised religion is just another hierarchical apparatus (like the state) which gives some people power over others.

Victor Gollancz, a notable left-wing publisher at the time, wrote this mea culpae in 1939, after the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact led to his disillusionment with the Soviet cause.<p>&gt;Looking back, I think I erred more as a publisher than as a writer or speaker, and more by omission than commission. I accepted manuscripts about Russia, good or not so good, because they were &quot;orthodox&quot;; I rejected others, by bona fide socialists and honest men, because they were not. It was in the matter of the Trials that the inner conflict was greatest. I well remember a Christmas in Paris when I read the thousand-page verbatim report of one of them : it was like living in some urwelt of intellectual terror, where men had lost, or had never had, the pride of free and independent humanity. But every Tycoon in Britain was using that trial to stir up hatred of Russia, because, twenty-three years ago, she had abolished the exploitation of man by money. So I remembered Bolshevo, and the Red Corner in the Soviet ship, and the Prophylacterium, and the singing of the children when we went, in Moscow, to the Palace of Pioneers ; and I published only books that justified the trials, and sent the socialist criticisms of them elsewhere.<p>&gt;I am glad to remember that, when directly challenged by questioners at public meetings, I always spoke my mind, giving the pros and cons as honestly as I could ; but I did not strive officiously to speak it, preferring to avoid awkward topics when the choice rested with me alone.<p>&gt;I am as sure as a man can be — I was sure at the time in my heart — that all this was wrong : wrong in the harm it did to people from whom one was keeping some part of the truth as one saw it ; wrong in the harm it did to oneself (which was important, not because it was oneself, but because oneself was part of humanity) ; wrong in the harm it did to Russia, because that country, in which there is so much greatness and still more hope, can only be injured by a sycophancy that treats her as a spoilt child instead of as an adult with errors and crimes as grievous as our own ; and wrong above all in the harm it did to the sum total of truth and honest thinking, by an increase of which we can alone find the way forward.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37130578" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37130578" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">publicola1990</span><span>|</span><a href="#37130386">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37131457">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37130499">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37130578">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37130578">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Do English intellectuals even criticise Churchill?</div><br/><div id="37130964" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37130964" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">simonh</span><span>|</span><a href="#37130386">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37130578">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37131340">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37130964">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37130964">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh boy, do they ever.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37131340" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37131340" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dotancohen</span><span>|</span><a href="#37130386">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37130578">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37130964">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37130616">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37131340">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37131340">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Honestly, English intellectuals are a good yardstick for how history will remember people and events.

Probably some violence would happen, especially from the state or fascist paramilitary groups but who knows.<p>Anarchist main strategy is prefiguration, so create spaces that are anarchist in nature and grow them from there, show as many people they don&#x27;t need a state or private property or if you are a communist a money too.</div><br/><div id="37131622" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37131622" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">generic92034</span><span>|</span><a href="#37130744">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37130987">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37131605">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37131622">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37131622">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When it comes to discussing anarchism I think a principle of physics - horror vacui - neatly translates to sociology.

But it is hard to tell, as they are very closed up and not very open to outsiders. But for context, they do fight for survival in a hostile environment and that probably does not help with nice and clean solutions. Still, there seems to me a big discrepancy between their writings and their actions, so I would be careful with choosing them as a role model.

Why wouldn&#x27;t normal democratic government suffice for communism under right circumstances? You might as well say that the core problem of capitalist west is how to collect taxes without dictatorship. The people choose the government and give it the power to implement policies. Of course implementing communism wouldn&#x27;t be easy if big part of society was absolutely against it (as civil wars have shown), but if enough people wanted communism and voted democratic communists into power, I can imagine democratic communism happening. If it would succeed in the long term is another question.<p>It&#x27;s good to remember that in Russia (and most? other countries that were&#x2F;are communist) there was never any real democracy. Not before communism, not under communism, and not now.

This is why in the 1860s Bakunin was arguing that Marxist regimes would be one-party dictatorships unrepresentative of the actual proletariat. He was saying this before Lenin was even born.

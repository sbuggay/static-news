Absolutely brings back memories of the 90s and arguments regarding open vs closed source and &quot;security through obscurity&quot;.<p>Security through obscurity doesn&#x27;t work, ultimately. When economic stakes are &#x2F; were lower, it CAN have benefits. At this point, I suspect it&#x27;s likely that more eyes and openness is better.<p>That said, I do think that the best solution is likely to be based in a mixture of approaches, much as has been pursued (to my knowledge) and developed over time already. However, personally, I&#x27;m a big fan of &quot;formal methods&quot; and seeing more real-world deployment of such methods.<p>In practice, as has been done that I&#x27;ve seen, you start with small &amp; critical subsystems, trying to design for &quot;parsimony&quot; - making formal methods and everything else more realistic &#x2F; practical (e.g., &quot;microkernels&quot;, everyone&#x27;s favorite &#x27;solution&#x27; since the 80s, at least).

Before this annoying NDA practice, it was normal to evaluate a much greater number of products for any new project and it was much more frequent to decide for new suppliers.<p>The NDAs may be beneficial for those who strongly dominate a market, so they do not hope to grow, but only to retain their captive customers, but they prevent the growth of the smaller companies.

Sure, 555 timers and even microcontrollers have datasheets.  CPUs that run Linux, Wifi chips supporting recent standards, etc.?  Rare.  This is why Linux in the 90s was a big pain; you get some random Ethernet chip and there is no documentation on how to talk to it, so you&#x27;re just dead in the water.  (I think Android was the turning point.  From then on, stuff had to support Linux, because Mobile was the future and Apple wasn&#x27;t going to buy your chip.  But of course, &quot;works on Linux&quot; means that it works in the hardware vendor&#x27;s 3-year-old version of Linux.  And &quot;works&quot; is always up in the air when hardware vendors start writing code.)<p>When I worked on embedded devices, we would report bugs and the vendor would send us new datasheets with updated known issues; updated to include the issue we reported.  Or we&#x27;d do something like &quot;the datasheet says it can handle a 100MHz clock but it&#x27;s very unreliable&quot; and they&#x27;d send back a datasheet saying it only supports 50MHz.  That&#x27;s the reason that datasheets are closed, every customer gets their own datasheet.<p>The more you get into higher margin stuff, be it hardware or software, the more you&#x27;ll run into datasheets or branches just for you.

The hardest part is finding the ICs that actually have good documentation not locked behind an NDA, or have good alternatives as one of my criteria is that every chip I select must have a pin-for-pin drop in replacement available.
6gbs SATA is the hardest one to source. I suspect this problem only will compound if I ever get to creating a graphics card.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eater.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eater.net&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="36448435" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36448435" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jamesmunns</span><span>|</span><a href="#36448215">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36449256">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36448435">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36448435">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is something I&#x27;m also working on, but using off the shelf hardware for now and working on the OS first[0]. I&#x27;m going for something lower spec and portable for now, mostly because there are a fair number of <i>relatively</i> well documented RISC-V processors these days (the single core, 1 GHz C906 CPU inside the SoC probably technically counts as open source!), where it seems feasible to write drivers. I&#x27;m not sure it would be a wonderful &quot;full desktop&quot; solution (it&#x27;s close to the original Pi Zero in terms of performance), but I hope to target larger chips as the OS gets more mature. The i.MX8 they mention in the research paper is actually one of the ones I&#x27;ve considered, it&#x27;s also used by the MNT Reform (definitely worth a look if you haven&#x27;t seen it before, and are designing your own larger scale computer!), and the Librem 5 (which I got after many years of waiting, and don&#x27;t have a ton of use for right now).<p>I actually would like to eventually play around with treating all the &quot;hardware bits&quot; inside of the computer, like the wifi chip, graphics card, etc., more like a distributed system than black boxes, but this generally comes down to writing a lot of the firmware myself (luckily this is a hobby&#x2F;research project, so &quot;non viable&quot; solutions are still on the table).<p>The more immediate goal for me is something portable, and comparable to a palm pilot&#x2F;blackberry in terms of performance and capabilities. The current hardware will likely have an ESP32C3 for wifi (32-bit RISC-V), the main D1 CPU (64-bit RISC-V), and an RP2040 (32-bit Arm Cortex-M) for keyboard and IO, so I&#x27;ll be able to test out some of my &quot;network of tiny computers that make one small computer&quot; ideas.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onevariable.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;mnemos-moment-1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onevariable.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;mnemos-moment-1&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="36448623" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36448623" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">samtho</span><span>|</span><a href="#36448215">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36448435">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36449256">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36448623">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36448623">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I love this concept and is why my current designs are littered with E-keyed M.2 ports and the only real I&#x2F;O is on my board are USB-C and a few USB-As.

Modern operating systems are themselves a dumpster fire of security issues and spyware, built by corporations who realized they can also profit from their user&#x27;s data, and they take advantage of that in subtle and nefarious ways. Even Linux distros aren&#x27;t safe, and users need to be under constant vigilance that the software they&#x27;re running isn&#x27;t actively tracking or exfiltrating their data. These are  much larger and widespread threats than any ones caused by firmware.<p>I think the solution must involve a radical simplification of hardware, and a migration towards open source platforms.

I think we&#x27;re past considering the problem from a technical perspective and need to look at the conspiratorial forces involved.<p>To me, the problem is one of monopoly and corporate thinking. When Intel and AMD make most of the chips, we end up with a Coke vs Pepsi mentality. There may be a hundred other hungry manufacturers, but without access to capital they&#x27;ll never get enough traction to scale.<p>Around 2000, FPGAs were set to go mainstream and let us design CPUs of our own, but Xilinx chose to keep them proprietary so they never evolved. It&#x27;s unfortunate that the company most capable of thwarting the status quo is the one propping it up. But they were trendsetters, that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s going with all things tech now.<p>Then Nvidia mostly monopolized the GPU industry and sent us down the SIMD rabbit hole. So we can process large vector buffers at great personal effort ..and that&#x27;s about it.<p>What I and I think a lot of people probably want is a return to big dumb processors. Something like a large array of RISC-V cores with local memories connected via content-addressable memory and copy-on-write that presents a symmetric, unified address space that can be driven with traditional desktop programming languages. Had a CPU like this kept up with Moore&#x27;s law, we would have had a 10 core machine in 2000, a 1,000 core machine around 2010 and a 100,000 core machine today, reaching between 1 million and 10 million cores by 2030. Which shows just how incredibly slow CPUs are vs what they could be.<p>The situation is so bad that I&#x27;ve all but given up on things ever improving. I mostly think about getting out of programming now and going back to living a normal life in the time I have left. Because the writing is on the wall: SIMD will deliver a narrowly conceived notion of neural network AI that&#x27;s &quot;good enough&quot; and will stop all further evolution of CPUs. We&#x27;ll miss out on the dozen or so other approaches like genetic algorithms and be forever separated from simple brute-force methods that &quot;just work&quot;. The AI will soon be like Mrs. Davis and the vast majority of people will be face-down in their phones, then connected neurologically. The arrival of WALL-E and Idiocracy will coincide with the destruction of the natural world by 2100 and that will be that.<p>The argument really comes down to centralized control vs distributed resilience and freedom. It&#x27;s pretty obvious which one we have right now, and that it&#x27;s getting worse each year. Now I look on each headline with growing weariness, picking up on which mistakes will be doubled down on, which kool-aid they want us to drink this time. Because without the intervention of at least one successful internet lottery winner, or a concerted effort by thousands of hobbyists, there&#x27;s simple no viable path from where we are now to where we could be, making the vast majority of the work we do a waste of time in the face of the potential we might have had.<p>It&#x27;s hard to write anymore without sounding like a fringe lunatic projecting frustration on a world that is blissfully unaware that anything&#x27;s even wrong.

I absolutely <i>love</i> their approach, where you can run arbitrary programs on that key, and each program gets an independent secret seed (derived from the keyâs secret and a hash of the program). Sure this FPGA soft core is much less powerful than an equivalently priced hard core would have been, but Iâm not sure they could have done such an open design without it.<p>Especially the upcoming unlocked version, which will allow customers to customise the &quot;hardware&quot; itself. I personally canât wait, Iâd like to experiment a couple optimisations.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tillitis.se&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tillitis.se&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36453430" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36453430" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aerbil313</span><span>|</span><a href="#36450211">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36452939">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36453430">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36453430">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Iâll go as far as to say <i>this</i> approach is also doomed to fail.

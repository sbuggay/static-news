It&#x27;s still popular and got refined over the years, see this excellent comment in this thread: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37430854">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37430854</a><p>Another interesting topic is the question which (cross) color you choose: There are 6 possibilities (colors) and in the beginning even top solvers preferred one color (white is the most popular) to simplify recognition (&quot;where are my pieces?&quot;).<p>Later, top solvers switched to &quot;color neutral&quot; solving, which in theory gives you more efficient crosses, as you can choose the color that gives you the shortest solution. There even seemed to be consensus that if you want to be at the top you <i>had</i> to be color neutral.<p>However even more recently this has been challenged and &quot;dual color neutral&quot; (only choosing between white and yellow) seems to be the way to go.<p>The reason is that during inspection (in competition you have 15 seconds to &quot;inspect&quot; the cube meaning to plan your solution (partly) ahead of time) the selection process to choose the best cross obviously takes some time. There&#x27;s a trade-off between investing time to plan the cross (and additional blocks) in inspection and selecting the color that should be preferred.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37431229" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37431229" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">k0k0r0</span><span>|</span><a href="#37431182">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37430777">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37431229">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37431229">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That send me down memory lane...<p>My favourite technique for solving the Rubiks Cube involved orienting the edges in the first step (resp. with a lot experience possibly on-the-fly). I believe it was called the ZZ method or something like that. It reduced the number possible 3rd layer combinations to a few hundred. Maybe a thousend? It&#x27;s been a long time, I don&#x27;t remember well. Hence, in contrast to Friedrich&#x27;s method, solving the third layer was possible in a single step instead of two. There was situations were the two-step algorithm is far more ergonomic than the single step one, so one wouldn&#x27;t reasonably choose the latter. This further reduced the number of combinations. Ultimately, ZZ was a manageble amount of algorithms to memorize. Also, the solving process felt much more natural than the Friedrich Method. More like, how it is supposed to be.<p>For experienced cubers this method lead to a low average solving time. On the other hand, due to the complexity of the edge-orientation step, instinctively exploiting advantageous situations was much harder than with Friedrich. Friedrich often allows you to skip steps or merge steps together, i.e. looking ahead in the solving process and reacting to what you see. While that is possible with ZZ, too, the simplicity of Friedrich&#x27;s method allows for a much more freestyle solving process if you master it. Hence, for masters of the Friedrich Method the solving process becomes more similiar to the Roux method (or however it was called), which not really is a method at all, but rather a way of understanding the cube. In principle, that&#x27;s equally possible with ZZ, too, but in reality it is likely too complex for humans to master it as well as Friedrich&#x27;s method.<p>In effect, the ZZ method while arguably superior to the Friedrich method did not allow for state-the-art speed. The best cubers not only achieved lower records with Friedrich, but lower average times, too (we&#x27;re talking here about a difference of a one digit number of seconds). The ZZ method nevertheless lead to more reliable worst case times. If looking ahead in Friedrich fails, the ZZ method shines due to its overall smaller average number of turns necessary to solve the cube.<p>(However, all this information is 10 years old memories, so please check for yourself, if at the top level that&#x27;s still true today or true at all.)<p>Also, it was a lot of fun to learn the ZZ method. I can highly recommend doing so. Learning several hundred algorithms is less than it seams. It likely takes at least a year, though, and that is if you learn several new algorithms per day. One does not need to learn them all at once. One can always resort to a two-step 3rd layer approach if necessary. But, getting the 3rd layer in a single step felt so awsome! (I was not even halve way through all algorithms, when life dragged me to focus on other things.)<p>I should definitely give cubing another try someday. Last time I took a cube, I couldn&#x27;t even remember the two-step algorithm necessary to solve the particular 3rd layer situation that came up. However, this time I would rather focus on mastering ZZ&#x27;s first step, i.e. orienting all the edges, instead of focussing on memorizing all 3rd layer combinations.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37430777" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37430777" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xmprt</span><span>|</span><a href="#37431229">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37430868">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37430777">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37430777">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s pretty wild seeing how off the estimates are and how far things have come since then.

Though now most cubers donât take advantage of the symmetry between algorithms, and instead do completely different algorithms for flipped cases. One reason for this is that most people arenât perfectly ambidextrous, and the other is it can facilitate recognition.<p>The second most popular method, Roux, has also a lot of potential. Completely different from CFOP.<p>CFOP has been refined a lot. First the obvious: the cross is solved at the bottom, and so are the first two layers. That way you can better see the pieces that actually interest you: those that arenât solved yet.  And it saves you from flipping the cube over when it comes to solve the last layer.  The first two layers are still solved mostly intuitively, but with a lot of tricks to make it faster, like pseudo slotting, key-holesâ¦ currently Tymon KolasiÅski is <i>the master</i> of pseudo slotting, with extremely efficient F2L (and standing equal to him is Max Park, who <i>is</i> basically ambidextrous for this phase).<p>For the last layer there are also a lot of tricks, most of which requires recalling an ungodly amount of algorithms. Some are about inserting the last pair <i>and</i> orient the last layer (few cubers learn them all, but the set called &quot;winter variation&quot; is fairly popular). Sometimes the edges are already oriented, so we can orient <i>and</i> place the last corners (COLL), so at the end we only need to permute the edges (easier recognition, slightly faster algorithms than general PLL).<p>And then thereâs ZBLL, from the ZZ method, where we start with edges already oriented, and we orient the corner and permute <i>everything</i> in a single algorithm. But thereâs a crapton of algs to learn from, not even Tymon KolasiÅski knows them allâ¦ well, one cuber <i>does</i> know them all (donât recall his name, sorry), I believe his method to solve the last layer is to orient the edges at the same time he places the last F2L pair, then he goes ZBLL.<p>---<p>If you want to learn speed cubing now, I recommend <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cubeskills.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cubeskills.com&#x2F;</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jperm.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jperm.net&#x2F;</a> â or look up the Roux method if you donât want to do like everyone else.</div><br/><div id="37431167" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37431167" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shilangyu</span><span>|</span><a href="#37430854">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37430974">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37431167">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37431167">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Roux while still very much an underdog is gaining popularity as the method for one handed (OH) solves.

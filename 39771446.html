I mean, literally, we&#x27;re systems of systems composed of stuff that&#x27;s Earth stuff. And of course many interlocking systems besides, all made of the same stuff.<p>Separate a portion of the larger system, and the component will not retain the original&#x27;s complexity - it will lose complexity to entropy, and revert to the mean.<p>Along those same lines, imagine, just for a second, a completely separated other Earth, and the systems interlocked inside it. Now imagine those, mixing with ours, all those interlocking systems, interfering, constructively and deconstructively. There&#x27;s only one way that shakes out[1]. It&#x27;s not great.<p>I&#x27;m not saying interstellar voyaging is impossible. I just think it&#x27;s impossible for us, as human animals, as Earth systems. But Earth systems are not the only systems that exist. Our technological systems have a leg up, in that they can be developed on a substrate of understanding beyond just the crust of the one planet. Technological systems have better messaging between systems, and they can make at least an attempt at centralized control. A technological surrogate will be the one to experience other suns. Something that remembers us, and maybe remembers us well enough it can pretend to be human occasionally.<p>I suppose that sounds nice, in the same way the traditional blue-sky-golden-gate-fluffy-cloud-big-bearded-old-chap afterlife sounds nice. But God, it also sounds patronizing as all hell. Just put me in the ground so I can help the garden. See, as I get older, watched things die and grow, I&#x27;ve come to realize: the afterlife quantifiably exists . . but you don&#x27;t get to be selfish about it.<p>[1] Not counting technological solutions, like genetic engineering and, failing that, the magical realm of nanowhatever, although I suspect nanowhatsit will act an awful lot like living systems, which are of course their own sort of nanothingy</div><br/><div id="39774496" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39774496" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wombatpm</span><span>|</span><a href="#39772737">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39773697">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39774496">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39774496">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’d be happy if we just start with long term orbitals.

Sorry, but slavery was an institution long before <i>some</i> Europeans took part in it (emphasis on &quot;took part&quot; as it was cooperative, involving African, Arab, etc. slave traders), and continues to be practiced long after those European empires abolished it within their own empires. The abolitionist movement was also European, and certainly Western. And how can you know if the world would have been better? That&#x27;s a counterfactual you either cannot know, or one that fails to account for all the good that was also transmitted through colonialism, or absorbed by the colonial powers. It wasn&#x27;t black and white. And even where the bad is concerned, while there is not argument <i>for</i> chattel slavery, good can come out of bad things. Furthermore, you are reducing European influence to one aspect of one aspect, not even just colonialism, which is not even uniquely European, but slavery per se. This is ridiculous.<p>Your argument w.r.t. poverty is also the same boring reductive fallacy that people who argue against beautiful architecture and art make (&quot;You could have fed so many people with that money!&quot;). Guess what: you can do both. You don&#x27;t &quot;solve poverty&quot; by spending a sum of money on food over art. Those people will be hungry soon. That&#x27;s one. Two, Man does not live by bread alone. Beauty matters. We don&#x27;t live to eat. We eat to live. And yes, we can both care for the starving <i>and</i> invest in things other than helping the poor.<p>The idea that Europe is responsible for global poverty is also obtuse, historically illiterate, and devoid of common sense. There was plenty of poverty in the world before the evil European showed up. If anything, Western commerce, whatever its flaws, has lifted many out of poverty. Yes, capitalism, whatever its flaws, has lifted many, especially the West, out of poverty and into a good deal of <i>material</i> comfort. Look at the 20th century alone. It&#x27;s better to be poor today than poor a century or a few centuries ago. The average man today is far better off today materially than he has ever been, than even the materially better off in previous centuries were.<p>Our ancestors weren&#x27;t perfect, and we should not repeat their errors, but it takes a certain kind of ingratitude and blindness to fail to appreciate the cumulative good they did leave us, an ingratitude and blindness seemingly particular to snarky, ideologically infected oikophobes in the West. Believe me: Africans aren&#x27;t generally seething with hatred at the good of the West the way people in the West do. If anything, they are more likely to despise the malaise and decadence they see in the West today, that the West is trying to force down the throats of everyone else. They are looking to replicate what is actually good in the West in their own countries.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39772932" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39772932" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ptdn</span><span>|</span><a href="#39772296">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39773103">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39775002">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39772932">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39772932">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The last century has involved the fastest reduction in severe poverty ever seen in human history, and it&#x27;s not stopping anytime soon.

I love looking at these old manuals but every era was different.<p>I think the decline is kinda obvious… the manual is an expense, most people don’t want to read it, and it’s better to make the game explain its own story and gameplay. 1980s manuals had walkthroughs and explained the story because that kind of functionality was difficult to put in software. Today, games frequently have catalogs and encyclopedias you can access in-game, extensive cutscenes that give you the story, and tutorials for every important game mechanic.<p>It’s wild to look at the Final Fantasy II (you know, FF4) manual from 1991. It has half the story laid out with maps of towns and dungeons, followed by tables of the items and abilities in the game. Meanwhile, you look at Xenoblade Chronicles 3 from 2022. XC3 is absurdly complicated by comparison and has a much larger story, but it is playable without a manual because the game explains how to play as you play it. Somewhere in the middle, in the 2000s, you have the middle option—manuals that give you a list of characters in the story and tell you what all the buttons do.<p>Archive.org is great for these old manuals.<p>Worth mentioning is how games like Legend of Zelda were not anticipated to be beatable by ordinary players without help (help beyond what the manual provided). Phantasy Star 2 is in a similar category and I think you were expected to have the strategy guide.<p>Also worth mentioning is games like SimLife, where the manual is a proper software manual. It also has those weird cartoons about a family playing around with a gene splicer.</div><br/><div id="42299226" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42299226" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lazystar</span><span>|</span><a href="#42298604">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42298924">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42300806">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42299226">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42299226">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not OP, but I had a similar experience growing up in the &#x27;90s.

Without that backstory, the game&#x27;s story - and especially Brood War&#x27;s story - are pretty hard to follow.<p>&gt; Today, games frequently have catalogs and encyclopedias you can access in-game, extensive cutscenes that give you the story, and tutorials for every important game mechanic.<p>I was able to read the StarCraft manual on the bus to school, car rides, waiting rooms.

Other info goes in the encyclopedia. Make an encyclopedia mechanic—each entry for a unit is unlocked once you destroy a certain number of those units in-game. Unlocking the entry gives you some slight mechanical advantage, like the ability to see which upgrades the unit has or the exact HP values. Once or twice during the game, design a segment of gameplay that requires you to complete an encyclopedia entry in order to pass.<p>I’m sure the kids in the 2000s could just play games on the bus.</div><br/><div id="42301190" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42301190" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">p1necone</span><span>|</span><a href="#42298604">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42299661">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42300983">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42301190">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42301190">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I’m sure the kids in the 2000s could just play games on the bus.<p>I certainly played gameboy in the car, until I inevitably got carsick and had to vomit somewhere.

Take games like Ark Nova with an hour teach (literally) and you really really have to want to learn and play that game. It is also why party games and simple card games stay so popular because the rules are always less than 5 minutes.<p>To make a great rulebook, you probably new two or three diagrams per page for each new concept. So do you have a huge rulebook that is easy to learn from or a small one that is hard to learn from. (The cost and weight factors are pretty negligible.) It also points to the ongoing success of card driven games since you can defer the rules overhead until someone draws the card and they can read the rules themselves as long as the turn structure is fairly simple to jump right in.<p>Source: I design board games as a hobby and pitch them to publishers.</div><br/><div id="42303960" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42303960" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pcblues</span><span>|</span><a href="#42298654">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42300415">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42302156">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42303960">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42303960">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I loved playing games I was familiar with because the rules had been finalised with the people I played with, and we had agreed on the ambiguities (they became house rules). We then developed our strategies based on a known and &quot;complete&quot; understanding of the rules, and the fun came from winning based on the mutually understood set of rules, not a strategem that a player extracted from an unread part of the manual. On the other hand, learning a new game is fun when no-one has played it before, and part of the process was agreeing on the rules after a few run-throughs. Illuminati was great like that. Yet so was the Game of Life card game.
A complicated game&#x2F;rulebook is a different beast. I believe it also needs a person willing to teach the game, or learn it on their own, then teach it. It needs a person familiar with the game, and new players willing to invest in the 
game knowing they will play it together A LOT.

I&#x27;ve played thousands of games of Haggis (which for two players could be played with an ordinary deck of playing cards and a notepad to keep score) online, and I can tell you that expert-level strategy gets into some pretty deep thinking.<p>I&#x27;ve also played thousands of games of Dominion online, and got to a level that I&#x27;d consider competent - above what almost any casual player would ever reach, but still awful next to real experts. A lot of people seem to hate that game in the board gaming circles I used to hang out in - a lot of players get the impression that simple strategies beat more complex ones, and the endgame is boring because you most often acquire victory points via otherwise-useless cards that clog your deck. But on a large fraction of possible &quot;kingdoms&quot; (and the random choice of card piles adds a huge amount of variety to the game), there are complex &quot;engines&quot; available that crush the simpler strategies. It&#x27;s just that you actually have to learn how to implement them, which simply does <i>not</i> flow directly from a mechanical description of what the cards do no matter how well you teach it.<p>Which is to say, yes, card-driven games have some huge advantages - both when the cards define new rules space (the Dominion &#x2F; Fluxx &#x2F; M:tG way), but also just when they&#x27;re a relatively simple component of an abstract, heads-up, imperfect information game (the Haggis &#x2F; poker way). The latter benefit, I think, from a higher level of general expertise: children are commonly taught to play various sorts of card games, so they&#x27;re a very familiar implement that can draw on a lot of powerful design language (set collection mechanics, numerical &quot;ranks&quot; vs symbolic &quot;suits&quot;, etc.).</div><br/><div id="42303908" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42303908" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vintermann</span><span>|</span><a href="#42298654">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42302156">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42300968">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42303908">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42303908">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Spiel des Jahres quality games always have great rulebooks.

The 2023 printing of Acquire&#x27;s rulebook is more readable than any previous printing&#x27;s rulebook. But each printing of Acquire&#x27;s rulebook has the same basic structure. The 1960s printing had sections for: objective of the game, game terms, setup, play (playing tiles, buying stock, merging chains), end of the game, and edge cases. The 2023 printing has more detailed rules, more example images, and more tips for new players, but the order and presentation of rules is roughly the same.<p>... but the 2023 printing apparently runs to 16 half-size pages, where the original rules fit on the underside of the box top.

This can be a daunting and overwhelming challenge for players new to the raid, even if they already are experienced in FPS gameplay.<p>Challenge: explain to a player, familiar with Destiny gameplay but new to the raid, the mechanics of an &quot;encounter&quot; in 5-15 minutes, live. It must be as concise as possible so as not to confuse or overwhelm them, and not stretch the patience of the other players already familiar with the encounter.<p>Too often I&#x27;ve see players start from the immediate aspects, working forwards towards the later&#x2F;broader aspects of the encounter, but I find that in the firehose of information, by the time the explanation is complete, the player has forgotten the first, immediately important details: &quot;wait, tell me again what am I supposed to shoot first?&quot;<p>So the approach I&#x27;ve been experimenting with is to work <i>backwards</i> from the goal of the encounter, so as to finish with the most immediate, tactically important information, so it&#x27;s freshest in their memory.

I also usually use a similar style of prompting people to do things when I am teaching people IT stuff instead of doing it for them or only talking about it (family tech support, might be a chaotic raid, but usually less twitchy &#x2F;s).<p>As a datapoint in a similar situation, I played in a guild in Lost Ark that was quite competitive (more than I was). This game has mechanic heavy raids, but I do not know how they compare to Destiny 2. I went into early raids essentially blind and learned mostly by doing and listening to good calls during it.<p>A few minutes before we went in, and during the straightforward way to the bosses, someone familiar with the mechanics explained the general idea, e.g. &quot;there is an instant kill in all phases, in the first 2 you need to stand on the whitish spots, in the 3rd phase on the reddish spots&quot;. During the actual encounters, and before the switch of mechanics, they would call out in short what to do, e.g. &quot;stand in red&quot; or just &quot;red&quot;.<p>I personally liked this way. It gave me a rough idea what to expect and refreshed my memory enough to not screw up in the heat of the moment. The explanation itself was also quite short, because we didn&#x27;t go through the play by play, only covering the important stuff and relying on in the moment callouts. Plus, some briefing happened during the run to the boss. This method might only work with a somewhat competent&#x2F;disciplined group. We played like this as a guild with good raid leaders and during crunch time we had good comms discipline. In addition we went into training raids with inexperienced players, with the expectation that we might not make it, but still try our best, and usually won. There also were more or less fixed raid teams that grinded these bosses without any explanation, because everyone had done it multiple times already.<p>I played another game with lightly mechanics based bosses and I, or someone else, explained in about 3 chat messages what to do when we went in with randoms. It was simple enough &quot;I do X, shoot adds when I do X, if I die, do Y&quot;. The experienced players took care of the harder&#x2F;mechanics parts, everyone else covered the easy parts. If you have a semi-fixed group for this, everyone learns all mechanics at some point by observing.<p>Edit: Typo</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42300479" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42300479" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alach11</span><span>|</span><a href="#42301185">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42303934">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42300479">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42300479">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When I teach people how to play a game, I usually omit several of the rules upfront to help people grok the goal faster.

If you start with a version that has all cards face-up and no betting, people would conclude that Texas Hold&#x27;em is a supremely boring game, and wouldn&#x27;t bother to try the full Texas Hold&#x27;em experience!</div><br/><div id="42302186" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42302186" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zahlman</span><span>|</span><a href="#42300479">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42301246">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42301717">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42302186">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42302186">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve seen people teach by playing the open-face (or otherwise simplified version) of a <i>single turn</i> as a way to give an overview of core mechanics.<p>Naturally, this works better if the 2 hour game consists of dozens of 5 minute turns rather than a few half-hour ones.<p>If you show <i>one hand</i> of Texas Hold&#x27;em, and don&#x27;t actually <i>play</i> it, but instead talk through what players might be thinking at various points, then you not only cover the mechanics, but sell the game (through the rhetorical device of dramatic irony: you emphasize that the players don&#x27;t have complete information, and may try to mislead each other, and may come to wrong conclusions even without such deceit, and of course nobody knows what will come on the river...).

I would get to parts that should be simple like moving a character or something similar, but there would be ten asterisks to how it works, each explained in different parts of the book.<p>Fake example: &quot;Here&#x27;s the movement phase, where you can move your character! Character movement is determined by your weight, refer to the weight class your character is currently in.&quot; Meanwhile, weight classes are explained 30 pages later.

The explanation would have been better without it. (For me.) It leaves me thinking what the heck a trick might be. I know card tricks where a magician asks you to pick a card and then things happen and later they magically identify the card. Or i know “tricking” people in the bluffing with card sense. But the heck would anyone “take” any of the above? Maybe the goal is that someone will bluff and we are supposed to “take it” as in believe othes bluffs and that is somehow the game? Oh but now from the description it sounds the goal is to not “take” the points so then isn’t that a “trick not-taking” game? Or a “trick forcing” as in the active thing is to force others to take the “trick” when they would rather not?<p>Board game geeks do this often. They have seen so many games before that they learned to identify patterns in the rules and they learned names for those patterns. They say something like “this is a pool bulding, hidden movement game with the added twist that your blurbs can smorg on backturns too, let’s play”. Which is fine, as long as they play with other board game geeks. But if they also want to play with us non-boardgamegeeks these sentences confuse more than explain. Because i might be just sitting there trying to figure out where will i find water for my pool, when actually what they meant… i don’t even know what they meant. Same way as i have no clue what is a trick and why would anybody taking it in the game you are describing.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42300535" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42300535" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ryouhander</span><span>|</span><a href="#42300450">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42302159">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42301744">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42300535">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42300535">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I always follow the same framework -- set the stage (What&#x27;s the theme or idea?), explain the object (How do I win?), explain the overall structure of the game (How will the game flow and end?), and then hone in on your turn (What do I actually do when my turn comes up?).<p>The final step should naturally lead you into the finer nitty-gritty as players are ready.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42301744" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42301744" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ianferrel</span><span>|</span><a href="#42300450">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42298808">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42301744">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42301744">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How much of this is just &quot;most board games are awful&quot;?<p>Awful in the sense of overly complicated and fiddly.

2) Elaborate games are so open-ended and hard to analyze forward strategically that they are <i>much</i> more balanced across people of different skill levels. People who would have no hope of a competitive, fun game of chess will have a more interesting game of Brass: Birmingham or Eclipse.

My pet peeve is when a game is launched as a kickstarter and they add new game mechanics as stretch goals. If it was a good game with just the basic mechanics then why on earth would anyone want it be more complicated just because more people have funded it? And from the other angle if it is a better game with the extra rules and mechanics added then why not make that the game? It is the job of the game’s designer to make the very hard choices and tradeoffs between complexity of rules and the fun people will have with them. If they abdicate this responsibility and leave it up to “let’s see how viral our kickstarter canpaing will be” then they don’t understand their task.</div><br/><div id="42302102" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42302102" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ta_1138</span><span>|</span><a href="#42301744">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42302000">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42303146">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42302102">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42302102">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Kickstarter games tend to have far more design than development, as the success of the kickstarter campaign has little to do with the game being any good, but with the material available at campaign time being attractive. So overproduced games with way too much art, and way to many systems, end up doing far better than, say, a simpler game that would have gone through a more traditional euro publisher 10 years ago.<p>If you talk to people in industry, they realize that this is making the games worse, but it&#x27;s making them sell better. Just like today, just like with a movie, high sales don&#x27;t come from great mechanics, but franchises or licensing. Your superhero coop game is going to do much worse if it doesn&#x27;t have a license. Why do we have so many boardgames with video game licenses? Because it sells. There&#x27;s way too many games in the market right now for even industry insiders to good track of most offerings. Buyers working for large internet game stores are overwhelmed.<p>So no, game designers are 100% understanding their task, which is to make a game that gets backed and is profitable. Cutting half the game after you told backers what you were doing is a disaster, and it&#x27;s all those extra rules and extra boards that sold the game in the first place.

I am certainly an extremist in this way, I believe almost every board or card game ever made is better to play on a computer, but I think we should all be able to agree that a LOT of board games would benefit from automation.<p>Monopoly is a great example, because basically everyone has at least some understanding of the game and basically no one has ever played it entirely correctly in purely analog form.  I have literally never seen anyone do the auctions in real life, mortgaging is rare, and other &quot;house rules&quot; like the pot on &quot;Free Parking&quot; are common.  All of these things tend to cause the game to drag on forever, ironically the thing most of those same players will complain the most about.<p>If you play any of the computer&#x2F;console versions the auctions are automatic and easy for everyone to participate.  Some support the house rules as options, but they have to be enabled and some versions specifically warn that they will break the game.<p>Computers exist to automate tedious tasks, if your game has tedious mechanics that require a lot of text to explain it&#x27;d probably be better as a computer game where those parts can be automated and the player just has to make their choices within that framework.<p>In industrial safety one of the mantras is that if it&#x27;s easier to do it wrong than right people will definitely do it wrong, so you need to make the right path also the easy path, sometimes changing entire systems or processes to make it that way.  I believe the same logic should be applied to gaming.  If your game is complicated enough that effectively no one is going to play it correctly as a board game, either simplify it so that&#x27;s not the case or don&#x27;t make it a board game.<p>My partner would argue that the physical interaction with the pieces&#x2F;cards&#x2F;board&#x2F;whatever is what matters and computers don&#x27;t have that, but I believe if I&#x27;m judging a game as a game then the gameplay not making me hate it is the most important part.</div><br/><div id="42303782" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42303782" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lmm</span><span>|</span><a href="#42301744">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42302429">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42303019">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42303782">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42303782">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Monopoly is a great example<p>No it isn&#x27;t, because board game people hate it.

A book alone is simply not sufficient without, as the linked PDF complains about, something like the effort of studying a textbook, probably with the game-pieces right alongside and working through fake play as you go so that any of it makes sense.<p>Attempts to translate that into extensive game walkthroughs in manuals (not quick examples of play to demonstrate a rule, which <i>are</i> sometimes nice) are horribly misguided. Just include a damn QR code that points to a YouTube video. Give it an entire page to make it more likely the players find it, that&#x27;ll still be less space than a walkthrough.<p>I truly think Monopoly&#x27;s around the upper end of complexity that normal people can be expected to absorb and apply from a game manual—not from someone showing them the right way, or from a video—which means the vast majority of modern-era games are way past that point. I&#x27;ve known more people who fail to play with all parts of the Monopoly rules than I&#x27;ve known people who correctly play with all of them (or at least know the rules, but affirmatively reject or deliberately modify them) by a large margin. Usually it&#x27;s auctioning or mortgaging they skip, either because they never read the rules and learned from someone who wasn&#x27;t familiar with those parts, or because they did read the rules but deemed one or both of those parts too daunting to play and manage <i>without having seen a demonstration of it</i> and decided the game seems like it can run without those rules (yes, it can, but it makes it worse in some key ways—not doing auctions when someone declines to purchase a space is especially harmful, as it prolongs the game without much in the way of compensatory extra fun)<p>Like, sure, Risk is kinda a shitty grand strategy or area control or war game or however you want to classify it, for demonstrable, if arguable, reasons, but if your answer to that results in more complex rules than Risk... you&#x27;re gonna need an explainer video, because your rule book is definitely gonna suck. Because that&#x27;s a game normal people can, just barely, often figure out and run correctly just from the rule book, and yours surely won&#x27;t be.</div><br/><div id="42301001" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42301001" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bluGill</span><span>|</span><a href="#42298808">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42299104">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42299999">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42301001">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42301001">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Which is why many say there needs to be several rule books.

The point about interconnecting pieces or like &quot;gears&quot; that are all involved is a good thing.  Everything is dynamic and in interplay.<p>A lot of that means these are not linear systems (not in a systems theory sense, but textual sense).  Graphics and images do volumes.  But only so much as you understand, again, the WHY.  Everything has to feed into the &quot;economy&quot; of the game and how all the parts interact.<p>Rulebooks also need to make sure terminology is consistent.  I&#x27;ve played some games where I see a word that&#x27;s used, and then I try to find the definition and it&#x27;s just... not there.  At least not easily found.  An index of some sort is necessary if you&#x27;re going to use special terms that aren&#x27;t obvious (and if they are obvious&#x2F;standard words, but you use them in a unique way, also define that).<p>I think there should be:
0. Intro&#x2F;thematic vibe&#x2F;core concept - the what you are trying to do and possibly why.
1. Component Overview - the what you are playing with.  (Include a layout of the setup version of the game).
2. Step by step rules, underlined words that have specific definitions to be referred in the index.
3. Examples are ideal (including images), especially in tricky situations that involve edge cases (or worse, corner cases)
4. Common &quot;edge cases&quot; (oxymoron?) that are trickier should have their own FAQ&#x2F;addendum for clarification.
5. Glossary&#x2F;Index<p>Rules should not try to be cute and invent words for common scenarios unless it&#x27;s clear what it means in context.<p>Rules should NOT try to be super thematic.  A little flavor text at the beginning is fine, but like the above issue, there should not just be things like &quot;Grippledize the phlumoxor to gain 10 boodiboos&quot;  Just say &quot;place your character piece at location 3 in order to gain 10 units of currency&quot; or whatever.<p>If you&#x27;re going to use terms like that - use them on the cards as flavor text, not hinge the rules on understanding them; or if you&#x27;re going to be cute with names, be consistent with it, and constantly use it so it&#x27;s etched into the brain &quot;OK, Grippledizing means Place at a spot&quot; - if it&#x27;s just a one off thing there is no need for a &quot;cute&quot; name for it.

I&#x27;d put that after videos of play, which are by far the most useful thing for this, followed by written first-time play AARs (a huge step down from a video, but serviceable), followed finally and distantly by the rule book.

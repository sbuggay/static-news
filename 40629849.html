If there is one thing it&#x27;s time for then it&#x27;s for academia to get out of their ivory tower and face the real world. As Taleb puts it:<p>“I will repeat the following until I am hoarse: it is contagion that determines the fate of a theory in social science, not its validity.”<p>Or as Yarkoni &amp; Westfall put it: &quot;psychology&#x27;s near-total focus on explaining the causes of behavior has led much of the field to be populated by research programs that provide intricate theories of psychological mechanism but that have little (or unknown) ability to predict future behaviors with any appreciable accuracy.&quot; [1]<p>I personally think it&#x27;s fair to compare social science research with monks researching a religious text. They can work hard for years without ever coming up with a new idea.<p>So what&#x27;s the solution? Somehow dogmatism should be reduced. This will probably happen once the government figures out how to align incentives better. Currently, peer review and grant proposals are largely done by academic peers.

honest with themselves. More honest with others. You lose friends, but

For instance, everyone is advised to take regular tests (like blood tests). While things can still be improved a lot, this simple proactive measure helps detect many health problems before they cause serious damage.<p>For mental health, we don&#x27;t do anything until the person is fed up with their struggles and maybe asks for professional help. Even then, in most cases we do not start with a &quot;Triage&quot; process. It took me a long time to even realize that there should be a mental health questionnaire, and ask my psychologist for it. We leave individuals to learn about mental health and take care of it, while there is not even a clear starting point for anyone who wants to learn.<p>Mental health problems, like viral infections, can be contagious. Unlike viral infections, one person with one mental health issue infects others with different types of mental health issues than the one they have. It is incredible how much happiness&#x2F;productivity&#x2F;economic value is lost to mental health issues that are manageable with our current knowledge.<p>If our collective goal for the society is to maximize a measure of overall happiness (which I think is a really decent goal), we need to have a better plan.

Unfortunately our medical practices aren’t always good enough yet where doing early checkups at a large scale actually prevent harm.<p>Combine this with the sometimes shoddy diagnostics processes in mental health, and suddenly it doesn’t seem too weird to me that we avoid poking too much until people complain themselves. I think that if we were to ask people to fill out every mental health questionnaire that exists, most people would likely test positive for some disorders. But if those symptoms are not causing unmanageable harm in people’s lives, and given the current state of treatments (not nearly always effective), I think we should think twice before subjecting everyone to a list of mental health questionnaires.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40630967" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40630967" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jimkleiber</span><span>|</span><a href="#40630892">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40630977">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40631391">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40630967">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40630967">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think most cultures have beliefs&#x2F;norms for the suppression of emotion that influence our health more than we may realize.

I would describe as to having something in your brain that you don&#x27;t control that is always conspiring to get you to do nothing, if it fails to have you doing anything but what you want&#x2F;should be doing; Wherever this is accomplished by making you forget, distracting you, robbing your willpower, making it hard to concentrate, making other things seem more appealing, hyperfocusing you in any random stuff, etc. Doesn&#x27;t matter to the conspirator as long as they get you to waste time against your will, even when you want to waste time doing something you like, the conspirator will get you to waste time another way, for they are just a prick.<p>Of course there is no conspirator and I am just personifiying symptoms but that is about it what means to have ADHD on a practical levelm explained in words everyone can understand. There can be other symptoms that are not related to this like forgetting about contacting people you care about or the need to have something in your hands to fidget or not being able to remain sitted but those are secondary and very dependant on the person, the most debilitating aspect that almost every ADHD person has, just manifested slightly different, is that of stopping you from doing what you want&#x2F;must do, worst is that some of that stuff you can willpower over it, but some you can&#x27;t, willpower does naught when your brain makes you to temporarily forget that you were doing or you have to do a thing.<p>Worse stuff is that a lot of individual symptoms of ADHD are things that &quot;happen&quot; to everybody so they judge from their own experiences which is not fair as it is not the same when a non-ADHD person gets distracted or forgets things as when it happens to an ADHD person.

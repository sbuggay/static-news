The &quot;monitor&quot; was called CP (control program) IIRC.<p>XEDIT was a great editor. There was also Rexx (and previously EXEC and EXEC&#x2F;2) as the system&#x27;s programming language that you could use to customize virtually every aspect of the editor and automated tasks. Rexx had integration with the editor and also integrated with the OS there were lots of these small integration points that let you do really powerful stuff. Applications like email were implemented on top of the basic OS and editor. A very unique and powerful architecture (mirrored to some degree in OS&#x2F;2 later).<p>The ecosystem was incredible. The virtualization support in the CPU let you run a complete multi-user system with each user having a visualized CPU within one virtual CPU. I.e. it was &quot;fully&quot; virtualized. What&#x27;s more incredible is that a lot of these pieces, like the OS, were all written in assembly. Super robust. Super clean. Amazing documentation for everything. As top notch engineering as it gets.<p>The full screen terminal (e.g. 327X) were part of the architecture, delegating a lot of the interaction to the terminal. Interesting enough you could poll the terminals for input which we&#x27;ve used for writing some games. A friend of mine wrote a library for doing that. There were also colour&#x2F;graphics terminals like the 3279 and could be programmed e.g. with a library called GDDM.<p>EDIT:

So if you arenât running under z&#x2F;VM, Linux canât use readers&#x2F;punches, because the hypervisor interface isnât there.

OS&#x2F;400 has this weird version of âOOâ in which (1) there is no inheritance (although the concept has been partially tacked on in a non-generic way by having a âsubtypeâ attribute on certain object types), (2) the set of classes is closed and only IBM can define new ones.<p>Thatâs a long way from what âOOâ normally means. Not bad for a system designed in the 1970s (1988âs AS&#x2F;400 was just a âversion 2â of 1978âs System&#x2F;38, and a lot of this stuff was largely unchanged from its forebear.) But AS&#x2F;400 fans have this marked tendency to make the system sound more advanced and cutting-edge than it actually was. Donât get me wrong, the use of capability-based addressing is still something that is at the research-level on mainstream architectures (see CHERI) - but the OO stuff is a lot less impressive than it sounds at first. Like someone in the 70s had a quick look at Smalltalk and came away with a rather incomplete understanding of it.<p>&gt; and of course it started out with a virtual machine in the late 1970s.<p>If you consider UCSD Pascal, BCPL Ocode - far from a unique idea in the 1970s. It is just that many of those other ideas ended up being technological dead-ends, hence many people arenât aware of them. I suppose ultimately AS&#x2F;400 is slowly turning into a dead-end too, it has just taken a lot longer.

On the contrary, I think it actually obscures what I mean, and would lead the casual reader to assume that things were actually much less different than they actually were.<p>Both MS-DOS and CP&#x2F;M still had the very clear and almost identical concept of a &quot;file&quot; in the first place. I don&#x27;t know if CP&#x2F;M (and in turn CMS) was inspired by UNIX in that way, or whether the &quot;file&quot; concept came from a different common ancestor, but it&#x27;s worth repeating that MVS has more or less <i>nothing</i> like that &quot;file&quot; concept.<p>MVS had &quot;datasets&quot; and &quot;partitioned datasets&quot;, which I often see people relating to &quot;files&quot; and &quot;directories&quot; through a lens colored by today&#x27;s computing world. But if you start using it, you quickly realize that the semblance is actual pretty minimal. (If you use the 1980s MVS 3.8j, that is.)<p>Both datasets and partitioned datasets require you to do things that even the simplest of filesystems (e.g. FAT12 for MS-DOS) do on their own and completely transparently to the user (or even developer). And moreover, datasets&#x2F;members are usually (not always) organized as &quot;records&quot;, sometimes indexed, sometimes even indexed in a key-value manner. This goes so fundamentally with the system that it <i>goes down into the hardware</i>, i.e. the disk itself understands the concept of indices, record lengths and even keyed records with associated values. MS-DOS, CP&#x2F;M, and practically all modern systems, instead see &quot;files&quot; as a stream of bytes&#x2F;words&#x2F;octets or whatever.<p>A lot of this has been abstracted away and &quot;pulled&quot; into the modern and familiar &quot;file&quot; concept the closer you get to z&#x2F;OS, but that&#x27;s what MVS back then was like.<p>A C64 with its 1541 is closer to old school MVS than MS-DOS and CP&#x2F;M both are, because an 1541 supports both &quot;sequential&quot; files (byte streams) and &quot;relative&quot; files (indexed record sets), and because it provides relatively high level interface to circumvent that altogether and work with the disk (&quot;volume&quot; in MVS parlance) more directly. There&#x27;s even a &quot;user defined&quot; file type. However, altogether the 1541 is closer to MS-DOS and CP&#x2F;M again, because usually (not always!) you leave the block allocation to the system itself. Like you <i>always</i> do in a modern system and MS-DOS or CP&#x2F;M, there is basically no sane way around it (at best you can slightly &quot;tweak&quot; it).<p>That&#x27;s not even touching on what &quot;batch processing&quot;, and associated job control languages and reader&#x2F;printer&#x2F;puncher queues, mean in practice.<p>It&#x27;s so alien to the world of nowadays.</div><br/><div id="40983377" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40983377" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kragen</span><span>|</span><a href="#40979048">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40980339">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40980746">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40983377">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40983377">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>Both MS-DOS and CP&#x2F;M still had the very clear and almost identical concept of a &quot;file&quot; in the first place.</i><p>ms-dos files (after 2.0) were sequences of bytes; cp&#x2F;m&#x27;s were sequences of 128-byte &#x27;records&#x27;, which is why old text files pad out to a multiple of 128 bytes with ^z characters.  ms-dos (after 2.0) supported using the same &#x27;file&#x27; system calls to read and write bytestream devices like paper tape readers and the console; cp&#x2F;m had special system calls to read and write those (though pip did have special-case device names).  see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seasip.info&#x2F;Cpm&#x2F;bdos.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seasip.info&#x2F;Cpm&#x2F;bdos.html</a><p>that is, this<p>&gt; <i>CP&#x2F;M (...) instead see[s] &quot;files&quot; as a stream of bytes&#x2F;words&#x2F;octets or whatever.</i><p>is not correct; cp&#x2F;m has no system calls for reading or writing bytes or words to or from a file.  nor octets, which is french for what ms-dos and cp&#x2F;m call &#x27;bytes&#x27;<p>admittedly filesystems with more than two types of files (ms-dos 2+ has two: directories and regular files) are <i>more</i> different from cp&#x2F;m</div><br/><div id="40983743" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40983743" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anyfoo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40979048">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40983377">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40980746">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40983743">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40983743">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Granted, I wasnât aware.

And I&#x27;m not just talking about PowerPC. In the 80s -- long before Hercules -- IBM developed a &quot;mainframe on a card&quot; solution for use in IBM PCs. For a CPU, they commissioned Motorola to build a special 68000 CPU with different microcode that implemented a large subset of the System&#x2F;370 instruction set. Any instructions that could not be implemented with this custom-schmustom architecture would trap, and be decoded and emulated by a regular 68000 that ran in tandem with the custom one. The resulting architecture was able to run mainframe operating systems and applications very well, providing mainframe developers a benchside testing solution that allowed them to run software still in development without tying up resources on the actual mainframe (which needed to have as much CPU time as possible committed to production workloads in order to be profitable to run).<p>Still probably cost an arm and a leg, though.

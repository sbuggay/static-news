Afterwards I often just check in on the tripper and see if they need water, make sure their comfortable, and sometimes ask them to visually or verbally give me a thumbs up at a mid-way point.<p>a few other things I advise my peers on
- Proper testing of their drugs
- Checking for health conditions, medications, drug interactions
- Dosing in a sensible manner than minimizes the chance of a chaotic or anxious driven trip
- Stressing the importance of having playlists that bring a suitable atmosphere
- Suggesting proper sleep, nutrition, and some exercise leading up to and after a trip<p>If you head over to &#x2F;r&#x2F;LSD &#x2F;r&#x2F;shrooms you will find a constant stream of individuals who range the gambit from from teenagers to older adults who lack serious basic understanding of how to dose, prepare their mindset, and manage a environment conducive to a productive trip.

Any man who suggests that it doesn&#x27;t effect women are not being kind to the differences in hormonal physiology. There really needs to be closer research done on this but until then I just ask female peers to be slightly aware and cautious about their mental states during their cycle.<p>It is my suggestion that women record in their trip notes additional info such as, what day of their cycle they are on, and if it may or may not have effected their trip preparation, trip, or integration work afterwards.<p>As a rule of thumb, I advise women who partake in MDMA to extra care due to possible compounding effects during a post MDMA &quot;comedown&#x2F;withdrawl&quot; and hormonal drop associated with a period. If they emotionally struggle sober during their cycle then it might be a good idea to abstain, take very conservative doses, or wait until their past the their period.<p>There exists a community called Mom&#x27;s on Mushrooms that can probably has the largest collection of individuals who can give anecdotal experiences.<p>There are conditions such as premenstrual dysphoria disorder that psilocybin seems to help with symptoms, but its all anecdotal experimentation and feedback. so who knows</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39010047" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39010047" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">taopai</span><span>|</span><a href="#39008788">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39007849">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39010047">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39010047">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I only had 3 experiences.

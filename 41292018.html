I have experience that may shed some insights. I worked on SCADA software (3 different ones), for about 15 years, started off as a Systems Engineer for an Industrial Power Metering company (but writing software), built drivers for various circuit breakers and other power protection devices, and wrote drivers and other software for IEC61850 (substation modelling and connectivity standard). I’ve been the technical director of one of these SCADA systems, and in charge of bringing the security to “zero trust”. I’ve been on the phone with the FBI (despite not being an American or in America), and these days I design and lead the security development at a large software company.<p>I’ve been out of the Power Industry&#x2F;SCADA game for about 6 years now, and never had huge involvement with solar farms, so please take this with a large grain of salt, but here is my take. 15 years ago, all anyone would say about industrial networks was “air gap!”. Security within SCADA products was designed solely to prevent bad operators from doing bad things. Security on devices was essentially non-existent, and firmware could often be updated via the same connectivity that the SCADA system had to the devices (although SCADA rarely supported this; it was still possible). In addition, SCADA systems completely trusted communication coming back from the devices themselves, making it relatively simple for a rogue device to exploit a buffer overrun in the SCADA. After Stuxnet + a significant push from the US government, SCADA systems moved from “defensive boundary, trust internally” to “zero trust”. However, devices have a long, long service life. Typically they would be deployed and left alone for 10+ years, and generally had little to no security. Security researches left this space alone, because the cost of entry was too high, but anytime they did investigate a device, there were always trivial exploits.<p>Although SCADA (and other industrial control software), will be run on an isolated network, it will still be bridged in multiple places. This is in order to get data out of the system, but also to get data into the system (via devices, and off-site optimisation software). The other trend that happened over time was to centralize operations in order to have fewer operators controlling multiple sites. That means that compromising one network gives you access to a lot of real world hardware.<p>Engineers never trusted SCADA (wisely), and all of these systems would be well built with multiple fail-safes and redundancies and so on. However, if I were to be a state-actor, I’d target the SCADA. If you compromise that system, you have direct access to all devices and can potentially modify the firmware to do whatever you want. If there is security, the SCADA will be authorized.<p>I don’t think the security risks are overblown (they are overblown in <i>what</i> they think the real problems are). I think that as the systems have gotten ever more complex; we have such complicated interdependencies that it is impossible to deterministically analyse them completely. The “Northeast blackout of 2003” (where a SCADA bug lead to a cascade failure), was used as a case-study in this industry for many years, but if anything, I think the potential for intentional destruction is much higher.</div><br/><div id="41296337" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41296337" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">applied_heat</span><span>|</span><a href="#41292982">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41295526">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41293632">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41296337">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41296337">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m in this space, but plc io networks from Schneider and Rockwell are still “trust internally”, and some HMI or scada has to have read&#x2F;write to them.

With massive p.v., eolic etc grid demand might change MUCH more for big power plant, like a 50MW P.P. need to scale back or power up of 10MW suddenly and that&#x27;s way too much to sustain. When this happen if the demand is too much the frequency plunge, grid dispatcher operators have to cut off large areas to lower the demand (so called rolling blackouts), when the demand drop too quickly the frequency skyrocket and large PP can&#x27;t scale back fast enough so they simply disconnect.

I lived next to a small inland sea most of my adult life. The number of times someone on the other side of town asserted it was raining when in fact it was not was quite high.<p>Every adult in Seattle eventually has to learn that if you have an activity planned on the other side of town, if you cancel it because it’s raining at your house you’re not going to get anything done. You have to phone a friend or just show up and <i>then</i> decide if you’re going to cancel due to weather.<p>Now to be fair, in the case of Seattle, there’s a mountain that multiplies this effect north versus south. NL doesn’t have that, but if you look at the weather satellite at the time of my writing, there are long narrow strips of precip over England that are taller but much narrower than NL.</div><br/><div id="41295710" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41295710" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eldaisfish</span><span>|</span><a href="#41292982">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41293359">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41293746">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41295710">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41295710">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">clouds and rain do not behave the same as the sun.<p>What point are you trying to make here?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41293746" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41293746" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lucianbr</span><span>|</span><a href="#41292982">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41293069">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41293359">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41292379">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41293746">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41293746">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; When it is sunny in the netherlands, it is likely sunny everywhere in NL because of how small the country is.<p>Often friends of mine who live in my city report rain when I see none, or no rain when it&#x27;s raining outside my window.

Even when you are looking for plausible deniability, shutting down solar panels from cloud website doesn&#x27;t make a list of your top 10 options. (In fact, it won&#x27;t make the list in those scenarios precisely <i>because</i> you are looking for plausible deniability.)<p>Let&#x27;s imagine a power grid as modern societies know them today, except all consumers monitor their solar panels themselves, and none of those consumers outsource this monitoring function to any third party foreign or domestic. Power grids can still be materially disrupted in this scenario. Especially in the case of total war. Obviously in the case of open war. And particularly in the case of cold war.<p>As I said, I advocate consumers disconnecting any power generation functions from networks. But if I&#x27;m in the seat coming up with post conflict, or even simply emergency recovery, operating assumptions, I&#x27;m not counting on those panels generating power. It&#x27;s just irresponsible to do so. In total war EMP will knock most of that generation off line where you&#x27;re luck enough not to have it eliminated entirely. In cold or open war, disruptions to distribution can and will render that generation useless.

I’d like to know what my panels are doing, but you don’t need the internet for that.<p>This is because of the market for carbon credits.  When you installed your PV panels, someone estimated how much electricity they would generate over the next 10-15 years.  Tradable carbon credits were created based on that estimate and went into the marketplace.  And for the next 10-15 years they have to verify that the electricity was actually generated, or else someone has to pay back some money.  Did you read the fine print on your contract?

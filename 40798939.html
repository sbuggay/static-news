Then at college, some guys I knew made one (and they weren’t dumb at all, pretty competent people). They were firing it near where people were sitting on the lawn and it suddenly shattered, sending sharp jagged pieces of PVC flying. One of the pieces hit a girl sitting nearby and gave her a nasty cut near her eye. Her face was covered in blood and it was totally horrific for her and everyone else. It made me realize that the fun of the activity was just significantly outweighed by the possible safety downside. It could have been so much worse, too— she could have been blinded instead of just gotten a nasty scar on her face.</div><br/><div id="40815768" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40815768" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ggreer</span><span>|</span><a href="#40814532">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40814805">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40815768">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40815768">[17 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">These sorts of failures are usually caused by people constructing the potato cannon out of thinner schedule 40 PVC (usually colored white). If you use schedule 80 PVC (which tends to be dark gray) or ABS (which deforms instead of shattering), the risk is negligible.<p>This is also why I prefer pneumatic cannons to combustion. Since there&#x27;s not a quick spike in pressure from a combustion reaction, the maximum pressure that needs to be contained is lower (and you can measure it with a gauge as you&#x27;re pumping the air tank up). Also if you make the air tank big enough, the pressure behind the projectile stays high for longer, so you tend to get higher velocities.<p>When I was in high school I made a potato cannon, played around with it in the woods with some friends, and <i>then</i> told my parents about it. My mom wasn&#x27;t too happy, but my dad took it as a challenge. He built an even more powerful pneumatic version with a tripod, sights, and a solenoid trigger mechanism. The whole family loved it. I used some extra PVC pipe to make molds for cement slugs. With a little paper wadding to get a good seal, they&#x27;d go fast enough to embed themselves a couple feet into the side of a hill. It was spectacular.</div><br/><div id="40816477" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40816477" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ryandrake</span><span>|</span><a href="#40814532">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815768">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40817191">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40816477">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40816477">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yea, Home Depot PVC doesn&#x27;t belong anywhere near compressed air.

It was there, eating one of my allotted MREs, that I noticed the MRE heater was printed in large letters &quot;Do not expose to flame.&quot;  Being a bored jarhead, I couldn&#x27;t help but try and figure out why.  Being able to rub a few brain cells together, I thought about how the heaters are activated by the addition of water.  Since water is hydrogen and oxygen, I was willing to bet that those were some of the reaction products.  I never bothered to look it up, but I did find that whatever was coming out with the steam was also quite flammable.<p>Once that was proven, I recalled that recently a contractor had dug a well near our work site.  I ambled over and found a 3 foot long, ~3 inch diameter steel pipe that had a 90 degree elbow with a quick release cap.
All that was required after that was a touch hole, added with a drill, some MRE heaters, and projectiles.<p>Potatoes were not available there, but fruit like oranges and pears were.  I started with an orange and just jammed it into the very end of the barrel, it was too big to go all the way in, and went for it.  The distance was laughable, 1 or 2 feet, but the sound?  Everyone came running out of the work center tents because they thought I had just loosed a round from my weapon.<p>After being called an idiot by the local Lieutenant, I switch to only pears, which were easy to jam in hard enough to cut the excess off.
At this point, I was lobbing pears across the perimeter road, into the scrub &#x2F; minefield outside the wire.  Never found a mine with it though.<p>All my fun ended one faithful day when I accidentally dropped a pear in front of a Romanian MP truck on patrol around the perimeter.

Except he called it a &quot;sock cannon&quot; and had loaded it with a large tube sock that he had rolled up. He explained how it worked, how he built it from a few basic plumbing parts anyone could get at the hardware store, how the fuel was just hairspray and how we definitely shouldn&#x27;t build one ourselves.<p>Naturally, I went home and decided to construct a much bigger version of the one he showed us. After convincing my parents to drive me to the hardware store, I picked out what I needed -- including 7 feet of PVC. The clerk immediately figured out what I was building and that was the first time I heard the term potato cannon. They seemed concerned that my mom was on board with the whole thing, but I stuck to my guns and said it was a science project and was for shooting socks. I had figured I could wrap the sock around a smaller projectile, but that clerk made me realize I didn&#x27;t even need the sock.<p>My friend and I put it all together pretty quickly the next day and set it up in my backyard for testing. I think we probably started with socks, but I honestly can&#x27;t recall. What I do remember is taking a hacky-sack I had lying around that fit perfectly into the barrel to try and fire it at our back fence. We were using a piezo igniter from a lighter I had disassembled, and it took some trial and error to get the fuel to air mixture just right. It took both of us to operate: one person aimed the barrel, the other operated the trigger. This time, I was aiming and he was lighting. But it just wasn&#x27;t lighting... so I turned around to try and help and BOOM the cannon went off like, well, a cannon. Except I wasn&#x27;t pointing at the fence anymore, but well above it. The hacky-sack tore through the branches of several trees before exploding on the metal siding of the house on the opposite side of our block. The sound could probably be heard for blocks.<p>We both just looked at each other with a mixture of delight and panic before immediately running back into my house. We saw someone come out of the house we hit looking utterly confused, trying to figure out what just happened. We started laughing uncontrollably, realizing how close we were to causing a lot of damage, or possibly injuring someone.<p>Luckily, nothing every came of that incident, and we made sure later tests were done in a nearby park. We never did attempt to put an actual potato in the thing. Perhaps 7 feet was a little overkill...<p>PS - Dr. Vince, if you&#x27;re out there, thank you for being one of the best teachers I&#x27;ve ever had.

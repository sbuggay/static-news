Ursula Le Guin&#x27;s translation does not retain much feeling or meaning from the original. I don&#x27;t fault her on this though because most translations of the Daodejing are like this. I recommend Philip J. Ivanhoe&#x27;s translation, which has its own flaws as well.<p>If we want to go out into the weeds a bit, I think this text is ethereal in the original but despite this, most translations tend to be quite similar. Wang Bi, the oldest commentary writer and popularizer of the Daodejing, argued that the text supports a large number of divergent meanings. If this is true, we should expect translations to be vastly different from one another. But despite the Daodejing being the second most translated book in history after the Bible, most translations keep the feel and content of the others.<p>On another topic, translators usually translate the text as poetry when most of the text is best translated as prose. The text itself is a work of philosophy and not poetry, hence the author&#x27;s name ending in 子 and the subject matter about correctly running a state and following the Dao. Although the text is doubtlessly more mystical than other Chinese philosophy texts such as The Analects of Confucius, in China today, the Daodejing is correctly placed next to the other great philosophers of ancient Chinese philosophy: Confucius, Mencius, and Zhuangzi.<p>And finally, it&#x27;s important to note that classical Chinese rarely used punctuation marks like those we find it modern reproductions like you see here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.daodejing.org&#x2F;1.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.daodejing.org&#x2F;1.html</a> . Commas and periods are usually modern additions to aid in reading but usually did not appear in the original. Importantly, we have evidence that even the chapter breaks are themselves mostly inserted, that the original Laozi did not put them there. If we take out these punctuation marks, the text lends itself to still more possible translations and interpretations. And this ignores the inherently inexact and inferential nature of classical Chinese, which itself supports many translations.<p>Someday in the distant future we&#x27;ll have a hundred unique lenses on this text, but today we have relatively meager pickings. And they all sort of sound like Ursula Le Guin&#x27;s translation.</div><br/><div id="40888488" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40888488" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">karencarits</span><span>|</span><a href="#40888074">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40888155">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40888488">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40888488">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; the Daodejing being the second most translated book in history after the Bibl<p>I know this is difficult to quantify accurately, but Wikipedia lists Daodejing behind the Little Prince and Pinocchio<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_literary_works_by_number_of_translations" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_literary_works_by_nu...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40888155" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40888155" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bigstrat2003</span><span>|</span><a href="#40888074">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40888488">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40888698">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40888155">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40888155">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; If this is true, we should expect translations to be vastly different from one another.

I think LLMs are about to usher in a new era for academic translation. Obviously they have their faults, but philosophy in particular suffers to a much greater degree from language barriers than the layman might guess, so I think there’s a lot of room for improvement. In particular, many German and French authors have works that haven’t been translated yet, and, more relevantly, Chinese philosophy is still only tangentially related to European philosophy. When books do get translated, they often are translated with a significant delay, obviously leading to issues for people trying to form a scientific consensus.<p>I think the work of both great thinkers like Husserl and more underappreciated ones like Edith Stein would benefit greatly from LLM-assisted term-standardization and overall synchronized translation, with their original German-language works fed in alongside the translations we do have, for automated comparison purposes.<p>The academy is efficient, but IMO we’re about to see a scientific revolution in the humanities — aka cognitive science.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40886940" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40886940" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ericra</span><span>|</span><a href="#40886879">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40887476">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40887993">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40886940">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40886940">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes this is similar to the popular Stephen Mitchell &quot;translation&quot; in that neither spoke the original language.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m glad both of them exist.

Like, Chinese culture has a big thing for filial piety--one&#x27;s ancestors, as your creators, with the lack of a &#x27;central power&#x27;, seem to catch up some of the sovereignty that logos would attribute closer to the divine. In Chinese culture, it&#x27;s not some weird divine abstract thing you owe existence to, it&#x27;s just your ancestors.<p>Taoism seems to talk of &#x27;heaven and earth&#x27;, but &#x27;heaven&#x27; seems like the collective of little sovereignties like the emperor, your parents, and simple the pattern of nature itself, the pluralistic part. &#x27;Heaven&#x27; doesn&#x27;t seem like a monolithic entity.<p>In regard to being purposeless, purpose seems acknowledged as emergent, and subservient, like &#x27;the way that can be named is not the eternal way&#x27;--there&#x27;s naming, purpose, and then subservience. It&#x27;s harder to think of more concrete examples, and it&#x27;s a bit easy to confuse an acknowledgment of pattern with purpose, but taoism seems rather critical of purposive action on the whole.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40887635" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40887635" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">solidsnack9000</span><span>|</span><a href="#40887159">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40887624">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40888162">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40887908">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40887635">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40887635">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That is not really translation, though, once you start doing that.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40887908" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40887908" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">j45</span><span>|</span><a href="#40887159">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40887431">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40887624">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40888239">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40887908">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40887908">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you for sharing this<p>I was gifted with one translation of the Tao Te Ching.

As in English.<p>There&#x27;s also a very strong way in which this statement is not true, because if we assume that the text contains transcendental universal truths, saying that it can only be accurately expressed in Chinese, is suggesting either that it&#x27;s a uniquely Chinese truth, so it&#x27;s not universal, or that Chinese has some greater expressive quality than other languages, which is arrogant bullshit and not true.<p>So I think rather than thinking of a translation, think instead of what <i>statement</i> do you have of the truths reflected in a particular form in that original Chinese text. What statement do you have of those truths in whatever material you&#x27;re working with, be it a language or something else?<p>And it&#x27;s funny to talk about much being lost, because the text itself readily and repeatedly admits that the truths it talks about cannot be accurately expressed. In fact, it highlights the limitations of language, of the original Chinese it was written in, to accurately and fully convey what it is talking about.<p>So I think it&#x27;s nonsense to say that, “oh, so much is lost when translating from Chinese”, and it&#x27;s entirely the wrong way to talk about it, and kind of a lazy worshipfulness that&#x27;s unworthy of that, I think, in this context entirely.<p>So liberated from those constraints, I think you can be free to consider, well, what is it talking about? And also to think about that and come up with your own translation.<p>So back to the original point, I don&#x27;t think you have to lose something when you&#x27;re putting it in English. Here&#x27;s my attempt:<p>The path that can be walked is not the AllPath. The word that can be said is not the AllWord.<p>Btw, What does your regular Chinese person think about this book?

</code></pre>
I&#x27;d be (genuinely) curious if you had more precise inputs as to why Chinese language (pictographic) wouldn&#x27;t be more expressive than Western&#x27;s (alphabet-based): I think there&#x27;s reasons to not be so quickly dismissive.<p>&gt; The path that can be walked is not the AllPath.

Is it popular in Chinese speaking regions as well? What do people think about it?<p>A few isolated data points: most Chinese persons I know consider classical Chinese &quot;old unreadable stuff&quot; and don&#x27;t seem to care much for it. But plenty of Westerners (Europe) don&#x27;t care much for old Western texts either (e.g. Iliad, Plato, Bible).</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40887045" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40887045" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">max4c</span><span>|</span><a href="#40887159">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40887455">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40887045">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40887045">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Highly recommend checking out Le Guin&#x27;s Earthsea Cycle.

He begins to take responsibility for his acts and feelings. And with it he often shoulders a terrible load of guilt. He sees his shadow as much
blacker, more wholly evil, than it is. The only way for a youngster to get past the paralyzing self-blame and self-disgust of this stage is really to look at that shadow, to face it, warts and fangs and pimples and claws and all – to accept it as himself – as part of himself. The ugliest part, but not the weakest. For the shadow is the guide. The guide inward and out again; downward and up again; there, as Bilbo the Hobbit said, and back again.

Her language is not particularly flowery, and she writes using simple words, which are often the ones that have the vaguest meanings and the most room for nuance. If you take a single sentence like that from a story or novel, and remove it from its surrounding context, you strip away a lot of that nuance. By reading the sentence in isolation, you only see a pale shadow of its intended meaning.<p>Maybe this is a bad analogy, but it makes me think of how you wouldn&#x27;t think there was anything interesting about Tchaikovsky&#x27;s 1812 Overture if all you heard was the cannon volleys by themselves, even though they&#x27;re what make the piece complete.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40887106" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40887106" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">t-3</span><span>|</span><a href="#40886943">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40887033">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40887688">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40887106">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40887106">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think Earthsea and Hainish are both great, but I don&#x27;t like any of her other stuff, and don&#x27;t like this TTC (or really any of the English translations I&#x27;ve seen) either.

I only know a few words of Mandarin and can&#x27;t read the glyphs at all, but I&#x27;ve picked my way through with a dictionary and MTL - the structure of the original is obviously not reflected in any of the English translations.

I find Le Guin&#x27;s prose breathtakingly gorgeous.  And then it hits you like a brick wall.<p>&gt; The second year I was in Elbow, I was worklister, the mill syndicate cut rations. People doing six hours in the plant got full rations—just barely enough for that kind of work. People on half time got threequarter rations. If they were sick or too weak to work, they got half. On half rations you couldn’t get well. You couldn’t get back to work. You might stay alive. I was supposed to put people on half rations, people that were already sick. I was working full time, eight, ten hours sometimes, desk work, so I got full rations: I earned them.

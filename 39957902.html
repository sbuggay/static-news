Traffic is not evenly spread. The figures from the article (400M page loads per month) are subject to <i>recursive</i> 80&#x2F;20 rule. 80% of the requests (320M) are served within 20% of the time (6 days). Within those high-volume days, 80% of the requests (256M) are served in 20% of the time (~29h). And if you&#x27;re serving particularly spiky traffic patterns, then 80% of the <i>those</i> requests (~205M) come in during just 20% of the time window (5.8h) -- 5.8h is a little shy of 21000 seconds. 205M &#x2F; 21k is about 9.7k requests per second.<p>That&#x27;s still doable on a single system, but it&#x27;s no longer trivial. Especially if you want to run off a single DB with no read replicas. And while the total amount of traffic served remains the same, the necessary bandwidth cap for peak loads gets <i>far</i> above the optimistically averaged 11MB&#x2F;sec.<p>2. Unidirectional end-to-end latency only applies to streaming data. A cold start in the real world (no HTTP&#x2F;3) requires first to establish the underlying TCP connection which is three trips, then the TLS connection which is a minimum of two more trips, and <i>then</i> you get to send the actual HTTP request... which still needs to send the response back.<p>If you want to serve real humans, everything observable has to happen in less than one second[0]. After that there&#x27;s a steep drop-off as users assume your system is broken and just close the tab.<p>Disclosure: in previous life I helped to run a betting exchange. The traffic patterns are <i>extremely</i> spiky, latency requirements are demanding and trading volume is highly concentrated in just a tiny fraction of the overall event window. For any activity involving live trades, we had to get the results on their screen within 100ms from the moment <i>they</i> initiated the action. That means their network roundtrip latency ate into our event processing budget.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nngroup.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;response-times-3-important-limits&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nngroup.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;response-times-3-important-...</a></div><br/><div id="39959083" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39959083" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">swiftcoder</span><span>|</span><a href="#39958988">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39959352">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39959083">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39959083">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Point 1 is the kicker, I think, for something like a business insider clone.

I mean to say that after reading the author&#x27;s ideas my takeaway was not that they were suggesting that I irresponsibly construct a single-point-of-failure system for a situation that demands a strong availability story.

What tradeoffs are made and what risks are budgeted are not ubiquitous, therefore, our architecture should not be.<p>I, for one, appreciated the thought experiment and I took it for that: a theoretical alternative that would otherwise seem untenable being held up against a known pattern. I take it as theoretical because the author didn&#x27;t actually build the system they&#x27;re proposing for BusinessInsider, and without putting it into practice, I can only see it as that.<p>In practice, articulating and defining the cost of making choices is still the responsibility of the engineer and I don&#x27;t believe the author was ignoring availability to suggest that we should too. In fact, I&#x27;m left with: &quot;I find this proposal interesting, of course there are availability concerns, how might I solve those concerns from here?&quot; The difference between that thought and the &quot;straw-man&quot; I pointed out is that the straw-man argument reads: &quot;throw this all out because that system is only going to fail.&quot;</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39958535" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39958535" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Fannon</span><span>|</span><a href="#39959011">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39958514">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39958535">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39958535">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A lot of good arguments which I think are often under looked. &quot;We need to go into the cloud&quot; often feels more like a peer pressure thing.

Keep backups, replicate your DB to a cold DR site if you&#x27;re truly worried.  That will handle the majority of non-FAANG businesses in the majority of non-FAANG cases.<p>And if that failure occurs?  So long as you don&#x27;t lose data, it will be a short-lived blip for most businesses.

Everyone must make them. Are you ever going to forget to secure the access to any db after that?
That is not only one specific conig but an entire class of problem that you are alert to now.<p>Not only is it ok because it&#x27;s low stakes and then you know better for high stakes at work after that, but really even at work it should be normal to suffer a breakage once in a while, because at work it&#x27;s even more important that you know how to recover when it inevitably happens anyway even without making mistakes.

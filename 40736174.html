With Forth, you can define high level words using low level primitive words. You then weave these low level words together at a high level. After you have written a correct solution at a high level, bottlenecks can be optimized out by introducing new low level words. It&#x27;s like you are solving a problem by designing an instruction set specifically for that problem. But unlike a hardware ISA, you can add new instructions tailor made for the specific problem you are presently solving.<p>Paul Graham has described lisp as a tool for writing fast programs fast (that&#x27;s the gist at least). IIRC, he clarifies that each fast is a phase. Lisp allows you to write a fast, high level, prototype that might have poor runtime performance and then you refine the prototype so that the compiler can generate fast machine code.<p>Forth is similar but feels closer to the machine than Lisp because of the stack based threading model. In Forth, you often don&#x27;t need manual memory management _or_ garbage collection and you can easily extend the system with new low level words. But it does require you to think differently about your program design so that it fits the stack based vm model.<p>Historically, Forth has been implemented in assembly but you can write a Forth that targets any host. The truly mind expanding thing is that you, an individual, can write a Forth compiler and you can also write it in such a way that it has multiple targets. For example, you can generate native, jvm and js targets from the same underlying source. Usually this can be done by translating the forth generated AST to source code for another high level language. This allows you to write a fast high level language quickly without getting bogged down in writing, say, fast x86 codegen or a garbage collector. To get started, you just target the host language with the best high level properties that you need (which will be problem and context specific). I don&#x27;t enjoy writing c, but I have no problem translating to c if I need to for performance or for syscall access.<p>To illustrate the practical power of this. Suppose that you have an important subcomponent of your system that was written in, say, Node.js. It turns out that this is a critical bottleneck that cannot easily be optimized in javascript. You don&#x27;t want to rewrite the whole system, but you do want to rewrite that component and have it seamlessly interoperate with the existing system. You could write a small Forth DSL for that subcomponent. This Forth will target javascript initially. You translate the subcomponent into Forth and reuse all of the existing tests (that were presumably also written in javascript). Then you rewrite the tests in Forth so that the entire subcomponent is now written in Forth. Now you write a new backend that translates to say, c or rust with node bindings. You can run the native implementation against a native implementation of the test suite since they&#x27;re both written in high level Forth at this point. Then you can flip the switch between the native or javascript implementations and be confident that both implementations are identical because they have the same high level description.<p>Once you start seeing things this way though, you start realizing that you can write Forth style code in any language (and the reverse is also true). Forth is as much about a process for solving programming problems as it is a specific, concrete language. This is also why there is the old adage &quot;once you&#x27;ve seen one Forth, you&#x27;ve seen one Forth.&quot;</div><br/><div id="40765213" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40765213" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">8bitsrule</span><span>|</span><a href="#40760886">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40761566">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40762579">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40765213">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40765213">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I didn&#x27;t use FORTH long, maybe for a year, (back when 8080s were The Thing), but I remember my first reaction (after learning about Reverse Polish) to it: it was like using assembly language, but without the pain.<p>(Moved to 6502; don&#x27;t recall having a version for that.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="40762579" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40762579" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">7thaccount</span><span>|</span><a href="#40760886">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40761566">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40765213">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40761177">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40762579">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40762579">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think a lot of recent Forths (at least outside of the embedded space) have been written in C or C++ rather than assembly now that the processors are incredibly complicated.

Great little computer, but compared to the Spectrum that came out around the same time, it had a worse keyboard, only black and white graphics and 3KB of RAM.  Because it used Forth, you could do quite a lot in 3KB, but it was still a bit limiting.  I think mine was a very early one, because it had some added soldered wires on the board, correcting some errors.<p>Mine got modified quite a bit over the next couple of years.  Extra RAM.  Some dumpster diving got me several keypads with good quality keys.  I took them apart and made a proper keyboard to replace the original dead rubber monstrosity.<p>I made a parallel I&#x2F;O port out of TTL logic and veroboard. And then temporarily my Ace rode about on the top of a fairly flaky micromouse exploring mazes. It didn&#x27;t win any prizes but it did get me an A in O-level Technology.<p>My school was throwing out an old teletype, so I scavenged that.   Then I modified the parallel I&#x2F;O port to output +&#x2F;- 12V on one pin, and wrote software to bit-bang RS232 at 110 baud.  Back before the Internet, just finding the specs for RS232 was not so simple - our local library was a bit limited in that way - but I got there in the end.  A lot of guesswork and trial and error.  I don&#x27;t think anyone made a printer for the Ace, so I may have had the only one.  Being able to print code listings really helped.<p>The first summer I wrote a whole load of games, mostly in Forth, but sometimes Forth just wasn&#x27;t fast enough.  I got a copy of &quot;Mastering Machine Code on Your ZX81&quot;, and learned Z80 machine code.   If there was an assembler available, I didn&#x27;t have it, so this was all hand-assembled.  Getting jumps right was a total pain, as was debugging.  Generally, it either worked first time, or you started from scratch again.  Usually I got there in the end.<p>I sold those games through a ad in &quot;Your Computer&quot; magazine, and earned back the price of the computer several times.  But recording and shipping tapes one at a time got tedious really fast, so I didn&#x27;t take that any further.<p>Somewhere over the years, with my parents moving house multiple times, the Ace disappeared.  Many years later, I found one on Ebay, and still have it.  But somehow I never fell back in love with it - it just wasn&#x27;t as good as I remembered my one rather non-stock one being at that formative time in my life.</div><br/><div id="40765278" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40765278" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">8bitsrule</span><span>|</span><a href="#40761123">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40764257">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40761718">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40765278">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40765278">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh man, those were fun times.

CBASIC (from Compiler Systems aka Gordon Eubanks) dated from the same period and was also a part time activity for a nuclear sailor. CP&#x2F;M 3.0 was mature - you had a lot of professional compiler companies like Prospero, Borland, FTL, and  HiSoft, but by that stage. Some of them, like Prospero and HiSoft dated back to the CP&#x2F;M 2.2 era, and I got the impression that they had three or four staff.</div><br/><div id="40762132" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40762132" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rhelz</span><span>|</span><a href="#40761509">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40761741">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40762140">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40762132">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40762132">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for the view back into history.

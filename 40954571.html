For example,<p>- itemized lists of information. E.g. The 5 reasons for the civil war, type of questions. What to do, if you miss one item? Your card as a whole gets over exposed, while the missed item might get underexposed.<p>- Related information, e.g., history dates. When using Anki the students tends to latch on to incidental facts, e.g., Treaty of Paris, ah I remember it has two repeating digits, yes, 1899. While it would be more useful for a student to think, ah, that was after the Cuban independence struggles in the 1890&#x27;s.<p>Any user will recognize that this effect is very strong. You tend to remember cards by the most trivial of things.<p>- Hierarchical knowledge. Things like chess openings. How do you put that in Anki cards. It&#x27;s all a kludge. Where to put the variants, etc.<p>- Knowledge networks. Things like medical information (where Anki is hugely popular). But typically, you get cards with massive amounts of information because you have lots of linked information, (symptoms, causes, treatment, pharmaceuticals, etc. )<p>- Even in language learning. We have the useful fiction that there is a 1-1 relationship between words in two languages, but there almost never is.<p>- Learned knowledge tends to be linked to Anki. It happens often that you can remember things when doing Anki, while being at a loss when needing the information in the real world.<p>Add to that, that Anki does nothing for conceptual understanding. You really need to learn a subject before memorizing it, but in the learning phase Anki is not helpful.<p>So in short, yes, Anki is the best tool there is to help learning, but I&#x27;m sure better tools can be made, especially when targeted to a particular knowledge field.</div><br/><div id="40983690" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40983690" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">keiferski</span><span>|</span><a href="#40983512">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40983752">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40983690">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40983690">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">1. The best card-creation practice is to divide these itemized lists into separate cards. So ideally, you shouldn&#x27;t have 5 items on one card anyway.<p>2. Dates are pretty important to know, so I&#x27;m not sure what the issue is here.<p>3. With language learning, there is no reason why you need to make cards word-word. Personally I use image-word much more often, which correlates more to how we learn our first language.<p><i>It happens often that you can remember things when doing Anki, while being at a loss when needing the information in the real world.</i><p>I haven&#x27;t had that experience at all. But if you have, there is a simple fix: create cards that mimic the situation you&#x27;d use the phrase in. For example, have the phrase &quot;a cappuccino, please&quot; matched with a photo of a barista in a coffee shop.<p><i>Anki does nothing for conceptual understanding. You really need to learn a subject before memorizing it, but in the learning phase Anki is not helpful.</i><p>I also don&#x27;t agree with this. Learning the &quot;foundational&quot; aspects of something is critique for understanding it conceptually. For example, knowing the boring geographical details of European borders circa 1900 is key to understanding the subsequent 45 years of geopolitical conflicts.<p>In general, I think most of the critiques of Anki&#x2F;spaced repetition&#x2F;flashcards are mostly just critiques of the &quot;typical&quot; way people make cards and use the apps. If you get a little more creative with creating cards, most of these issues go away.<p>That all said, I do agree that Anki is definitely not perfect and could be improved – but more in the sense of making better-designed cards and better practices the default, not something you have to implement manually yourself.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40983752" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40983752" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">t_mann</span><span>|</span><a href="#40983512">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40983690">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40983661">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40983752">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40983752">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">ad 1: have you tried using Cloze cards for that? I like to group eg 1-2 reasons, then I will see the list with 1 or 2 items missing<p>ad 3: I had success for similar problems by simply creating a lot of cards that give enough context and just ask for the next step. In chess openings, couldn&#x27;t you just display the current position and ask something like &quot;In opening X, variant Y, what are the next moves for white here&quot;? In some cases I&#x27;ve written scripts to create cards for all variations of a question I want to ask<p>ad 4: I think Cloze deletions can help to some extent here (I&#x27;ve basically made Cloze my new default card type), but you are probably running into the limitations of Anki there<p>ad 5: language learning, specifically vocab lists, has always baffled me as a use case for SRS. there is so much context that you need in order to use words proficiently (in what kind of medium was the word used? what register was used (formal&#x2F;scientific&#x2F;informal&#x2F;...)? was it used ironically, empathetically,...?). the only way to learn language imho is to immerse youself as much as possible, through ways where it gets actually used, not such artificial environments<p>the one thing that I&#x27;d like to see changed about Anki would be to have more options for changing the scheduler, or making it easier to use custom schedulers on multiple device types. I simply don&#x27;t like the logic of SM2&#x2F;FSRS of hiding a card from you until a specified date and assuming that you&#x27;ll be reading it then. if you don&#x27;t open the app for a while, the review dates get completely messed up (I&#x27;ve had new cards scheduled for review sometime in the 2040&#x27;s). I love the interface and that you can use HTML to enter cards, but I just want to put knowledge in there and get exposed to it from time to time. I wish there was a scheduler that just randomly shows you cards, with probability roughly proportional to how urgently you need to see them. and do not interpret too much into the fact if I haven&#x27;t opened the app for half a year but still remember some of the cards well. I don&#x27;t mind seeing those cards &quot;too often&quot;, but I do mind if Anki hides the knowledge that I put in there from me, for years or decades even</div><br/></div></div><div id="40983661" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40983661" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gwervc</span><span>|</span><a href="#40983512">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40983752">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40983378">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40983661">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40983661">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; - Even in language learning.

The words aren&#x27;t in context, which leads to &quot;flashcard blindness&quot;, where you see a word in context, know that you recognize it, but can&#x27;t remember what it means.<p>2. The theory behind spaced repetition is that you learn most <i>efficiently</i> when you try to remember something just when you&#x27;re about to forget it.  But that means that if the algorithm is working properly, <i>every single card is hard</i>.  This makes motivation a problem, because you know studying is going to be a grind, not fun.<p>3. While &quot;being able to remember it after thinking a second or two&quot; might be fine when studying for an exam, or in many other contexts where memorization might be important, that&#x27;s too slow for languages.  What you want for a language is &quot;know it immediately without having to think about it&quot;.<p>4. The &quot;scheduled review&quot; system is too inflexible.  Some days you get only a handful of cards to review, some days you get dozens.  It&#x27;s hard to tell when you&#x27;re starting out how many cards you should be adding each day such that the number of cards match the amount of time &#x2F; effort you have to study.  Furthermore, if you skip a single day, you have twice as much the next day; and if life happens and you end up missing a week or a month, you come back with a giant jumble of cards, half of which you&#x27;ve forgotten, and it&#x27;s really difficult to dig your way out of it.<p>By a strange coincidence, in 2019 I <i>also</i> started on an alternate to Anki to help myself study Mandarin.  It has some similarities to his system, in that there&#x27;s multi-level knowledge; but it&#x27;s different in that instead of having a fixed schedule, it has the concept of &quot;difficulty&quot; and &quot;study value&quot; for each word &#x2F; grammar concept, and the algorithm tries to give you a full &quot;readunit&quot; of &quot;native input&quot; which will balance the two.  &quot;Spaced repetition&quot; emerges naturally from the model, and if you go away for a week (or 6 months), it knows you&#x27;ve forgotten some things, so it gradually refreshes your memory.<p>It&#x27;s in closed beta now; the first public language (MVP) will be in Biblical Greek, but the second one (if it happens, maybe in a year or two) will be in Mandarin; and hopefully there will be other ones after that.

For that domain, SRS is useful for learning an alphabet (or syllabary), for scaffolding enough common words to start understanding graded readers and for a few other tasks.
They’re terrible as a primary learning strategy, though! Too much of language is highly nuanced and context dependent and the only way to absorb all the unwritten rules, the common collocations and the precise boundaries of word meanings is through extensive input. This means encountering the same words and structures in countless different variations and contexts, not the same few sentences drilled repeatedly (at least past the beginning stages).<p>By paying attention to the specifics of learning math and tailoring the SRS to match it, it’s possible to make a far more efficient system than anyone could with an Anki deck.

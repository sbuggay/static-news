I see this consistently repeated all over HN or Reddit, but it just isn&#x27;t true. Only the high clergy routinely reached their late 60s, and trying to analyze general mortality from the relatively sparse ancient records that mostly concerned the richest and most important people introduces enormous biases.<p>It is the burial grounds that tell the full story without major biases (there still <i>are</i> biases caused by, say, sailors drowning and their bones not being buried on land - a nontrivial cause of death in a maritime imperium). And the bones of average people indicate that over half didn&#x27;t live to see their 60th birthday until the 19th century.<p>In some really bad periods (the Dark Ages in Europe), the average buried adult person is in their early forties - a tale of food insecurity and constant raids. Rome, at least, was mostly food secure and had long periods of peace, so celebrating your 50th birthday was very thinkable for a free Roman citizen of non-pauper status.<p>Edit: someone downvoting this. People, just take <i>any</i> paper about an archeological excavation of an old burial ground and the detected age distribution of the skeletons found. <i>People over 60 are untypical, though always present</i> in all periods until well into the industrial revolution. And early Medieval cemeteries skew a lot younger than either Rome at its height, or the Late Middle Ages with their better agriculture and more capable governments.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36641147" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36641147" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">schmichael</span><span>|</span><a href="#36641118">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36639316">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36641147">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36641147">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Petronius was writing comedy, but there is no reason to dispute the incidental details, which can bring the Lupanar to life.

If you borrow a bunch of money to start a business and can&#x27;t pay it back, that burden isn&#x27;t just on you. The employees who depended on your business for their income also carry some of the burden of your failure. The customers who depended on you are also impacted. At a larger scale, when a business fails, we all lose out on what could have been if it hadn&#x27;t. Our economy loses diversity. Most new businesses will fail, but the failures are never just about one person either.

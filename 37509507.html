It&#x27;s not entirely fair to say that the Match acquisition immediately caused that decline; I started a couple years after Match got the company in its hands, and only two of the original founders were still focused on OkCupid full time. But the product continued to improve and grow for years after that. There was very little top-down directives about how to develop the product during that time.<p>OkCupid had excellent growth in the first half of the 2010s, but as that growth started to plateau, it was pretty clear that the focus moved to following Tinder&#x27;s trends in an effort to match their level of growth. But OkCupid was a really healthy company with great profits and low burn, being only a team of 30-40 people. It could have stayed the way it was and continued to turn a profit. But Tinder had shown that the market size for mobile was way bigger than the desktop-focused product that OkCupid used to be. The focus towards acquiring more mobile users meant stripping down and simplifying a product that previously demanded hundreds of words of essay writing, and answering hundreds of questions. The essay prompts became simpler, multiple choice asymmetric questions got deprioritized over reciprocal yes &#x2F; no questions. And as a user, I felt the quality of conversations I had went down as most messages were sent on the go from people just trying to line up their weekend plans, instead of a deeply invested audience trying to form meaningful connections first.<p>I really miss working on the product OkCupid was when I started, and often day-dream about starting another dating app closer to its original long-form vision. But the worst part of trying to do that is bootstrapping users, and seems like the only ways to do that are either have a lot of capital, or shadier methods like fake profiles or scraping data off of other sites. Not really interested in raising or setting my morals aside to do it.</div><br/><div id="37515153" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37515153" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lr4444lr</span><span>|</span><a href="#37514958">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37516010">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37515153">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37515153">[46 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I met my wife on OkCupid.<p>The original format attracted a much smarter and more worldly crowd of women, to put it bluntly, than the other services.

Pre-mobile, not many people really used computers or the internet outside of work or gaming. I grew up in a poor part of the US and lots of people did not have desktop computers at home; most kids begged their parents for access to computers for gaming. Parents in our area could never figure me out. I liked using computers (I would dumpster dive for parts since as a poor kid, I had much more time than money) but I didn&#x27;t game much, and I&#x27;m a kid so I&#x27;m definitely not doing work. (I learned to code as a kid because I wanted to make games and then I found the coding part much more fun than the gaming part.) My parents were flummoxed how a kid who liked spending so much time reading was also so weird about wanting to use something as expensive as a computer.<p>That&#x27;s the root of this blog post, the rise of Tinder, and the big shift to mobile in general. Nerds aren&#x27;t the only people on the internet anymore. The average person is now on the internet. OKCupid was very much the dating site of us thoughtful nerds, those who thought text and personality tests would help them find a better match. Most singles in the West at the time just went to the bar, got intoxicated, then made base conversation with whomever engaged their base interests.

How about on Tinder? You worked there, and that&#x27;s an unfair assessment of Tinder.<p>The fundamental trend in these dating apps is that ratio, and the relative growth (or decline!) of that gender&#x27;s active user base. And it&#x27;s not something Match, or for that matter Dataclysm ever discussed, even though it&#x27;s kind of the most important single metric for a dating app.<p>I mean ask demographers, they talk about 3m:2f being a crisis ratio [1]. And on Tinder it&#x27;s probably closer to 10:1-20:1, I&#x27;m sure they pay AppAnnie (or whatever they&#x27;re called now) to push out some fake ass numbers here and there. If it wasn&#x27;t a horrible number - anything worse than 3m:2f is pretty horrible! - they would write about it, and they simply won&#x27;t.<p>On the one hand I really liked Dataclysm, and I was bought into the ideas it put forward. There&#x27;s this post from 2018 by the author that used to say, oh well the reply rate to black women was 20 percentage points lower, which is the same in 2008. Well, trends showed about 18 percentage points more interracial marriages, the data was totally counter to trend: that indicated a problem in OkCupid, not in the user base as the author claimed. The Tinder PR team kind of put the kibosh on that kind of transparency for the wrong reasons, but it was the <i>right</i> idea.<p>So this big essay prompt format that the app used to use, I don&#x27;t know if it was part of the problem where OkCupid was fundamentally against trend. In some respects, clearly, the essays versus swiping didn&#x27;t matter. It certainly seems intuitive that the essays matter, it appeals to a sense of superiority in a particular audience&#x27;s way of believing how online dating should work, but those guys are operating in the vacuum of the single most important data point (the actual ratio) and are forced to essentially generate fictions for why the apps work the way they do and why it worked <i>for them.</i><p>I appreciate that from your point of view, 2013-2017 was a focus on &quot;mobile&quot; and that in your opinion that was &quot;bad.&quot; But c&#x27;mon, show me a category of free app that didn&#x27;t have a focus on &quot;mobile.&quot; I personally think the apps are doing the best given the circumstances - the ratio! - and that everything else is dancing around this because, if people knew, you know, they&#x27;d stop using them.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;edition&#x2F;Date_onomics&#x2F;7GDVBgAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=3%20men" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;edition&#x2F;Date_onomics&#x2F;7GDVBgAAQB...</a> (page 22)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37511329" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37511329" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">munificent</span><span>|</span><a href="#37514958">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37516277">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37511329">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37511329">[31 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; We’ve all been Marl at one time or another</i><p>This, to me, is the key line in this quite good article.<p>It&#x27;s not that software companies are catering to those <i>other people</i> who are infinitely stupid and deserving of our scorn.

You&#x27;re picturing a drudging life where people work all day and have barely any source of happiness.

This is the entire source of the word &quot;repugnant&quot;, because it sounds like you get infinite suffering with finite happiness. That <i>does not follow</i> from <i>anything</i> utilitarianism stipulates; you&#x27;ve simply created an awful world and falsely called it utilitarianism. Try to imagine all these people living a nearly <i>completely neutral</i> life, erring a bit on the happier side, and it suddenly doesn&#x27;t sound so bad.<p>Secondly, you&#x27;re ignoring the fact that people can create happiness for others. What fixed finite &quot;happiness&quot; resource are we divvying up here?

(This is one of the key areas where many if not most people&#x27;s moral intuitions. including mine, do not match up with utilitarianism: happiness and suffering aren&#x27;t mere numbers and you can&#x27;t just blithely have them cancel each other that way.)<p><i>&gt; if you can magically divide up some total amount of happiness, why not the same with suffering?</i><p>Nothing in the argument contradicts this.

It is available in various formats, including an audio book. It is a short, easy read. It is also one of the most impactful books I&#x27;ve ever read.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelifeyoucansave.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelifeyoucansave.org&#x2F;</a><p>Along the header there is an item &quot;free book&quot; if you want to get the book.<p>In short, there are a few theses in the book that combine in a compelling way. This isn&#x27;t his summary, this is the summary I got out of reading it. (1) the suffering of someone you don&#x27;t know is just as real as the suffering of someone you do know. (2) there are many worthy causes, but we aren&#x27;t allocating enough resources to address them all, so it is best to allocate them such that they do the most good for the worst off (3) if you are reading hacker news, you are likely in the 1% (worldwide) and your primary needs are already being met and you can make meaningful contributions to help those most in need without affecting your lifestyle much.<p>Each chapter tackles a topic. For instance, part of it brings up many the counter arguments about why someone might not want to donate and then debunks them. Eg, in a poll, most US citizens believe that 10-20% of their taxes are going to foreign, and say about half that, say 5%, would be reasonable. In fact it is well under 1%. Or people will say there have always been poor people and there will always be poor people (counter argument: to the people who are helped, aid makes a huge difference to them personally, and there have actually been great strides in the past 30 years at reducing global poverty).<p>Another chapter talks about the typical feel good news item about someone in the community who has gone blind and so the community pitches in to pay for a seeing eye dog for the person (it costs up to $50K to train and vet such dogs). Yet that same $50K could have prevented river blindness for thousands of children, or been enough to perform cataract surgery on thousands of blind adults.<p>People often say, why give to a charity in Africa? It will just end up in someone&#x27;s pocket before it helps anyway. The book talks about the effective altruism movement and describes how charities are vetted and monitored. The website above has links to many such vetted charities.<p>Another chapter talks about where to draw the line? Sure, I can afford $700 to pay for corrective surgery for a woman suffering from fistula and feel good about myself. But in reality I could afford another $700, then another $700, etc. Do I need to keep donating to those worse off until I am one of the worse off people?

In order to pay for those expenses, advertising revenue must increase. To increase advertising revenue, the site must be more &#x27;family friendly&#x27; and have stricter moderation. More users means that you can&#x27;t be as personal and must be more automated. You don&#x27;t want bad publicity because that can turn advertisers away. If you want more advertising revenue you need more users, which means you need to sand off any rough edges and unique appeal and instead appeal as broadly as possible, regardless of the original intent of the site. To appeal broadly you must add every feature that everyone else has and forget being unique. Broader appeal brings in people who reduce the quality of the content. The larger the site gets, the more appealing it becomes to bots and propoganda. In order to maximize impact for either personal (ego) or professional (money&#x2F;political) reasons, you need to post content that hits people where they&#x27;re vulnerable - cute, funny, infuriating, etc.<p>So, the product experiences enshittification.

It has millions of downloads and hundreds of thousands of monthly active users. It&#x27;s a “power” tool, not a game.<p>Unfortunately, it depends on servers for a lot of it&#x27;s core features. There are no accounts, data passes through my servers and, aside from caching, gets deleted as soon as feasible. I really wish I could avoid it, tried to reduce this as much as possible, and made servers as cheap as possible in the process. But it&#x27;s still in the $100s&#x2F;month, which I can&#x27;t justify without compensation.<p>I tried donations, and have ad free paid versions: they don&#x27;t cover costs. Ads are 95% of revenue.<p>People who paid $1 half a year ago will complain that I killed their pet if the server is down for an hour on a weekend. They&#x27;ve paid their hard won $1 after trialing the product for a month, and feel entitled to forever support of something that has running costs, in both hardware and brain power. Whereas I&#x27;ve made my buck, and have every incentive to tell them to f-off.<p>People on ads will give me a tenth of a cent everytime they use the app, so I have the incentive to keep then coming back. Of course I can be sleazy and trick them into clicking ads, or drown them in popup hell, or whatever.<p>But the point is, if $0.001 is enough to make a nice profit from each use of my app, there&#x27;s no better model than ads. A $1 sale means I&#x27;m loosing money on a power user after a few years. A $1 yearly subscription is something users just won&#x27;t do, especially without fancy upgrades. And, in all models I&#x27;ve tried, 95% of revenue is always ads. Sales don&#x27;t even cover the costs of the sales channels.<p>That&#x27;s why ads took over the internet, and you won&#x27;t be turning that back.</div><br/><div id="37515497" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37515497" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">freedomben</span><span>|</span><a href="#37510792">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37515014">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37516419">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37515497">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37515497">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You would know your market way better than me, but just anecdotally I&#x27;m usually willing to pay $5 for a useful app.  Based on your numbers it sounds like that would still make you money after 10 or so years.

Marl wouldn&#x27;t be a marginal user. The economic sense of attracting the marginal user Narl still only holds true to a point. Make the app bad enough by appealing to Narl and you&#x27;ll lose Marl to a competing app that doesn&#x27;t suck as bad. Narl is fickle, doesn&#x27;t really need the app, and will be easily tempted to move on to other apps. Not a great long term investment. Marl needs the app and as long as it does what he needs without pissing him off the app has got a user they can profit from. It seems very shortsighted to drive away your core users to temporarily attract the less interested marginal ones.<p>Thankfully, I can&#x27;t think of many apps that have gotten worse by aggressively targeting the Narls of the world. When apps get worse, it&#x27;s usually greed that gets in the way.

I actually met my wife on OkCupid, all the way back in 2007 originally, and she wasn&#x27;t even the first long-term relationship I ended up off of the site, which was back in 2004. OkCupid used to have social features, allowing you to maintain a personal blog and follow other user&#x27;s blogs. A whole lot of us had a pretty nice community, couchsurfing, visiting each other when we traveled for work. That was even how I met my wife, through the blogs, not by direct solicitation of a date. We didn&#x27;t even live on the same coast when we met, but eventually moved to the same city by chance and ended up together.<p>When Match Group bought the site, they killed these features and there was no longer any reason to stick around, but a lot of us had stuck around long after pairing off and marrying. For a long time, we even stayed in touch via other means and continued meeting up in person when we had the chance. Unfortunately, Facebook was the main place they all settled, and I did not want to stick around on Facebook, so mostly I&#x27;ve lost touch with these people now. But we had a nice community for a long time, even a nearly global community, with people in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Australia.<p>Heck, even the reason I originally joined OkCupid wasn&#x27;t with the intention of finding dates. It was because of an old vBulletin forum I was on for Armenians in Los Angeles where a bunch of people took the personality tests and compared results, so I joined to do that. But things were different enough in 2004 that I didn&#x27;t need to seek out dates. Women just messaged me and asked me out because they weren&#x27;t yet overloaded with spam and jaded from the Internet turning to shit.<p>The Internet was different in a lot of ways back then. OkCupid was founded by nerd grad students that mostly wanted to prove they could apply math to romance. But then they discovered math could actually make them rich, and Match Group never gave a shit and only cared about money from the start. I suspect much of what eventually became shit started that way. Larry and Sergey were probably legitimate math nerds, too. Mark Zuckerberg probably just wanted to hot-or-not his classmates. But then they all discovered they could get rich and investors killed the fun.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37512094" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37512094" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">amelius</span><span>|</span><a href="#37510818">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37511140">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37512689">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37512606">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37512094">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37512094">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">See also doctors and medicine.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37512606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37512606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jrvarela56</span><span>|</span><a href="#37510818">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37511140">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37512094">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37511348">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37512606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37512606">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Would be great if you could bid: the user signs a contract where they commit to pay $X if they get married.<p>The more you commit to, the more priority the algorithm gives you as it wants you to get married asap.<p>This could be easily gamed as the users could just commit to absurdly high amounts and never get married - while getting prioritized by the site.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37511348" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37511348" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ivee</span><span>|</span><a href="#37510818">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37511140">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37511997">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37511348">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37511348">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">(author here) I agree monopoly &amp; market power is a big part of the story here, but I feel like that is already well-understood; I was trying to describe what the incentives feel like from the inside.<p>I guess more anti-trust in tech would probably be good, but the reality of network effects &amp; the advertising economy mean it&#x27;s actually nontrivial for government to intervene in a way that&#x27;s clearly net good for users.

There&#x27;s hardly any competition.<p>I recently helped a group look at launching a dating app over a six month period. Here are a few take aways:<p>1. Nobody really likes the dating app experience. Most users have a few dating apps installed at any given time.<p>2. Therefore, it&#x27;s relatively easy to break into the market. You start with a single geography and a single niche, and use marketing to gain a pre-launch group of a few thousand individuals.<p>3. The MRR is not great, and churn is around 2 months. Therefore, it&#x27;s a hard market to scale into effectively without a lot of money.<p>4. Beyond the financials, the ethics are interesting. You&#x27;re either selling your users to advertisers, or you&#x27;re you&#x27;re nickel-and-diming your users for low-value features.<p>Ultimately the group we were involved with decided to invest their money and time into other projects.<p>That all said: Match.com has a monopoly because most startups want a quick exit, and not actually solve the core problems. If someone like Facebook really wanted to enter the market and win, they could crush Match.com, IMHO.

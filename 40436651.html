Also one that I can honestly imagine a high school student undertaking. I would like to know how you controlled humidity, what your popcorn making apparatus was, what conclusions you drew, can it really make my popcorn better, so many questions.<p>It seems so sad that we&#x27;re taking projects that would be real fun---like yours---and comparing them to projects that clearly required massive amounts of infrastructure and external expertise. Now, again, both kinds of projects have their place: one to let students do genuine science, and the other for students to get an exposure to university research labs.<p>Why again are we turning science fairs into competitions and handing out awards and using them to filter college admissions?

Then I would weigh them and put them all in the laundry room, where the humidity was pretty constant for different time periods over a few months.  I took another set of batches and heated them up in the oven for different periods of time.  Then re-weigh to see how much moisture was lost from the kernels.  Seeing that the amount of unpopped kernels and volume was pretty consistent between the fast drying and slow drying allowed me to predict what it might be like for years old popcorn by really drying out the kernels.  I also did some batches in a high humidity environment using a box with a humidifier and seeing the weight gain from the moisture.<p>Everything was popped in an air popper to give everything that was going to pop the time to pop.  Then count the unpopped kernels!<p>The overall conclusion is popcorn is probably good for up to a year, and you can do a lot better than the microwave bags if you buy loose popcorn.  Generally more moisture helped, but there was a sweet spot range where there&#x27;s enough moisture to have the steam make it pop big and open, but too much humidity made the casing soft and it would have just a kernel that was cracked but didn&#x27;t pop.<p>The hardest part was coming up with a precision scale that could do two digits of precision.  Basically everyone that used them then were either drug dealers or people who bought actual lab equipment.<p>Thank you for coming to my popcorn ted talk.<p>Oh and I forgot, this was when I was in 5th grade.

Teens is a golden age of compilation and remixing.<p>For kids, in general, if one kid makes a claim (&quot;I made this,&quot; or &quot;This game cartridge is mine&quot;) that turns out to be false, there is generally some sort of comeuppance.  That could be as simple as the kid losing respect within their peer group, or it could be as serious as parents being informed about the kid commiting a petty crime.<p>This is important, because it instills society&#x27;s values (such as they are) in the child.  For example, what if kid A steals a game cartridge from kid B, and then kid B retaliates by shooting and killing kid A?

In contrast, my project was entirely self-made and therefore not very impressive, but it had some gimmicks in how I presented it which managed to impress judges at the school and regional levels, enough to send me to ISEF.<p>ISEF was an amazing experience, especially as a kid from a school that was nothing special. Our school was so excited that they hired a public speaking specialist to work with me to prepare. Looking back, that training in public speaking directly contributed to many successes in my career decades down the line. Plus the experience of going to ISEF still brings back positive memories. I never felt like I belonged - there were some amazingly smart kids there - but the social camaraderie and the ability to meet kids that thought it was cool to be smart was eye opening.<p>As far as &quot;making mistakes when you&#x27;re 17&quot; - yeah, I made mistakes then too, but I certainly paid the price for them. <i>Especially</i> when you make conscious decisions to defraud and falsify, if these allegations can be proven.

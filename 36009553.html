Every language has some pain points that are responsible for more than their fair share of miscommunications. Just to use English as an example, although this is true of most natural languages, the overuse of the copula &quot;is&#x2F;are&quot; is a consistent source of mistakes whether accidental or purposeful. So much so that computer programmers learning object oriented programming have to be taught the difference between &quot;is-a&quot; vs &quot;has-a&quot; relationships.<p>If you say &quot;My coworker Taro is a samurai&quot;, what does that mean? Did he dress up as a samurai for the office costume party? Does he study older forms of Japanese martial arts? Was he descended from a noble family from the Japanese feudal era and have claim to an actual samurai title?<p>There are controlled dialects of English, like E-Prime, which forbid the use of the copula &quot;to be&quot; as ungrammatical, or at least heavily restrict it. You can say your coworker &quot;dressed as a samurai&quot;, &quot;trains in the arts of a samurai&quot;, or &quot;traces ancestral lineage from a samurai clan&quot;, but you can&#x27;t say he &quot;is a samurai&quot; in E-Prime.<p>Would this make communication more clear with fewer mistakes? I don&#x27;t think this has been adequately studied enough to say for certain. But at least in certain domains like military speech and air traffic control we have examples of such enforced language simplification resulting in measurable decreases in miscommunications. I&#x27;m very curious to see if we can generalize those results to a full, general-purpose dialect or entirely new language.</div><br/><div id="36010000" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36010000" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bradrn</span><span>|</span><a href="#36009766">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36009978">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36009987">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36010000">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36010000">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; the overuse of the copula &quot;is&#x2F;are&quot; is a consistent source of mistakes whether accidental or purposeful<p>I’m not sure I’d characterise these as ‘mistakes’, <i>per se</i>.

If I say &quot;she came from school&quot; it is clear that we&#x27;re talking about relative motion today or in the recent past from one nearby location to another. If I say &quot;her family came from Japan&quot; it is clear I&#x27;m talking about ancestry and&#x2F;or a long ago emigration, but also spatially oriented. If I say &quot;the party is from 3pm to 5pm&quot; then I am using &quot;from&quot; to indicate a temporal rather than a spatial motion. But it still conveys the same basic meaning in all these cases, as the origin point of a motion or interval, and it is not usually the case that a single usage of the word could be confused for more than one meaning.<p>The IS-A vs HAS-A relationship is entirely different. It is the difference between existential quantification (some aspect of this thing resembles&#x2F;has an X) and universal quantification (the entirety of this thing is fully captured by the meaning of X). Rigorously analyzed these are very different claims. In a strongly typed language they couldn&#x27;t be substituted for each other.<p>To make this concrete, if I say &quot;he is bad&quot; then it is unclear whether I am saying that person is an intrinsically bad man, or if I am just commenting that the thing that he is doing right now is not morally justified.<p>This may seem like splitting hairs, but that&#x27;s rather the point. It&#x27;s at the edge of what we are comfortable thinking about in everyday life. But how much of that is because the language that we use--English--doesn&#x27;t have these distinctions built into its very foundation? If we were native speakers of a E-Prime, maybe this distinction would be obvious and trivial. And maybe, just maybe, we wouldn&#x27;t let politicians and con men off the hook so easily for equivocating language.</div><br/><div id="36010233" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36010233" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bradrn</span><span>|</span><a href="#36009766">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36010087">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36010092">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36010233">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36010233">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Exercise: try stating this without the copula.<p>‘The copula has many uses.’<p>or:<p>‘The copula can be used in many different situations.’<p>-----<p>Also, I think you underestimate the amount of variation in other words, e.g.:<p>&gt; If I say &quot;she came from school&quot; it is clear that we&#x27;re talking about relative motion today or in the recent past from one nearby location to another.<p>Not just recent past, but having any time near to the point of reference: ‘When she came from school after the bomb scare…’.<p>&gt; If I say &quot;her family came from Japan&quot; it is clear I&#x27;m talking about ancestry and&#x2F;or a long ago emigration, but also spatially oriented.<p>Or they might have arrived yesterday to visit her.<p>&gt; If I say &quot;the party is from 3pm to 5pm&quot; then I am using &quot;from&quot; to indicate a temporal rather than a spatial motion.<p>But only because ‘3pm’ and ‘5pm’ themselves have clear temporal reference as opposed to spatial reference. For an ambiguous example, if I say ‘we drove from breakfast to lunch’, that might mean we drove starting at breakfast-time and finishing at lunch-time, or it might mean we started at a location where we had breakfast and drove to a location where we had lunch. (To more fully show that the latter is a valid interpretation, consider ‘we drove from breakfast to breakfast’: it makes no sense if ‘breakfast’ is a time, but it makes sense if treated with the sense of ‘place where we had breakfast’.)<p>-----<p>&gt; The IS-A vs HAS-A relationship is entirely different. It is the difference between existential quantification (some aspect of this thing resembles&#x2F;has an X) and universal quantification (the entirety of this thing is fully captured by the meaning of X).<p>This doesn’t sound quite right to me. In my view, both ‘has’ and ‘is’ are basically <i>relationships</i>, rather than quantifiers. Consider a sentence like ‘I have the keys’: this merely states a relationship between two objects, rather than quantifying over any set. A sentence like ‘The morning star is the evening star’ is similar in this regard. It is true that a sentence like ‘I have a key’ has existential meaning — but I suspect the quantification is linked to the indefinite article ‘a’ more than the verb.<p>&gt; To make this concrete, if I say &quot;he is bad&quot; then it is unclear whether I am saying that person is an intrinsically bad man, or if I am just commenting that the thing that he is doing right now is not morally justified.<p>This ambiguity isn’t limited to the copula, though. ‘I like him’ has exactly the same kind of ambiguity.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36010092" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36010092" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TeMPOraL</span><span>|</span><a href="#36009766">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36010000">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36010087">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36009987">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36010092">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36010092">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yup.

Even if formal semantics allows us to achieve complete unambiguity when it comes to grammatical categories (quantifiers, temporal and spatial setting, etc.), I think it would be exceedingly difficult to make every single lexeme completely unambiguous.

Those plus the referenced papers would be a good place to start. The one in particular that I&#x27;m thinking of is, I believe, the Summer 2014 topic of &quot;Integrating Montague Semantics and Event Semantics.&quot; That marriage of Davidsonian and Montague semantics into a single framework is, I believe, a universal theory of semantics. [It should be noted that he makes no such grandiose claims.]<p>&gt; Personally, I’m not sure if ‘unambiguous meaning’ is possible or even desirable<p>By &#x27;unambiguous meaning&#x27; I mean something more specific than the words alone imply. [I am aware of the irony.]<p>In computational semantics, the goal is to transform a parsing of a sentence into a logical statement (or in the case of a question, a query) about the world. For example, the sentence &quot;every dog barks&quot; would be translated into a logical statement of the form &quot;for every dog there exists at least one barking event with that dog as the acting subject.&quot; Or rather a mathematical statement to that effect that I don&#x27;t know how to render on HN.<p>But unfortunately in natural language even when a language is correctly parsed in terms of syntax--which is all Lojban seeks to accomplish--there are still many different possible semantic implications. For example, the sentence &quot;Spot didn&#x27;t bark&quot; could mean<p>1. There is no event in which Spot has ever barked, or
2. In the case of a specific event, Spot did not bark.<p>English doesn&#x27;t differentiate without clarification, e.g. &quot;Spot never barks&quot; or &quot;Spot didn&#x27;t bark that time.&quot; Lojban has universal and existential quantifiers, but their use is not mandated.<p>When I say I want unambiguous meaning, I mean something very specific: monoparsing of sentences to logical statements&#x2F;semantic formalisms.

The first words that an infant learns are exclusively learned through ostensive definitions (defining by pointing). This implies that the meaning of those words is fundamentally different to each of us, as it&#x27;s founded on our phenomenological experience and not through the dictionary.
Further words are learned to combine previous definitions and more ostensive definition, so ambiguity is carried on.<p>Lojban does not eliminate the ambiguity of the meaning of the words, but the ambiguity of its syntactical structure.<p>To me, the ambiguity of language, and the impracticality to change the meaning of words are the fundamental issues preventing humans to enhance the innate cognitive abilities, and the root cause  of most human conflicts around communication.<p>Any profession and culture has its own jargon, this enables them to express the particular quality of their reality with much more accuracy than common language.<p>So, instead of trying to build a shared language, what we can do is to create a personal Language for each of us. Not for the purpose of communication, but for the purpose of improving our reasoning and internal model of the world, so we can describe and make sense of our particular reality with much more accuracy.<p>I&#x27;ve been dedicated to building &quot;Interplanetary mind-map&quot;, a tool that supports making your language by making your meaning  more explicit.

When MacArthur tried to get rid of the use of Chinese characters in Japanese writing during the post-WW2 occupation, he backed off when it was embarrassingly pointed out that Japan had a higher literacy rate than the US, despite having less of an investment in state schools at the time. Studies have shown that it does not take more time or effort for a child to learn to read and write Chinese or Japanese (assuming those are their native spoken languages) than for an American student to learn to read&#x2F;write English. It may defy what you think you know as common sense, but it is a replicable observation.<p>The reason for this is that nobody except little children actually read by sounding out individual letters of words. That would be too much for the human mind to process in real time. You learn to read by recognizing particular clusters of lines on a paper or screen as having semantic meaning, and your brain translates that directly. The imlpiactoin is the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe. (Did you read that OK?)<p>So essentially, you and a Chinese person both put in the same amount of effort to learn the same number of squiggly lines on paper as having semantic meaning, and memorizing a mapping of squiggles to words. It&#x27;s just that in English the pronunciation is emphasized in the writing, whereas in Chinese it is mainly the meaning of the word that is focused on. But given that in this age most of our communication is through text which may never even be read aloud, it does make one wonder if the Chinese had the right idea all along.<p>But if so, rather than use a 3000 year old writing system with a lot of inherited historical baggage, why not start afresh? Keep the same basic concept (digital pictures in squares representing atomistic units of meaning, aligned in sequential order according to a grammar), but allow the pictures to make full benefit of today&#x27;s digital display and font rendering technology. The logical end result of this is, I believe, emoji. Or something very close to it &#x2F; evolved from it.<p>To get an idea of what I mean, you might want to check out Xu Bing&#x27;s &quot;Book from the Ground&quot;, which is a very readable book written in emoji, or something close to it.

It&#x27;s questionable if it&#x27;s even possible - to me, it sounds like a category error. &quot;Words&quot; aren&#x27;t keys in a hash table, and &quot;meaning&quot; isn&#x27;t a discrete thing.<p>&gt; <i>now you have a language without any ambiguity. If there are some ambiguity in the objects&#x2F;concepts that you are referring, then use your language more to specify the object.</i><p>Thing is, I don&#x27;t think ambiguity comes from <i>language</i>. Concepts and categories are naturally fuzzy for us. Precision is a continuum.<p>If you need to express something more precisely than your language allows with single word or term, you just create a new word and attach a long-form description to it to position and connect it to other words in the latent^H^H^H^H^H^H^H concept space. That&#x27;s how we always did it, and it was never <i>hard</i>.</div><br/><div id="36010366" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36010366" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bmacho</span><span>|</span><a href="#36010181">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36010330">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36009764">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36010366">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36010366">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I still don&#x27;t get it.

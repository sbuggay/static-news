Most of the students (including me in my early undergrad days) come to classes with blank slates. This forces your brain to be in panic mode when encountering new information from the lecturer by either jotting ferociously or not paying attention because, of course, the lecture slides will be posted in Google Drive later, after the lecture is done.<p>For engineering classes, I would rather invest the entire time in the class to focus, ask questions, and read the content from the textbooks if it&#x27;s standard stuff covered there. The ideal scenario is doing it before class, but even going through textbooks on the same day and creating notes based on them works fine for me. During my pre-undergrad days while preparing for entrance exams, my teachers would ask everyone to just listen to the whole topic while they used to explain on the whiteboard, and only at the very end, after the board was fully covered, would they give everyone 5–10 minutes to jot down the content in their notebooks. I really think that really balances all the classroom learning, but I have never experienced the same type of teaching philosophy elsewhere since then.<p>I also think that a particular type of learning style can&#x27;t work across subjects. There is no one-size-fits-all. You can&#x27;t study history the same way you do mathematics. Physics is very different from chemistry, and computer science is definitely different. A lot of universities (anything outside the top 10) in my country really got CS education all wrong. I see kids writing code in their notebooks. Mugging up random information.

I can say that I have been a very successful student (graduated with best GPA in class, did a PhD, now a professor) and I did things very different to what&#x27;s described here. Goes to show that different people might need very different studying styles.<p>Calculating hours of study per week beforehand? No way. I studied what was needed. If a semester was easy I studied less, if a semester was hard I studied more. I only counted hours after the fact (sometimes) to track progress. But IMO the variance in course difficulties is so large that if you allocate a constant amount of time to studying, you will fall short sometimes and study too much other times (yes, one can study  too much: studying when it&#x27;s unneeded and you&#x27;d rather be reading a novel, doing sports, having a drink, or whatever is wasting time).<p>Rewriting notes? No way. Notes took in class were the final version (at most, I could add things that I missed, but I never rewrote anything). I do concur with the author in that I did prioritize taking notes over immediate understanding - my notes were quite appreciated by the class because I took down practically everything (using a fountain pen helped!).<p>Highlighting text, be it with markers, underlining, etc.? Never.<p>And what I consider to be the key that made my study work (this was mostly a post hoc realization): I used a variant of what the post calls &quot;read-recite-review method&quot; (I didn&#x27;t know the method formally, this is just what I did spontaneously) but where &quot;recite&quot; wasn&#x27;t just reciting, but explaining the material to an invisible audience, aloud, while walking around the room, with a quite dramatic tone, gesticulating, and in English (whereas the material was written in Spanish).<p>When I started to do that I think the main reason was just to avoid boredom (which of course is no small matter when studying), but later I realized that needing to explain the material, and especially translating it to a different language in real time, is a way to force your brain to understand it and not just merely recite in automatic mode.<p>Not sure if it would work for other people, though... and it does have the drawback that you <i>need</i> to have a room for yourself with some privacy.

The article mentioned learning styles not being proven; in fact, one can argue the opposite is true; people who learn with mixed, varied content perform the best. But we also like the learning type which is comfortable for us; this boosts motivation. The problem is that studying students across a whole semester and multiple courses rarely happens, and studies focusing on how varying the learning content within a 10 minute window changed how much students learned, does not replicate the value of being familiar with a learning content style, nor the cost that things within it might blur. There are pros and cons to sticking to one style; variation certainly helps in the short term.<p>- enjoyment(or motivation) matters. Because almost every student reports procrastinating early in the Semester (95% in one study, and I guess the other 5% didn&#x27;t fill in the form). A real issue with learning research is that it tends to replicate exam period, exam conditions, and not the 60-80% of students lives where many put off studying, gently attend lectures, socialise and work between semester exam seasons. It is in that time that results are predetermined, not in the final weeks. That&#x27;s what my learning app for students focuses on, and achievable regular cadence of studying in that period; motivating and fun enough to engage before your peers are. It splits content like your lectures up into memorable emoji-represented exercises, and then sends you notifications using the emoji for one exercise each day, to get you to just study a little each day. This has big downstream effects.<p>- the quality of learning content is as variable as the quality of laptops; some is poor. Key concepts like the &quot;Minimum Information Principle&quot; - that questions based on building definitions, linking concepts and memorizing should have only one short clear answer - are almost necessary if you want to learn a serious amount without forgetting what matters and blurring answers. Long answers, although they seem better because of detail, will drop your grades as you accidentally confuse or forget part of them, as compared to separating them into different or say follow up cards.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39333465" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39333465" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kragen</span><span>|</span><a href="#39329273">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39328765">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39333465">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39333465">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>If your grades aren&#x27;t what you&#x27;d like them to be, then you probably need to change how you study!</i><p>it&#x27;s always amusing but faintly horrifying to me to see people in schools speaking as if the purpose of learning is to earn grades, rather than vice versa; most of them are sufficiently educated to know about goodhart&#x27;s law, but perhaps have not thought to apply it to this question<p>a useful counterpoint may be pg&#x27;s <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;lesson.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;lesson.html</a><p>&gt; <i>Even though I was a diligent student, almost all the work I did in school was aimed at getting a good grade on something.</i><p>&gt; <i>To many people, it would seem strange that the preceding sentence has a &quot;though&quot; in it.

but determining whether you understand something is one of the most difficult things about learning!  you can&#x27;t rely on your feelings when you read it; those mostly stem from familiarity.  asking &#x27;why?&#x27; as suggested is a little better, but it&#x27;s common for people to accept weak reasons for statements they&#x27;re already predisposed to believe (for example, because they&#x27;re familiar).  instead, you must try to apply it.  one approach is working out possible causes (&#x27;why?&#x27;) and consequences, as well as possible causes and consequences of the negation; but often you can be more focused, because in many cases you are learning a particular thing in order to gain a particular ability.  you learn about &#x27;if&#x27; statements, for example, in order to be able to write a computer program that uses them (if not to pass a test); so, attempting to write such programs is often better than asking yourself &#x27;why does the if statement in c have parentheses around the condition?&#x27;, which is not something you can answer—at least, easily, as a novice programmer, or, possibly, at all, given that thompson chose to omit them in golang.  (considering that question as you&#x27;re writing a compiler can illuminate syntax design tradeoffs!)<p>ideally, you would do this <i>before</i> the lecture, so that when the lecturer is explaining the concepts you were attempting to apply, you know what questions to ask.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39330756">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39330756</a> points out that ideally you would read the relevant textbook material before the lecture.  while i agree that this ought to be ideal, i&#x27;m reluctant to give advice i haven&#x27;t actually tried myself<p>adding marginalia, on the other hand, is an excellent idea, just as suggested here, so the advice here isn&#x27;t all bad<p>with respect to cramming, a big problem with the schooling system is that it incentivizes cramming on many levels.  (just after saying &#x27;don&#x27;t cram&#x27;, this text advises you on exactly how to cram.)   taking one semester of, for example, greek, involves spending perhaps 50 hours in class and 70 hours studying outside class; if you spend 120 hours studying greek spread over many years, you will have a lifelong working greek vocabulary of thousands of words.  by contrast, if you spend 120 hours studying greek crammed into a single semester, then never use it again, you will forget even most of the alphabet within five years.  memorably, i had forgotten even &#x27;ουχ&#x27;, the greek word for &#x27;not&#x27;<p>consequently, almost all the time spent studying in school is wasted, in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t give the students any new intellectual powers; the temporary gains in capabilities are quickly lost, as the students recede to their previous level, like <i>flowers for algernon</i>.  this observation is so commonplace that it fails to provoke the appropriate level of existential horror<p>if your objective is learning rather than earning grades, advice like &#x27;do not be tempted, by any free time that you have during exam week, to do anything other than studying&#x27; is highly counterproductive.  to the extent that you study at all during exam week, your exam grades will be unrealistically inflated and will overstate your real level of knowledge, destroying the utility of the exam as an assessment of your lasting understanding.  failing some exams will enable you to repeat the classes again next semester so you can study the material you didn&#x27;t understand in more depth<p>obviously this is terrible advice if you want to graduate, or even stay in grad school, but just as obviously, it&#x27;s what you&#x27;d do if you were using the exams for learning rather than to obtain credentials to flourish in front of the ignorant<p>a piece of advice that really ought to be in here, but isn&#x27;t, is to teach the material you&#x27;ve learned to someone else.  another very useful strategy is to get someone else to teach it to you in a one-on-one tutoring session, which will increase your performance by about two standard deviations (the well-known &#x27;bloom&#x27;s 2-sigma problem&#x27;).  wealthy and powerful people can get experts to tutor them thus, and have been doing so for millennia.  large parts of grad school also usually consist of teaching material you supposedly already know and one-on-one apprenticeship.  the rest of us have to make do with asking questions in open lecture, meeting with other students to do exercises together, going to the kinds of parties where people talk about the stuff they studied last semester, and maybe help from family members who already know it.  if you have those opportunities, don&#x27;t waste them</div><br/></div></div><div id="39328765" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39328765" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sh4rks</span><span>|</span><a href="#39333465">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39331413">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39328765">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39328765">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Two words: spaced repetition</div><br/><div id="39329489" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39329489" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yoyopa</span><span>|</span><a href="#39328765">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39328789">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39329489">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39329489">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">it&#x27;s better to just learn it the first time and remember it. that way you don&#x27;t have to repeat. that way you don&#x27;t have to repeat.</div><br/><div id="39333569" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39333569" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kragen</span><span>|</span><a href="#39328765">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39329489">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39332456">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39333569">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39333569">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">most things you have to rehearse or practice, or you&#x27;ll forget them.  only a few things (foods that make you vomit, for example, or neighborhoods where you get mugged) can be learned from a single exposure with no later mental rehearsal.  better encoding helps a lot, but it&#x27;s not a panacea</div><br/></div></div><div id="39332456" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39332456" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Denzel</span><span>|</span><a href="#39328765">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39329489">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39333569">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39332542">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39332456">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39332456">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m not sure why you’re being downvoted.

People who employ both feel like superhuman.

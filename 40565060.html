English has grossly grouped together Chinese as one unified language, when in actuality it is not. In fact, many &quot;dialects&quot; are mutually unintelligible--one speaker cannot understand another speaker. If all of China switched to using a phoenetic writing system, everyone would write everything differently. It&#x27;d be very difficult--impossible at some points--to read and write materials from other &quot;dialects&quot;. However, with a logographic approach, everyone can understand that the character 工 means &quot;work&quot; even if I pronounce it like [wirk] and someone else pronounces it like [wak], for example. It&#x27;s one of the reasons why subtitles are so prevalent in Chinese media. Obviously, this problem can be eliminated by eliminating individual &quot;dialects&quot;, which is sort of promoted through the adoption of Mandarin Chinese. Many Chinese media is also dubbed in the standard dialect so that actors with regional dialects can be understood.<p>As for Chinese characters in other languages, Japanese becomes a lot easier to read with the addition of Chinese characters. Kanji allows sentences to be shorter, less ambiguious, and easier to parse. Unlike Chinese, each character is not just a single syllable, and there are many homonyms in Japanese because there&#x27;s a smaller set of sounds.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;history.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;46658&#x2F;did-china-ever-consider-a-phonetic-writing-system#46659" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;history.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;46658&#x2F;did-china-...</a></div><br/><div id="40568594" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40568594" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gpvos</span><span>|</span><a href="#40568186">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40568935">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40568594">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40568594">[28 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As far as I know it&#x27;s not English or any Western entity that has grouped the Chinese languages together as one, but the Chinese government, for political reasons.

I&#x27;m not finding easily accessible any estimates of literacy rates for early (say, Qin dynasty) China, but numbers for medieval Europe suggest something like 10-30% for relatively broad definitions of literacy, which seem to be commensurate for estimates for Qing dynasty China. Especially if you look at the period at which Chinese characters essentially ossify into their modern form, it&#x27;s not clear to me that there&#x27;s a wide diversity of topolects that it has to approximate, almost certainly nothing to the degree of modern Chinese.<p>For another thing, mediating among linguistic diversity is something that all of our other scripts have had to do. Cuneiform was used to write the administrative languages of different language families (Semitic languages like Akkadian, Indo-European like Persian, and who-knows-what-language-family-these-are like Elamite), and yet it was a syllabary. Even Chinese script itself starts devolving into a syllabary when Japanese adapts it.<p>The reason I think Chinese resisted becoming a syllabary was because Chinese was poorly suited for such a transition: my understanding is that words in Chinese are largely monosyllabic and involve a decently high degree of homophones. Furthermore, reconstructions of Old Chinese also suggest a relatively complex phonotactic structure, which means a syllabary that largely covers a CV-syllable scheme is hard to adapt. In other words, Chinese may have been a rare language in that conversion from a logography to a syllabary would not have dramatically reduced the amount of characters one would have had to have learned. (Note also that the reduction of a syllabary to an alphabet, abjad, or abugida happened effectively twice, with Phoenician (or some ancestor) and Korean Hangul).</div><br/><div id="40569835" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40569835" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">faitswulff</span><span>|</span><a href="#40568186">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40568935">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40571521">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40569835">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40569835">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t see how your explanation and GP&#x27;s explanations are mutually exclusive.<p>To add some detail to this point:<p>&gt; my understanding is that words in Chinese are largely monosyllabic and involve a decently high degree of homophones.<p>A syllabary would have had to represent phonetics as well as <i>tones</i>, which would have multiplied the required syllabary by <i>n</i> number of tones. For instance, Mandarin has 4 (or arguably 5) tones. The &quot;ah&quot; sound has four pronunciations: ā, á, ǎ, and à. Hong Kong Cantonese has at least 6 tones, having purportedly lost a few. Different dialects of Chinese have different numbers of tones, and some have been lost or gained within the same dialect throughout history.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40571521" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40571521" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">card_zero</span><span>|</span><a href="#40568186">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40568935">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40569835">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40568358">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40571521">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40571521">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Via Phoenician (between Egyptian hieroglyphs and Etruscan), the English alphabet is also a bunch of pictograms with reduced pictorial content.<p>Here is a picture of a fish under water:<p>M<p>D</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40568358" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40568358" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">j7ake</span><span>|</span><a href="#40568186">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40568935">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40570444">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40568358">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40568358">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My analogy is that 1,2,3,4,5 is a unified script that allows anybody to understand writing.<p>However, saying the words 1,2,3,4,5 will depend on your local language.</div><br/><div id="40569214" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40569214" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jameshart</span><span>|</span><a href="#40568186">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40568358">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40569925">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40569214">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40569214">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The analogy to numerals is great to get a western-language speaker to grok the basic mechanism by which a symbol can be unrelated to a sound, reused across completely different languages, and even have different ‘readings’ in different contexts (2, 2nd, 12, 1&#x2F;2…)</div><br/></div></div><div id="40569925" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40569925" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lupire</span><span>|</span><a href="#40568186">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40568358">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40569214">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40570444">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40569925">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40569925">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But it also shows that you don&#x27;t need logograms.<p>We don&#x27;t have a distinct symbol for 35 just because English and French pronounce it differently.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40570444" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40570444" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wodenokoto</span><span>|</span><a href="#40568186">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40568358">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40568720">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40570444">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40570444">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When I was studying Mandarin Chinese at a school in Shanghai, borrowed a book on Shanghainese.

Once you get accustomed to reading kanji, and did not learn to visually parse (except very briefly as a young grade school child) nearly all of the words that you see regularly as logograms first, and groups of sounds second, the experience would be akin to reading English while afflicted with a strangely selective amnesia hole for entire words.

It&#x27;s not that English is such a unique language that it absolutely requires a spelling system that doesn&#x27;t make sense and effectively forces everyone to memorize each word&#x27;s spelling aside from it&#x27;s pronounciation (wow just like kanji), it&#x27;s just that English spelling has never been a problem to a degree that required a systematic solution, so now we&#x27;re stuck with what we have.

A typical example is nounification of verbs, something that traditional Chinese never had.

It&#x27;s a fun book to read and really teaches native Chinese speakers how to write good English. Interestingly, a lot of the lessons in that book can be applied to Chinese writing too, such as avoiding nounification, and removing duplication.

Work that goes into reducing this tends to have wonderful knock on effects all over, from faster builds, quicker rollbacks, smaller CI bills (yes it’s possible!). The biggest difficulty I’ve seen in practice is going from “somebody hits the button” to “thing happens”.<p>But even just making sure that “somebody hits the button” is a 1 button thing instead of a 20 button thing can be a major win! Totally valuable work<p>On the other side of the coin: having good observability into prod (talking mainly about APM stuff and tracing) gives devs way more confidence in the changes they’re making as well. Make it easy to deploy stuff, but also make it easy for systems to log things, and make it easy for developers to poke into those logs (my favorite flavor of this right now is honeycomb, but mainly cuz you can do perf analysis and answer questions from PMs about usage quite easily)<p>The nice thing about all of this if you’re a mid sized team is that you can totally outsource this with the right kind of person. Somebody who comes in, has the right to write some automation code (maybe it’s Zapier even!), and is not part of office infighting about process. The mandate being “make this pipeline smoother”. Probably among the easier problems to fix compared to deeper business or product problems. And it’s also super visible to other teams (“wow the bug is already fixed?”)<p>EDIT: one thing I’ve seen done that “never works” (I have not seen everything) is splitting up a repo into smaller repos. If you find yourself thinking “with smaller repos things could be smoother” it’s likely that what you want is not multiple repos but a build tool like Bazel or Buck, that will let you describe multiple projects in one repo, without causing inter-repo friction come review time. Integrating these tools can save you loads of money on CI and enforce decent test suite separation. The unfortunate flip side is that at least Bazel is very idiosyncratic, and most other tools are based on Bazel. I have heard good things about Buck 2 but have yet to see it in prod</div><br/></div></div><div id="38718330" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38718330" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">The_Colonel</span><span>|</span><a href="#38718093">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38718015">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38718330">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38718330">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s a good summary, I agree with basically everything.<p>I think a lot of it boils down to strong engineering, which is not getting mauled into submission by product &#x2F; business. Strong engineering will naturally gravitate to optimizing long processes.<p>The other big factor which has many consequences is the overall organization culture - are people encouraged to be helpful, reach out to other teams without organizing meetings in the calendar? Is there a blaming&#x2F;finger pointing happening? Are many disputes largely about ego, dominance, politics?<p>The &quot;Meetings&quot; section might be controversial, but I agree as well. There&#x27;s just no getting away from lots of communication&#x2F;alignment in large organizations, and synchronous&#x2F;low latency communication should be encouraged. Yes, that means disruptions, but being on the same page&#x2F;unblocking others is usually more important. The amount of lines of code produced is not the largest cause of productivity loss in the large organizations.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38718015" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38718015" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">devjab</span><span>|</span><a href="#38718330">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38718015">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38718015">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I stated my carer developing systems in an enterprise setting but have since moved into the wonderful space of companies transitioning from startup to enterprise. So I’ve worked a lot in this space, and while I’m not sure that I necessarily agree that old complex software is unmanageable legacy, there is a lot of truths in this article. In my experience software doesn’t really have to be “legacy” to encounter these issues. In fact a lot of 30+ year old systems are both better and more maintainable than things developed within the past 5 years. Which is probably an interesting case on its own, but let’s keep on topic!<p>The way I like to handle these systems is to slowly transition things into “microservices”. I put in in quotes because it doesn’t necessarily have to be what many think of when they read the word “microservices”, and in truth they aren’t at all since they often build upon complex shared data models with all the “fun” that comes with that. Eventually I like to build things in to actual microservices, but it’s often a loooong if not impossible struggle to get there within most organisations which view IT as a cost center on par with HR but without the communication charms. Anyway, what I like to do is to separate complex business logic into their own “microservices” so that anything related to X lives in a single smallish services instead of a big complex system. One which is example is how we’ve got a “budget upload and computation”, a ”liquidity (not entirely sure that’s the correct English word)”, and, a “bank account” service all of which used to be part of this huge complex system, but are now separated completely in terms of the responsibility for their particular businesses logic.<p>Eventually this breaks complex systems into a ton of minor services, which comes with its own set of issues and is obviously against a lot of what you’re taught in academic computer science because often you’ll have similar code in multiple systems, but it’s sooo much more maintainable and it’s so much easier to move fast and implement what the particular teams in an enterprise organisation needs for their particular business logic. In my example, we’ve gone from five teams having to wait literal months for changes to being able to implement them within a week, and often the same day they are requested. We’ve also lowered our incident reports on problems from less than 60% to above 90% each month. I’m not sure why we call it lowered when higher is better, but whatever.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

There is really nothing stopping anyone from extending SRFI-171 with a generic transduce form (and some more transducers that I left out because didn&#x27;t really think it through). Such a project has my blessing and I would be happy to mark the SRFI as superseded.<p>A vector-reduce form would be trivial but icky, and I chose not to do it to not have to have the continuation safety discussion. I have an idea to make thread and continuation safe transducers with immutable and visible state, but the first PoC was pretty slow. (I am going to say it... I miss c++ move semantics. Ouch)<p>Anyway, if I read things correctly the complaint that srfi-171 has delete dupes and delete neighbor dupes forgets that transducers are not always used to or from a data structure. They are oblivious to context. That is why both are necessary.<p>The SRFI document was written for someone who already knows what a transducer is, and specifies an API that implementers are to follow. I did not intend for it to be user documentation. User documentation is severely lacking. I was hoping for it to make it into r7rs-large (hubris. I know) and then I would make some kind of push to document it better. As it is now I have very little computer time.<p>Regarding why transducers are faster I am still pretty certain it has to do with mutation and boxing. Looking at the assembly generated by srfi-171 in chez I don&#x27;t really see that much aggressive inlining - and I don&#x27;t think chez would fare much worse with srfi-158.  Generators and accumulators use set! everywhere, meaning chez (and guile) doesn&#x27;t really try to keep the values unboxed or typed. That incurs quite a slowdown. It does use more state though.<p>Sorry about the messy response. Typing this while walking home.<p>In short: his library looks fine. Use it. From what I can see the only differences are ordering of clauses to make the transduce form generic and naming conventions. His library shadows a bunch of bindings in a non-compatible way. The transduce form is still not generic but moves the list-, vector-, generator- part of transduce into a &quot;folder&quot;. Which is fine. But a generic dispatch would be nicer.<p>Ask me anything I guess.</div><br/><div id="41305154" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41305154" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ThatGeoGuy</span><span>|</span><a href="#41304642">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41304074">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41305154">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41305154">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Author of the post here, hi! Funny to see this resurface again, I have made a number of changes to the transducers library since this blog post (see: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.call-cc.org&#x2F;eggref&#x2F;5&#x2F;transducers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.call-cc.org&#x2F;eggref&#x2F;5&#x2F;transducers</a>).<p><i>A vector-reduce form would be trivial but icky, and I chose not to do it to not have to have the continuation safety discussion.</i><p>I am not sure what &quot;continuation safety&quot; refers to in this context but I wanted a library that would give me a good out-of-the-box experience and have support for commonly used Scheme types. I have not yet added any folders&#x2F;collectors&#x2F;transducers specific to some types (like anything related to streams or SRFI-69), but I think a broad swath of types and patterns are currently covered.<p>I think in particular my griped regarding vectors were that collectors such as `collect-vector`, `collect-u8vector`, etc. were not implemented. There is a chance to break out of these collectors using continuations but that&#x27;s not really a good argument to not have them (I hope this is not what you&#x27;re referring to!).<p><i>Anyway, if I read things correctly the complaint that srfi-171 has delete dupes and delete neighbor dupes forgets that transducers are not always used to or from a data structure. They are oblivious to context. That is why both are necessary.</i><p>I think this is exactly my argument: they are oblivious to context and actually do the wrong thing by default. I&#x27;ve seen this happen in Rust with users preferring `dedup` or `dedup_by` (from the Itertools crate) rather than just constructing a HashSet or BTreeSet. It almost always is used as a shortcut to save on a data structure, and time and again I&#x27;ve seen it break workflows because it requires that the chain of items is first sorted.<p>I think this is is particularly damning for a library that means to be general purpose. If users want to implement this themselves and maintain it within their own code-bases, they&#x27;re certainly welcome to; however, I don&#x27;t personally think making this kind of deduping &quot;easy&quot; helps folks in the general sense. You&#x27;d be better off collecting into a set or bag of some kind, and then transducing a second time.<p><i>From what I can see the only differences are ordering of clauses to make the transduce form generic and naming conventions. His library shadows a bunch of bindings in a non-compatible way. The transduce form is still not generic but moves the list-, vector-, generator- part of transduce into a &quot;folder&quot;. Which is fine. But a generic dispatch would be nicer.</i><p>Shadowing bindings in a &quot;non-compatible&quot; way can be bad, but it also helps to make programs more clean. If you&#x27;re using transducers across your codebase, you almost certainly aren&#x27;t also using e.g. SRFI-1&#x27;s filter.<p>As for generic dispatch: I agree wholeheartedly. I wish we had something like Clojure protocols that didn&#x27;t suck. I&#x27;ve looked into ways to (ab)use variant records for this sort of thing, but you run into an open&#x2F;closed problem on extending the API. This is really something that needs to be solved at the language level and something like COOPS &#x2F; GOOPS incurs a degree of both conceptual and actual performance overhead that makes them somewhat unsatisfying :(<p>And also: thank you for SRFI-171. I disagree with some of the design decisions but had it not been written I probably wouldn&#x27;t have even considered transducers as something worth having.</div><br/><div id="41307604" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41307604" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">woolion</span><span>|</span><a href="#41304642">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41305154">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41307867">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41307604">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41307604">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Small unrelated bug report: in your &quot;Book review: Bernoulli&#x27;s Fallacy&quot; article, there is a link to: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thatgeoguy.ca&#x2F;blog&#x2F;%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D&#x2F;2021&#x2F;03&#x2F;07&#x2F;review-the-little-typer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thatgeoguy.ca&#x2F;blog&#x2F;%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7...</a><p>I don&#x27;t have much time to read through all this now but I&#x27;ll check later, looks like great write-ups!</div><br/></div></div><div id="41307867" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41307867" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bjoli</span><span>|</span><a href="#41304642">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41305154">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41307604">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41304074">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41307867">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41307867">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; It almost always is used as a shortcut to save on a data structure, and time and again I&#x27;ve seen it break workflows because it requires that the chain of items is first sorted.<p>I am not sure I understand.

In such a context you need both dedup and dedup-neighbors.<p>To be frank, I don&#x27;t really care much for the *-transduce functions.

For the fold method, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen it called sentinel value. Usually it is seed or initial?</i><p>I think in Scheme it is common to call it knil, mirroring how lists use nil as the &quot;sentinel&quot; value which marks the end of a proper list. I opted to name it sentinel in that article (and in the docs) for two reasons:<p>1. Sentinel values are a common topic in many languages <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sentinel_value" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sentinel_value</a><p>2. Transducers necessarily abstract across a lot more than loops &#x2F; lists. Lisps do a lot of really cool (and optimized) stuff with lists alone and Scheme is no different in this regard. However, because of how Scheme primarily exports list operations in (scheme base) is really easy to run into a situation where lists are used in an ad-hoc way where another data structure is more appropriate. This includes vectors, sets, mappings, hashmaps, etc. Transducers-the-library is meant to be general across operations that work on all of these types, so I chose language that intentionally departs from thinking in a list-focused way.<p><i>Now, my main question. Transducer? I&#x27;m curious on the etymology of that word. By itself, I don&#x27;t think I could ever guess what it was referencing. :(</i><p>This is from Rich Hickey&#x27;s presentation: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6mTbuzafcII" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6mTbuzafcII</a><p>It&#x27;s not a reducer, because they serve as higher-order functions that operate on reducers. Instead, the values they accept are transient through the function(s), so they transduce.

I think I met Yehuda Katz briefly after that at a conference (along with Jim Weirch, RIP). Since then I&#x27;ve been using Ruby pretty much every day. I built some crazy weird stuff in Ruby, often using lessons learned from this post, and many more since. One of the rare memories I have of my 20&#x27;s is figuring out  Eigenclasses.<p>Now I&#x27;ve landed in using Elixir and I can safely say I kinda think it was all a little bit of a waste. I know why Ruby had these kinds of ideas, I remember the release of Refinements (2015 was a hell of a year) and I think it enabled a bunch of interesting software, but holy crap how many hours or days did I spend debugging some absolute method_missing mess? Or the people that were my peers? Was it ultimately worth it to have classes, instances, and ancestors? I don&#x27;t use any of that stuff now and I write pretty much the same software I did back then.<p>Either way I think it&#x27;s particularly revealing to compare the post&#x27;s first sentence and last four paragraphs.</div><br/><div id="40020999" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40020999" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">benreesman</span><span>|</span><a href="#40020939">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40020999">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40020999">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I worked with Yehuda for quite a while (great guy, super smart) and even having him explain it in person never got me past a mechanical understanding.

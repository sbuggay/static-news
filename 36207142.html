What people are worried about is more mundane: whether the hyperconnectedness will make their kids less happy in the short or long run. There is some evidence that the age of first smartphone negatively correlates with these outcomes. [1] For my daughters, I worry about social media use, body image issues, and the like.<p>&gt; <i>Just delaying their first contact to the age of 13&#x2F;14 won&#x27;t magically guarantee they will be able to navigate it responsibly.

We understand that parents (<i>noun</i>) are supposed to parent (<i>verb</i>). It&#x27;s not lazy to say that we think our children would be better served if their brains were a bit more developed before they are confronted with the world of addictive apps and always-on social media.<p>I&#x27;m glad to hear that things have worked out well for your kid. There are of course a variety of outcomes for different kinds of kids. No one knows whether their kid would have been happier (or would have grown into a happier adult) had they done something differently.

They also come with social media apps preloaded (the last cell phone I bought prevented deleting or uninstalling facebook) although that doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t order your children not to create accounts. They&#x27;re also difficult to lockdown and monitor, and they continuously broadcast copious amounts of data about your children to third parties.

Not because we want to but because all the science point toward them being dangerous. I’m personally not on the hardliner side, but I’ve yet to see a single argument as to why children need to have access to a smartphone during class except for cases of accessibility. All of the pro phones in school voices in the debate here are from the tech industry or are media science professors who haven’t done any research on the health impacts.<p>I think it’s wild to find HN debating whether this is similar to banning books, or how the smartphone is just the comic or the video. Especially because I assume that you weren’t allowed to read comic books during class.<p>I don’t think you should keep access to the devices from your children, but do they need to own their own internet connected smartphones that they can use without supervision? I don’t personally think so. This is anecdotal, but I’m in my early forties so I grew up with the internet being supervised until I had enough money to buy a PC of my own which coincidentally was around the time I was in the 8th or 9th (not sure if the age ranges are the same across US and DK grades, but I was 14ish) grade. Before that I had a Commodore 64 in my room, and I had a game boy, but if I wanted to use the internet I had to do it on the family PC. I don’t think this was intentional by my parents, I think it was because a PC was just really expensive in the early 90ies. But it worked out well. Sure my friends and I spent time at the local library, downloading images of Pamala Anderson in a swimsuit, scared the librarian would get there before it had completed loading. (If you’re young, you won’t know this fear, but images would load line by line and a big swimsuit image would take several minutes to load, often failing in the process.)<p>I plan on doing something similar with my children, and I really hope our legislators will help out by banning smartphones in schools. My children had access to supervised usage from 3-4ish, but we’re a bit picky about what they get to use. This is because playing things like digital puzzles don’t give children the same development as actually touchy the pieces, and because we both have an healthy hate for mindless F2P games. Not because they are inherently evil (they probably are) but because we want to play games with our children when they get older, and if they are too indoctrinated then all they’ll want to play is stuff we won’t.

Just my own story.<p>I grew up around the same era and computing was a huge thing for me. I&#x27;ve had my first computer (ZX Spectrum 48k) when I was 6, first IBM PC-compatible when I was around 9, first dial-up Internet access around 14. I don&#x27;t really remember the ages TBH (except the 6, because I left some evidence by hardcoding my age in a BASIC program), so they&#x27;re plus-minus couple years.<p>But then Internet was different back in the day. Pay-per-minute dial-up, 14kbps on a good day, so the best available time killer was reading jokes and anecdotes from FidoNet or Usenet, offline. Endless meaningless feeds the whole day wasn&#x27;t a thing. And when tech got better my interests were already ingrained in me.<p>Looking back, it changed the trajectory of my whole life, and in a good way. I&#x27;ve had all the latest tech news, talked to smart people, and was able to learn lots of things - all when I&#x27;ve still had that virtually infinite energy and my brain was much more agile than today. So with some luck, I was able to seize some opportunities. The history has no &quot;if&quot;s, but I can&#x27;t imagine things would&#x27;ve went half as good, would I not be into computers back then.<p>But also, wouldn&#x27;t I have that curiosity, limited attention span (any game got boring pretty fast) and innate desire to entertain myself by tinkering with whatever random thing was available, I guess it could&#x27;ve went nowhere.<p>Now, the subject at hand is drastically different - phones now and personal computers back then are hard to compare fairly. Except that my parents back then weren&#x27;t always exactly fond of me setting all day and night in front some screen rather than playing with other kids (or whatever). But they tolerated it and appraised my successes.<p>Morale is, I think, it all depends on the kid - not on the tech - how they&#x27;re gonna spend their time and where they&#x27;ll head in their life. Some will create new things, some will just drown themselves in Modern Internet&#x27;s firehose of shit (maybe there was something similar back in the day and I&#x27;m just blissfully unaware, hah). I&#x27;m glad my parents have provided me with things I&#x27;ve had, letting my energy flow into something not just non-harmful but actually somewhat useful, and that their only real interference was in indirect moral guidance by me see some good and bad examples.</div><br/><div id="36208498" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36208498" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">larusso</span><span>|</span><a href="#36207825">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36208171">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36207950">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36208498">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36208498">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Morale is, I think, it all depends on the kid - not on the tech - how they&#x27;re gonna spend their time and where they&#x27;ll head in their life.<p>This is what I tried to convey with not putting it on an age barrier.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36207950" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36207950" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">flangola7</span><span>|</span><a href="#36207825">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36208171">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36208242">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36207950">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36207950">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;zombie“ kids walking around only having conversations in little chunks between smartphone breaks<p>As an adult this is me and my friends, I don&#x27;t see a problem with it.

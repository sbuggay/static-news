A lot of these firms - SPD included - were living in the 20th century when it came to all areas of operations. I&#x27;m not surprised to hear the news that they are consolidating further.<p>Even before SPD went out of business, it was very difficult to get &quot;traditional distribution&quot; that enables sales in bookstores. Indie publishers often forego distribution (and by extension, bookstore sales) and go it alone with their own websites, direct sales to individual retailers, and print on demand through Ingram and Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing.<p>I recommend the following article for insights into challenges faced by SPD:<p><i>The Berkeley publishing mindset of the 1970s was singular and beautiful in many ways. These people did not set out to be celebrities or to make names for themselves per se, or even to strike it rich. The orientation to publishing was around books for their cultural merit and value, and if they reached more readers than expected, wonderful. The ecosystem supported itself because everyone supported each other. If there were halcyon days in book publishing, this was it (not accounting for the truly problematic and systemic -isms that have since become so widely unveiled and understood). The afterglow lasted a good many years because I caught its tail end in the early 2000s when I started at North Atlantic Books. By then, these guys were in their 60s, starting to wind down, and many of them wouldn’t be around to tackle the tsunami of change that was on the horizon.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brookewarner.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;distribution-the-most-misunderstood" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brookewarner.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;distribution-the-most-mi...</a></div><br/><div id="39985990" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39985990" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MichaelZuo</span><span>|</span><a href="#39983787">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39984282">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39985990">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39985990">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is this only for mass market trade books?<p>There are dozens of university presses in North America alone that have a huge selection of  high quality books available for order at any time, from what I can see online.<p>And there are multiple small distributors for the rest of the world that seemed to be viable businesses.<p>For example, I bought an excellent textbook published by Kyoto university on morphology of modern agricultural products written by Japan&#x27;s leading expert in this field, including relevant research notes from his best students, all bound in an excellent hardcover English translation.</div><br/><div id="39987261" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39987261" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Pamar</span><span>|</span><a href="#39983787">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39985990">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39984282">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39987261">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39987261">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">OT, but I really have to ask: &quot;what does <i>morphology of modern agricultural products</i> mean?&quot;.<p>Thanks to whoever can explain this in layman terms.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39984282" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39984282" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mistrial9</span><span>|</span><a href="#39983787">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39985990">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39984422">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39984282">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39984282">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">this is true, and it goes back further.. to small press freedoms in North America and in Europe ..</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39984422" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39984422" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gaucheries</span><span>|</span><a href="#39983787">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39985350">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39984422">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39984422">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">While I was in undergrad, I volunteered at SPD’s warehouse in Berkeley for a summer.

Contributing your time to a non-profit is not &quot;letting someone screw you with no commitment&quot;. Moreso if you&#x27;re an intern in a non-profit that explicitly set forth to offer unpaid internships to anyone who applied. Volunteers are there to contribute without expecting a salary, but that is not consent for abuse. Quite the opposite.<p>Also, you&#x27;re talking about completely distinct things. Volunteering for an organization is not a green card to be treated poorly or abused by current staff. In fact, organizations who open internships understand well how it is in their best interests to create a good environment and a good experience. They know they are opening their inner workings to the outside world and creating experiences for those whose main deliverable for the organization is not work but PR in the form of testimonies and first-hand accounts.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39985350" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39985350" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwiforgtnlzy</span><span>|</span><a href="#39984422">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39987501">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39985350">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39985350">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">An anecdotal examination of a low-volume book written of someone I used to know.

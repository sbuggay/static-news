If you&#x27;re at all interested in big systems, you should read this.<p>&gt; Compounding this latency, hard drive performance is also variable depending on the other transactions in the queue. Smaller requests that are scattered randomly on the media take longer to find and access than several large requests that are all next to each other. This random performance led to wildly inconsistent behavior.<p>The effect of this can be huge! Given a reasonably sequential workload, modern magnetic drives can do &gt;100MB&#x2F;s of reads or writes. Given an entirely random 4kB workload, they can be limited to as little as 400kB&#x2F;s of reads or writes. Queuing and scheduling can help avoid the truly bad end of this, but real-world performance still varies by over 100x depending on workload. That&#x27;s really hard for a multi-tenant system to deal with (especially with reads, where you can&#x27;t do the &quot;just write it somewhere else&quot; trick).<p>&gt; To know what to fix, we had to know what was broken, and then prioritize those fixes based on effort and rewards.<p>This was the biggest thing I learned from Marc in my career (so far). He&#x27;d spend time working on visualizations of latency (like the histogram time series in this post) which were much richer than any of the telemetry we had, then tell a story using those visualizations, and completely change the team&#x27;s perspective on the work that needed to be done. Each peak in the histogram came with it&#x27;s own story, and own work to optimize. Really diving into performance data - and looking at that data in multiple ways - unlocks efficiencies  and opportunities that are invisible without that work and investment.<p>&gt; Armed with this knowledge, and a lot of human effort, over the course of a few months in 2013, EBS was able to put a single SSD into each and every one of those thousands of servers.<p>This retrofit project is one of my favorite AWS stories.<p>&gt; The thing that made this possible is that we designed our system from the start with non-disruptive maintenance events in mind. We could retarget EBS volumes to new storage servers, and update software or rebuild the empty servers as needed.<p>This is a great reminder that building distributed systems isn&#x27;t just for scale. Here, we see how building the system in a way that can seamlessly tolerate the failure of a server, and move data around without loss, makes large scale operations (everything from day-to-day software upgrades to a massive hardware retrofit project) possible that just wouldn&#x27;t be possible in a &quot;simpler&quot; architecture. A &quot;simpler&quot; architecture would make these operations much harder, to the point of being impossible, making the end-to-end problem we&#x27;re trying to solve for the customer harder.</div><br/><div id="41322465" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41322465" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dekhn</span><span>|</span><a href="#41321964">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41323232">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41322465">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41322465">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It;s funny you mentioned Marc worked on latency viz and used it to tell a story.

Reddit was one of the very first users of EBS back in 2008.  I thought I was <i>so</i> clever when I figured out that I could get more IOPS if I build a software raid out of five EBS volumes.<p>At the time each volume had very inconsistent performance, so I would launch seven or eight, and then run some each write and read loads.  I&#x27;d take the five best performers and then put them into a Linux software raid.<p>In the good case, I got the desired effect -- I did in fact get more IOPS then 5x a single node.  But in the bad case, oh boy was it bad.<p>What I didn&#x27;t realize was that if you&#x27;re using a software raid, if one node is slow, the entire raid moves at the speed of the slowest volume.  So this would manifest as a database going bad.  It took a while to figure out it was the RAID that was the problem.  And even then, removing the bad node was hard -- the software raid really didn&#x27;t want to let go of the bad volume until it could finish writing out to it, which of course was super slow.<p>And then I would put in a new EBS volume and have to rebuild the array, which of course it was also bad at because it would be bottlenecked on the IOPS for the new volume.<p>We moved off of those software raids after a while.  We almost never used EBS at Netflix, in part because I would tell everyone who would listen about my folly at reddit, and because they had already standardized on using only local disk before I ever got there.<p>And an amusing side note, when AWS had that massive EBS outage, I still worked at reddit and I was actually watching Netflix while I was waiting for the EBS to come back so I could fix all the databases.  When I interviewed at Netflix one of the questions I asked them was &quot;how were you still up during the EBS outage?&quot;, and they said, &quot;Oh, we just don&#x27;t use EBS&quot;.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41322518" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41322518" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mgdev</span><span>|</span><a href="#41323232">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41322149">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41322518">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41322518">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s cool to read this.<p>One interesting tidbit is that during the period this author writes about, AWS had a roughly 4-day outage (impacted at least EC2, EBS, and RDS, iirc), caused by EBS, that really shook folks&#x27; confidence in AWS.<p>It resulted in a reorg and much deeper investment in EBS as a standalone service.<p>It also happened around the time Apple was becoming a customer, and AWS in general was going through hockey-stick growth thanks to startup adoption (Netflix, Zynga, Dropbox, etc).<p>It&#x27;s fun to read about these technical and operational bits, but technical innovation in production is messy, and happens against a backdrop of Real Business Needs.<p>I wish more of THOSE stories were told as well.</div><br/><div id="41325358" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41325358" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BikiniPrince</span><span>|</span><a href="#41322518">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41322149">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41325358">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41325358">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It was a good year after that incident.

Smaller requests that are scattered randomly on the media take longer to find and access than several large requests that are all next to each other. This random performance led to wildly inconsistent behavior. Early on, we knew that we needed to spread customers across many disks to achieve reasonable performance. This had a benefit, it dropped the peak outlier latency for the hottest workloads, but unfortunately it spread the inconsistent behavior out so that it impacted many customers.<p>Right - which we all knew about in the 90s, and NetApp more or less solved with WAFL.<p>&gt;We made a small change to our software that staged new writes onto that SSD, allowing us to return completion back to your application, and then flushed the writes to the slower hard disk asynchronously.<p>So a write cache, which again every major vendor had from the beginning of time.

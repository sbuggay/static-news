I think a lot of the critiques of dating sites&#x2F;apps miss the mark. The &quot;they only stay in business by keep you single&quot; sort of comments.<p>Instead, i think dating sites&#x27; issues are more fundamental. Thought experiment: write a dating profile for yourself in the 3rd person. Then have you 5 closest friends and family members each write one on your behalf. Now have everyone vote on which of the 11 profiles is the most &quot;you&quot;. Do you believe yours comes in first? How about top 5?<p>When we fill out profiles, we naturally try to highlight some parts of ourselves and hide others. Your friends and family see you as you present. Only you see yourself as you intent.<p>The result of this all is that our dating profiles are a limited, and often misleading, approximation of ourselves. Any matchmaking app is thus matching my &quot;Online Dating Approximation&quot; with your &quot;Online Dating Approximation&quot;. The hope is that if our approximations match, we can extrapolate us matching? Weak connection in my experience.<p>I think this is why Tinder and Bumble have had so much success with their frankly superficial model. At least the online vs reality is closer than more in-depth matching schemes. But we still hear tales of cat&#x2F;hat-fishing, so maybe they suffer the same issues.<p>None of the dating apps ive seen have really keyed into the &quot;monkey brain&quot; side of love. The subtle things that make us truly love a person. To be seen if any get there, but there is just no substitute for getting to know someone in person vs flipping through people online.</div><br/><div id="38056495" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38056495" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">krisoft</span><span>|</span><a href="#38056197">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38056246">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38056495">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38056495">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Do you believe yours comes in first?<p>There is a fundamental misunderstanding here.

The kind of funny wich meshes with your funny? Are they insightfull? Empathic? Judgemental? Confident? Do they have lots of insecurities? These scream of the page from between the words even if, and perhaps especially so if the person is unaware of them.<p>But of course that only works if they wrote the words themselves.

The superficial model isn’t working anymore.<p>I think the issues are much more fundamental than you suggest. They’re societal and they’re subcultural within the apps. For one, people are much pickier now than they’ve ever been. On the other hand, the dating apps have this filtration problem: those who successfully form a relationship quit the app, possibly for life.<p>Unfortunately, it’s not random when people form successful relationships. Some people are just much better at it than others. This is where the filtration problem arises: over time, the concentration of people who aren’t good at forming relationships increases, as these are the folks who stay in the apps the longest. This makes it harder and harder to find a relationship through the apps, and frustration ensues.</div><br/><div id="38056517" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38056517" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">s1artibartfast</span><span>|</span><a href="#38056197">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38056246">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38056278">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38056517">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38056517">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The filtration problem isn&#x27;t app specific, that&#x27;s life.

Of course, I had already learned that falling in love online was a bright red flag, so my expectation was somewhat less than finding that monkey brain chemistry: I was looking for people who I could tolerate (and vice verse!) long enough to figure that part out.<p>After my first marriage ended, apps had all turned into tindr, and it seems that quirky folks end up in the generic loser pile, while the top 1-10% are doing bloodsport.  Fortunate for me, I&#x27;m on the empathetic side of quirky and connecting with people in person is easy enough if I put myself out there.

I suspect this has become more of an entrenched belief since the discovery of evolution&#x2F;DNA, and the generally accepted belief that most of our life outcomes are predetermined by our inheritance.<p>I think the dating apps (and employment recruitment platforms&#x2F;techniques) intensify this further, by filtering based on a few simple characteristics, some of which really are genetically predetermined (height) and others that are downstream consequences of having had a blessed start in life (income&#x2F;education level&#x2F;job seniority&#x2F;state of health).<p>Society generally, including&#x2F;especially the dating&#x2F;employment spheres, don&#x27;t seem to offer much support for people who really sincerely trying to undertake a journey of personal improvement (outside of mainstream accepted practices like conventional fitness training and education). You&#x27;re just expected to be &quot;good to go&quot;. Someone who may have been dealt a rough hand in life but is trying very hard to improve themselves, including their social skills, their emotions, their health&#x2F;fitness, their career prospects - all of which will lead them to becoming better romantic partners over time - can find themselves getting little support and encouragement along the way, and indeed can get a lot of discouragement from some quarters (including friends and family members).<p>I think a lot about how the world would be better if more people were encouraged and empowered to go on long-term journeys of deep personal growth, and what kinds of social platforms, including dating and employment platforms, could emerge out of that and bring much more opportunity and satisfaction to people who currently feel the despair of being left behind.</div><br/><div id="38056801" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38056801" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">atleastoptimal</span><span>|</span><a href="#38056681">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38056515">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38056801">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38056801">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think you hit the nail on the head in a lot of aspects but I don&#x27;t fully agree.

The double connection nature of the questions that allowed not just answering questions but also what answers you&#x27;d accept and how strongly you felt about those answers was great. It also did a nice job of sussing out people&#x27;s true personalities. The more questions they answered the more difficult it was to hide their true selves. One of my favorite examples of this was a question about why birds don&#x27;t get harmed when they land on power lines. The question could be used to gauge a person&#x27;s technical knowledge but the answer &quot;They do but they express it poorly&quot; was a signal of a sense of humor.

Everyone agreed that it was a perfect approximation of their personality.  ie. People don&#x27;t really have a sense of who they are.  (The few that do, are exceptional and don&#x27;t need dating sites).  Profiles are probably not the right artifact to use to determine a match.<p>Social cues will always be more valuable than personality, or kindness.  For men, that is status and wealth and physical attractiveness.  For women, it is beauty and age.  Regardless if you like that or not, it may be what is missing in these utilities.<p>Further, I like how the Japanese make group dates.  3 boys and 3 girls go out on a date. Gokkon.

TLDR: Once you have a two to one ratio of straight men to  straight women. Men get matched 1&#x2F;2 as much, respond by lowering there standards and spamming women.

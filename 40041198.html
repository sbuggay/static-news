Five billion people are currently under 40 years old, so well over half the world’s population has never existed in an environment but this.<p>A note based on this. While GPS was around since 1978 the signal was intentionally degraded with a process known as &quot;selective availability&quot; until 2000. This largely rendered GPS unusable for many many purposes, definitely useless for road navigation, it had some limited utility in areas like backcountry navigation and was definitely useful for marine navigation.<p>&gt; gypsum can go from a cold start to a fix on the user’s position, and the precise time, in less than a minute of listening to the antenna<p>This is very impressive and outclasses what I see even commercial receivers doing today, do you have any idea how? I remember on road trips in the early 2000s I would have to sit on the side of the road and wait for the GPS receiver to get a fix (a 15-20 minute process, when it worked) before we could leave.

With modern processing power, though, receivers (including gypsum) can just ‘brute force’ the search space to find the in-view satellites, instead of using the hints downloaded over the air.

Is my phone using &quot;brute force&quot; to find the WiFi router?</i><p>Early receivers were a lot less advanced than modern receivers - one of the key functions of the almanac is to help receivers <i>figure out what satellites they can expect to see</i> - thus greatly reducing the range of gold codes and time offsets they have to check.<p>Unlike wifi, GPS signals are below the noise floor until the gold code is applied to despread the signal, and the gold code has to be synchronized with the received signal to detect it.<p>The gold codes are pseudorandom and designed to stop signals interfering with one another. Unless you know which gold code you&#x27;re looking for, and find its time offset (accurate to about 2 chips in 1023) you can&#x27;t tell it apart from noise.<p>You also don&#x27;t quite know the frequency you&#x27;re looking for - partly due to the imprecision of the receiver clock, partly because GPS satellites move very fast and so can have a lot of Doppler shift (depending on where they are in the sky relative to the receiver of course)<p>Back when receivers had more limited physical hardware, searching through ~30 different satellites, multiplied by ~500 different gold code offsets, multiplied by a few different Doppler shifts could be a slow process. Especially if you&#x27;d found a handful of satellites, so some of your receiver channels were tied up with tracking leaving you with fewer for searching!<p>So ignoring the almanac and brute forcing every satellite, gold code offset and doppler shift is one of the many ways performance has increased since this stuff was developed in the late 1970s.</div><br/><div id="40046951" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40046951" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">myself248</span><span>|</span><a href="#40042064">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40045733">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40045514">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40046951">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40046951">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Small note -- the codes are named after Robert Gold, so being a proper noun, they should be capitalized, just like Gray, Hadamard, or Golay codes.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40045514" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40045514" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">error503</span><span>|</span><a href="#40042064">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40045242">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40045733">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40042807">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40045514">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40045514">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I hadn&#x27;t even imagined this constituting &quot;brute force&quot;.

A GPS receiver requires at least 4 parallel channels to achieve a position solution, and there are up to 32 possible codes the satellites could be at. Scanning 6 channels across 32 codes, and then also sweeping phase and doppler shift to lock them , just to &#x27;discover&#x27; if there is a valid signal there takes time, and this is what older receivers had to do. Modern receivers tend to just &#x27;brute force&#x27; this by having an entire receive pipeline dedicated to every possible PRN all the time, and possibly even correlate multiple doppler shifts simultaneously as well, so they effectively have 32 (or more) receive channels, despite only ever expecting a maximum of 12 birds being visible. The extra channels are necessary more or less exclusively to reduce acquisition time, so I think it&#x27;s fair to call them &#x27;brute force&#x27;.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40042807" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40042807" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aaronax</span><span>|</span><a href="#40042064">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40042686">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40044031">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40042635">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40042807">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40042807">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Related: Satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS), of which Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is the USA implementation.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;GNSS_augmentation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;GNSS_augmentation</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40042635" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40042635" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Cyph0n</span><span>|</span><a href="#40042064">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40042471">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40042686">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40045414">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40042635">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40042635">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As an EE grad, I would still consider what you did to be “from scratch”.

As another commenter noted well, making everyone appear at <i>exactly the same</i> location would be nigh-impossible, though.<p>GPS receivers will look for the &#x27;strongest&#x27; PRN signal in the noise, so broadcasting louder than the (incredibly weak!) C&#x2F;A signal is a valid way to jam or spoof GPS. It is, however, generally illegal for civilians.<p>GPS receivers operating with good practice do tend to try to mitigate this sort of attack, by (for example) ignoring signals with a too-high power level. It&#x27;s a bit of a cat and mouse game, and there are academic papers exploring each side.<p>Lastly, GPS receivers also need to deal with interference <i>from GPS itself</i>! If GPS signals bounce off surfaces before reaching the receiver, the receiver might see two sets of GPS signals: one that arrived directly, and one that was scattered off a surface and arrives a bit later. This is called ‘multipath interference’, and part of what goes into making GPS receivers work well is mitigating multipath interference.</div><br/><div id="40045201" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40045201" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">error503</span><span>|</span><a href="#40042416">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40042511">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40042645">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40045201">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40045201">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; making everyone appear at exactly the same location would be nigh-impossible, though.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is actually the case. In a spoofing scenario, all of the rogue signals would typically be generated by a single terrestrial station. The time of flight of all of the generated signals will be the same, so all that matters is the position solution reflected in the <i>transmitted</i> signals, as the fundamental principle of GPS based on TOF is no longer in play. So I&#x27;d think that in a typical spoofing scenario, all receivers thinking they&#x27;re in more or less an identical location is what you&#x27;d expect.<p>It might be possible in a borderline case for the receiver to receive some spoofed signals and some real signals simultaneously, in which case you&#x27;d expect weird results, but I think you&#x27;d definitely see a correlation around the position being broadcast by the spoofer.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40042645" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40042645" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pictureofabear</span><span>|</span><a href="#40042416">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40042511">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40045201">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40042774">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40042645">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40042645">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just to be a little clearer, jamming and spoofing are the not the same thing.

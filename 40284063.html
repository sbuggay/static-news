The idea of everything revolving around apps is in some ways a bit odd, if you think about it. App is short for application, and we call apps apps because in the earliest days of computers the most common question was &quot;but what are they good for?&quot;. Well, here&#x27;s an application of computers: running the numbers. Here&#x27;s another application for computers: writing letters. Etc.<p>If you think in terms of justifying expensive machines, then making everything revolve around individual &quot;apps&quot; makes sense, but once you&#x27;re beyond that and think in terms of productivity workflows an app-oriented makes less sense. Computers are not about abstract applications of the tech, they&#x27;re about produced work artifacts, which we can generically call compound documents, and those may be rich multi-media affairs with many different kinds of program contributing to the final experience.<p>At least, this was the OLE&#x2F;OpenDoc argument. Things didn&#x27;t work out that way but it&#x27;s worth asking if that was due to implementation deficiencies or because the actual vision was bad.<p>Primary evidence in the case <i>against</i> OLE-style compound documents is that it&#x27;s gone out of fashion and is hardly used anymore outside of office suites, and only hardly even there. Users don&#x27;t seem to care and aren&#x27;t asking for it back.<p>Primary evidence in the case <i>for</i> compound documents is the web. Web pages are arguably very similar to OLE style documents, but less engineered and without the ability to edit them. Nonetheless, the &lt;iframe&gt; or &lt;object&gt; tag is roughly similar to OLE&#x27;s IOleInPlaceSite [1]. In earlier versions of Internet Explorer the &lt;object&gt; tag could in fact embed OLE objects, they are so conceptually similar. URLs are similar to &quot;monikers&quot;, XML+XSLT had similar goals to OLE&#x27;s structured storage (what OpenDoc called Bento) and so on.<p>I guess the critical difference is that the developer usability of the web is much higher. OLE&#x2F;COM were the product of C++ architecture astronauts who didn&#x27;t seem to care much about developer usability. Writing OLE components was a horrifically difficult experience even if you were using Borland&#x27;s tools instead of Microsoft&#x27;s. Writing web pages was easy.<p>OpenDoc was the ultimate expression of compound document purism. In OLE apps could embed other apps, but in OpenDoc there were no apps. Everything started with a blank generic document into which you embedded components and tied them together. Pre-made document templates were available that could approximate apps but they were always editable. It was a highly fungible and malleable computing environment, somewhat similar maybe to Squeak. Jobs was right to kill it though. Apple needed to focus on shipping a good implementation of a proven paradigm at that point in its history, not trying to reinvent the basics.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;win32&#x2F;api&#x2F;oleidl&#x2F;nn-oleidl-ioleinplacesite" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;win32&#x2F;api&#x2F;oleidl&#x2F;n...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40295711" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40295711" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">andrewstuart</span><span>|</span><a href="#40295713">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40295711">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40295711">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Please, I&#x27;m still not over the trauma.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

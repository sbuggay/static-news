I have described how and posted a youtube link of a guy doing it (and been soundly chastised for not just saying &quot;binaural&quot; which is a word I learned today. Shame on me ;)<p>Using headphones will have a higher quality ceiling for &#x2F;hearing&#x2F; audio in 3 dimensional space than is possible with speakers for obvious reasons. You will not get any sound intended for the left ear only heard by the right and vice-versa.<p>So there it is, you can do 3D &quot;spatial&quot; audio and do it better and do it since a very long time and &quot;[sustain] much more detail than a 2 dimensional space&quot; If that is your artistic goal.<p>Stereo is good enough to do &quot;spatial&quot; using headphones and, in fact, will sound  better and more accurate than anything, including new branded product, that uses speakers.<p>But yeah take it with some salt because while I like music, I&#x27;m no audiophile and am consistently delighted with audio quality I can get from really quite cheap equipment.

If I recall from watching it when the video came out - Atmos is much more of a marketing thing. Converting old stereo tracks to Atmos is pure snake oil, and from a technical perspective even when you know what you are doing it&#x27;s hard to get an Atmos stream connected to an Atmos player connected to Atmos speakers so you can easily end up with the system falling back to stereo. Even when you get it working, the technical benefits are questionable and again you have the issue that most music in existence was authored for stereo, and trying to modify that audio to produce some kind of effect on Atmos is going to be arbitrarily messing with a musician&#x27;s intent and probably produce a worse result.<p>It is easy to hear the technical claims and think &quot;okay that makes sense&quot; but what I like about the video is that Benn Jordan explores the actual implementation as a regular consumer, finds complexity in deployment, finally gets it working and then talks about the musical merits as a music producer and musician.

Stick some hair on, a nose. Use it to record the left and right channel as you wander around somewhere with some noise sources. Listen to the playback using stereo headphones. It&#x27;s a very cool, low-tech thing to do. I think I did it as a kid with a cassette recorder.<p>Are you saying any of that is wrong?

When you work with something like atmos or a surround system, you have control of where that sounds sits in a spacial field, which then gets played through those cans on the left and right side of the head.

Wikipedia really relies on experts to correct it to be good.<p>Headphones work better for 3d sound than speakers and have for decades.

The beauty of Atmos is that it can be rendered properly whether you&#x27;re listening on headphones, your TV or in a theatre with 100+ speakers.<p>Sure, a mix designed specifically for your speaker configuration is equivalent to or better than Atmos -- Atmos obviously can&#x27;t magically output more audio data to a two channel headset.

That is: theoretical custom mix for headphones &gt;= Dolby Atmos &gt; traditional compromise stereo mix. However ~all content released is in the latter category. Pretty much all music released is designed to be listened to on the car radio, so all the details are compressed out. In that context, a headphone-specific mix seems to be asking too much.<p>It is, of course, completely technically possible to produce spatial audio for headphones, but there&#x27;s a reason why it didn&#x27;t really take off anywhere other than video games. DirectSound 3D, SB X-Fi and A3D back in the 90s had object-based spatial audio, though it wasn&#x27;t great, and was an API not a storage or transmission format. Ambisonics has existed since the 70s, and when I tried it out a decade or so ago, it was very cool - but for various reasons, it never really was practical outside of a few tech demos.<p>Dolby Atmos isn&#x27;t doing something that was physically impossible before, it&#x27;s just a new codec that makes it practical to store and transmit spatial audio that can be rendered for the specific speaker configuration it&#x27;s being played on. Unlike some previous attempts at it, it&#x27;s a codec that actually has relatively widespread support now, with the force of a Dolby behind it to encourage manufacturers and producers to actually implement it in the correct way. Indeed, going back to my point about car radio dynamics, Dolby Atmos even has strict rules about the loudness of content, meaning if something has Atmos, you&#x27;re probably going to get better dynamics than the standard stereo mix. My hope is that pushing audio rendering decisions to the decoder is going to force them to get a bit smarter than just dumping channels to the speakers. It&#x27;s long overdue for car audio systems to have dynamic range compression built in.<p>I see it a bit like NVIDIA G-Sync. VRR existed for a long time, but with nobody using it. NVIDIA brought it into the mainstream and applied technical standards to it to the point that you knew if you buy a G-Sync branded monitor and GPU, you&#x27;re going to get a consistent experience.</div><br/><div id="36676072" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36676072" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">harry8</span><span>|</span><a href="#36674649">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36675784">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36675062">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36676072">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36676072">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh go on.<p>You really think if Eno released &quot;Ambient 5: Music for Headphones&quot; it wouldn&#x27;t likely be his biggest seller? &quot;...few musicians...&quot; Eno for sure is one, and it could even be just a different mix and can be right beside the icon for the file with the regular mix on a streaming service.

 I’ve only really gotten into Brian Eno in the last year or so. I think his music is a great candidate for this format. It’s electronic first, and already conceptualized as a soundscape. Look forward to listening to this!

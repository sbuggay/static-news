It shows, in first hand accounts, the banality of evil and how easily it can prevail if people do nothing. It is an account of modern tyranny and everyday collaboration. The parallels in the <i>feeling</i> of what&#x27;s happened in American society, particularly the silence, confusion and cowering now of anyone who should oppose a hostile takeover and dismantling of our democracy and our laws, are striking. It should have been required reading in American schools, when there was still time to educate people against these dangers.</div><br/><div id="42945707" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42945707" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ookblah</span><span>|</span><a href="#42945242">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42945352">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42945707">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42945707">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">i don&#x27;t even want to give people that benefit at this point. used to think that it was education, circumstances, outside forces, culture, etc.  like &quot;if only&quot; we had XYZ then we can prevent this.<p>at this point i just want to call it &quot;stupidity&quot;.  not even a left vs right thing. there exists a subset of the population that cannot and will not be educated or have the ability to reason on a certain level to make things work.  they will always be taken advantage of, scammed, etc.  social media and tech just made this 10x more effective.<p>it&#x27;s how you have populations repeatedly making the same damn mistakes century after century just in a different form.  it&#x27;s baked into our DNA i suppose.<p>maybe i&#x27;m just cynical have given up.  it&#x27;s a really jarring  thing to encounter people who refuse to even spend the min effort to attempt to question their own beliefs.</div><br/><div id="42945762" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42945762" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">labster</span><span>|</span><a href="#42945242">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42945707">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42945352">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42945762">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42945762">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Nah, cynicism is the only rational reaction now.

The USA will likely address climate change directly through technology (geoengineering) vs rapid degrowth (the only two plausible means of stabilizing the climate)<p>2. The USA will likely avoid war.<p>3. The USA will likely experience large-scale economic growth due to regulatory change, efficient government services, compounding industrial ecosystems and robotics<p>4. The American scientific establishment and education system are likely to be transformed to create massive jumps in productivity (in the age of AI)<p>5. And, of course, the current trajectory of AI seems to support if not promote an unprecedented humanism. Unlike past automation, it doesn’t require humans to act like machines — instead, it lets us leverage our intuition, emotion, and vibes.  And this intelligence is available to all, worldwide.<p>We already have smarter AI than 99% of humans — and this creates certain transformative opportunities. There is little doubt that this will be applied across society at an unbelievable scale and speed.<p>Why is this desirable, you might ask? In short, China’s economic model (low-corruption communistic capitalism) is working way better than liberal democratic models.<p>We don’t want war. But we do want the ability to compete effectively with China — and with the European model, it’s not happening.<p>There are very few ways to compete with China without very strong leadership — and now, it seems, we have that chance.<p>And, with the global distribution of high-intelligence AI, there is plenty of room for distributed, decentralized local growth that can enable all people around the world to participate in economic development and super-abundant resources.<p>Things will continue to accelerate. And the biggest wellbeing challenges will come from overabundance of resources rather than their scarcity.<p>Note: these are hypotheticals for a reason!

Mere lack of enthusiasm, or failure to show it in public, was ‘defeatism.’ You assumed that there were lists of those who would be ‘dealt with’ later, after the victory. Goebbels was very clever here, too. He continually promised a ‘victory orgy’ to ‘take care of’ those who thought that their ‘treasonable attitude’ had escaped notice. And he meant it; that was not just propaganda. And that was enough to put an end to all uncertainty.<p>Terrifying. This anti-speech is anathema to all Americans. Let’s remember that. By recalling what all Americans have as a sacred self-belief (myth even), that America is anti-Nazi and anti-dictatorship and pro-freedom and pro-speech, we can effectively strengthen our ties.<p>What seems to drive Trump at his core is not ideology, but ego. On their path to power, both he and Musk could have been democrats, but they were rejected.<p>Together, they share the goal of creating the greatest presidency in American history. At some point, this may be a better scenario than the alternative.<p>The election is past: “winning” and defeating the opposition are less relevant now than creative strategies for generating positive outcomes from the current situation.<p>Outrage feeds the demons.

Control the media, control the public opinion and narrative. I think that what is happening in America is something new though. The dismantling of the US government is weird on it&#x27;s own, but the step down from US soft power is what really makes no sense. The previous 80ish years of US world dominance was build on a combination of military might and soft power. Europe was rather ruined after WW2, the reason it&#x27;s as advanced as it is today, and the reason we are&#x2F;were such close allies with the USA is because of programs like the Marshall plan. Which was essentially the USA giving Europeans the money to buy American products. Stuff like access to US produced tractors revolutionised European farming as an example. On the US side this meant that the USA investment into Europe made it possible for the American wartime industry to restructure itself. So that instead of producing tanks, factories could produce farm equipment and so on. Total win-win.<p>Military power is necessary, but political influence is bought with soft power and diplomacy. The reason USA has military bases over most of the world. Places which allows America to have places to &quot;store&quot; all that military might outside the USA is because it has allies. The Russian loss of their Syrian bases is a good example or what happens when you lose that soft power. That same soft power is also the reason American brands can sell their stuff globally. Basically the entire American entertainment industry and all the foreign aid programs are giant advertising ventures, selling the American lifestyle. When that soft power is gone, America will still be capable of getting it&#x27;s way in many cases through threats. People don&#x27;t respond well to that though. With USA rivals more than happy to step in, you shouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see Coca Cola replaced by some Chinese cola brand sometime down the road. This is obviously a semi ridiculous example, but I think it&#x27;s a good illustration if what could happen. That same thing will affect US tech dominance as well. Here in Denmark companies are now actively looking for exit strategies from the American cloud because of the increased risk. I don&#x27;t think anyone seriously expects something to happen, but at the same time, there is nothing companies hate more than risk. The reason Google Cloud never made it in Europe is because it has more risk than Azure and AWS, and with European alternatives having caught up... Well...<p>What is perhaps even worse is that the only reason the USA can function with its current deficit is because of the Dollar. If BRICS succeeds in moving half of the worlds population away from the Dollar, the American &quot;empire&quot; will fall considering it&#x27;s the only &quot;empire&quot; in the history of mankind which has been capable of maintaining it&#x27;s world dominance while also increasing its deficit.<p>Hitler and Nazi Germany might be the example everyone knows, and Musk performing his &quot;gesture&quot; doesn&#x27;t exactly help matters. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a real long term plan behind what the aristocracy in the US is doing right now though. At least not one which will keep them safe from each ohter or society as a whole. Berlusconi and his buddies never went to prison after all, no one fell out of a window and so on.</div><br/><div id="42945490" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42945490" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">whatever1</span><span>|</span><a href="#42944761">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42945344">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42945565">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42945490">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42945490">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">ΕU is currently handed over to China.

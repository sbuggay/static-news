Like, the brown-blackness of the back of your eyelids gets replaced with something you actually see, like it&#x27;s projected there?<p>I can imagine what something looks like, and I guess I sort of &#x27;see&#x27; it, but closing my eyes doesn&#x27;t make it any more real. It doesn&#x27;t seem to involve the eyes or any part of the visual system at all - it&#x27;s somewhere else in my head.</div><br/><div id="37719916" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37719916" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Jiocus</span><span>|</span><a href="#37719381">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37719445">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37719916">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37719916">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If I remember correctly, aphantasia is inability to visualise images, objects or memories in the mind, and this seems to be what the author actually refers to. The alternative, to actually perceive imagery with the eye that isn&#x27;t there is usually called hallucination. The article doesn&#x27;t get at this difference and seems to be based on Youtube videos about aphantasia.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever had a dream with vivid first person eyesight (like most people during dreams) then it&#x27;s easy to see that we should be very capable of producing high quality visuals without external stimuli.<p>I&#x27;ve been practicing on this kind of thing as it&#x27;s a technique for dropping into a lucid dream. In my case, I manage to find some kind of repeat pattern in the visual random noise of my closed eyes. Slowly and consciously I manage to see clouds or waves on an open sea, maybe add color. Then I can try something more advanced. If going to sleep, these images get more vivid and might classify for something called hypnagogic hallucinations[0], but then it&#x27;s not quite the same level of conscious involvement steering what to see. In any case, it&#x27;s nowhere near what I&#x27;d imagine as useful for an on-site photo session, more like a high effort meditation.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hypnagogia" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hypnagogia</a></div><br/><div id="37721026" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37721026" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">godelski</span><span>|</span><a href="#37719381">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37719916">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37720830">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37721026">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37721026">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Speaking of dreams, similar to the author&#x27;s comment about needing to try a month before getting good results, I used to not remember my dreams at all. I decided to keep a dream journal. First week I only had like 3 entries with one sentence notes like &quot;saw the color blue.&quot; But a few months in I was remembering most of my rem cycles, 6 months in and the dreams could continue through cycles (like one long epoch). I did this for 2 years -- stopped because I had a few times where I had just long dreams where I just did normal things (stressed at those times over the monotony of my life) and they just seemed like extra work days -- and a decade later and I still remember most of my dreams. I only ended up lucid dreaming (the goal) a few times though.

Some dreams consist of strong emotions and what I sense as I wake up is not the dream, but the feeling of have been separated from the dream. That&#x27;s hard to put into words in the middle of the night. In the end, I tend to recall my dreams quite well, many of which have a permanent place among other episodic real life events.<p>I have a few dreams that are like a long running TV show, suddenly I&#x27;m in this certain universe and the plot continues, even though it&#x27;s been a few years. In a single sleeping session it&#x27;s often the rule that dreams continue even if I wake up in the middle. It&#x27;s so consistent that waking up from a nice dream doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s lost but gives me something to look forward to.<p>Lucid dreaming in my experience is very much an Inception-like (the film) experience. Once you have &quot;woken&quot;, there&#x27;s a fine line between controlling the dream, and the dream noticing what you&#x27;re up to, eventually booting you from the matrix.<p>For something more on topic and for anyone that will be experiencing a lucid dream in the future: Take a moment to really appreciate the extreme level of graphics, and other senses the mind can render.</div><br/><div id="37723277" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37723277" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">godelski</span><span>|</span><a href="#37719381">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37722104">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37720830">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37723277">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37723277">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; That&#x27;s hard to put into words in the middle of the night.

That&#x27;s the point of the journal anyways. But yeah, it is crazy the dreams I had and how real they were. Entire lives. And even the lessons you learn from choices you make. The emotions and how things even feel real to the though.<p>&gt; and the dream noticing what you&#x27;re up to, eventually booting you from the matrix.<p>This kept happening to me! The first time I did it started to fly but then just kept going up and up and it got brighter and I woke up haha.<p>&gt; Take a moment to really appreciate the extreme level of graphics, and other senses the mind can render.<p>It really is insane and makes me think of the computation that the brain can do so efficiently. Like it doesn&#x27;t get everything right -- which is why you&#x27;re really able to get lucid (e.g. you can read something 2 times and it&#x27;ll be different) -- but it is very real regardless. I&#x27;m sure there is a lot of compression going on and some tricks being played but it is often convincing. But what is also insane is that we know even pretty small animals dream in at least some realistic way. My cat tries to run in her sleep, meows, chirps like she does at birds, and wakes up with different emotions. I&#x27;ve had a pet rat do some similar things, at least the feet. It begs the question why this evolved, how important it is (essentially simulating your environment. Like learning from synthetic data, but shower thoughts on steroids), and how this relates to consciousness.  And I wonder if we&#x27;ll push harder to make machines do these incredible feats in much smaller packages and without nearly the same training or energy requirements. And I wonder how convincing these simulations are to the smaller creatures.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37720830" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37720830" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">qingcharles</span><span>|</span><a href="#37719381">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37719916">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37721026">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37720497">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37720830">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37720830">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve suffered Hypnagogia several times in my life where I have woken up and can see giant spiders running around my bedroom.

This is a really interesting thread. I always thought people were much the same. But recently I also learned that my wife just sees words when reading a book whereas I see a “movie”.<p>Also I will project words in my mind to inspect them visually to see how to spell them, and if they look ok. And when studying I recall pages of books with the info in the place where it is printed, much like zeehio describes. This is super helpful when memorizing entire books ie when I studied biology.<p>But from this thread I still get the idea there are people that really really see things, whereas for me it stops at “visualizing”. Which does help when composing a picture but perhaps there is more? I think I’ll try this exercise.<p>One weird thing I often did (or try to do, doesn’t always work) as a kid is stare into the blackness of my closed eyes until I sort of got convinced there was a massive boulder looming over me. It would feel quite real and I’d really feel the massiveness and it would make me feel very small and even make me feel adrift.

This would include your wife when she is reading. I think they difference is that some people have access to this visualization consciously, with their frontal cortex, and for others it&#x27;s subconscious. If you didn&#x27;t have this visualization, I believe it would be really hard to commit what you read to memory and have any sense of a story.<p>When I meditate, one of the practices is to label thoughts as they arise.  When you do this, you realize that a huge amount of thoughts pass by subconsciously.  You notice them more and more as you label them, but it feels like a deep rabbit hole of thought that I haven&#x27;t gotten to the bottom of yet.<p>edit: just looked at the article and realized that the technique is essentially thought labeling.

I don&#x27;t see myself as having a disorder, just an undeveloped ability.)<p>Edit 3: Somewhat relatedly I have also been mostly unable to hear sounds in my &quot;mind&#x27;s ear&quot;, although I am a keen amateur musician. I can imagine tunes but they are not accompanied by the timbre and richness of actual sounds. They&#x27;re more of an abstraction. This is something I&#x27;ve made actual progress on, though. As a byproduct of learning sight-singing and transcription  (as an adult, starting with movable-do sol-fa), I am able to hear sounds much more convincingly at times.

I learned about that about 3-4 years ago from my colleagues. Before that I wasn&#x27;t aware that people can see images. I certainly couldn&#x27;t (still cannot).<p>I read a lot about this topic and it&#x27;s fascinating. This does not only apply to images but also sounds and smells. I cannot &quot;imagine&quot; them too. So I presume that a great musician is able to imagine certain instruments clearly in his head. At least a friend told me that he could do this. And a master chef will probably be able to imagine the taste of different ingredients.<p>I however cannot. At times this realization feels quite sad. I try to however see the benefits to this.. there are some. E.g. I have a great sleep. I always told my wife that I close my eyes and the world is gone. I then can just fall a sleep given that I am tired enough. She never understood that.<p>Were this held me back in my life is drawing and chess playing. I am good chess player on club level but I never managed to play blindfolded more than a few moves. I now know why. I also always needed references before me when drawing. I imagine a good mind&#x27;s eye could be of great help here.<p>I will certainly try the techniques mentioned in the article&#x2F;video. But I think if you can learn it depends on whether you have the ability at all. I might have dreamed with pictures very rarely but I am not sure about it.

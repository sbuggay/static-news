Everest was pretty irresponsible:<p>&gt; <i>The question of which mountaineers would comprise the climbing party was no easy one. As a consequence of World War I, there was a lack of a whole generation of strong young men. George Mallory was again part of the mission, along with Howard Somervell, Edward &quot;Teddy&quot; Norton and Geoffrey Bruce. George Ingle Finch, who had gained the record height in 1922, was proposed as a member but eventually was not included. The committee&#x27;s reasons included that he was divorced and that he had accepted money for lectures. The influential Secretary of the committee, Arthur Hinks, made it clear that for an Australian to be first on Everest was not acceptable; the British wanted the climb to be an example of British spirit to lift morale. Mallory refused to climb again without Finch, but changed his mind after being personally persuaded by the British royal family at Hinks&#x27;s request. [...] Andrew &quot;Sandy&quot; Irvine, an engineering student whom Odell knew from an expedition to Spitsbergen, was a so-called &quot;experiment&quot; for the team and a test for &quot;young blood&quot; on the slopes of Mount Everest.</i><p>So Irvine was very inexperienced, and Mallory&#x27;s absent-mindedness also didn&#x27;t bide well for their chances of coming back alive. However, the article also directly contradicts the Wikipedia page (Wikipedia states that Mallory initially refused to go without Finch, while the article writes that  &quot;he would not think of joining the new expedition if Finch was going&quot; - so make of it what you will...</div><br/><div id="40715137" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40715137" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ziggy_star</span><span>|</span><a href="#40712685">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40714778">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40713994">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40715137">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40715137">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You will find that on occasion grown men throw caution to the wind and consciously take seemingly unnecessary irresponsible risks for personal glory and the greater good.<p><pre><code>  As a consequence of World War I, there was a lack of a whole generation of strong young men.

God bless, reading this only makes me think of these <i>heroes</i> even <i>more charitably</i>. Such irresponsible people are once again desperately needed.<p>If you&#x27;d like this sentiment expressed in a less somber manner Shatner got you covered:

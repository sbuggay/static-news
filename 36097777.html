If the price of care was reasonable, sure, let&#x27;s be proactive but because PCPs don&#x27;t really seem to do anything but refer you to a specialist and any visit to a specialist + tests will immediately trigger thousands of dollars in bills, even if you&#x27;re insured you&#x27;re going be paying your deductible plus like 10-30% after that.<p>I got a random lab bill for like $650 (discounted from $2500) and in the follow up visit everyone agreed that was high but no could explain why it was that expensive - medicare&#x27;s fee schedule has the same code costing $90.  Until we stop this madness of providers basically charging whatever opaque negotiated random amount they want to insurers who then pass that down to charge payers after collecting a % the prices are just going to continue to go up and the broken medical system will stay fucked - with the consequence that the economics aren&#x27;t going to make sense to seek proactive care.</div><br/><div id="36100240" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36100240" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">arcticbull</span><span>|</span><a href="#36100159">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36100430">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36100240">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36100240">[27 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The issue isn&#x27;t really that they&#x27;re expensive - they are, they shouldn&#x27;t be. Proactive access to care is good.<p>The article kind of hints at this, but it comes down to Bayes theorem [1]. The general population has a relatively low incidence of disease, so even tests that are fairly reliable in a population with a high incidence of disease become super inaccurate when applied to the general population.<p>Worse, false positives generally - especially in the US, due to high financial liability risk - end up involving expensive, invasive medical follow-up tests, and the probability of a false positive multiplied by the risk of the exploratory procedures outweighs a later diagnosis.<p>No wonder annual physicals don&#x27;t do much good.<p>High-risk people should get periodic tests for the things they&#x27;re at risk of, and people should be in a position to report issues they discover in the course of their lives.

I am guessing a lot of these diagnoses require lifestyle changes (instead of med) that the patients wont do, e.g. pre-diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity etc<p>But it would be wrong to say that these visits are a waste.<p>&gt; Annual physical exams can “do more harm than good”<p>Key word being &quot;can&quot;, one can say this for literally for anything.

You&#x27;re very unlikely to have any serious diseases that haven&#x27;t shown symptoms.”<p>A disease does not have to be life threatening to show symptoms and even life threatening diseases (e.g. certain cancers in women) can have no symptoms until you are beyond the point of no return.<p>Sometime a person has &quot;symptoms&quot; that they think is a part of life and would never go to the doctor for if not for an annual physical. e.g. I personally know people who have had serious vitamin deficiencies found out through annual tests which they got after many years. Their &quot;symptoms&quot; were lack of energy, focus, hair loss, mood swings, sadness etc. Something most people probably wont go to the doctor for.

One recent study is described here:<p>This overstates the impact of the Nordic study. If you go to the original article[0] you can see why, this study had very low participation and event rates which limits how strong of a conclusion we can draw from this as treatment effects may not be accurately reflected (for example in some countries the colonoscopy arm only had 32% participation). We also have historical studies looking at gFOBT and flexible sigmoidoscopy showing mortality benefits which can be extrapolated to colonoscopies. For a full picture of the evidence behind colon cancer screening I would suggest referring to the USPSTF which provides a publicly accessible summary and rationale[1].<p>With respect to developing countries, colorectal cancer (and living long enough to suffer its sequela) is mostly a developed country problem although this is changing.<p>In recent years, we have been seeing a surprising rise in colorectal cancer rates occurring at younger ages presenting with advanced disease which has led to the USPTF lowering the recommendation for screening to 45 from 50. With this trend in mind and historical data, we would really need extremely strong evidence to make the claim that screening colonoscopies are ineffective which the Nordic study does not provide.<p>&gt; Similarly, while hypertension is a problem, there is scant evidence that routine treatment of it is beneficial.<p>This is just boldly incorrect and a VERY dangerous statement to make. The article you link to is entirely irrelevant as it looks at <i>acute</i> hypertension which is a very different beast, this article is describing what we call <i>permissive hypertension</i> in medicine. We have known for several years now that we do not need to tightly control inpatient blood pressures (which are often temporarily increased due to stress&#x2F;illness) and that doing so is harmful. This says nothing about the consequences of untreated chronic hypertension in the outpatient setting.<p>For treatment (beyond the scope of USPSTF which does provide a grade A recommendation for hypertension screening) we can turn to the ACC[2] which also helpfully provides an evidence synthesis specifically drawing your attention to:<p>&quot;In a meta-analysis of 61 prospective studies, the risk of CVD increased in a log-linear fashion from SBP levels &lt;115 mm Hg to &gt;180 mm Hg and from DBP levels &lt;75 mm Hg to &gt;105 mm Hg. In that analysis, 20 mm Hg higher SBP and 10 mm Hg higher DBP were each associated with a doubling in the risk of death from stroke, heart disease, or other vascular disease.&quot;<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa2208375" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa2208375</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org&#x2F;uspstf&#x2F;document&#x2F;RecommendationStatementFinal&#x2F;colorectal-cancer-screening" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org&#x2F;uspstf&#x2F;documen...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ahajournals.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1161&#x2F;HYP.0000000000000065#d1e2145" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ahajournals.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1161&#x2F;HYP.00000000000...</a></div><br/><div id="36101744" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36101744" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">oaktrout</span><span>|</span><a href="#36098821">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36099158">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36099358">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36101744">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36101744">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;This is just boldly incorrect and a VERY dangerous statement to make.&quot;<p>I couldn&#x27;t agree more.

Many, many people are autoassigned a primary care provider by their insurance, they often change this when they actually schedule a visit. Allocation of patients to providers is a very large aspect of manging health plans.<p>2) Data aggregation and validation of your information. People sign up with unbelievably garbage information and it tends to persist, even on employer provided plans.<p>3) Baseline medical status such as weight and vitals. Insurers aren&#x27;t looking at this information directly but it comes through via billing codes for the exact types of exceptional cases insurers want to measure.<p>These have a huge impact on the actuarial aspects of developing and managing health plans.<p>PS: Depending on the patient pool, for lots of pools insurers no longer put much economic weight into prevention as it has played out that insurers end up paying for the prevention but patients change insurers so often that they change before the insurer benefits from the effects of the prevention.

I don&#x27;t know. Early detected illness is usually much more easily treated and has much less serious effects.<p>When I read this counterargument:<p>&gt; Rothberg, the Cleveland Clinic physician, wrote a journal article about his father&#x27;s experience a decade ago, when an annual checkup triggered a number of follow-up tests that cost $50,000 and ended up doing more harm than good.<p>Well, yeah... Not every country has a crazy overpriced healthcare system like the US where minor problems cost thousands. Also this sounds very much like a &#x27;worst-case example&#x27;.<p>Here in Spain everything is free. Yes, the state pays for it, but the state also pays for treatments that will be more expensive when things get out of hand. And a yearly check is pretty standard and even required by employers. It has happened twice that they found a problem in my blood check. Both cases it was nothing but if it had been, knowing it early could have saved my life.<p>&gt; In the physical, the doctor used his hands to examine the patient’s stomach. He thought the aorta felt a bit enlarged there and might be an abdominal aortic aneurysm. This led to a cascade of tests — even though the patient turned out not to have an aneurysm — and during one, he nearly bled to death.<p>Yes medical tests can go wrong. But a scan would have been a much safer option here than just to go poking around.<p>&gt; This means that in the midst of a primary care shortage in the United States, doctors are spending several hours on visits that evidence suggests are a waste of time and could be harmful.<p>A primary care shortage should be fixed.

That means whether or not you can &quot;found it&quot; is largely down to chance.<p>The same thing is true for medical checkups. Because there are so many things occurring inside that biomass, whether or not a checkup can discover abnormality is largely down to educated chance.<p>Here in our city, a full-body checkup in the city hospital costs around $2,000. It includes blood and urine test, MRI &amp; X-Ray &amp; B-Ultrasound scan for conditions that are common, cardio stuffs, endoscopy from both directions and a few others. But even that kind of test still has misses, so again, it&#x27;s down to chance.<p>On the other hand, when done correctly, checkups do have it&#x27;s benefits.

How often and when to do this is debatable, but specific tests have recommendations (the USPSTF is a great source).<p>In contrast, palpating an abdomen in the hopes of opportunistically catching an asymptomatic tumor or putting a stethoscope on someone&#x27;s neck to listen for carotid artery narrowing as part of an annual screening physical exam is arguably negligent and homeopathic at best. Other than blood pressure and BMI, I can&#x27;t think of another component of the physical exam that would have potential clinical utility in an asymptomatic patient (granted my residency days in primary care are many years behind me now).<p>Using the article&#x27;s example of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, we have evidence-based recommendations on screening[0] which notably do not include a physical exam.<p>Current recommendations (expert opinion, weak evidence) for periodic health visits will vary but are typically something like every 3-5 years for patients &lt; 49* without chronic conditions and annually &gt; 50 which coincides with roughly when we start to screen for most malignancies and worry about cardiovascular disease. There are many safe and useful investigations (e.g. colon cancer screening, cholesterol) and interventions (e.g. vaccines) that can be done in this visit so calling an annual visit &#x27;bullshit&#x27; is facetious although this is very accurate for the physical part.<p>*Women between 40-49 should also be getting an annual mammogram although this does not necessarily need an associated visit.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org&#x2F;uspstf&#x2F;recommendation&#x2F;abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org&#x2F;uspstf&#x2F;recomme...</a></div><br/><div id="36100556" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36100556" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crazygringo</span><span>|</span><a href="#36098913">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36100264">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36100556">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36100556">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a layman (not a medical professional), I&#x27;ve never heard the term &quot;periodic health maintenance visit&quot; before reading this comment.<p>I&#x27;ve definitely heard &quot;annual physical&quot; and &quot;annual checkup&quot; before though.

This is from the article (emphasis added):<p>&gt;&quot;Almost nothing in the <i>complete annual physical examination</i> is based on evidence&quot;<p>I was in residency around then and it was in the early days of screening evidence and tests becoming available and cheap. This was before even all the fancy new colon cancer stool tests came out and it wasn&#x27;t that long before this article came out. We were even routinely ordering unnecessary labs like screening liver function tests and checking urine (which still happens sadly) on 30 year olds once a year who are in completely good health.<p>I think when this was written the annual physical actually meant an annual physical with a laundry list of unnecessary labs, but it was transitioning to the period where we use those words to mean a visit primarily aimed at evidence-based primary&#x2F;secondary prevention and during peak &quot;Choosing Wisely&quot; campaign to reduce unnecessary investigation. I think the authors agenda is positive but seems misleading in the context of 2023.<p>Honestly, in my opinion if you&#x27;re palpating an aortic aneurysm these days you&#x27;re practically a nutjob but people (and myself) were absolutely doing this circa 2016. This is what that looks like[0], so even if you have someone skinny enough that you can feel this through their abdomen (the aorta is in front of the spine) we&#x27;re pretending this is anything more than voodoo when we have cheap ultrasound (if appropriate).<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i0.wp.com&#x2F;medicine-opera.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;aaa.jpg?fit=570%2C424&amp;ssl=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i0.wp.com&#x2F;medicine-opera.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2016...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36100264" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36100264" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">A1kmm</span><span>|</span><a href="#36098913">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36098860">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36100264">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36100264">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Cochrane review referenced was updated in 2019 and if anything the conclusions are stronger now: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cochrane.org&#x2F;CD009009&#x2F;EPOC_general-health-checks-reducing-illness-and-mortality" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cochrane.org&#x2F;CD009009&#x2F;EPOC_general-health-checks...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36098860" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36098860" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">arisAlexis</span><span>|</span><a href="#36100264">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36098953">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36098860">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36098860">[14 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is really a bad article, one that can actually have a net negative effect on the world.

One of the biggest problems in American healthcare is overtesting, overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Quick and convenient access is obviously very good for some patients, but there&#x27;s a significant risk of harm if patients are given easy access to treatments that may be ineffective, unnecessary or actively harmful to them, based on commercial imperatives rather than medical need. The most tragic example is the proliferation of pill mills, which were one of the fundamental drivers of the opioid crisis.<p>I&#x27;m obviously opening myself to accusations of paternalism, but unnecessary healthcare causes real harms on a drastic scale. By some estimates, as much as a third of healthcare spending in the US is on treatments that offer no medical benefit; all of those unnecessary treatments carry some level of risk. The consequences of inappropriately prescribing ADHD medication might seem trivial if you once took a few ritalin or adderall to get through your exams and suffered no serious adverse consequences, but these drugs can cause devastating harm in patients at risk of mania - bipolar disorder and cyclothymia can look a lot like ADHD if you ask leading questions and don&#x27;t take a thorough history.<p>The US healthcare system is obviously broken, but the proliferation of self-service healthcare offers at least as many risks as potential benefits.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.choosingwisely.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.choosingwisely.org&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36101605" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36101605" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pipes</span><span>|</span><a href="#36100536">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36102135">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36101605">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36101605">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And the link titles on hacker news are following the same trajectory that Reddit did about a decade ago.

Most diagnostic tests have good sensitivity (they pick up most cases of real disease) but relatively poor specificity (they pick up lots of false positives).

I was working on writing some fast code to compute something I can no longer explain, to help my advisor in his computational approach to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.  I gave a talk at a number theory seminar a few towns over, and was asked if I was doing this in hopes of reinforcing the evidence behind the conjecture.  I said with a grin, &quot;well, no, I&#x27;d much rather find a counterexample.&quot;  The crowd went <i>wild</i>; I&#x27;ve never made a group of experts so angry as that day.<p>Well, I never was much of a number theorist.  I never did come to understand the basic definitions behind the BSD conjecture.  Number theory is so old, so deep, that writing a PhD on the topic is the step one takes to become a novice.  Where I say that I didn&#x27;t understand the definitions, I certainly knew them and understood the notation.  But there&#x27;s a depth of intuition that I never arrived at.  So the uproar of experts, angry that I had the audacity to hope for a counterexample, left me more curious than shaken: what do they see, that they cannot yet put words to?<p>I am delighted by these advances in formalism.  It makes the field feel infinitely more approachable, as I was a programmer long before I called myself a mathematician, and programming is still my &quot;native tongue.&quot;  To the engineers despairing at this story, take it from me: this article shows that our anxiety at the perceived lack of formalism is justified, but we must remember that anxiety is a feeling -- and the proper response to that feeling is curiosity, not avoidance.</div><br/><div id="42406492" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42406492" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">awanderingmind</span><span>|</span><a href="#42400606">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42400948">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42406492">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42406492">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  [...]this article shows that our anxiety at the perceived lack of formalism is justified, but we must remember that anxiety is a feeling -- and the proper response to that feeling is curiosity, not avoidance.<p>Beautiful sentiment, also in other areas of life, thank you.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42400948" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42400948" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bell-cot</span><span>|</span><a href="#42400606">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42406492">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42400481">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42400948">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42400948">[18 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The crowd went wild; I&#x27;ve never made a group of experts so angry as...<p>Also not a number theorist...but I&#x27;d bet those so-called experts had invested far, far too many of their man-years in that unproven conjecture.

For academic assignments, that&#x27;s 99% likely to fail.  But the insight you&#x27;ll get into the problem by trying will be more worth it.  And the other 1% of the time you&#x27;ll look like a genius.  And - as soon as you attempt <i>real</i> math research, those odds shift enormously, in favor of the counterexample-first approach.)</div><br/><div id="42401541" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42401541" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">boothby</span><span>|</span><a href="#42400606">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42400948">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42401464">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42401541">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42401541">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; All of which effort and edifice would collapse into the dumpster if some snot-nosed little upstart like you, using crude computation, achieved overnight fame by finding a counter-example.<p>Not <i>at all</i>.

Such a finding would actually be a boon to their career!  That&#x27;s why my response is curiosity, and not to sneer at them for protecting their extremely secure tenured careers.<p>Edit 1: And if you think you&#x27;ve found a counterexample to a long-standing conjecture with a computation, you&#x27;d better be <i>damned sure</i> that your computation is correct before opening your mouth in public.  And that takes a <i>ton</i> of work in the case of the BSD conjecture, because you&#x27;ve almost certainly identified a bug in the extremely complex code underlying that computation.  If I ever thought I was holding onto such a counterexample, I&#x27;d approach a human calculator like Ralph Greenberg as my first step (after internal checks: re-running the code on another computer to rule out cosmic bit flips, and perhaps running more naive, unoptimized implementations).<p>Edit 2: This attitude pervades my software development career, and I&#x27;ve brought it to my foray into superconducting circuit design: a bug report brings <i>joy</i> to my life, and I aim to shower the reporter with praise (which may involve chocolate).

No professional would want to read one.<p>I agree this attitude comes with some tradeoffs, but they do seem manageable.</div><br/><div id="42403551" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42403551" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rstuart4133</span><span>|</span><a href="#42400481">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42401063">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42401336">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42403551">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42403551">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I don&#x27;t think this is easily resolved.<p>It is technically resolvable.

There appear to be so many things which are “known to the experts” but not correctly documented. The experts are in agreement that the important ideas are robust enough to withstand knocks like this, but the details of what is actually going on might not actually be where you expect them to be. For me, this is just one of many reasons why humans might want to consider getting mathematics written down properly, i.e. in a formal system, where the chances of error are orders of magnitude smaller. However most mathematicians are not formalists, and for those people I need to justify my work in a different way. For those mathematicians, I argue that teaching machines our arguments is a crucial step towards getting machines to do it themselves. Until then, we seemed to be doomed to fix up human errors manually.<p>It makes me think about how you get UI&#x2F;UX&#x2F;web designers who make (informal, imprecise) mockups and prototypes of their design ideas and interaction flows, they then hand these off to a developer to do the coding (formalise it, explain it precisely to the machine), and on the way the developer will inevitably find problems&#x2F;holes in the designs (like an interaction scenario or code path not considered in the design, which could uncover a major design flaw), which the developer and&#x2F;or the designer will have to patch somehow.<p>As in, design and development are different roles and require different mindsets, and most designers have a very strong resistance against working and thinking like a developer.</div><br/><div id="42400037" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42400037" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">coliveira</span><span>|</span><a href="#42399920">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42399759">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42400037">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42400037">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; consider getting mathematics written down properly, i.e. in a formal system<p>This was already tried, and failed (Hilbert).

Natural language interacts with human brains in all kinds of complicated ways that we do not fully understand, so just because we can make a compelling-sounding argument in English doesn&#x27;t mean that argument doesn&#x27;t have holes somewhere.<p>Second, the incompleteness theorems apply only to given formal systems, not to formality in general.  Given a system, you can produce a Godel sentence <i>for that system</i>.  But any Godel sentence for a given system has a proof in some other more powerful system.  This is trivially true because you can always add the Godel sentence for a system as an axiom.<p>This is a very common misconception about math even among mathematicians.  Math produces only conditional truths, not absolute ones.  All formal reasoning has to start with a set of axioms and deduction rules.  Some sets of axioms and rules turn out to be more useful and interesting than others, but none of them are True in a Platonic sense, not even the Peano axioms.  Natural numbers just happen to be a good model of certain physical phenomena (and less-good models of other physical phenomena).  Irrational numbers and complex numbers and quaternions etc. etc. turn out to be good models of other physical phenomena, and other mathematical constructs turn out not to be good models of anything physical but rather just exhibit interesting and useful behavior in their own right (elliptic curves come to mind).  None of these things are True.  At best they are Useful or Interesting.

But understanding the source would require familiarization with &#x27;tedious details&#x27; which incidentally, what this article is also about.<p>So the issue, stated this way, is not so much raw talent as time and effort. This leads to the topic of motivation - finding something great in an idea can lead to investment in the subject.

A long sequence of technical steps can be compressed into a single good intuitive definition&#x2F;idea like the complexity of  navigating a path becomes clear from a higher viewpoint.<p>Grothendieck, considered by many to be the best mathematician of the past century, made the point that there were several colleagues who were  more proficient

I also wonder how well 4-manifold theory is faring.<p>Much worse, this nonchalant attitude is being taught to PhD students and postdocs both explicitly and implicitly: if you are worried too much, maybe you are not smart enough to understand the arguments&#x2F;your mathematical sense is not good enough to perceive the essence of the work.  If you explain too much, your readers will think you think they are dumb; erase this page from your paper (actual referee feedback).<p>Also, like Loeffler in the comments, I don&#x27;t trust the &quot;people have been using crystalline cohomology forever without trouble&quot; argument.

Of course, it is grounded in Fermat&#x27;s margin note about his having a wonderful proof that couldn&#x27;t fit in said margin. At the end of the documentary, the various mathematicians in it note that AW&#x27;s proof certaintly wasn&#x27;t what PdF had in mind because AW&#x27;s proof is thorougly modern.<p>So I have wondered about PdF&#x27;s possible thinking.<p>Now, the degenerate case of n=2 is just the Pythagorean Theorem<p><pre><code>  c^2 = a^2 + b^2
</code></pre>
and we now know from AW&#x27;s proof that the cubic and beyond fail.<p>Now, the PT is successful because the square b^2 can be &quot;squished&quot; over the corner of a^2, leaving a perfect square c^2. [Let&#x27;s let the a^n part be the bigger of the two.]<p><pre><code>  5^2 = 4^2 + 3^2

  25 = 16 + 9

  25 = 16 + (4 + 4 + 1)
</code></pre>
Each of the 4&#x27;s go on the sides, and the 1 goes on the corner, leaving a pure 5x5 square left over.<p>Now, for cubes, we now know that a cube cannot be &quot;squished&quot; onto another cube&#x27;s corner in such a way that makes a bigger cube.<p>I&#x27;m not up for breaking out my (diminishing) algebra right now (as it&#x27;s a brain off day), but that b^3 cube would need to break down into three flat sides, three linear edges, and the corner.<p>This fits my physical intuition of the problem and seems to me to be a possible way that PdF might have visualized the cubic form. Now, I have zero mathematical intuition about such things (or necessary math skills either), but the physical nature of the problem, plus the fact that we now know that the cubic and beyond don&#x27;t work, leads me to wonder if this is an interesting approach. It also makes me curious to know why it isn&#x27;t, if that is indeed the case, (which I assume is probable).<p>As to the n=4 and beyond, I would just hand-wave them away and say something like, &quot;Well, of course they are more fractally impossible&quot;, which by that I mean that a real mathematician would have to say exactly why the n=3 case failing means that the n&gt;=4 case would also not work. (My guess here is that there just becomes less and less possibility of matching up higher-dimensional versions of a two-term addition.)<p>Anyway, just a thought I had some years ago. I even built a lego model of the bits of cube spreading out along the corner of the a^3 cube.<p>I would enjoy learning why I&#x27;m so utterly wrong about this, but I found it a fun mental exercise some years ago that&#x27;s been swimming around in my brain.<p>Thanks in advance if there are any takers around here. :-)<p>[And, my favorite Horizon episode is &#x27;Freak Wave&#x27;.]</div><br/><div id="42405385" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42405385" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jovas</span><span>|</span><a href="#42403117">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42400611">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42405385">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42405385">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I believe Wiles&#x27; proof <i>requires</i> the case of n=3 (Euler), and n=4 (Fermat) separately.

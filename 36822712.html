You can see that even today: Chrome is bundled with Android, and the internet is designed for Chrome.<p>&gt;Second, why did IE lose to Chrome from the position of market domination while Windows has always been dominating the desktop OS market?<p>Because IE, and specifically IE6, was a product of 2001. When Firefox (<i>NOT</i> Chrome) finally usurped the throne, it was because <i>almost five years</i> had passed since IE6 had released and the technologies for the internet and computers in general were being held back by what was then an ancient decrepit relic that was IE6.<p>Firefox introduced (mostly) W3C compliant (X)HTML, advanced CSS, JavaScript, tabbed browsing (nonchalantly stolen from Opera), and browser extensions&#x2F;plugins among other things. Firefox was <i>plain better</i> than IE6 which at that point was <i>frozen ancient technology</i>, and Firefox usurped the throne from IE6. Microsoft&#x27;s kneejerk reactions that were IE7 onwards and Trident!Edge came far too slow far too late and they never recovered from the loss.<p>Now you&#x27;re probably asking why Chrome is the dominant monopoly browser today, and that answer is also easy: Chrome incorporated what Firefox introduced but marketed themselves more aggressively, continued to improve where Firefox languished upon obtaining the throne, and for better or worse threw out a lot of conventional computer nerd traditions which ultimately made for a more performant browser in line with common user desires.</div><br/><div id="36844698" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36844698" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rstuart4133</span><span>|</span><a href="#36822713">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36844484">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36844698">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36844698">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Now you&#x27;re probably asking why Chrome is the dominant monopoly browser today, and that answer is also easy: Chrome incorporated what Firefox introduced but marketed themselves more aggressively<p>That&#x27;s one way of putting it.  But I think the article indirectly explained it better:<p>&gt; We know that binding IE with Windows is the key to IE’s domination of the browser market.<p>Google did a similar thing with Chrome.  They bound it to Google&#x27;s services.  You got nagged every time you visited www.google.com.  Understandably google&#x27;s more advanced stuff didn&#x27;t work with IE.  But it also often didn&#x27;t work with Firefox.

    He is not the first Firefox team member to come forward and make such accusations in the past eight months; however, his allegations span far beyond current events and accuse Google of carrying out a coordinated plan that involved introducing small bugs on its sites that would only manifest for Firefox users.</code></pre></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

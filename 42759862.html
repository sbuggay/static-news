During my PhD, within the research field of Genetic Programming, there is an author who only published to Springer. This author always had the best results in the field. Reliably, when ever some new results would come out, this person would publish to Springer with better results. Vague methods, no reproducibility. So when I went and built a non-GP algorithm and improve the state-of-art by orders of magnitude, low and behold this person was able to improve upon my results. It seems as though there is no actual editorial activity over there at all<p>When Docker first came out, one of my advisors and I pondered how we might use it to aid in the reproducibility crisis in academic research. I don&#x27;t think anything ever came of it, certainly the situation seems to have deteriorated since. There are a lot of good researchers out there, but I fear many of them do the same dealing with the dumb system we find in large bureaucracies in the private sector<p>In some ways it is worse. Reviewers are expected to put in free labor for the journals and then we have to either put our own work behind a paywall or &quot;pay for the privilege&quot; to have it be open access.<p>Perhaps we should take a stab at building open-review features, reviewers, journals, reproducibility, and transparency around Arxiv. They have a survey banner on the site right now, lets suggest some ideas! (edit: sadly, the survey is quite limited and irrelevant to improving the practice of research)</div><br/><div id="42801217" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42801217" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ashton314</span><span>|</span><a href="#42799508">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42799009">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42801217">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42801217">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; When Docker first came out, one of my advisors and I pondered how we might use it to aid in the reproducibility crisis in academic research.<p>I’m working on my PhD in computer science, programming languages specifically. We’re lucky that we have the easiest time reproducing our benchmarks and experiments. The big venues in my field all encourage authors to submit artifacts as docker containers to reproduce all the tables and figures from a paper. Papers that reproduce get special badges on the first page. I’ve reviewed a few artifacts and it can be really nice with docker.<p>So, hopefully other fields take note of what we’re doing to combat reproducibility. CS is fortunate that verifying some claim might be as simple as running a shell command.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42799009" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42799009" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mondobe</span><span>|</span><a href="#42799508">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42798612">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42799009">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42799009">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I hope the incoming administration takes &quot;tomato government assistance&quot; seriously.

This has been a problem for at least the last few decades, especially when it comes to papers from some parts of the world.  Before the current breed of low quality journals, we saw this happening with conferences that were often branded with professional societies like IEEE, but if you looked carefully it would be “IEEE Section of (random place in Asia)” and not a conference sanctioned by IEEE itself.  Those used to be full of garbage plagiarized papers and junk.  I think the idea is that nobody usually reads the papers when they make a decision based on publication metrics, so pumping a CV with garbage often goes unnoticed.  It’s not a wise practice: in many places getting caught doing this would be a career ender.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42799441" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42799441" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sva_</span><span>|</span><a href="#42798612">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42799364">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42799441">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42799441">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was looking for such &#x27;tortured phrases&#x27; on Google scholar recently and also found an article from MDPI:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;1996-1073&#x2F;16&#x2F;4&#x2F;1792" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mdpi.com&#x2F;1996-1073&#x2F;16&#x2F;4&#x2F;1792</a><p>&gt; There is a requirement to assist various types of solar radiation and wind speed measurement and predictions, such as the iterative approach, <i>counterfeit consciousness</i> method, and so on.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42799494" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42799494" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lysace</span><span>|</span><a href="#42799364">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42799434">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42799494">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42799494">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MDPI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MDPI</a><p>&gt; MDPI (Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute) is a publisher of open-access scientific journals.<p>I first thought it was a criticism on the MDPI Android resource resolution but oh boy was I wrong.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42799434" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42799434" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">belinder</span><span>|</span><a href="#42799494">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42802086">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42799434">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42799434">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Who would have thought that tomatoes are creatures that can be herded by a shepherd.<p>Fraud is on the rise everywhere it seems.

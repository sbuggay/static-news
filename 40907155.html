They have some deep-seated feeling that they need to demonstrate <i>something</i> to their community, a sense that maybe their value is in some ways conditional on what they provide. Content people who feel almost everyone already loves them rarely change the world. (That&#x27;s no indictment of contentment, maybe changing the world is overrrated.)<p>The difference between persistence and obstinance is that obstinant people feel that <i>every step on the path to solving the problem</i> is a moment where they may be judged and found wanting. They are rigid because any misstep or dead end is perceived as a sign that they are a failure. It&#x27;s not enough for them to solve the problem, they have to have been completely right at every step along the path.<p>Persistent people still have that need to prove themselves, but they hold it at a different granularity. They give themselves enough grace to make mistakes along the way, take in advice from others, and explore dead ends. As long as they are making progress overall and feel that they will eventually solve the problem, they are OK with themselves.<p>In other words, persistent people want to garner respect by giving the world a solution to the problem. Obstinant people want that respect by showing the world how flawlessly smart they are at every step, sometimes even if they never actually solve the problem.<p>Or put another way, persistent people have the patience to get esteem only after the problem is solved. Obstinant people need it every step of the way, which is another sign that obstinance has a connection to insecurity.<p>It&#x27;s a delicate art to balance the drive to prove yourself with the self love to allow yourself to make mistakes, admit being wrong, and listen to others.</div><br/><div id="40911158" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40911158" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eslaught</span><span>|</span><a href="#40908300">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40909450">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40911158">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40911158">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your analysis seems to assume that the only form of motivation is external. By this logic, persistent&#x2F;obstinant people do things because they hope for some external reward (e.g., praise, recognition, fame, possibly financial compensation). The difference is merely at the granularity of the goal this is attached to.<p>My experience is that the persistent people I know have at least some degree (and often a large degree) of internal motivation. They do things because the process of problem solving is rewarding in and of itself, and&#x2F;or they have some intrinsic motivation about solving the problem. They are not out to please anyone else except themselves.<p>Maybe no one is purely 100% internally motivated. But my experience is that the more persistent people I know generally have a higher percentage of internal motivation. In contrast the people who give up more easily generally have a lower percentage of internal motivation; if they really only care about the external reward, it often turns out there are lots of ways to do that, and many are shorter than solving &quot;hard&quot; problems.</div><br/><div id="40913485" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40913485" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ensocode</span><span>|</span><a href="#40908300">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40911158">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40909450">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40913485">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40913485">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks, I thought the same but as you mentioned, there is no 100% intrinsic&#x2F;extrinsic motivation.

The more steps, the lower the overall chance of hitting the original problem&#x2F;solution with the exact path of steps. And if the original plan contains a dead end one could not foresee, people give up at some point alltogether.<p>But persistence simply means more like &quot;lets take multiple shots at solving the problem&quot;, discovering stuff along the way, pivot the strategy or change direction, but ultimately just trying to solve the problem X times, which over time <i>increases</i> the chance of solving it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40910793" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40910793" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smusamashah</span><span>|</span><a href="#40908300">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40913505">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40912386">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40910793">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40910793">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Having someone close who is obstinate makes the article very relatable (my father, talking him into something is like to talking to a stone, no matter how convincing you are and even if he seems to budge, it will take just a single moment to spring back).<p>For me this line &quot;The persistent are attached to the goal.

COUNTER!&quot; The other philosopher didn&#x27;t know much about mathematics, had no idea to reply, got flustered, and &quot;lost&quot; the argument.[1]<p>And honestly, I&#x27;m not sure I would have done better in the moment. On reflection? Sure. But in front of the king, presented with a completely unfamiliar argument stated with great confidence and demanding a reply? Yeah, maybe not. Even on topics where I have reasonable in-depth knowledge I sometimes really doubt myself when someone says something <i>very wrong</i> with great confidence, and sometimes I really double and triple-check things to make sure I&#x27;m not making a right fool of myself.<p>Few years back I ordered a sandwich at a deli. Still looking at the menu, the lady asked what I wanted. &quot;Ehhh, well, ehmm, I don&#x27;t eat meat, so, ehhh, something without that&quot;. &quot;Oh, I have chicken!&quot; And she said this so quickly and with such confidence that for a few seconds I was genuinely doubting whether &quot;chicken&quot; was meat or not and wasn&#x27;t really sure what to answer.<p>I guess she had a bit of &quot;a moment&quot; and we had a laugh about it afterwards, but I thought that was a pretty interesting and harmless example of how you can really start doubting yourself.<p>NFTs are another example. When I first heard of it, I thought I had not understood it correctly because &quot;surely it can&#x27;t be this dumb&quot;. And for months when all the NFT hype was raging I thought it must be some very complex crypto bonanza I wasn&#x27;t really understanding. All the obscure jargon and lingo the NFT people confidently use aided that notion. I&#x27;m not really interested in crypto in general, but finally gave in and did some more in-depth reading on it. I found that no, it really <i>is</i> that dumb, and I <i>had</i> understood it correctly months ago, and all the jargon was just meaningless bollocks word salad.<p>[1]: I read about this years and years ago, I can&#x27;t find anything about it right now and this anecdote may be false, but it seemed trust-worthy enough at the time to remember.</div><br/><div id="40909229" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40909229" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nsguy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40908005">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40908307">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40909963">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40909229">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40909229">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had a similar issue recently. Someone suggested a technical solution that based on my experience has zero chance of being correct. It was said with great confidence that makes me doubt my experience. Great confidence but zero supporting details or experience. For someone observing from the side there&#x27;s no way to tell who is right and my double-take doubting my own experiences can appear to make the extremely confident but likely wrong person be the right one.  For someone that really knows stuff, being 100% confident on nuanced&#x2F;complex issues is very hard, you&#x27;re used to moving forward with 90% or 80% or 95% confidence. I.e. you&#x27;re very likely right, but there are can be surprises or something you didn&#x27;t anticipate. For someone confident but wrong they have like 100% confidence for something that&#x27;s 0% chance of success. As you say, this is a lot more difficult when you&#x27;re put on the spot, e.g. the CEO might question what&#x27;s the right decision in a meeting (the king in your example.).

They have been making precision optical gear for over a hundred years, and fetch many thousands, for their consumer (really, professional) kit. Thousands of successful people have built their entire careers around this company&#x27;s gear.<p>If you want to see &quot;stubborn,&quot; look no further than their QA Division. In the US, there used to be a running joke, that if you had &quot;Quality&quot; in your job title, it meant your career was dead. At this company, it meant that you were headed for Executive Row. Many VPs and General Managers (a very powerful title, at this company), were former QA people.<p>And, boy, were they a <i>pain</i> to deal with. They would have 3,000-line Excel spreadsheets, and if even one of those lines was a red &quot;X&quot;, the entire product line could get derailed. I had a project that we worked on, for 18 months, get nuked at the last minute, because they didn&#x27;t like the Quality. I worked with an SV startup, that had a project canned, for pretty much exactly the same reason. The startup folks didn&#x27;t seem to take the Quality seriously, which was basically a death sentence.<p>In that company, the kind of &quot;stubborn&quot; the QA people demonstrated, would be considered absolutely essential.

I do remember the one major bug I let slip out into a release though) well after everything had been signed off on. I brought it up in the team meeting and the principle dev asked me directly &quot;Do you think we should cancel the release to fix this bug?&quot; I wasn&#x27;t sure of myself and he told me that &quot;it&#x27;s your call&quot;, and I said that yeah, we should fix the bug.<p>For anyone under 35 who is confused by this, was before releases were rolling and shipped online. When Microsoft released a major version back then, it had a (IIRC) ~10 year support contract attached to it (and if you found a bug and were on a good enough of a support contract, the dev team would develop a custom patch for you to fix a bug in a 9 year 6 month old release!), and a lot of gears were set in motion to make a release happen.<p>This was the norm at Microsoft for a long time. I was originally attracted to the SDET role because they were the last defender of the customer experience, they were the engineers who held the line on quality.

Right it&#x27;s calendars until below the fold (on a desktop), and I didn&#x27;t scroll down because &quot;eh, physical calendar, not interested&quot;. Also, apparently I did not read the text very carefully (maybe because clearly it&#x27;s a calendar, it says so in the link) and didn&#x27;t notice the &quot;other apps&quot; bit for several minutes.<p>However, I don&#x27;t think the market for this is very large, especially at the current price. How many people have enough events per day that they need a calendar? Plus, my phone already has a calendar, and it has reminders so I don&#x27;t even need to look at it. If I were married maybe syncing up calendars could be useful, so if that&#x27;s the use case then put that in the picture. I don&#x27;t get the whole show-a-website thing. I know HN likes putting the NYT on their wall, but I just don&#x27;t get it, especially at 125 dpi. A photo, okay, but B&amp;W and 600x480 is not what I&#x27;m looking to spend $150 + $3&#x2F;month for. Also, anything with a subscription is right out. Reliance on external servers is right out, sooner or later that server is going to go away.<p>The problem as I see it is that the things you put on your desk&#x2F;wall are either art, 300 dpi color photos, whiteboard for todos, clocks, and calendars. This only really fits the last two--except that there is no option for clocks (say, clock and clock+picture)--and $150 seems kind of expensive for that. Expensive compared to what $150 could buy me, given that a synced up calendar is just a click away on my browser and integrated into my phone.<p>Since you asked for advice, I&#x27;d say you have a cool hobby&#x2F;craft&#x2F;maker project, but not a saleable product. Pivot or quit. For instance, if you want to try the hobby route, you could make it to fit standard picture frames of a given size and offer one yourself for extra, and make it assemble-yourself. Saves time on your part, reduces costs, so you can sell it cheaper. Provide a download to setup a local server, and an option to display a PNG (= inexpensive way for users to write pixels directly) via USB or something. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good idea, but it seems like a wider market.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40911554" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40911554" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">akomtu</span><span>|</span><a href="#40907731">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40909448">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40907996">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40911554">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40911554">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A few ideas:<p>1.

Thorny as in, the previous engineer was ordered to give up and move on because our boss was worried it was adversely affecting their mental health and their performance on other tasks.<p>I quickly learned that every person who found out I was working on this problem was eager to share the same three or four ideas on how to fix it. All of these ideas were early on the list of ideas that the previous engineer had ruled out multiple times in multiple ways. For the sake of thoroughness, I also tried them and ruled them out. But of course each person who wanted to share ideas didn&#x27;t know they were saying the same thing I had heard a hundred times before, so the suggestions kept repeating.<p>Over time, dealing with the same suggestions over and over again, I learned an important lesson: when someone suggested an idea, it didn&#x27;t do any good to explain that multiple people had tried it and ruled it out in multiple ways. That made people perceive me as close-minded, stupid, and inflexible. Instead I just nodded and said, interesting, that&#x27;s worth checking out, thanks, or, hmm, I wonder how I could measure that.<p>At first I was afraid that if I acted intrigued about a very basic obvious idea, people would think we were idiots for not trying it long ago, but that turned out not to be the dominant dynamic at work. The dominant dynamic was that people think you&#x27;re smart if you are receptive to your advice, and and they think you are stupid if you are not receptive to their advice.

Five qualities of persistence:<p>&gt; Energy, imagination, resilience, good judgement, and focus on a goal<p>It&#x27;s nice to frame it that way so we can know what to focus on.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m strong in terms of energy, imagination and resilience.<p>I&#x27;m probably a bit weaker in terms of judgment and focus on a goal. I think my approach to the latter 2 has something to do with my environment.<p>Good judgement is actually harder to achieve than it seems. I think my issue is that I was conflating &#x27;good judgment&#x27; with &#x27;common sense&#x27;. But it&#x27;s not the same. We&#x27;re humans and things can be complex for irrational, artificial reasons. Good judgement these days often entails adapting to the subtle irrationalities of the environment and learning to exploit them. That lesson has been really tough for me.<p>In terms of &#x27;Focusing on a goal&#x27;, my issue is that I chose a huge audacious goal with small milestones along the way. While I managed to achieve all of the milestones, they don&#x27;t bear any financial rewards; their utility was just a risk mitigation strategy so that I could easily pivot to other, less ambitious goals if the big audacious goal didn&#x27;t pan out.<p>My goal over the past 10 years was to create a platform that would make it much easier easy to build fast, secure, bug-free, highly maintainable software. That&#x27;s a really difficult goal especially on the sales side as it is a highly competitive space. I managed to build a platform which achieves that. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saasufy.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saasufy.com&#x2F;</a><p>But unfortunately, I&#x27;m realizing that my goal is too big. I&#x27;d be competing against many big tech platforms and also against existing software development paradigms (which is even harder!). So now I&#x27;m shifting my strategy towards using my platform Saasufy.com just for myself and my friends to build more niche products like this HR&#x2F;Recruitment platform: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insnare.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insnare.net&#x2F;</a><p>I&#x27;m thinking I may have to even re-imagine what &#x27;niche&#x27; means.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40911879" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40911879" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">skybrian</span><span>|</span><a href="#40911349">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40908408">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40911879">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40911879">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The persistent are quite rational.

The market being saturated pushes it to be (even more) hit-oriented. &#x27;Saturated&#x27; as in a sponge held at the bottom of a full bathtub. You can keep releasing more games but the people you want to buy them (let alone play them) aren&#x27;t going to quit their second job to find the time to buy and try your weird little games.<p>This is not the middle. The author is talking about small games. It may be the middle of indie game development, but across the whole landscape, the &quot;missing middle&quot; would seem to refer to the &quot;single-&#x2F;double-A&quot; studios&#x2F;publishers&#x2F;games that died out between the launch of the PS2 and the release of GTA IV.<p>id Software is an exception and makes a poor example to follow. Studying wild success stories is not without merit, but is -- if you are interested in <i>how to do the thing successfully</i> -- ultimately a trap. id was (among other things) in the right place at the right time. There is very little opportunity today for any team (let alone individual person) to push the boundaries of the technology in a meaningful way. You cannot make a game as radical and captivating as DOOM was. You will not attract players to your (now generic) platformer by getting it to run at 60Hz. You might say there was very little opportunity for any individual to do so back then as well, but then we are back at exceptions being bad examples.</div><br/><div id="37723346" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37723346" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chii</span><span>|</span><a href="#37723248">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37723972">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37723346">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37723346">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; push the boundaries of the technology in a meaningful way.<p>Which is why game mechanic and gameplay is where the boundaries are, not computational efficiency or photorealism (or even, artistic direction or production value).<p>I imagine that prior to Jonathan Blow&#x27;s indie hit &quot;Braid&quot;, people were also imagining that the technological ceiling has been hit and an individual (or small team) cannot compete with the AAA studios.</div><br/><div id="37723517" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37723517" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">qwery</span><span>|</span><a href="#37723248">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37723346">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37723972">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37723517">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37723517">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sure, but most explanations of id&#x27;s success (including in this article) hinge on (John Carmack&#x27;s) technological prowess (and DOOM melting your face off).<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure what your point about Braid is.

The publishers that can stay small have to bootstrap, which makes them unattractive as sources of funding. It&#x27;s not being driven by consumers that assume a production with 4000 people involved is strictly better than one with 3 people, it&#x27;s the funnelling effect of all the money coming from more speculative sources that have no motive to consider industry health holistically - which is a macro-economic problem.<p>You can learn about the early days of this from Matt Barton&#x27;s interview series with Robert Sirotek, particularly the last part[0]. Sir-Tech ran sustainably, by Robert&#x27;s assessment, and consistently shipped smaller productions, but a shake-out  occurred in the 90&#x27;s. At first it was primarily coming from retailers who wanted things done their way to get a placement, squeezing out lower-cap players and imposing drop-dead ship dates on the developers. But it&#x27;s reasserted itself a few times in a few different ways, since then, and is now pretty clearly tied to the industry being in a dilemma of either getting no investment, or endless amounts, with a promise of making 100x that, which ultimately reflects the decades-long asset bubble and increasing use of &quot;free money&quot; federal lending. If they don&#x27;t promise those kinds of returns, someone else takes the funding.<p>So, the market is actually scrambling to figure out what to do with the investment tap cut off right now. Embracer Group, one of the biggest consolidators of the last cycle, reported troubling finances last quarter and has started closing studios.

The entertainment complex certainly doesn&#x27;t help either.<p>Providers: you need comprehensive family care to avoid specialist care being needed, an increase in supply of doctors, decreasing their educational loan burden (which strongly incentivizes specializataion, and a system that involves specialists). I think advanced AI systems can do much more day-to-day tracking and diagnosis&#x2F;information, but of course that is a personal information nightmare. Actually I don&#x27;t mean advanced. I think current AI is plenty good enough. Unfortunately only insurance companies will employ these systems or pay for them.<p>Insurance: Probably need a medicare-for-all option. We were close to this with Obamacare but FUCKING JOE LIEBERMAN killed it. Exhibit A in why the Democrats with full control of government will never get anything done.<p>Drug&#x2F;Device companies: reduce patents, I don&#x27;t know, maybe allow price negotiation (which is just mind blowing in a &quot;free market&quot; economy), reform the FDA to make bringing drugs to market cheaper.<p>Lawyers: caps caps caps so there isn&#x27;t costly malpractice insurance. Maybe would also necessitate a federal review board to weed out &quot;bad doctors&quot;.<p>But the biggest is probably governmental direction to actually get people to be able to eat and live active lives. Maybe GLP-1 will help, but the quiet time bomb of increasing obesity in Americans each decade is probably a sneaky large amount of our costs.<p>Otherwise, on the nihilistic side, keep doing whatever our society is doing which is causing men to kill themselves in huge rates (soma ... uh... I mean opioids were also doing this as well) before they reach their ultra-expensive late stage of life.<p>Anyway, none of that is happening (except, sadly, the nihilistic solution is the most realistically happening).<p>Maybe setup huge provider networks across the border in Mexico and Canada served by high speed transit, so large portions of the world get health maintenance in functioning health care systems, and only do hospitalization and emergency care here?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42547278" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42547278" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">refurb</span><span>|</span><a href="#42543521">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42546378">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42546433">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42545260">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42547278">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42547278">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Upvotes for highly accurate summary.<p>The providers have leverage and the ones with the most will screw you over unless you’re big enough to throw some weight around.<p>I honestly don’t see much change unless the government comes in and sets new rules that actually make sense.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42545260" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42545260" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xyst</span><span>|</span><a href="#42543521">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42545559">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42546629">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42545260">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42545260">[45 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Very difficult to disrupt American healthcare when health insurance companies determine your rates, direct pay patients often the most vulnerable, and instead of focusing on patient care you have to focus on stupid administrative tasks to deal with different types of health insurance plans&#x2F;pharmacy benefit managers&#x2F;vendors.<p>Thanks to decades of neo-liberalism (the idea of deregulation and &quot;free market&quot; economy).

For everyone in the back: that&#x27;s not what happened.  BCBS tried to place arbitrary limits on anesthesia payment.  Medicare does not do this.  Physician complaints with Medicare payments revolve around the hourly rate.  Physician complaints with BCBS revolve around arbitrarily setting a hard limit for the amount of time a procedure is allowed to take.

Yeah, we&#x27;ve been over this: Medicare does not set arbitrary caps on the length of a procedure.  They pay for anesthesia services from the time the patient goes under to the time the patient wakes up.<p><pre><code>  In fact, it&#x27;s the whole premise for why Medicare is meant to bring prices down!
</code></pre>
In fact, it&#x27;s not.  Limiting care is pretty much the opposite of how Medicare operates and you can see this reflected in the claim denials.  For-profit insurance companies deny claims at 2–3x the rate of Medicare because they are incentivized to deny care.<p>From Medicare&#x27;s policy manual:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cms.gov&#x2F;files&#x2F;document&#x2F;chapter2cptcodes00000-019" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cms.gov&#x2F;files&#x2F;document&#x2F;chapter2cptcodes00000-019</a>...<p><pre><code>  A unique characteristic of anesthesia coding is the reporting of time units.
  Payment for anesthesia services increases with time. In addition to reporting
  a base unit value for an anesthesia service, the anesthesia practitioner reports
  anesthesia time. Anesthesia time is defined as the period during which an
  anesthesia practitioner is present with the patient. It starts when the anesthesia
  practitioner begins to prepare the patient for anesthesia services in the operating

Now I made a good faith look through your comment history to see if you&#x27;d actually posted anything like that.  Barring something I missed I can only assume you&#x27;re working based on an incorrect assumption of how Medicare pays for the cost of anesthesia.<p>There is a fixed component per procedure (base unit).  This is based on the complexity of a procedure and roughly how long it&#x27;s expected to take.  That is why CMS would track how long a procedure is expected to take.  There is a time based factor (time unit), and that is not limited in the way that BCBS was proposing.</div><br/><div id="42547277" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42547277" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tptacek</span><span>|</span><a href="#42543521">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42547249">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42545666">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42547277">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42547277">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s there in black and white on the other thread, down to the individual surgical procedure.<p><i>Later</i><p>(The comment I replied to was edited extensively after I replied to it.)</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42545666" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42545666" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tyre</span><span>|</span><a href="#42543521">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42545260">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42546390">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42545386">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42545666">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42545666">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you want to do the hard work of automating and abstracting the &quot;fucking mess&quot; of the financial layer of American healthcare, we&#x27;re hiring: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;juniperplatform" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;juniperplatform</a><p>Or email me: chris@juniperplatform.com</div><br/><div id="42546356" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42546356" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">t-writescode</span><span>|</span><a href="#42543521">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42545666">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42545386">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42546356">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42546356">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Grr.

Also, if UnitedHealth refuses to reach a deal with the drug manufacturer, they risk losing insurance customers to other insurers who are willing to do so; Australians can&#x27;t realistically switch public health insurers (moving overseas is the only real way; private health insurance usually has very modest prescription drug benefits)<p>&gt; Australia would have to start funding research.<p>Australia actually does have significant medical research funding. Unfortunately it seems to be a struggle to find good data on exactly how much (in easily comparable terms, such as %GDP) – the WHO&#x27;s statistics [0] on this topic are missing both the US and Australia for whatever reason. But even in the absence of hard figures, I&#x27;d totally believe the US spends at least double (on a % GDP basis).

But that&#x27;s more a consequence of poor industrial policy (most of Australia&#x27;s pharmaceutical manufacturing sector moved overseas, and what&#x27;s left is mostly lower-end stuff like vitamins and herbal supplements, with rare exceptions such as CSL) than anything to do with drug pricing.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;observatories&#x2F;global-observatory-on-health-research-and-development&#x2F;indicators&#x2F;gross-domestic-r-d-expenditure-on-health-as-a-percent-of-gross-domestic-product" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;observatories&#x2F;global-observatory-on-heal...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42546369" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42546369" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tomrod</span><span>|</span><a href="#42543521">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42545401">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42545576">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42545567">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42546369">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42546369">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">100%.

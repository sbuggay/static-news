The idea is, stimulus is piped into the &quot;top&quot; layer and filters down to the bottom layer, with each layer picking up on more and more abstract concepts.<p>popular deep artificial neural networks (lstms, llms, etc.) are highly recurrent, in which they are simulating not deep networks, but shallow networks that process information in loops many times.<p>&gt; columns.. and that&#x27;s about it.<p>recommend not to oversimplify structure here. what you describing is only high-level structure of single part of brain (neocortex).<p>1. brain has many other structures inside basal ganglia, cerebellum, midbrain, etc. each with different characteristic micro-circuits.<p>2. brain networks are highly interconnected on long range. neurons project (as in send signals) to very distant parts of the brain. similarly they get projections from other distant parts of brain too.<p>3. temporal dimension is important. your article is very ML-like focusing on information processing devoid of temporal dimension. if you want to draw parallels to real neurons in brain, need to explain how it fits into temporal dynamics (oscillations in neurons and circuits).<p>4. is this competition in realm of abeyant (what you can think in principle) or current (what you think now) representations? what&#x27;s the timescales and neurological basis for this?<p>overall, my take it is a bit ML-like talk. if it describes real neurological networks it got to be closer and stronger neurological footing.<p>here is some good material, if you want to dive into neuroscience. &quot;Principles of Neurobiology&quot;, Liqun Luo, 2020 and &quot;Fundamental Neuroscience&quot;, McGraw Hill.<p>more resources can be found here:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;neuroscience-landscape.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;neuroscience-landscape.com&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40982566" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40982566" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">visarga</span><span>|</span><a href="#40982771">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40981616">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40982566">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40982566">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think it matters so much how the brain is made, what matters is the training data. And we obtain data by searching. Search is a great concept, it covers evolution, intelligence and creativity, it&#x27;s also social.  Search is discrete, recursive, combinatorial and based on some kind of language (DNA, or words, or just math&#x2F;code).<p>Searching the environment provides the data brain is trained on. I don&#x27;t believe we can understand the brain in isolation without its data engine and the problem space where it develops.<p>Neural nets showed that given a dataset, you can obtain similar results with very different architectures, like transformer and diffusion models, or transformer vs Mamba. The essential ingredient is data, architecture only needs to pass some minimal bar for learning.<p>Studying just the brain misses the essential - we are search processes, the whole life is search for optimal actions, and evolution itself is search for environment fitness.

Most people familiar with learning theory already understand learning algorithms of any kind as a subset of probabilistic search algorithms with properties that make them responsive to data. The idea that the structure of the information processing system doesn&#x27;t matter and there&#x27;s just this general factor of learning capacity a thing has is... not well supported by the way in which research has progressed in the entire period of time when this has been relevant to most people? Sure, in theory any neural network is a general function approximator and could in theory learn any function it&#x27;s complex enough to represent. Also, we can arrive at the solution to any computable problem by representing it as a number and guessing random numbers until we can verify a solution. Learning algorithms can almost be defined as attempts to do better search via structured empiricism than can be done with the assumption that structure doesn&#x27;t matter. Like, sometimes multiple things work, sure. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s arbitrary<p>TL;DR: Of course learning is a kind of search, but discovering structures that are good at learning is the whole game</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40981616" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40981616" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jaimie</span><span>|</span><a href="#40982566">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40981609">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40981616">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40981616">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The domain of Artificial Life is highly related and has had an ongoing conference series and journal going, might be worth mining for more inspiration:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Artificial_life" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Artificial_life</a>

which is that learning take place by evolutionary means. But Hawkins&#x27;
proposal does fit squarely within current popular ideas around 
predictive coding.<p>The key structures in Hawkins&#x27; architecture are cortical columns (CC). 
What his VP of Eng (Dileep George) did is to analyze Hawkins&#x27; account of 
the functionality of a CC, and then say that a CC is a module which must 
conform to a certain API, and meet a certain contract. As long as a 
module obeys the API and contract, we don&#x27;t actually care how the CC 
module is implemented. In particular, it&#x27;s actually not important that 
the module contain neurons. (Though the connections between the CCs may 
still have to look like axons or whatever, I don&#x27;t know.)<p>Then Dileep George further figured out that there is an off the shelf 
algorithm than works perfectly for the CC module. He selected an 
algorithm which is based on statistical learning theory (STL).<p>STL based algorithms are an excellent choice for the CCs, IMNSHO. They 
are fast, theoretically sound, etc. They are also understood in great 
mathematical detail, so we can characterize _exactly_ what they can and 
can&#x27;t do. So there is zero mystery about the capabilities of his system 
at the CC level. Note that in Hawkins&#x27; case, the STL based algorithms 
are used for pattern recognition.<p>Now Hawkin&#x27;s proposal isn&#x27;t just a single CC, it&#x27;s a network of CC&#x27;s all 
connected together in a certain way. My memory is a little hazy at this 
point, but as best I recall, his architecture should have no problem 
identifying sequences of patterns (as for sound), or spatial patterns 
across time (as for vision). And I bought his argument that these could 
be combined hierarchically, and that the same structure could also be 
used for playing back (outputting) a learned pattern, and for 
recognizing cross modal patterns (that is, across sensory modalities).<p>But is all this enough?<p>I say no. My reading of evolutionary epistemology suggests to me that 
pattern identification is insufficient for making and refuting 
conjectures in the most general sense. And ultimately, a system must be 
able to create and refute conjectures to create knowledge. Hawkins has a 
very weak story about creativity and claims that it can all be done with 
pattern recognition and analogy, but I am not convinced. It was the 
weakest part of the book. (pp 183-193)<p>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s clear to you or not why pattern recognition is 
insufficient for doing general conjectures and refutations. If it&#x27;s not 
clear, I should attempt to expand on that ...<p>The idea is, that it is not always possible to arrive at a theory by 
just abstracting a pattern from a data set. For example:<p>What set of data could Newton have looked at to conclude that an object 
in motion stays in motion? I suppose he knew of 7 planets that stayed in 
motion, but then he had millions of counter examples all around him. For 
a pattern recognition algorithm, if you feed it a million + 7 data 
points, it will conclude that objects in motion always come to a stop 
except for a few weird exceptions which are probably noise.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40983164" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40983164" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">slow_typist</span><span>|</span><a href="#40981571">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40981677">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40983164">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40983164">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The title of the referenced book by Erwin Schrödinger is “what is life”, I believe.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;whatislife0000erwi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;whatislife0000erwi</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40981677" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40981677" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sdwr</span><span>|</span><a href="#40983164">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40983480">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40981677">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40981677">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Fantastic speculation here, explains a lot, and has testable hypotheses.<p>For example, there should be a relationship between rate of learning and the physical subcolumns - we should be able to identify when a single column starts up &#x2F; is fully trained &#x2F; is overused<p>Or use AI to try to mirror the learning process, creating an external replica that makes the same decisions as the person<p>Marvin Minsky was spot on about the general idea 50 years ago, seeing the brain as a collection of 1000s of atomic operators (society of mind?)</div><br/><div id="40981847" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40981847" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">calepayson</span><span>|</span><a href="#40981677">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40982004">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40981847">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40981847">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Fantastic speculation here, explains a lot, and has testable hypotheses.<p>Calvin is the man.<p>&gt; For example, there should be a relationship between rate of learning and the physical subcolumns - we should be able to identify when a single column starts up &#x2F; is fully trained &#x2F; is overused<p>This sounds super interesting.

One common mistake people make when thinking of evolution, is where in the hierarchy it takes place. In other words, they misidentify the agents by an order of magnitude.<p>For example, in biology I commonly see it taught that the individual is the subject of natural selection (or worse, the population).<p>Really, it&#x27;s the gene. The beauty of evolution is that it can take an agent as simple as the gene and shape it into the litany of complex forms and functions we see all around us.<p>If evolution is at play in the brain, I suspect that Minsky&#x27;s agents are the individual firing patterns. Like genes, the base of the hierarchy, the fundamental unit. Also like genes, they slowly build increasingly complex behaviors from the ground up.

It feels like better versions of the arguments for Darwin Machines exist that would not: a) require an unsupportable neuron-centric view of evolution, and b) don&#x27;t view evolution through the programmers lens.<p>&gt; Essentially, biology uses evolution because it is the best way to solve the problem of prediction (survival&#x2F;reproduction) in a complex world.<p>1. This is anthropocentric in a way that meaningfully distorts the conclusion. The vast majority of life on earth, whether you count by raw number, number of species, weight, etc. do not have neurons. These organisms are of course, microbes (viruses and prokaryotes) and plants. Bacteria and viruses do not &#x27;predict&#x27; in the way this post speaks of. Survival strategies that bacteria use (that we know about and understand) are hedging-based. For example, some portion of a population will stochastically switch certain survival genes on (e.g. sporulation, certain efflux pumps = antibiotic resistance genes) that have a cost benefit ratio that changes depending on the condition. This could be construed as a prediction in some sense: the genome that has enough plasticity to allow certain changes like this will, on average, produce copies in a large enough population that enable survival through a tremendous range of conditions.  But that&#x27;s a very different type of prediction than what the rest of the post talks about. In short, prediction is something neurons are good at, but it&#x27;s not clear it&#x27;s a &#x27;favored&#x27; outcome in our biosphere.<p>&gt; It relies on the same insight that produced biology: That evolution is the best algorithm for predicting valid &quot;solutions&quot; within a near infinite problem space.<p>2. This gets the teleology reversed. Biology doesn&#x27;t use anything, it&#x27;s not trying to solve anything, and evolution isn&#x27;t an algorithm because it doesn&#x27;t have an end goal or a teleology (and it&#x27;s not predicting anything). Evolution is what you observe over time in a population of organisms that reproduce without perfect fidelity copy mechanisms. All we need say is that things that reproduce are more likely to be observed. We don&#x27;t have to anthropomorphize the evolutionary process to get an explanation of the distribution of reproducing entities that we observe or the fact that they solve challenges to reproduction.<p>&gt; Many people believe that, in biology, point mutations lead to the change necessary to drive novelty in evolution. This is rarely the case. Point mutations are usually disastrous and every organism I know of does everything in its power to minimize them. Think, for every one beneficial point mutation, there are thousands that don&#x27;t have any effect, and hundreds that cause something awful like cancer. If you&#x27;re building a skyscraper, having one in a hundred bricks be laid with some variation is not a good thing. Instead Biology relies on recombination. Swap one beneficial trait for another and there&#x27;s a much smaller chance you&#x27;ll end up with something harmful and a much higher chance you&#x27;ll end up with something useful. Recombination is the key to the creativity of evolution, and Darwin Machines harness it.<p>3. An anthropocentric reading of evidence that distorts the conclusion. The fidelity (number of errors per cycle per base pair) of the polymerases varies by maybe 8 orders of magnitude across the tree of life. For a review, see figure 3 in ref [1]. I don&#x27;t know about Darwin Machines, but the view that &#x27;recombination&#x27; is the key to evolution is a conclusion you would draw if you examined only a part of the tree of life. We can quibble about viruses being alive or not, but they are certainly the most abundant reproducing thing on earth by orders of magnitude. Recombination doesn&#x27;t seem as important for adaptation in them as it does in organisms with chromosomes.<p>4. There are arguments that seem interesting (and maybe not incompatible with some version of the post) that life should be abundant because it actually helps dissipate energy gradients.

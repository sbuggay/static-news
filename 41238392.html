I think I glossed over some concepts, and it sometimes looks like I&#x27;m pulling numbers out of thin air in some examples. Nonetheless I hope it will help some people understand these topics.

Similarly, the note labeled &quot;5&quot; is actually what we hear as the 12TET major third - clarifying a couple of examples on this lattice (or playing a chord) would be good.<p>Then, the thing I think that might help is driving the point home a little more by creating a comma by hand - a &quot;knight&#x27;s move&quot; to another tile 5 horizontal and 3 vertical, creates a ratio that <i>almost but not quite</i> undoes itself.

It&#x27;s been suggested by the book below that the dominance of equal temperament in western music is a relatively recent innovation, something like 120 years old, and is perhaps a consequence of the industrial revolution and the demand for mass manufacture of musical instruments having uniform qualities it produced.<p>Further reading: How Equal Temperament Ruined Harmony (and Why You Should Care), by Ross W. Duffin (2008).<p>My layman&#x27;s takeaway from the book: Equal Temperament is a compromise tuning that allows a piano to access all major and minor modes, at the cost of the keys on the outer ring of the circle of fifths to be somewhat out of tune. An ET &quot;C Major&quot; &quot;sounds best&quot;, and the further you move away from it in either direction, the worse the key sounds. Also, the fact that Beethoven and Mozart were aiming for just intonation and&#x2F;or meantone in productions of their works seems to be sort of an inside secret among music maestros, with rigid adherence to equal temperament slyly pushed on competing rookies to keep them trapped in the lower ranks by virtue of their resulting weaker performances. But the subject is highly contentious in western music for sure.</div><br/><div id="41264040" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41264040" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smrq</span><span>|</span><a href="#41262742">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41263780">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41263899">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41264040">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41264040">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I haven&#x27;t read this book, but that takeaway doesn&#x27;t sound right. In ET, all keys are equally out of tune--that&#x27;s a natural consequence of it being equal. In contrast, it&#x27;s just intonation in which chords become progressively further out of tune the further they get from the center.<p>It&#x27;s true that ET is a compromise in some ways, but it actually opens up the possibility for radical modulations into more distant keys without having to adjust intonation on the fly. In that sense, just intonation is also a compromise.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41263899" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41263899" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">black_knight</span><span>|</span><a href="#41262742">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41263780">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41264040">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41263154">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41263899">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41263899">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I disagree.

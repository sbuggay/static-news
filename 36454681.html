Otherwise it comes across as &quot;Ten things you grunts need to do to make my career go better&quot;.<p>The OP makes some pretty big generalizations:<p>&gt; <i>A common area for things to get messy is QA. In many agile teams, PMs end up doing UAT or requirements checking before tickets go live... A common way this happens is if the engineering team is much less tenured than the PM, and the PM knows how to test better than the engineers. In any case, PM acting as QA is not a healthy state. If PM is catching lots of bugs in UAT, engineering teams need to re-evaluate their QA strategy and fix the problem ASAP.</i><p>Well that&#x27;s one possibility, but I&#x27;ve never seen it in reality, let alone call it common. Another strong possibility is that the team (PM in particular) didn&#x27;t spend enough time thinking through use-cases and writing acceptance tickets. And&#x2F;or that whoever&#x27;s supposed to be communicating with the customer isn&#x27;t doing that well. Or indeed that the customer themselves doesn&#x27;t understand their needs well (in which case quickly getting them an MVP without much acceptance testing is <i>entirely</i> the right thing to do, then iterating). So, less blamespreading, more the team rolling their sleeves up. Especially if the PM really aspires to be a &quot;partner&quot; to developers (as they say elsewhere).<p>And btw if the <i>&quot;engineering team is much less tenured than the PM&quot;</i> is a recurring pattern, then that suggests trying to scale too fast, or antipatterns in hiring&#x2F; development&#x2F; budget&#x2F; management&#x2F; retention&#x2F; compensation (for example any developer with half a clue in that org would eventually either aim to get promoted&#x2F; jump ship into PM&#x2F; quit). The solution isn&#x27;t always to whip the developers harder. It may be about mismatches in management&#x2F; budget&#x2F; incentives&#x2F; KPI.</div><br/><div id="36466070" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36466070" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crm</span><span>|</span><a href="#36466030">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36466217">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36466070">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36466070">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Looks like the OP has you covered ! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;staysaasy.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;2023&#x2F;03&#x2F;12&#x2F;pm-engineers-dont-hate.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;staysaasy.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;2023&#x2F;03&#x2F;12&#x2F;pm-engineers-dont-h...</a></div><br/><div id="36466224" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36466224" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smcin</span><span>|</span><a href="#36466030">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36466070">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36466217">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36466224">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36466224">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not really, none of the second article&#x27;s philosophy seems to show up in this article: <i>&quot;Hold Yourself Accountable&#x2F; Help With the Dirty Work&#x2F; Be an Engineering Management Ally&#x2F; Be a World Class Copilot&quot;</i> seems to conflict with their narrative <i>&quot;In any case, PM acting as QA is not a healthy state.

Be proactive. When PMs do ask you for information, answer promptly and graciously<p>At a previous consulting engagement I ran across a rather toxic triangle involving the PM, the developers, and the manager of the developers. The PM did not report to the engineering managers, she reported up the chain elsewhere. The engineering manager made if very clear that bad news was not welcome from developers, and only the mildest concerns about risks and blockers was tolerable. Thus, the developers could not give the PM, or anyone, honest information without risking the manager&#x27;s displeasure.<p>Which is all a long way to say: If PMs are seeing issues with communication from engineers, first eliminate the possibility that the developers are doing so because that&#x27;s how they are managed.</div><br/><div id="36466059" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36466059" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smcin</span><span>|</span><a href="#36454796">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36466059">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36466059">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Buried in the article are these remarks:<p>&gt; <i>As always with power balances, just be gracious.</i>

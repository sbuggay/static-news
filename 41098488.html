Growing up in the late 70s early 80s we were kicked out of the house until dinner.   
We did a lot of really dangerous things exploring.   
Among these,<p>-Playing in storm drains. Inside the narrow tunnels I might add.<p>-Abandoned  construction sites.<p>-Railway tracks. Putting things o  the rails waiting for the train to see what happened. Everything from rocks to toys to coins.<p>-Dumpster diving in large dumpsters.  There was a soap factory near us and wed dive for schampoo or hairgel.<p>-Jumping in the biohazard pond looking for frogs eggs.<p>-Throwing things off bridges.<p>-Climbing various constructions, houses and dubios trees.<p>-Competing in who could jump from the highest roof.<p>Kids not only could get hurt.  We did.   Legs were broken.   
No one died fortunately.<p>Bored kids outside is not really as romantic as many would have it.   
Not arguing against boredom, constant stimuli is not healthy.<p>That being said, unsupervised  bored kids can lead to some very dangerous outcomes.</div><br/><div id="41098945" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41098945" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">6r17</span><span>|</span><a href="#41098885">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41098979">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41098945">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41098945">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My IT school changed since I was there. Talking to my old director he told me about the power of the environment. The premise is that we had a smaller school before, and it was not optimally planned, (student&#x27;s cables running around, trash not exactly at disposal nearby, etc...)<p>It seems obvious there is a direct link between environment and behavior, but what he started doing was like &quot;programming the environment&quot; in order to trigger behavior changes.<p>Why would we litter if the trashcan is nearby ? Why would we go out of our way with cables if power-socket is on every table ?<p>The same way I wonder if we cannot &quot;program&quot; the environment for kids, in a way that allows us to let them get bored out, but in such a situation that is not dangerous but also productively interesting for the kids.<p>It is not the same to get bored out outside nearby a train track or in the industrial area, than in a somewhat controlled area ?<p>What do we want to expose them to ? We already know it might want to try crazy stuff ; but I guess we can reduce the danger factors and increase area for more interesting activities ? Also, this is all linked to age and I&#x27;m not sure we can make generic rules.<p>Growing up in a farm is much different than growing up in the streets, and ultimately, my parents and I think a lot of parents, decide to live where kids are safe to grow with somewhat nice activities and people around them.<p>(Note that I also met a couple that completely cut themselves from the world and they really had to come back to society when the kid came to age, just because a kid requires social interactions with people it&#x27;s age)</div><br/></div></div><div id="41098979" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41098979" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">robocat</span><span>|</span><a href="#41098885">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41098945">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41098958">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41098979">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41098979">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">[delayed]</div><br/></div></div><div id="41098958" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41098958" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lm28469</span><span>|</span><a href="#41098885">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41098979">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41098927">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41098958">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41098958">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Boys will be boys, we all did these things back then and the extreme vast majority of us survived, I&#x27;ll take that over 10 hours of screens per day from age 3</div><br/></div></div><div id="41098927" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41098927" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ricketyricky</span><span>|</span><a href="#41098885">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41098958">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41098910">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41098927">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41098927">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ehem - sounds like a normal childhood?<p>Compare that to the sheltered, all-wishes-granted and no minute spent w&#x2F;o distractions like social media, kids.

I practice it for a long time now, and still struggle a lot. How well it goes depends totally on the context of my life. It&#x27;s hard, and honestly led to being very depressed a long time. But now I do feel like a better person, a lot of insecurities are gone, and with that, a lot of things that i did which were ultimately negative, also are gone (mostly). (lot of things still to work on :D).<p>I did go to therapy after a while for a few sessions, that&#x27;s definitely something i&#x27;d recommend when depression hits. it&#x27;s totally worth it, to get some confirmation or guidance on psychology.<p>One of the things for example for me that was an issue:
I became super indoorsy after a bad injury. That also caused me to excersize less. This both led to a loss of anti-cortisol production, which is a hormone that reduces stress.  That ultimately meant, that no matter how long i&#x27;d sit in silence, i&#x27;d still be stressed because my physiology lost the ability to produce that by itself. Now i go for lots of walks outdoors, and do some minor excersize.

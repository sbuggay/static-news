I found it fascinating that they had a team of DEI experts in place already. Like what makes one an expert?<p>In addition to my job, I spent nights developing programs trying to help these companies. Some folks right here on HN shared their successful experiences and I presented it to several companies. I was met with resistance every step of the way.<p>Over the course of a year and hundreds of candidates I presented, I&#x27;ve managed to place just one developer in a company.<p>However, most these companies were happy to change their social media profile to a solid black image or black lives matters. They sent memos, they organized lunches, even sold merch and donated. But hiring, that was too much to ask. A lot of graduates told me they never even got to do a technical interview.<p>Those DEI programs like to produce a show. Something visible that gives the impression that important work is being done. Like Microsoft reading who owned the land where the campus was built [2] in the beginning of every program. It eerily reminds me of &quot;the loyalty oath crusade&quot; in Catch-22.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23669188">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23669188</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;87JXB0t6de4?si=wtnQtBOE-fs4V7gR" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;87JXB0t6de4?si=wtnQtBOE-fs4V7gR</a></div><br/><div id="42660571" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42660571" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lolinder</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658998">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42659717">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42660571">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42660571">[192 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes. What too few people realized was that the rollout of DEI was driven by what was trending at the time, designed to win political points with the groups that were politically ascendant. These programs were never a victory for the principles or the people, they were marketing.<p>So it should come as no shock whatsoever that now that another political group is politically ascendant the marketing that is valuable has changed, so there go the marketing programs that were designed for the old power structure.<p>Change that occurs through fear of your power can only last as long as your power. Lasting change is only possible by actually changing hearts and minds. Progressives have forgotten in the last 10-15 years that the progress which we&#x27;ve won took generations not because our predecessors were weak and slow but because it <i>inherently</i> takes generations to effect lasting change. It&#x27;s a slow, painful process, and if you think you accomplished it in a decade you&#x27;re almost certainly wrong.</div><br/><div id="42660948" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42660948" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seadan83</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658998">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42660571">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42661526">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42660948">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42660948">[157 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree with most of your points. Though with respect lasting change, where is your impression coming from that the gains are in the last 10 to 15 years? Or even that is a widespread belief?<p>According to reporting at the guardian [1], FBs DEI program increased black and brown employees from 8% to 12%. Seems abysmal.<p>My perspective, US society is still fighting for gains that _started_ 160 years ago. Still painstakingly slow. We take for granted perhaps the first black president is _recent_, the first time having two black senators is now, school integration is about 40 years old in some places - not even one lifetime.i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an accurate characterization that huge strides were made in just the last decade, or that we were even starting at a &quot;good&quot; place.<p>I fundamentally agree on how slow the progress has been. I don&#x27;t know if it needs to be that slow. I disagree that there is a wide held belief that everything was done in the last decade. Notably because of how little has been done.

So nobody will do anything that costs themselves anything. The best you can hope for is color blindness and a very slow homogenization and equilibrium.<p>There was a gambit to achieve change by getting the non-black non-whites to identify with black people, but it looks like that is going to fail. As you would expect. The income mobility of a Guatemalan immigrant today is similar to that of Polish or Italian immigrants a century ago, and German immigrants 150 year ago. The folks who hit economic parity with whites when their grandparents who are still alive came here in poverty aren’t going to be easily persuaded that they need to upend a system that works well for them.<p>Indeed, in that environment, the longer you keep the concept of “race” alive, the worse things will be. You’re never going to use the concept of race to undo past harms; so it’ll only be used to stir up resentment and disharmony.</div><br/><div id="42664048" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42664048" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xrd</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658998">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42663439">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42663894">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42664048">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42664048">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your comment about white people that didn&#x27;t have anyone to do with slavery doesn&#x27;t seem entirely correct. I&#x27;m one of those people (great grandparents were German or Scottish immigrants). But my mom&#x27;s house is in a neighborhood where black people were explicitly prohibited from buying houses (it was on the deed at the time). And, loans from the government were red lined. Isn&#x27;t that government collusion that benefitted only me and harmed black people? It didn&#x27;t help Latinos or Japanese immigrants in the twenties. I&#x27;m not sure if that counts as having nothing to do with slavery. That impact seems directly correlated to slavery, although the dragnet could have impacted recent African immigrants in the 1920s.<p>Definitely agree nobody will vote for anything that costs them anything.<p>But my kids are mixed race partial African heritage and I do think it behooves us as Americans to think about rectifying that terrible wrong on my wife&#x27;s side of the family. There are dozens of examples of horribly wrong headed ways to do that (Brazil had some really creative and disastrous ideas), but we should at least acknowledge the lingering effects that still impacts people today that are descendants of slaves.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just sensitive because it feels like Florida, where I currently live, is trying to wipe away that history.

What you are describing is still wrong! And was made illegal for a reason. But anyone coming from Asia, Africa, South America, and most of Europe is going to just shrug their shoulders at what you just described.<p>I have yet to see even the most progressive Western European country that didn’t have a huge hate against Roma&#x2F;Travelers, or Indian community that didn’t have <i>some</i> serious Muslim&#x2F;Hindu friction, or Chinese vs Non-Chinese, etc. And let’s not talk about Eastern Europe, or African tribal&#x2F;clan warfare!<p>The issue here is that the more you talk about all the wrongs and specifics, the more you highlight finer granularities of identity, the more you base things on some small group, the more it splits everyone, the more different groups&#x2F;factions end up getting created, the more finger pointing happens, etc.<p>The more people start thinking of us vs them, their identity and how they are different&#x2F;split from everyone else, etc. and past grievances, the more they start thinking about retribution, control&#x2F;exclusion, etc.<p>For an incredibly evolved version of this, check out a (brief summary of [<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Caste_system_in_India" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Caste_system_in_India</a>].<p>It ends up in a nearly infinitely Balkanized hellscape where the more someone knows about someone else, the more likely they will end up enemies than friends. And eventually, nearly everyone is an enemy with their neighbors, and sometimes even themselves.<p>If we try to focus on what <i>should</i> happen, and the best <i>common</i> identity we can, and punish divergences from that instead, at least we can be mostly going in that, someone similar direction. And have at least some idea what common elements we can be friends on, and what we shouldn’t talk about lest we become (likely) enemies.<p>It is far from perfect, but at least it has some cohesive identity and direction, rather than infinite levels of infighting. Nothing is perfect.<p>Together, we can be strong. Alone, we are weak and easy to pick off.<p>The issue the US always has had, is that really the only common theme between all its different groups, is the desire to make money, and be left alone to do what they want.<p>But then when times get tough, inevitably some groups want to make everyone else do what they want and&#x2F;or take everyone else’s money.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42663894" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42663894" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">KPGv2</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658998">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42663439">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42664048">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42661539">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42663894">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42663894">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; America is a country where the majority even of “white” people belong to ethnic groups that never had anything to do with African American slavery<p>You&#x27;re framing DEI as a punishment for slavery, which it&#x27;s not.

One of the core tenets of abolitionism was the idea that humans are created equal, and such attributes as race or skin color are irrelevant before God, and hence to the faithful, too. Christ specifically said that being a Greek or being a Jew does not matter before God, and being a slave or being a master also does not matter; all are equal.<p>So, <i>certain</i> amounts of colorblindness are inherent to the very idea of people of different origins being equal, as it emerged in the USA, and supposedly elsewhere in the Christian-dominated areas of the world.<p>Also, it&#x27;s the idea of equality, equal worth (before God), not of fairness or compensation; the latter might come from atonement and Christian love to the neighbor.<p>Eventually other ideas took hold and somehow eclipsed the initial ideas, not just of 1860s but also of MLK&#x27;s.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42662952" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42662952" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ponow</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658998">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42662759">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42663927">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42662957">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42662952">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42662952">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But that line is what people agree with, not the commie stuff.</div><br/><div id="42663563" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42663563" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Izkata</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658998">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42662952">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42663570">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42663563">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42663563">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yep, that&#x27;s exactly why it became the thing he&#x27;s known for.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42663570" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42663570" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">NotSammyHagar</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658998">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42662952">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42663563">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42662957">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42663570">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42663570">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">what is the commie stuff?</div><br/><div id="42664250" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42664250" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">raffraffraff</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658998">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42663570">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42662957">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42664250">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42664250">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Dunno but I wonder if Jesus would be considered a commie if he appeared incognito in 1950s America.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42662957" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42662957" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">spaceguillotine</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658998">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42661539">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42662759">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42661599">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42662957">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42662957">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">MLK was a communist who was killed for his views by the US Government.<p>He was not the harmony flowers and rainbows he was white washed into.<p>Rights are never given, they have to be taken by force.</div><br/><div id="42663256" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42663256" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thefounder</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658998">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42662957">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42663713">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42663256">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42663256">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;&gt; Rights are never given, they have to be taken by force.<p>That&#x27;s simply not true.

That happened a long time ago. Redlining systematically and intentionally deprived non-white families of home ownership, while helping white families to own homes. But wealth begets wealth, so owning a home lets someone borrow money against it to start a business. When these people die, their children will inherit their wealth.

Yes, a family who was able to get a home loan (redlining didn&#x27;t affect them) might have squandered this wealth gambling, or maybe they didn&#x27;t pass it onto their children, so some people unaffected by redlining may still end up in a similar place. Similarly, some families that were affected by redlining have still managed to accumulate wealth in spite of redlining. My claim is that the family that squandered their money still got the chance to squander was was given to them, and the injustice is that the redlined family was denied that opportunity.</div><br/><div id="42663286" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42663286" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">395112342</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658998">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42662652">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42662489">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42663286">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42663286">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I can&#x27;t help but notice (believe me, I&#x27;m trying not to notice!) that this comment is getting some downvotes.

Hitler&#x27;s only original idea was taking shittons of methamphetamine. Martin Luther had done the legwork of radicalizing Germany into hating Jews; once Germany had become a functionally unified nation-state the Holocaust was a forgone conclusion. This is the core belief of Zionism[0]: that the only way to stop Jews from becoming victims is for those Jews to form their own nation-state that can commit its own atrocities.<p>BTW, this is the same logic the Japanese had in their head when they started invading and destroying the rest of East Asia, around the same time as Hitler. They wanted to be respected in the way that the Christian Bible would describe as &quot;having the fear of God&quot;. The fact that this led to the horrific rape of China and Korea[1] would suggest that these victim narratives are morally self-defeating without some framework of <i>reciprocal</i>[2] tolerance and human rights to distinguish between justified self-defense and unjustified oppression.<p>But America at least sort of has that, so we can make that distinction.

They have had issues with ‘the man’, but have managed to mostly sidestep them, and are very highly represented in education and professional employment. To the point they have been actively penalized in many Affirmative Action programs.<p>If it takes one woman 9 months to make a baby, you can’t get 10 babies with 10 women in 1 month.

From that point of view, it would get annoying if there was someone taking the wrench out before the fall.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42661088" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42661088" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thewanderer1983</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658998">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42660571">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42662456">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42662612">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42661088">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42661088">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;so there go the marketing programs that were designed for the old power structure.<p>AKA.

Sure, that moment is frequently the culmination of some period of struggle, but you have to remember that the issues that came to a head and sparked those DEI initiatives a few years ago were exactly that—the product of literally centuries of struggle. Or, perhaps more accurately, a recent phase of that struggle.<p>So, I believe your emphasis is on the wrong side of the equation here. That is, it&#x27;s not that there is an inherent deficiency in a trending moment or ascendant party giving rise to change. It&#x27;s the explicit <i>pushback</i> against DEI that is responsible for its unwinding. And, this effort was not successful because the party that sponsored the pushback was ascendant. Instead, part of the party&#x27;s ascension was due to it making an issue of the pushback.   More specifically, the blowback was part of a divisive theme, along with illegal immigration and other issues.<p>Progress is not a one-way street and gains are not de facto insulated against erosion. Progress (and its security) is a product of the mores and culture of a time, and these can be influenced and manipulated. So, there is really not such a thing as &quot;lasting change&quot;, and that&#x27;s what we saw here. In some ways, the blowback has taken us not just back to our pre-DEI state, but to a pre-1960s mental footing.</div><br/><div id="42663432" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42663432" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lolinder</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658998">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42663351">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42659717">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42663432">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42663432">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The methods chosen to push this and other recent changes <i>assumed</i> that those advocating change would stay in power, if not in government at least in the culture.

That was a critical and fatal flaw. You can&#x27;t plan change on the assumption that you&#x27;ll be able to apply pressure indefinitely.<p>You&#x27;re right that there are tipping points, but they don&#x27;t come at will, they come when the culture is ready for them. Push too soon, and as you note, you may actually undo progress that had already been truly won.<p>Culture behaves like a non-Newtonian fluid: manipulate it gently and it flows smoothly. Apply too much stress too fast, and it turns into a solid and resists you. Trump did not invent that resistance, he simply untapped it and rode it to power. The progressive movement created the resistance by applying too much pressure to a culture that wasn&#x27;t ready.</div><br/><div id="42663559" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42663559" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">unclebucknasty</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658998">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42663432">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42659717">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42663559">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42663559">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s too much history arguing against what you&#x27;re suggesting here.<p>And, your claim argues against itself.

So how, exactly, do progressives convince these same people?<p>You&#x27;re suggesting they do so by not moving too fast? That they wait for the &quot;culture to be ready for change&quot;?<p>If we waited for the culture to be ready, then schools in the South would still be segregated.

The job market was soaring in 2021 and looking for ways to hire new people without having to pay them more would likely be highly attractive. Now that the job market is not so competitive, there&#x27;s not as much need to do so if you&#x27;re just trying to find workers.</div><br/><div id="42662564" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42662564" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Manuel_D</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658998">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42660489">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42660856">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42662564">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42662564">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; you feel like you&#x27;ve hired all of the labor you can at a given market price (e.g., you&#x27;re cheap and don&#x27;t want to pay people more) it might make sense to try and reach out to parts of the labor force that you feel have been underutilized (or historically underrepresented, but we&#x27;re looking at this from the perspective of a ruthless business), and DEI programs could be a way of achieving this.<p>In my experience, DEI programs do the opposite. I&#x27;ve seen manager leave headcount unfulfilled because the qualified candidates they found were non diverse and hiring them would put them below their diversity target. If 20% of the workforce is women and your bonus is contingent on reaching 30%, you could recruit at Grace Hopper and try to hire more women.

Most of them were almost certainly hired as part of a much larger group: replacements for existing jobs that were vacated by retirees or people changing jobs.<p>&gt; A telltale sign that Bloomberg’s “percentage of the net increase” methodology is flawed, VerBruggen explained, is that, if the departures of whites had been just a little higher, the net change in whites would have been negative instead of the actual small growth of 20,000. Bloomberg’s methodology would then assert that whites took a negative percentage of the new 320,000 jobs, a mathematic impossibility.<p>&gt; The percentage of new jobs that went to whites was likely about 46%, eight points below the 54% white makeup of companies’ existing workforces.

The poor ones fail because the planners dont really know what they are trying to do, but leadership thinks they ought to have one, and so they metric-ize it.

And, concomitantly, deliver a lot of low value chatter that provides ample ammunition to opponents of any kind of DEI programs, even the good ones.<p>A good DEI program should, IMHO, be indistinguishable from good management culture embedded at every level in an org.<p>- It should not be controversial to assert, and product management to insist, say, that products designed for humanity should be usable by humanity: men and women, for example - but we still have medicine and cars tested on male models, and software that is unusable if you have low vision or cant operate a mouse and keyboard simultaneously. That doesn&#x27;t automatically mean one must hire 50:50 men:women, say (see legal rocks, above), but it certainly starts to smell like a missed opportunity if you don&#x27;t have a single person on your staff or in your network of consultants who can explain what it feels like to wear a seatbelt when you are 1.5m and 50kg not 2m and 85kg.

I am really tired of being caught in the maw of people fighting about my identity, what I am owed, and to some extent what place my identity has in society.<p>To the pro-DEI crowd: I have some hard truths for you. Actual change requires <i>commitment</i> and <i>focus</i> over an <i>extremely long period of time</i>. That means you have to choose probably 1 cause among the many worthy causes, and then invest in it <i>instead of</i> the others. You can&#x27;t do everything. The problems that afflict my community are running water, drug addiction, lack of educational resources, and secular trends have have made our traditional industries obsolete. I am not saying that land acknowledgements and sports teams changing their names from racial slurs are negative developments, but these things are not even in my list of top 100 things to get done.<p>We all want to help, but to have an impact you <i>must</i> have courage to say no to the vast majority of social issues you could care about, and then commit deeply to the ones you decide to work on. Do not be a tourist. I don&#x27;t expect everyone to get involved in Indian affairs, but I do expect you to be honest with me about whether you really care. Don&#x27;t play house or go through motions to make yourself feel better.<p>When you do commit to some issue, understand that the biggest contributions you can make are virtually always not be marketable or popular—if they are, you take that as a sign that you need to evaluate whether they really are impactful. Have the courage to make an assessment about what will actually have an impact on the things you care about, and then follow through with them.<p>To the anti-DEI crowd: focus on what you can build together instead of fighting on ideological lines. The way out for many minority communities in America is substantial economic development. In my own communities, I have seen economic development that has given people the ability to own their own destiny. It has changed the conversation from a zero sum game to one where shared interests makes compromise possible. If you want to succeed you need to understand that your fate is shared with those around you.

The kids mostly speak English as first language, and the schools are in English. With the exception of one huge twist, the schools have many educational difficulties you&#x27;ll find in rural America generally—it&#x27;s hard to get money for materials and curriculum, hard to recruit good teachers, hard to get students connected to people with practical advice&#x2F;guidance, hard to get connected to opportunities, hard to reach escape velocity, and so on.<p>So, what&#x27;s the twist? Tribal schools tend to be administrated by the federal government which makes problems extremely slow and hard to address. With some asterisks, the local elementary school was basically provisioned as a consequence of a federal treaty with the US Senate, and is&#x2F;was mostly administered by a the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), which rolls up into a federal department that until 2020ish, had never been run by a native person. All of these things make it very tricky to work with.<p>In spite of that, believe it or not, this is a massive improvement: until relatively recently, the school was a mandatory boarding trade school meant to teach kids to be (basically) English-only maids. This lead to a substantial percentage of the population being either illiterate or semi-literate, with no meaningful work experience, and with very very few opportunities that were not menial work. That inertia is extremely challenging to overcome, and the most natural place to try is the education system, which generally is simply not up to it.<p>I am stating these as a neutral facts on purpose. Regardless of how we got here, the hand is ours to play. Some of us got out and whether we succeed in the next generation depends on whether we can mobilize the community to productively take advantage of the resources we do have. This is why it&#x27;s painful to me to hear about, <i>e.g.</i>, land acknowledgements.

Your team does some interviews and wants to make an offer. DEI vetos it because every single candidate they interviewed was a white male. They don&#x27;t tell you who to hire or not to hire, they just say that if you couldn&#x27;t even find even a single woman or POC to interview, then you didn&#x27;t look hard enough. Go back, consider more candidates who might not fit your preconceived notion of what you thought a person in that role should look like.<p>If after interviewing more people you still pick a white male, that&#x27;s fine. DEI offices never force diversity and standards are not lowered. But they do have an impact - by considering more diverse candidates, that naturally leads to more diverse candidates being hired.<p>That&#x27;s just one example of what they do.<p>You can argue the merits of the specific programs, but it&#x27;s not true at all to say that those programs are just &quot;puffery&quot;.</div><br/><div id="42659026" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42659026" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AlexandrB</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658015">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42658517">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42659227">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42659026">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42659026">[17 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Go back, consider more candidates who might not fit your preconceived notion of what you thought a person in that role should look like.<p>This is already super weird.

During the meeting introducing it to VPs and dept heads, there were skeptical questions as a lot of groups were under shipping pressure and short-handed. There was also already a lot of &quot;HR overhead&quot; like various mandatory compliance training sessions that all employees had to attend every year (unrelated to their actual work). The company was also clearly already highly diverse at all levels from the CEO on down and had been for a long time.<p>The DEI training did end up becoming a yet another mandatory HR time sink and no one I know thought it was necessary or useful. The second year the program expanded to take even more time but the worst thing was they brought in outside trainers who started doing the &quot;You&#x27;re a racist and don&#x27;t even know it&quot; schtick along with weird tests and exercises. This became contentious and caused a lot of issues, especially because the context leaves people feeling like they can&#x27;t openly disagree. There was a lot of negative push back but people felt like they couldn&#x27;t use normal company channels so it was all in private conversations and small groups. Kind of the opposite of the intent of openness and communication.<p>For me, that was when DEI went from &quot;probably unnecessary (at our company) but just another &#x27;HR Time Tax&quot; to &quot;This is disruptive and causing problems.&quot; I&#x27;m not surprised that some companies are realizing that the way many of these DEI initiatives were implemented wasn&#x27;t effective in helping diversity and that they were also causing problems. It was the wrong way to pursue the right goal. At our company, we got rid of the old DEI program in early 2020, so this broad correction pre-dates the US election 8 weeks ago.</div><br/><div id="42660285" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42660285" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blitzar</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658015">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42658864">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42658495">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42660285">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42660285">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My general experience was that this was much more a thing on the ground in ~2015-2020 and the internet &#x2F; political rage machine is (as usual) a few years behind.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42658495" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42658495" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwpoaster</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658015">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42658072">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42658864">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42658196">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42658495">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42658495">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Symbols can have a lot of political power.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42658196" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42658196" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">causi</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658015">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42658072">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42658495">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42658103">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42658196">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42658196">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Right.

Working with people who are in different from me in some substantial way showed me how much of that is arbitrary.<p>For an extreme example, imagine a car company with zero women employees. I could imagine that their designs might look increasingly awesome to people who grew up playing with black, angular, high-powered cars (like me -- that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d want!). And while there are plenty of women who&#x27;d like that, too, there are lots of women (and plenty of men!) who&#x27;d want something smaller, more brightly colored, and with better gas mileage. It they didn&#x27;t have those varying opinions, or weren&#x27;t even aware that people <i>had</i> other opinions, they&#x27;d be severely limiting their potential market and leaving huge amounts of money on the table.<p>(My wife&#x27;s a big F1 fan and wants to own a McLaren some day.

Luckily, there&#x27;s one set of fields where that data is available: sports.</i><p><i>&gt; ...</i><p><i>&gt; In baseball, Gwartney and Haworth (1974) found that teams that discriminated less against non-white players in the decade following de-segregation performed better. Studies of later decades using “classical” productivity metrics mostly found that salaries equalize. However, Swartz (2014), using newer and more accurate metrics for productivity, found that Latino players are significantly underpaid for their productivity level. Compensation isn&#x27;t the only way to discriminate -- Jibou (1988) found that black players had higher exit rates from baseball after controlling for age and performance. This should sound familiar to anyone who&#x27;s wondered about exit rates in tech fields.</i><p><i>&gt; ...</i><p><i>&gt; In tech, some people are concerned that increasing diversity will &quot;lower the bar&quot;, but in sports, which has a more competitive hiring market than tech, we saw the opposite, increasing diversity raised the level instead of lowering it because it means hiring people on their qualifications instead of on what they look like. I don&#x27;t disagree with people who say that it would be absurd for tech companies to leave money on the table by not hiring qualified minorities. But this is exactly what we saw in the sports we looked at, where that&#x27;s even more absurd due to the relative ease of quantifying performance. And yet, for decades, teams left huge amounts of money on the table by favoring white players (and, in the case of hockey, non-French Canadian players) who were, quite simply, less qualified than their peers.

The vast majority of the benefits of these programs went to white women, immigrants, and sexual minorities.<p>We literally don&#x27;t even keep statistics about the descendants of slaves, because they&#x27;re too embarrassing. The only reason race was introduced into the census was to keep track of them, and now we&#x27;re counting Armenians for some reason.<p>Not dealing with slavery turned us all into race scientists.<p>That being said, the white victimization story is a dumb one. White people are overrepresented. If some institution stopped hiring or admitting for diversity reasons, they wouldn&#x27;t be hiring and admitting more white people, they&#x27;d just hire and admit <i>fewer people.</i> Anti-woke is a civil rights struggle on behalf of dumb people: the lowest ranked white people with absolutely no historical excuse. If one really believed in nature over nurture, or the degeneracy of culture, that&#x27;s exactly where you would go looking for it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;articles&#x2F;long-shadows-the-black-white-gap-in-multigenerational-poverty&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;articles&#x2F;long-shadows-the-black-wh...</a><p>&gt; Our headline finding is that three-generation poverty is over 16 times higher among Black adults than white adults (21.3 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively).

Before getting into the details, there is some important background to lay out:<p>The legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the United States is changing. The Supreme Court of the United States has recently made decisions signaling a shift in how courts will approach DEI. It reaffirms longstanding principles that discrimination should not be tolerated or promoted on the basis of inherent characteristics. The term &quot;DEI&quot; has also become charged, in part because it is gives preferential treatment of some groups over others.<p>At Meta, we have a principle of serving everyone. This can be achieved through cognitively diverse teams, with differences in knowledge, skills, political views, backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences. Such teams are better at innovating, solving complex problems and identifying new opportunities which ultimately helps us deliver on our ambition to build products that serve everyone. On top of that, we&#x27;ve always believed that no-one should be given - or deprived- of opportunities because of protected characteristics, except if they’re a man or white, or Asian man.<p>Given the shifting legal and policy landscape, we&#x27;re making the following changes:<p>On hiring, we will continue to source candidates from different backgrounds, but we will stop discriminating against white and Asian men. This practice has always been subject to public debate and is currently being challenged. We believe there are other ways to build an industry-leading workforce and leverage teams made up of world-class people from all types of backgrounds to build products that work for everyone.
We have decreased the importance of meeting racist and sexist quotas and tying outcomes to compensation. Having quotas in place make hiring decisions based on race or gender. While this was our practice, we want to appear less sexist and racist.
We are sunsetting our supplier discrimination efforts within our broader supplier strategy. This effort focused on sourcing from Black-owned businesses; going forward, we will focus our efforts on supporting small and medium sized businesses that power much of our economy. Opportunities will continue to be available to all qualified suppliers, including those who were part of the supplier diversity program.
Instead of equity and inclusion training programs, we will build programs that focus on how to apply fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all, no matter your background.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42659460" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42659460" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mv4</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658015">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42661260">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42663788">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42659460">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42659460">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">These programs seem problematic.<p>&#x27;A former Facebook global diversity strategist stole more than $4 million from the social media giant “to fund a lavish lifestyle” in California and Georgia, federal prosecutors said.&#x27;<p>Interestingly, similar fraud occurred at her next job.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;former-facebook-diversity-leader-pleads-guilty-to-fraud.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;12&#x2F;13&#x2F;former-facebook-diversity-le...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42663788" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42663788" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kristofferR</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658015">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42659460">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42660080">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42663788">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42663788">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Took me way too long that PoC doesn&#x27;t refer to proof-of-concept.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42660080" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42660080" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">santoshalper</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658015">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42663788">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42659688">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42660080">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42660080">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They never cared about DEI.

It is that it’s not an attractive or high status field to women. The people working in it are not seen as socially competent, it is highly outsourced, and depending on role has relatively little socializing. It’s also insanely competitive and you have to fight to keep your job from an army of H1B workers invading the country due to CEOs looking for slave labor. There are so many reasons to not be in tech and sexism should be one of the lowest reasons out there.<p>I don’t know any women complaining about sexism in comparison to the level of “holy fuck, when will I ever get a break?” It is an unrelenting field that constantly has you worried you’ll lose your job next month.

I personally ended up majoring in math  instead of cs because of that process at my college.</div><br/><div id="42660179" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42660179" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Karrot_Kream</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658511">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42660016">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42661360">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42660179">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42660179">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I don&#x27;t have the answers. You might be right.<p>I guess the interesting point of discussion here is &quot;personal inclination&quot;. A lot of my female friends have stories about how their parents encouraged their brothers to fix things around the house, get their hands dirty, read manuals, and set up new appliances. They tell me how they were, conversely, encouraged to make friends, maintain relationships, and steered toward more aesthetic pursuits like art, drama, or music.<p>My sister, at an age when she had no strong interests of her own, was given paintbrushes and nice paper as gifts by our parents but not Legos because they felt like girls were more likely to enjoy aesthetic things than mechanical things. Funny enough, as an adult she has neither mechanical nor aesthetic interests. The question I guess is how much of &quot;personal inclination&quot; is driven by these small decisions of what options we give to kids.<p>I will say my experiences are colored by the fact that my family is a low-income immigrant family in the US from a culture with definite gender discrimination and so they hold stronger gender prejudices than probably a high-income Scandinavian family. My guess is also that younger generations have grown up with a much better idea of gender equality and will raise their kids with less of this prejudice.<p>I also observed in my school that a lot of women felt more comfortable in the math department than CS (though CS had much less prestige compared to now), so thanks for your story and background.</div><br/><div id="42660339" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42660339" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">annzabelle</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658511">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42660179">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42661360">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42660339">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42660339">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think I may also have somewhat of a blind spot here because I grew up with a mom who is a software engineer herself and I was bought a bunch of electronics&#x2F;building toys by engineer relatives on both sides.

“””<p>Response:<p>“””<p>The reader is attributing the potential lower quality of their products to the filtering based on the owner’s identity.

In that sense, different companies <i>will</i> be different.<p>For example, according to those statistics, Costco <i>should</i> be more diverse than, say, Netflix.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42658792" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42658792" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">spike021</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658437">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42658492">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42658532">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42659747">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42658792">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42658792">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">perhaps it goes without saying but they don’t only employ front line store staff.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42659747" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42659747" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">brendoelfrendo</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658437">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42658492">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42658792">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42662452">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42659747">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42659747">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The diversity isn&#x27;t for you the customer, it&#x27;s for the employees and the kind of corporate environment Costco wants to build.<p>Edit to add: A better corporate environment, of course, does tend to lead to a better customer experience, but the &quot;visibility of diversity&quot; should not be the goal but rather &quot;genuinely fostering an inclusive environment where people are respected and feel willing to put in their best work,&quot; and I think that shows at Costco.</div><br/><div id="42662834" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42662834" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">drak0n1c</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658437">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42659747">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42662452">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42662834">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42662834">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It certainly is not there for the customer, as their core business of exclusionary membership is a quintessential example of systemic racism and classism via disproportionate impact.</div><br/><div id="42663183" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42663183" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ok_dad</span><span>|</span><a href="#42658437">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42662834">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42662452">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42663183">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42663183">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Can you expand on this?<p>The cost of a Costco membership is $65 per year (really half that if you can share the 2 membership cards you get between two families), available to everyone, and the prices they have there are so good that even my 3-person family saves money each year by shopping there.

You need to be good at all of memorization, problem-solving with theory, and laboratory experiment: it&#x27;s difficult to succeed with a weakness in any one of these. Though one could technically try to be a computational chemist for people who didn&#x27;t enjoy the experimental work, you&#x27;d still have to go through a lot of labwork as a student. I have a special respect for people who&#x27;ve succeeded as chemists as a result.<p>Also, as a side note of personal curiosity that&#x27;s on a bit of a tangent in case anyone with experience in chemistry is reading this: I heard an anecdote about improving results in teaching labs once that I&#x27;ve thought about from time to time, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s credible.<p>A chemistry undergraduate was running experiments at a teaching lab, when he decided to go the extra mile and look up how to calibrate his equipment. He then calibrated his equipment carefully before running the rest of his experiments each time that semester. His experimental results were so consistently close to the theoretical results, that he was accused of falsifying data by his instructor (though ultimately, he didn&#x27;t receive any penalties). Would this be plausible, or a tall tale? I was always wondering since then, if taking the time to calibrate all of one&#x27;s tools before an experiment could have such a big impact for experimenters—or alternatively, if the student actually was manipulating the data. But then again, maybe this was some kind of statistical fluke, and he attributed the randomness to his calibrations.</div><br/><div id="40073629" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40073629" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PlasmonOwl</span><span>|</span><a href="#40073009">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40074097">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40073629">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40073629">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You are completely right.

Chemistry truly is an unappreciated science. Another field where it is essential in studying, learning, fixing - environmental issues. There at many biologists, and ecologists, but few chemists.

We need more teachers that understand the need and use for chemistry - which would lead to a more educated population that could understand the world around them, better.</div><br/><div id="40072384" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40072384" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">selimthegrim</span><span>|</span><a href="#40072013">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40072965">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40072384">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40072384">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wish the market listened to you.</div><br/><div id="40072773" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40072773" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eru</span><span>|</span><a href="#40072013">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40072384">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40072965">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40072773">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40072773">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why?

He said that the most available job for chemical research for someone with a Bachelor&#x27;s was as a lab technician, which roughly earns about $40,000 USD a year: not bad, but far below an engineering or computer science graduate, despite the comparable difficulty for completing the degree.<p>For chemists who complete a doctorate, a brief search shows that a PhD graduate (after 4–7+ years of low pay as a graduate student after a Bachelor&#x27;s) can plausibly earn about $125,000 USD with some luck as a starting salary as a scientist in industry. A Master&#x27;s graduate can likely earn close to that. But I&#x27;ve heard that the job market is tougher for research positions—a fair number of people switch into other fields such as medical device sales and sales engineering (with eye-wateringly large salaries of plausibly greater than $400,000 USD a year from what I&#x27;ve heard), data science, or software.<p>But careers aren&#x27;t only about the money, though. It sounds like the author of the submitted article has lived a fulfilling life without a primary focus on salary, and it certainly looks like people who enjoy chemistry research won&#x27;t struggle financially for their efforts. However, there&#x27;s still a salary gap, especially at the level of a Bachelor&#x27;s: it looks clear that other fields pay a lot more for similar amounts of effort.

The result is minor tremors, sometimes larger quakes.<p>I am in southern Quebec, and there is a LOT of water here.  Personally, I suspect there are glaciers underground which are still thawing, which would also cause additional land movement.<p>Some supporting thoughts...<p>* one year, after a lot of snow (record snowfall, where some people&#x27;s 1st story windows were covered entirely), it took until July for all the snow to melt.  This was in areas around my house, and in my forest, where sun didn&#x27;t shine.<p>* if you look into how we used to store ice for the summer, we&#x27;d cut it out of lakes in massive blocks (eg, Lake Ontario or some such), and then store it in warehouses covered with sawdust.  Such ice was even used residentially, delivered every once in a while, and used in a refrigerator like &#x27;ice box&#x27;.  This ice would last the whole summer, it takes time for that much mass to melt, especially with some insulation.<p>Which is what underground glaciers have... they&#x27;re insulated.<p>Even a decade ago, we&#x27;d see -40C regularly here in Jan and Feb, which would counter 40C in the summer I suspect.<p>Anyhow, this could all be simple post-ice age land reformation.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40992856" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40992856" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jmward01</span><span>|</span><a href="#40993191">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40992825">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40992856">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40992856">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What does it take to convince people to take risks like this seriously? The challenge is that hypothetical risks &#x27;sometime in the next 50+ years&#x27; don&#x27;t convince people to do things, at least in the US. The pacific northwest is at a much higher risk from an array of faults (not just the cascadia subduction zone) and volcanic hazards but even there, where the risks are very well understood, getting a large region to take it seriously looks to be a near impossible task. Most people I have talked to don&#x27;t even know that there is a risk in the PNW much less the magnitude of it or how to prepare.

Additional work to strengthen highway passes, communication infrastructure, government owned buildings...maybe some seismic engineering or reinforcement done on the unreinforced masonry elementary schools, some of which (in Seattle) were last touched in the 1990s.

Everybody has their own idea about what needs money and how much money should be thrown around.  There&#x27;s no objectively correct way to sort it all out, no means by which we can weigh the relative merits of increased library funding against retrofitting single family homes against earthquakes except by asking people which they prefer.  And different people have different tolerance for risk, somebody who decided to tolerate the risk of a major earthquake sometime in the next X years because they&#x27;d rather fund some other project isn&#x27;t necessarily <i>wrong</i>.  It&#x27;s not a matter of simply educating people about the risk (and FWIW, the average person in Seattle is definitely aware that the region is geologically risky.)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40992988" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40992988" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shiroiushi</span><span>|</span><a href="#40992856">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40992961">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40993506">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40992936">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40992988">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40992988">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">He&#x27;s probably hoping for emergency preparedness, like any sensible person.

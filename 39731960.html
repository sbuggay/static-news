I did a lot of shell scripting at the time and was constantly getting annoyed by subtle differences between macOS and Linux. Sed is especially difficult, because the flags in BSD version and GNU version for in-place search and replace do not match. Plus, sed regexes are more primitive compared to most other languages.<p>I decided to switch from sed to Perl for all my string replacements and at the time it made my life so much easier! Eventually I started expanding my Perl use to a few lines of code at the time, and now I write a few larger (100+ LOC) scripts in it a year.<p>Funny how my personal journey matches the story of Perl back in the 80s: it was born to replace more primitive tools.</div><br/><div id="39732529" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39732529" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">silisili</span><span>|</span><a href="#39732447">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39732665">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39732529">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39732529">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For anyone who cares, sed -i&#x27;&#x27; should be compatible on both mac and linux.</div><br/><div id="39732892" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39732892" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">naniwaduni</span><span>|</span><a href="#39732447">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39732529">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39732665">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39732892">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39732892">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It is not. -i&#x27;&#x27; is exactly the same thing as &quot;-i&quot;, and while GNU sed interprets this as an empty suffix, BSD sed expects -i to take an argument normally, and will treat the <i>next</i> argument as the extension.

Decades ago, it was in a Perl group &#x2F; forum that I first heard the term &quot;do not re-invent the wheel&quot; when someone enquired about making some kind of their own CGI framework along with a great write-up about all the unique edge cases that the existing library already handled due to the experiential knowledge it had gained during its development.

To my surprise&#x2F;delight, I discovered that the Solaris boxes we were using came with Perl pre-installed (which in hindsight is totally expected). So I decided to learn about it the proper way and the Llama book was exactly what I needed.<p>People have called Perl code line noise. But when I read the book for the first time, everything make sense to me because my mind likes mnemonics. $ is for ($)calar, @ is @(rray), % has a pair of circles like key&#x2F;value pair and so on. I didn&#x27;t find it odd that you&#x27;ll get the array in list context and count in scalar context - it made complete sense. Till date, Perl is the language which I reach out for short-term tasks which need to be done immediately, because it helps me get the job done at the speed of thought.<p>I picked up some bash scripts as candidates to be re-written in Perl and I will never forget my mind being blown by the sheer lightening speed of Perl scripts; stuff that took many seconds or even minutes in bash were done in a second or less, even with my unrefined code. It was like a new world opened up and indeed, I felt like a wizard.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39732693" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39732693" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">trabant00</span><span>|</span><a href="#39732519">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39732267">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39732693">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39732693">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Learning Perl is imho the best book for beginning to code.

This &quot;Forward to Learning Perl&quot; epitomizes the mentality: Imagery of wizards, alchemy, breaking all the stuffy rules that quashed creative thought, etc. He even says &quot;bowing down at the Temple of Orthogonality&quot; like orthogonality a bad thing!<p>It hearkens back to the days when motor cars were curiosities that required frequent tinkering and had no safety requirements. The sky was the limit, but your car could blow up.<p>Perl was rightly bashed because it was the poster child of cowboy coding, which flies in the face of good engineering practices: Understandability, predictability, reproducibility, measurability, safety. This allows you to use a product with confidence. I had the misfortune of inheriting some cowboy code, and to this day I call a pox upon the writer. His lack of discipline caused YEARS of misery and maintenance costs; far outweighing any temporary benefit he provided.<p>Newer programmers might not have lived during the bad old days of cowboy coding, but I did. Nothing was documented. Nothing really worked because there was no edge case support. The mentality was &quot;If it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand&quot; and &quot;If you&#x27;re not happy with it, feel free to modify the code&quot; (their impenetrable code). Basically, pass-the-buck for your own lack of discipline, and then blame the user.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;ve moved on towards becoming a serious engineering discipline, complete with UX being a thing.</div><br/><div id="39732678" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39732678" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mdavidn</span><span>|</span><a href="#39732267">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39732492">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39732880">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39732678">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39732678">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m glad you found a corner of this industry with &quot;serious engineering.&quot; It&#x27;s still the wild west in web development.

Python appeared easier to understand for the newbie because it favoured words over expressions but now that Python has matured it’s become just as incomprehensible too.<p>&gt; predictability<p>I’ll be the first to admin that there are a couple of really massive footguns in Perl which are remnants of its evolution as a shell tool. But there’s other aspects to the language which are really clever. For example the way Perl does type comparison is much more predictable then Python.<p>On the whole, I think those languages are about equal.<p>&gt; reproducibility<p>CPAN was also light years ahead anything also available at the time. And still is in many regards. For example, Python environments is a mess. Perl is one of the most portable languages out there. Want to change the state of the runtime? Just add a line to the top of your source. Simple.<p>Python and JavaScript are a completely pain in the arse in comparison.<p>PHP is another example of a language that gets this right. Few people on here (myself included) will have much love for 2010’s PHP but it just goes to show that a lot of the languages “real programmers” praise do actually suck at a lot of the basic principles.<p>&gt; measurability<p>Not really sure what this is intended to refer to. Maybe APMs? Either way, a lot of diagnostics like that came into vogue after Perl’s decline so this isn’t really the fault of the language but more just 3rd party tool writers putting their focus elsewhere.<p>That all said, don’t be fooled into thinking such tooling doesn’t exist for Perl.<p>&gt; safety<p>Perl basically invented unit tests amongst the scripting languages. It also has stricter run modes to differentiate between one time scripts and important business code.<p>Saying Perl lacks safety demonstrates a lack of experience with the language.<p>——-<p>I’ve written production Perl, PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C++, Go, Bash, Visual Basic and even Pascal. De-mangled other people’s spaghetti code in all of those languages too. Probably a few languages I’ve forgotten about too. Perl is one of those languages people love to hate but is, in my opinion, one of the most misunderstood.<p>[edit] I should have added a comment about Perl’s backwards compatibility. Few other languages even come close to the longevity of Perl 5. And that commitment extends down throughout Perl’s ecosystem. With JavaScript I’m constantly scared the next npm update will break the project.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39732570" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39732570" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alfiedotwtf</span><span>|</span><a href="#39732267">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39732492">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39732880">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39732299">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39732570">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39732570">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Cowboy Coding is not a language thing, it’s a mentality thing.

What you mentioned last is called brand advertising IIRC, which is not conversion oriented, but aimed at exposing you to a brand (like, a car manufacturer) so that at some point _later_ in your life, you contribute to a decision to buy from them.<p>Now, huge companies do run focus groups and such to ensure their brand advertising has the right (psychological) effects. But it is inherently difficult to measure. And I&#x27;ve seen many mid-sized companies not do that at all, they run these ads based on what they believe might work.<p>Mind you, this is experience from 4 years ago, but I did find the ad industry, as obsessed with tracking as it is, to be surprisingly gut-driven. For a lot of it, it&#x27;s hard to tell if it works.<p>I do fully agree that for people who know what they&#x27;re doing, advertising absolutely works, in ways that are sometimes unintuitive to consumers.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41244099" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41244099" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lupusreal</span><span>|</span><a href="#41243350">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41243454">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41243666">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41243782">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41244099">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41244099">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I only worked in ad tech briefly and many years ago, but what I saw there was a game being played between the people who make&#x2F;distribute ads and the companies that buy them.

You’ve got your core 15% who you can send an email to saying “buy this”, and they will, 95% of the time - then segments step down in terms of convertibility until you’re down to 0.01%, at which point you’re usually going to get more people irritated by the marketing than you will sales.<p>The marginal cost of most marketing is very low - that’s to say, to reach 10,000,000 eyeballs doesn’t cost much more than to reach 10,000 - unless you’re doing paper catalogues, which is a whole other thing, most of your cost is up front, artwork, direction, whatever - so it makes sense to shoot for a bigger basket and get some bycatch.<p>Me - I resolutely refused to do any marketing for our business.

Not all ads are equal. Most ad segments are performed with a direct transaction: advertiser hands YouTuber money, YouTuber puts ad in their content. There may be additional parts of the deal such as tracking codes, but that&#x27;s not how it works.<p>The YouTuber gets the ad money, even if the video is not watched. Though that does not mean you should skip the ad, because the videos have heatmaps and no one would advertise if the segment was always &quot;cold&quot;. Though what the OP is saying is you can send strong signals (to both the advertiser AND the YouTuber) as to what ads you&#x27;re willing to watch and not. In fact, in this way, it is a great tool for making a more efficient market as it increases information quality. But only under the assumption it is both pervasive and not used bluntly.</div><br/><div id="41241448" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41241448" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ndriscoll</span><span>|</span><a href="#41234334">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41241122">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41243633">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41241448">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41241448">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you&#x27;re not interested in the advertisement, then you&#x27;re creating a <i>less</i> efficient market by signaling that you are.

Watch communicates potentially more because there&#x27;s a secondary effect of some of those people buy the product. But by indiscriminately watching or not watching, we provide information about an interpolation along what was binary before.

In a way, the discriminating information tells us something about the likely conversion rate.

Yes, but profits aren&#x27;t the only thing people care about. At least not all people. Money is still a proxy for something more abstract.<p>To make it clearer, there are in fact ads that I do enjoy. This is true for all of us because an ad is so vaguely defined. During a political campaign I appreciate some ads because I want to know the candidates positions, when they are debating, and so on. Too much of it pisses me off, but that&#x27;s different.<p>I also like ads that make me aware of certain things that provide utility to my life, but maybe not yours and this can be based on timing.<p>So stop rejecting this and recognize that these are all attempts at communicating these other factors. It&#x27;s another variable in a system of equations.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41241518" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41241518" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">paulryanrogers</span><span>|</span><a href="#41234334">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41241448">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41244014">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41243633">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41241518">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41241518">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Adnausium isn&#x27;t making the market more efficient.

My main channel (non-tech) is small, but is monetised, and YouTube see fit to throw me a _very_ variable amount of money every month. CPMs are down right now so revenue has tanked along with it, it’ll pick back up at some point, but the variability is itself the pain point. My videos are relatively expensive and time consuming to make, but people seem to find them useful, and even enjoyable. The occasional (relevant) sponsor read or similar has been a huge help in providing some stability in the past, and I know for many channels it’s the main source of income since YPP revenue share can be so volatile.<p>I do worry that if this takes off it will just result in those sponsors pulling their budgets for this type of advertising, and it’ll be another nail in the coffin for creators. Sure many of us also do patreon etc but that’s never really sat right with me personally (and see also the post on HN just today about Apple coming for a revenue split there for another creator-hostile storm brewing).<p>On the other hand, I totally get the hatred of “the usual suspect” sponsors (VPNs, low-quality learning platforms etc) that get done to death because of their aggressive sponsor budgets and not-unreasonable deals. Those get shoehorned into a ton of videos and it’s a shame, but a blunt instrument like this is likely to kill off sponsorships as a whole, not just those bad ones.</div><br/><div id="41238280" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41238280" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chankstein38</span><span>|</span><a href="#41231674">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41233038">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41238280">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41238280">[29 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The thing that sucks is I pay for YouTube Premium to remove ads then youtubers always have sponsored segments.

Passive advertising from video and stream platforms (which many adblockers do block)<p>2. Active advertising via sponsorships (which SponsorBlock wants to block)<p>3. Live stream donations<p>4. Video&#x2F;stream-independent donations, most usually via Patreon<p>5. Paid &quot;premium&quot; or behind-the-scene programmes (partly overlaps with video&#x2F;stream-independent donations due to their obvious weaknesses)<p>6. Merchandises<p>And not all streamers can do them at once. Live stream donations only work for some genres of streaming and it is easy to stress audiences. Usual donations may or may not work, but it is usually thought to be weaker than live stream donations due to its passiveness (unless you come up with very different perks, but then your income is completely independent from streaming).<p>Many high-profile channels rely greatly on merchandises because it does have significant margins if you can keep launching enough of them, but they are especially risky when your channel and&#x2F;or stream is not large enough. So smaller channels have traditionally relied on passive advertising, but its flaws are well known and discussed to the death by now.

Conseuqnces of being late to the party.<p>2. what&#x27;s offered isn&#x27;t necessarily going to be even higher quality than a public video.<p>3. ad rev from non-subbed views is still signifigant. Making a paid subscription for certain videos can mean brining in less money.<p>4. That lower view count affects your algorithm for growing.<p>It&#x27;s complex. And sadly, outside of the OF model most people simply don&#x27;t want to pay for content.

I do have patreon (and others) for other projects and it’s another revenue stream, which is great. But for my YouTube main channel I believe the content itself has value, and having to pour time and resources into building a value-add package devalues it - both in the immediate (since I would now have less time to devote to content creation) and longer term (since it makes it essentially a leader for my value add packages).<p>(Some larger creators I know do manage to carve out some revenue on patreon etc without any “perk package” but I think for that to work it becomes even more of a numbers game, and won’t help small creators just getting started.

While I agree with the sentiment, this point I highly disagree with. At least sponsor segments are (at their face) transparent. I&#x27;m sad that there&#x27;s many disingenuous products and misinformation in these segments, but at least you know it is an ad. On the other hand, native advertising has all those same bad things <i>but</i> additionally tries to deceive you into believing it isn&#x27;t an ad.<p>Analogously, I&#x27;d be upset if someone handed me a glass of piss when I asked for something to drink. But at least I can recognize it and turn it down. On the other hand, if you hand me a glass of piss and actively take efforts to make it look, taste, and appear like water, al while telling me it is water, sure, I probably won&#x27;t be upset because I don&#x27;t know. But dear god... if I find out... Well, I don&#x27;t think there are many reasons that someone should be punched in the face, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there are zero reasons to...<p>Deception is so much worse.<p>Btw: check out ReVanced[0]. You can rebuild the YouTube APK (and others) to integrate adblock and sponsor block. All optional too! Unlike pihole, it&#x27;ll actually achieve that.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;revanced.app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;revanced.app&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41236842" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41236842" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Always42</span><span>|</span><a href="#41240975">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41243647">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41236842">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41236842">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">i have been using sponsor block firefox extension for some time.

Advertising is necessarily adversarial, and everyone&#x27;s tolerance for it is going to be unique depending on how heavily they rely on free resources, but it is a necessary unpleasantry at its best.<p>If I could even recall the exact number of times an advertisement of any type appealed to me in the last 20 or more years, it would amount to less than the fingers on my hand. I used to welcome all of Google&#x27;s advertising tracking and relevance-seeking as the best version of advertising out there, but even that resulted in unimpressive and less than meaningful ads. If Google can&#x27;t advertise something useful to me, then I have zero qualms about walking by, palm facing them in refusal.<p>Because of these product failures, and because it is unwise to trust a big company with all of your personal data, I rarely desired to be advertised to at all.<p>Individual content creators have the opportunity to give me a chance with something unique that they know that their viewers would be interested in because they (hopefully) relate to their audience much more than a faceless corporation, and can present a product in its best, most relevant light.<p>But if that content creator is trying to sell me a Scandinavian VPN service or a game of legendary shadows, you can bet I have zero interest.<p>All this may change as GenAI-driven methods may key in on relevant interests based on what I wish to share about myself.

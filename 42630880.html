However, I&#x27;ve been back to visit my 3rd cousins multiple times and I get the impression that the specific pastry that Czech Texans are so familiar with is just one of many kinds in the old country.  In the 1800s, ovens were not as plentiful in Europe, but were more common in America.  Sugar, butter, eggs and white flour were more expensive in Europe, so kolaches were reserved for special occasions.

The best meditation advice I got was to just sit down, focus on doing nothing and be OK with being bored. Not some breathing techniques, how to focus your mind, posture etc. That comes later, very naturally, after you get curious about improvements.<p>Same goes for writing down thoughts. Just take a blank A4 paper from the printer and write away. Not sure what to write? Write about that, the fact that you&#x27;re not sure what to write. Throw the paper away if you don&#x27;t like the thoughts you see, or at least do it with that mindset.

Years of therapy and three different therapists have yet to get me to a place where I can truly open up, even when writing on a page I know no-one else will see.<p>Two days ago I did weed for the first time. I accidentally took a much larger hit than I meant to. For the first 15 minutes I had a complete out-of-body experience; nothing seemed real, I felt like I was floating through space, able to peer into reality at will, still not quite trusting that it wasn&#x27;t all a dream. I&#x27;m pretty sure the term of art for what I experienced would be a psychotic episode.<p>After that... I lost my filter. Like, it was gone. And my mouth was a conveyor belt connected to the emotional part of my brain. No logic, just uninhibited speech, for 45 minutes, all while sobbing harder than I have in my entire life.<p>I exposed every last deep, dark secret I possessed. My fear of never being good enough. My fear that everyone in my life will leave me at some point. My fear that I&#x27;ve done so many hurtful things over my life that I&#x27;m unworthy of love and of the friends I have. And many more things I won&#x27;t be sharing with the world, at least not yet.<p>Inside, it felt like my brain and my mouth were connected by a pipe, and all I could do was sit back and watch in horror as the very depths of my mind were laid bare for all to see.<p>A good friend of mine was with me while I did it. She heard everything. It&#x27;s a mark of our friendship that she held me, reassured me that she loved me for who I am, not who I want people to think I am. Our friendship is even stronger now, something I would never have thought possible before having that experience.<p>It was terrifying, and yet oddly theraputic. I&#x27;m seriously considering cannabis-assisted psychotherapy now.<p>---<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is: there are a number of substances that induce mind-altering states in ways that are relatively safe and free from long term effects. If you&#x27;re someone who can&#x27;t seem to open up naturally, don&#x27;t be afraid to try them. They just might change your life.<p>(As with everything, consume appropriately and safely. Have someone experienced in the substance you&#x27;re consuming keep an eye on you. And for god&#x27;s sake, don&#x27;t do anything known to be addictive or to have severe negative side effects.)<p>Also, find friends who you can truly be yourself around, who love you even when they know the absolute worst about you. It makes all the difference to know that someone loves you not for who you want the world to think you are but for who you actually are.</div><br/><div id="37817515" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37817515" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jiggybling</span><span>|</span><a href="#37814710">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37815059">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37817515">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37817515">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I tried weed once a few years ago and took a bit too much as well. When the euphoria hit, I realized I had never felt that good in my entire life and I became scared of the idea that I would lose control. My thoughts also sped up and I would get into these metacognitive&#x2F;self-analytical loops. I&#x27;d start thinking about something and before I could finish I&#x27;d have another thought analyzing what I had just thought, and so on. And I experienced the loss of filter. At the time, I was with a friend in his basement and we were surrounded by his mom&#x27;s amateur paintings. I&#x27;ve never been an art person but I remember looking at one of her paintings and talking nonstop about all the different visual details that kept popping out at me.<p>I didn&#x27;t have as complete as loss of inhibition as you described however. The friend I was with wasn&#x27;t someone I completely trusted - many of my thoughts I decided not to share. Still, I think the experience was valuable and I&#x27;m glad I tried it. Although, in retrospect any self-insight I gained I don&#x27;t think I truly took to heart, as it didn&#x27;t lead to any meaningful behavioral change. It&#x27;s only been two days, but I wonder what kind of long term changes you will see. Has the loss of filter persisted in any way or did it wear off when you came down?<p>Either way, your story, outside of being well written and incredibly personable, gives me hope for my own healing.  I&#x27;d love to connect and hear more about where your experience takes you, especially if you end up trying cannabis assisted therapy. I&#x27;m planning on trying psychedelic assisted therapy at some point so it would be cool to have someone to discuss with.

I just work from home, work on my hobbies (mostly gamedev), read articles, go to one or two social events a week (often just a family party or casual game night or meetup, nothing crazy), go to a few conventions throughout the year, and take one weeklong trip.<p>One year I managed to write 120,000+ words with this approach, and it likely would have been higher if I hadn&#x27;t skipped a decent number of days (maybe not a lot higher, I sometimes made up for the skipped days by reflecting back as much as I could).<p>I&#x27;m not currently that good about it, though.

And if you have the habit of being in bed awake for longer time, you know why that is anyway.<p>To get to the point: Doing a daily writing basically wiped out the problem entirely for me. Nowadays, when I can&#x27;t sleep, it is because I ate too much too late.<p>I do my writing once per day, usually close to bed time. I write about relatively noteworthy things (&quot;another day of being too lazy to progress on hobby thing XY&quot; is a pretty common one), then go a bit on a tangent maybe, why that is and if it&#x27;s actually that bad. I try to be mostly gentle to myself here and keep it positive. If things happen that annoy me (neighbours annoying, cashier rude, big train delay, whatever), I of course write them down too, and also go on a tangent. Can I do something about this? Are there maybe good reasons for it, which I didn&#x27;t think or care of the moment it happened, etc?<p>Basically, do the thing you would do while laying in bed and pondering things - the difference is, when you are not in bed, and writing, you do it in a more constructive, brief way. For events the next day (difficult meeting etc.) nail down the worst case, the way it will likely go, the things you for sure do not wanna do&#x2F;say.<p>And it weeds out the desire to unwrap all that crap once more as soon as you lay down. Which is the whole point of the exercise, basically.<p>Do I read these things ever again? Most often not, honestly. But I maybe change my opinion on that, and if so, they are available.<p>FWIW, I write these on computer, not pencil and paper. Lowers the friction for me, and is fine.

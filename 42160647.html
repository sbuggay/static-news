The presenter showed this equation: z = z**2 + c and explained how complex numbers worked.  I went home and thought really hard- harder than I had, clearly figuring out some stuff I didn&#x27;t know before (like mapping a small floating point interval to the &quot;high-res&quot; screen of my apple &#x2F;&#x2F;e.
Eventually I got a working program and started it... and it didn&#x27;t get very far before I had to go to bed.  I didn&#x27;t even know at the time whether you could leave a computer on overnight- would it overheat?  But I did and woke up to... nothing.  My BASIC program hadn&#x27;t gotten to any of the set yet, just the bands around it.  At that point, I decided I needed a faster computer and eventually upgraded to a 80286 DOS machine which I think was able to run FRACTINT.  FRACTINT was a clever optimization that used integer (which was all my poor 286 could do) and a number of other tricks to speed up set rendering.  It was a very useful lesson in how to optimize.<p>That book, and several others (K&amp;R C, Hackers) helped expand my high school mind and point me in the direction of high performance computing, complex systems, and simulation.  The butterfly effect played a huge role in my understand of classical causality.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42162096" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42162096" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sigil</span><span>|</span><a href="#42161983">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42162872">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42162096">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42162096">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Gleick&#x27;s &quot;Chaos&quot; got me sent to the principal&#x27;s office in high school. I went crazy for fractals. Unfortunately all I had at home was an IBM PC XT. Mandelbrot set renderings were agonizingly slow and the CGA palette was too limiting.<p>Around this time my co-conspirator and I realized the library had 386s that almost no one was using for catalog search. They became our fractal render farm. We&#x27;d exit the catalog program, insert a floppy with our latest renderer, kick off a deep zoom, and turn off the monitors to avoid suspicion until we could check back next period. The results were thrilling. What a difference the access to compute made.<p>You all know the story -- eventually the librarian found us out and reported us for &quot;hacking.&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="42162872" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42162872" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vr46</span><span>|</span><a href="#42162096">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42161901">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42162872">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42162872">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One of my favourite books and authors, I gave my copy to my photojournalism tutor after I explained how this book helped open up my mind and related directly to the photojournalism concept of “creating order out of chaos”, which has since become applicable to every part of my professional life!<p>Need to go dig out his other books and get myself another copy of this.

Did humans create those features by inventing mathematics, or did they exist independently in the universe, waiting to be discovered?

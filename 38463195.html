Steel wasn&#x27;t available in bulk until about 1880.<p>The materials really matter. Early steam engines such as Newcomen&#x27;s were insanely complicated and had terrible thermodynamic efficiency, because the parts couldn&#x27;t stand any real pressure.<p>Consider a Diesel. A basic Diesel engine is a very simple machine. Here&#x27;s a rural mechanic in China restoring one from junk status to running, using basic tools.[1] It&#x27;s a brutally simple one-cylinder engine, widely used in Japan and India. No pollution controls. No water recycling; you have to add water as often as fuel. No electrical components. Started with a hand crank. 
Costs about US$200-$300 for a new one.[2]<p>Seems like someone would have been able to build one of those by 1700 or so. But no.
You couldn&#x27;t build that engine without reasonably good steel. Even if you had one to copy, you could not build that with the technology of 1870. You need a strong cylinder, a strong cylinder head, and good piston rings that precisely fit the cylinder, or you won&#x27;t get the compression to ignite the fuel. The first Diesel engine that worked was built in 1897.<p>Steel is interesting, because it&#x27;s thousands of years old, yet wasn&#x27;t mass produced until the 1890s. A Bessemer converter is very simple. The Romans could have built one. But it took quite a bit of R&amp;D to get the metallurgy right so that steel came out. Bessemer got his working, but others, with different ore sources, couldn&#x27;t get theirs to work reliably. Robert Mushet did 10,000 trials over ten years of to get an understanding of exactly what ingredients do what. This debugged the Bessemer process, and the world changed.<p>The Romans had sword factories. They could make steel, but not in bulk. If that work had happened a centuries earlier...<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=s--QjXbdnME" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=s--QjXbdnME</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alibaba.com&#x2F;product-detail&#x2F;Changchai-Diesel-Engine-On-Sale-Best_60592807970.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alibaba.com&#x2F;product-detail&#x2F;Changchai-Diesel-Engi...</a></div><br/><div id="38470824" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38470824" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">GolfPopper</span><span>|</span><a href="#38470412">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38470929">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38470824">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38470824">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;<i>Steel is interesting, because it&#x27;s thousands of years old, yet wasn&#x27;t mass produced until the 1890s.</i><p>Thank you for your succinct summation of this complex point. I&#x27;ve been fascinated by the history of technology for as long as I can remember, but as a kid, even a teenager, steel drove me nuts. On the one hand, there were lots of sources talking about the late 19th Century as the time when steel emerged, but there were equally as many references mentioning Chinese steel, Indian steel or Damascus steel thousands or hundreds of years ago. It took me a long time (until, in the pre-internet era, I had access to a college library) to get a good picture of steel&#x27;s place over time.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38470929" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38470929" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">belugacat</span><span>|</span><a href="#38470412">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38470824">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38470480">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38470929">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38470929">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s funny how these things work.

The aeolipile dates to 1st century AD, rather late in Roman history.<p>[2] The historical motivation for the steam engine was of course draining coal mines, and the Romans weren&#x27;t really using coal in enough quantities to require it. The Industrial Revolution itself was initially jumpstarted with textile production, which Rome was even further behind in--the spinning wheel wasn&#x27;t developed until after 1000!</div><br/><div id="38468258" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38468258" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BirAdam</span><span>|</span><a href="#38465330">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38468015">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38465417">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38468258">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38468258">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You are correct as far as anyone alive today can know.

I havenât seen it brought up recently but thereâs a simple quote that makes it easy to evaluate any sort of energy related discussion based on the laws of thermodynamics:<p>âYou canât win, you canât break even, and you canât quit the game.â - C.P. Snow [1] (No idea if thatâs the correct attribution, I heard it from a professor 20 years ago)<p>My personal shorthand for this is to focus on the efficiencies of energy transformation and transport. Converting or moving energy means we lose some fraction of the total energy. All we can do is minimize that fraction.<p>The main point being that with that mental framework, I can easily assume that your posited approach wonât be more efficient than a solar panel or some other process with fewer transformation steps because each step magnifies energy loss inefficiencies.<p>Basically, the entirety of the energy debate is two things: How can we harvest energy cheaply and move it with minimal waste.<p>This is the basis for the whole room temp superconductor story that captured a bunch of our nerd imaginations, what happens if you get super close to zero energy loss while moving electrons?<p>Also, one more thing to keep in mind is constraints. Your proposed solution may be way more efficient by some metric if we change the constraints. For instance, my brain mostly goes to transportation which is transport and storage with immediate demand requirements. However, if our requirements were different along the lines of âlets store as much energy as possible over months, to slowly release it over monthsâ, inefficiencies of scale change things. Then maybe slowly moving water uphill during summer while releasing slowly during winter is a valid thing to consider [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gohighbrow.com&#x2F;laws-of-thermodynamics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gohighbrow.com&#x2F;laws-of-thermodynamics&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;drax&#x2F;how-to-turn-a-mountain-into-a-giant-battery-fac4896335c9" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;drax&#x2F;how-to-turn-a-mountain-into-a-giant-...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="38467731" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38467731" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ianburrell</span><span>|</span><a href="#38466032">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38468160">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38466254">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38467731">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38467731">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thermal solar energy is a thing.

    ARENAâs funding for VS1 is conditional upon the project reaching financial close, which is targeted to occur in late 2023. VS1 is expected to take two years to build with commercial operations commencing late 2025.

    CSP uses mirrors to concentrate and capture heat from the sun in solar receivers, with high temperature heat transferred via sodium and stored in molten salt. The stored heat can then be used to heat water to create steam to power a turbine and produce electricity, or the heat can also be used directly to decarbonise some industrial processes.

    One of the benefits of CSP is that the captured heat can be stored cost-effectively for long periods with little loss of energy. This means that CSP can be used to generate electricity or provide heat on demand, including overnight.

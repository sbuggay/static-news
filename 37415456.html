Same thing happened in the 3G era to Ericsson&#x2F;Nokia (with world-wide customers), and until the much more recent &quot;well, you can&#x27;t really use any Chinese equipment in your telco network&quot; trend, you can&#x27;t really blame anyone for actively ignoring that market.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s debatable how much money there actually is to be made in &#x27;5G&#x27; as a standalone technology: like land-line telephony, the stack is pretty much indistinguishable from &#x27;regular&#x27; datacenter tech these days, and apart from some niche management software and ultra-specialized radio hardware, it&#x27;s hard to see where Cisco could have made a real difference, given the total lack of promising US-based (or even EU-based) acquisition targets in that space.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37441626" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37441626" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cvccvroomvroom</span><span>|</span><a href="#37442702">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37442263">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37441626">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37441626">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To be fair, late stage corporations almost all look alike: unwieldiness, complexity, inflexibility, bureaucracy, sluggish inertia, inefficiencies, and disconnection from users.

We have perfected &#x27;crap for the masses&#x27;, unfortunately. Standard problems:
 - I just bought a (bulk) phone charging station. Even though I attempted to pay more to get a non-shitty product, it has no on&#x2F;off button. Instead, I can unplug it manually from the socket each morning :-&#x2F;.<p>- music volume: When I stream music from my android phone to one of our not-cheap bluetooth speakers, the volume can be adjusted in something like 16 possible increments. In practice, there are 3-4 possibilities:
(A) so low you can&#x27;t hear anything, and the frequency distribution is off.
(B) almost but not quite audible.
(C) audible, but a bit too loud.
(D) so loud you fear structural damage to your kitchen.
In practice, I toggle back and forth between B and C, and wish just that interval had analog subdivisions.<p>- two relatively expensive bluetooth speakers (sigh) in our house have no &#x27;tangible&#x27; power buttons, only icon-marked areas where you can hover your finger for the same effect. I lack words to describe how annoying it is to have to visually ascertain your finger is near where the almost-invisible icon is. I have marked them with nail-polish, but it is not enough. They are both cylinder-shaped, so there are 360 choices.<p>As I see it, there should be good money to make, 
in just offering physical knobs on your gadget, and possibly analog controls.<p>As a caveat, precisely the physical knobs have often been the failure points in expensive Hi-Fi gear I&#x27;ve owned over the years,
in particular the channel&#x2F;input selector,
and the volume controls.

I was careful to point out that unfamiliarity with the new interface wasn&#x27;t <i>necessarily</i> the same as it being bad, especially if with a little additional training and practice we could become more efficient and&#x2F;or it aided in discoverability for newer users.  Although I didn&#x27;t use the same words as the OP I was unironically suggesting that MS must have done a bunch of research to show that these interfaces would be an improvement in usability.<p>Joke&#x27;s on me!  Fifteen years later and I still can&#x27;t fucking find anything I want to do in the ribbon.  I use various MS products at least a couple times a week (though day-to-day is more Libreoffice when it can&#x27;t just be vim) and despite regular use I still find that I routinely have to google &quot;how do I X in Microsoft Word&#x2F;Excel&#x2F;etc&quot; for values of X that are <i>very standard tasks</i> that I am deeply confident I would be able to find on my own in a menu.  And once I do find out how to do something, even if it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m going to be doing a bunch, there&#x27;s no indication of a shortcut or keyboard equivalent that I could train myself on, to become an actual power user of the interface.

They&#x27;re not the same thing at all! &quot;Having to read the manual&quot; can make an application MORE usable if it allows for more advanced UI paradigms, and for applications where the users will spend a lot of time this can be a good trade-off (of course, for many other types of applications it&#x27;s a bad trade-off).<p>It&#x27;s hard to directly compare things to 20 years ago; &quot;real-time collaborative editing of a document (with automatic saving and unlimited undo) over a video call&quot; wasn&#x27;t done because we lacked the internet speeds and computing power to make that viable, not because UI paradigms improved.</div><br/><div id="38286676" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38286676" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">comex</span><span>|</span><a href="#38284409">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38285702">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38285020">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38286676">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38286676">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; It&#x27;s hard to directly compare things to 20 years ago; &quot;real-time collaborative editing of a document (with automatic saving and unlimited undo) over a video call&quot; wasn&#x27;t done because we lacked the internet speeds and computing power to make that viable, not because UI paradigms improved.<p>But that&#x27;s not true.  2003, 20 years ago, happens to mark the launch of both the first modern collaborative real-time editors (SubEthaEdit and MoonEdit) and a major video calling service (iChat AV).<p>Sure, hardware progress since then has helped.  Video calling got much better due to internet, camera, and codec improvements, along with webcams becoming a ubiquitous component of computers rather than an external addon.  Collaborative editing really took off once it started to work in web browsers, originally with EtherPad, but more importantly with Google Docs.  That&#x27;s partly due to the UI paradigm of the URL, but the ability for collaborative editing to work in web browsers can also ascribed to faster CPUs, as well as browsers getting more efficient (which is not hardware but also not a matter of UI paradigms).<p>Still.<p>Ignoring the calling part (which really isn&#x27;t essential, IMO), collaborative editing isn&#x27;t necessarily very resource intensive (depending on the algorithm).  The technical conditions for it to work were satisfied as soon as Internet access became a ubiquitous feature of computers in the late 90s.  Yet it wasn&#x27;t until 2010, when Google Docs gained collaborative editing, that it even started to take off.  I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s definitely an example of UI paradigms improving over time.<p>By the way, a form of collaborative editing was shown off in 1968 in the Mother of All Demos, <i>with</i> video calling!  It used analog video.</div><br/><div id="38287121" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38287121" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">arp242</span><span>|</span><a href="#38284409">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38286676">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38285020">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38287121">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38287121">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And AT&amp;T had their (in)famous Picturephone way back in the 60s.

And it&#x27;s fruststrating for every power user, and everytime normal users leave the &quot;happy path&quot; the UI-gurus &quot;designing&quot; such things had in mind.<p>&gt; scary technical language, having to read the manual,<p>Yes, people should try and understand the products they use. If they refuse to do so, then the obvious solution are simplified products, which, granted, are easier to understand, with the tradeoff of lacking functionality.<p>Which is completely fine by the way. Right tool for the job and all that. What <i>isn&#x27;t</i> fine, is if ALL products start doing that, because then it gets really hard for the people who do read manuals to do their job...because suddenly there are no manuals any more, the language used is over-simplified and non-descriptive, and interface elements are god-knows-where.<p>And sadly, that&#x27;s exactly where we are now in the software world. Because yes, things like a massive WYSIWYG editor <i>is</i> complex. There is no way around that complexity, not if you want it to have all these bells and whistles it&#x27;s marketed for having. Yes, things like an email client that people organise their online-identiy around <i>is</i> complex. Yes, applications that people manage their financial lifes with <i>have to</i> be complex. No, an error message saying <i>&quot;Oh noes! Something&#x27;s not working. Maybe try again later!&quot;</i> under the picture of some sad cartoon character is not helpful for tech support to debug problems.<p>My favorite example, and personal beef of mine? Firewall management software. Because, I think we both can agree that people who&#x27;s job it is to manage corporate firewalls <i>do</i> read the manuals, and are <i>not</i> scared by technical language. But all my reading and being tech savy gets me absolutely nothing, if the only way to configure that thing is by running a click-marathon through what I can only assume was a modern-art design study gone horribly wrong, and the only documentation available is an old youtube video from 2 versions ago.<p>&gt; as you realise how much knowledge you have to build up to confidently use some software.<p>Here is the thing though: In ye &#x27;olde days, all these scary, techy interfaces <i>looked the same</i>. Once you figured out the menu bar in one application, it was easy to transfer that knowledge elsewhere. Want to save something? &quot;File&quot; menu. Want to change what you&#x27;re working on? &quot;Edit&quot; menu. Want to change settings? Pretty sure there is a &quot;Settings&quot; or &quot;Preferences&quot; hidden somewhere under &quot;Edit&quot;.<p>Nowadays, we have a hamburger button, or a 3-dot button, or a title bar, or a sidebar, or maybe it&#x27;s one of the phones function buttons, or it&#x27;s a 2-3-4-finger swipe (the directionality of which is anyones guess). The settings may or may not be under Account, or in the App-Settings, or there might not be any settings at all. The account can be reached helpfully via that gear-icon, or by clicking the profile picture, or by hovering over the profile picture and waiting 0.5sec for the dropdown menu to fly in. Or it&#x27;s not there at all, because that would be scary to the users, and instead I can change account settings via the non-mobile website on my PC. Or via some other app. Oh, and how wonderful those interfaces are where certain elements only become visible <i>when I flip the phone by 90°.</i>.<p>And this continues ad nauseam. There are no rules, no continuity, no obvious way how something works. Knowing how one app works, doesn&#x27;t teach me anything about the next one, other than how great those ugly textual menu-bars were in comparison.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38285886" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38285886" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">userbinator</span><span>|</span><a href="#38284409">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38284210">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38285886">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38285886">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>Slack is not some backwater cottage industry.

In fact, it seems reasonable to assume that friction arising from the design of the UI will have a <i>greater impact on non-expert users</i>. Highly proficient and experienced users are able to work around problems more easily, recognise the (changed) patterns more easily, etc. They are also more able to articulate what the problems are and are more likely to dedicate time to doing so.<p>When your non-technical family member faces some inscrutable change to their workflow, they seek your help <i>to get their task done</i>, not to analyse the design or intent behind the UI -- and you know that, so you use your expertise to adapt their workflow to the new design and they thank you for it.<p>When your professional family member faces some inscrutable change to their workflow, they tell you how shit software is these days and find a solution on their own.<p>So on one hand you hear &quot;help me get my thing done&quot; and on the other you hear &quot;software used to be better&quot;.

They had a web app that didn&#x27;t just work -- it was acknowledged as very good. Fully customizable, you could open many sub-windows and monitor an arbitrary number of quotes depending on your strategy.

I used their web app for more than a decade.<p>Last year they replaced it by something they have the guts to call &quot;the enhanced experience&quot;.

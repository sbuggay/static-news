GL.iNet routers had several RCE (Remote Code Execution) vulnerabilities within the last 6 months. I advise you to have a quick look in your own router to ensure its not hacked, and possibly upgrade firmware.<p>As a typical user the noticeable symptoms for me were:
- internet speed noticeably slows down
- WiFi signal drops and personal devices either don&#x27;t see it, or struggle to connect. At the same time the router is still connected to the internet
- router&#x27;s internal admin page (192.168.8.1) stopped responding<p>I imagine many users haven&#x27;t updated their routers and thus may be hacked. In my case the hacker installed Pawns app from IPRoyal, which makes the router a proxy server and lets hacker and IPRoyal make money. The hacker also stole system logs containing information about who and when they use the device, whether any NAS is attached. They also had a reverse shell.<p>Solution:
1. Upgrade firmware to ensure these vulnerabilities are patched.
2. Then wipe the router to remove the actual malware.
3. Then disable SSH access, e.g. for GL.iNet routers that&#x27;s possible within the Luci dashboard.
4. Afterwards disable remote access to the router, e.g. by turning Dynamic DNS off in GL.iNet. If remote access is needed, consider Cloudflare Tunnel or Zero Trust or similar. There is also GoodCloud, ZeroTier, Tailscale, etc. I am not too sure what they all do and which one would be suitable for protected access remotely. If anyone has advice, I would appreciate a comment.<p>Consider avoiding GL.iNet routers. They do not follow principle of least privilege (PoLP) - router runs processes using root user by default. SSH is also enabled by default (with root access), anyone can try to bruteforce in (10 symbol password consisting of [0-9A-Z] and possibly might be more predictable). I set mine to only allow ssh keys rather than a password to prevent that. Despite running OpenWrt they are actually running their own flavor of OpenWrt. So upgrading from OpenWrt 21.02 to 23.05 is not possible at the moment.</div><br/><div id="40577751" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40577751" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">daghamm</span><span>|</span><a href="#40575589">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40575345">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40577751">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40577751">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;As a typical user the noticeable symptoms for me were: - internet speed noticeably slows down - WiFi signal drops and...&quot;<p>Could also be the neighbours and their big microwave oven :)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40575345" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40575345" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mannyv</span><span>|</span><a href="#40575589">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40572633">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40575345">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40575345">[17 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">An open question is still: how were the attackers able to grab his HTTP traffic?<p>Some CPEs have a cloud Wireshark-like capability for debugging.

I was thinking about this while reading. My guess is that the vulnerability was limited to reading incoming requests (to the modem) or something along those lines, not full control of the network. Replaying the requests is a good way to get both ends of the traffic if you can only access one. For instance, a login + password being authenticated. Just a thought!<p>EDIT: I&#x27;d be hard-pressed to know how one could exploit this, given TLS would encrypt the requests. Maybe they&#x27;re counting on using badly encrypted requests, encrypted with e.g. TLSv1.0?</div><br/></div></div><div id="40573805" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40573805" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">arrty88</span><span>|</span><a href="#40573944">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40580482">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40573805">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40573805">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; One of the things I&#x27;ll never understand was why the attacker was replaying my traffic?

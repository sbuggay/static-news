EDIT: It’s illegal, GA 21-2-413. I’m not sure how the validation works, but I assume that there is an identifier in the QR code, and it likely doesn’t have plaintext candidate names so I’m not sure if you could even validate the QR code with available data, but it would most certainly be a crime.<p>The scenario they exposed as possible is : voter receives a printout paper ballot with the vote selection printed correctly in text, but the included QR code has modified selection(s).  That paper is then fed into the reader&#x2F;scanner&#x2F;tabulation machine.  No further confirmation.<p>The whole point of the printout is for voters to confirm their selections, the whole QR code step is a design flaw.  Just print regular ballots with filled in circles that can go through a standard tabulation machine and still be read&#x2F;checked by humans if you really need to add a (required) touchscreen interface to the process.<p>“If an attacker changes only the QR code, voters have no way to detect the change by looking at their ballots, since voters can’t read the QR code.

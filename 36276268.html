How come no US citizen is attacking Russians, or Middle Easterners (Libyans, Syrians, Iraqis, Afghans etc) in US soil when the Media is 24 x 7 discussing how these countries are the &quot;Enemy&quot; of the United States?

So the attacks on people of Asian descent turned out to be the perfect excuse. That&#x27;s what it comes across to me as an observer of US politics. There is literally no reason for censoring information on discussion of a lab leak that did not even happen on US soil but in Wuhan. If you can discuss Russia, 9&#x2F;11, terror attacks in various parts of the globe, without US citizens going bonkers and attacking people of those races, I am pretty sure discussing lab leak theory would not piss US citizens off that much. But bring in race attacks angle and you have the people by your side asking for and justifying censorship.<p>Let me ask you another question: How do you think people in Asia discussed the COVID pandemic?

But that&#x27;s a bit different. Though I understand the confusion. Gain of function research can be classified as weapons. You got to develop weapons to defend against them. And of course, momentum. Especially in politics, where once funding is given it is hard to take it away, though not hard to reduce. I&#x27;m more saying if they would seriously deploy such a weapon and how serious the research is.<p>&gt; What makes you think leaders aren&#x27;t willing to hurt their own countries to hurt their enemies?<p>Some yes, some no. I think most countries have learned that the Russian strategy doesn&#x27;t lead to great outcomes. Then again, you think Russia would have learned it too. But most countries realize that you can&#x27;t rule over the dead. But you&#x27;re right, that I may be too trusting. As far as vaccines, it is hard to keep those secret. Especially if we&#x27;re talking about a country like China with a billion people, where you have to distribute at least a few hundred million. You don&#x27;t think a few are going to fall off the truck? There&#x27;d be a lot of money for such a situation. Or even just the recipe. I mean vaccines don&#x27;t confer 100% immunity so it still comes with big costs to yourself. But you&#x27;re right, Russia keeps doing the Russian strategy. Though this is more easily done in an authoritative country. This is a lot of what jcranmer is pointing to. One more thing to consider, it is hard to invade this region after. You might think the same thing about nuclear but there&#x27;s a reason they&#x27;ve focused on increasing the explosion and decreasing the radiation. Same reasons.<p>&gt; Every major terrorist organization is or was created, funded and controlled by major nations.<p>Not quite true, but if they were, then the above arguments would apply there so that no terrorist organization would get the bio weapons from the big countries. You might want to ask why there haven&#x27;t been any dirty bombs, despite that this should be easier, especially after the collapse of the USSR where many nuclear materials went missing. They all went somewhere (smaller countries and probably bigger countries too, to keep away from smaller countries), but we&#x27;ll probably never know the full extent.<p>&gt; And yet, all weapons labs in history were created by big&#x2F;rich countries.<p>I&#x27;m not quite sure what you&#x27;re getting at here. Not all weapons were created in big countries. But weapons like nuclear, bio, and others were from big countries because to have such a program is quite expensive. Currently bioweapons, of the kind we&#x27;re discussing, are still fairly expensive. This may change as things become cheaper. But regardless, these types of weapons are more attractive to the crazy anarchist who wants to watch the world burn than the angry dictator. They just aren&#x27;t practical in the modern globalized world.<p>But there&#x27;s got to be a logical reason for well over a century of research in the area and not seeing it used in practice. If it were a good weapon, it would have been used.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36287240" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36287240" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">startupsfail</span><span>|</span><a href="#36278817">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36286317">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36288355">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36288465">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36287240">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36287240">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Can the lab be sued out of existence for damages?<p>It is quite clear that they did amplification research as they’ve planned.

(Said later they didn&#x27;t do the planned research), but funding from the military appears to have been given.<p>(1.1)  They planned to do the research at the time and approximate place where Covid later emerged.<p>(2)  Protections at the lab were not what they should have been.<p>(2.2)  Lab scientists had previously created a highly infectious super-coronavirus (not Covid-19) with a very high kill-rate that in all probability would never have emerged in nature. Their tests showed no known (at that time) way to effectively limit its spread were it to leak.<p>(3)  NO animal testing was reported in a wide vicinity around the the Hunan market. Samples of Covid found in the market were NOT from animals (B).<p>(3.1)  The market is a busy place in the center of the city where the virus would almost certainly be once it&#x27;s spreading between people.<p>(3.2)  There is some evidence that researchers from the lab were hospitalized with Covid-like symptoms in November 2019, and one of their relatives died.<p>(4) The biggest hotspot of people reporting illness via social media (in the month before the province was locked down on January 23) was at the institute, though this was partly hidden in initial reports. The first case in Britain was recorded a week later.<p>(A) The Wuhan Institute of Virology sought funding for inserting a furin cleavage site. The institute is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan Seafood market.<p>(B) In January 2020, Chinese officials cleared the market without testing live animals. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was from environmental samples (animal cage, hair-and-feather–removal machine, etc). Covid-susceptible animals were present but NOT tested. The study of those samples was criticized for not having any animal samples.<p>(C) Information above drawn from archive.ph&#x2F;L2BSO and comments and links here in this HN thread.<p>---------------------------<p>&quot;The Sunday Times has reviewed hundreds of documents, including previously confidential reports, internal memos, scientific papers and email correspondence that has been obtained through sources or by freedom of information campaigners in the three years since the pandemic started. We also interviewed the US State Department investigators — including experts on China, emerging pandemic threats, and biowarfare — who conducted the first significant US inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak. The closest relatives to Covid known were too far from Covid to have developed into Covid on their own in a short time. So bringing in dangerous viruses and accidentally leaking them is an unlikely cause.&quot; Earlier reporting by the Times: archive.ph&#x2F;Mkqox<p>Genome statistical estimates indicate the &quot;relatives&quot; are decades away from Covid.  In February 2020, RaTG13 was identified as the closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, sharing 96.1% nucleotide identity. It was found near the town of Tongguan in Mojiang county in Yunnan, China. However, in 2022, scientists found three closer matches 530 km south, in Feuang, Laos, designated as BANAL-52 (96.8% identity), BANAL-103 and BANAL-236. However, it is alleged that one virus at the Wuhan institute was an even closer match to Covid-19 than RaTG13. Note that bat viruses had never been known to harm humans. Intermediate animals apparently catching a virus from bats and passing it to humans had been known to happen.<p>In the lead-up to the pandemic, the Wuhan institute frequently experimented on coronaviruses alongside the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, a research arm of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). In published papers, military scientists are listed as working for the Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, which is the military academy’s base.</div><br/><div id="36281795" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36281795" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">QuantumGood</span><span>|</span><a href="#36281773">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36286957">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36281795">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36281795">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Overly-speculative information supporting a lab leak:<p>&quot;Scientists with close relationships with the Wuhan Institute of Virology said it was their belief that there was vaccine research going on in the fall of 2019, pertinent to Covid-19 vaccination&quot;<p>&quot;Investigators believe the Chinese military had taken an interest in developing a vaccine for the viruses so they could be used as potential bioweapons. If a country could inoculate its population against its own secret virus, it might have a weapon to shift the balance of world power.&quot;<p>In May 2020, one of the key researchers died from unconfirmed causes at age 54.<p>&quot;On November 19, the safety director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences made a visit, according to the institute’s website. He addressed a meeting of the institute’s leadership with important &#x27;oral and written&#x27; instructions from China’s president, Xi Jinping, regarding &#x27;a complex and grave situation&#x27;. &quot;<p>&quot;In the first months of the pandemic, many Chinese scientists visited bat caves in Yunnan to see whether they could find a place where Covid may have originated.... 7 scientists attempting to visit were told the Moijang mine (known source of at least one Covid-like coronavirus) was closed, so they sampled bats in another abandoned copper mine nearby. On the first day of their work, police arrived, seized the samples and took them to their station, where they were interrogated and detained for 48 hours. Officers also went to their hotel and seized the samples they had collected from elsewhere. Even though the team had approval to test in the area, they were ordered to leave.

From a view inside the IC, if our intelligence and evidence supporting a lab leak theory was placed side-by-side with our intelligence and evidence pointing to a naturally occurring “spillover” theory, the lab leak side of the ledger would be long and overwhelming while the “spillover” side would be nearly empty.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oversight.house.gov&#x2F;release&#x2F;covid-origins-part-2-hearing-wrap-up-intelligence-community-officials-provide-further-evidence-that-covid-19-originated-in-a-wuhan-lab&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oversight.house.gov&#x2F;release&#x2F;covid-origins-part-2-hea...</a><p>The Furin cleavage site is one of the more compelling pieces of evidence. 1.5 years before the outbreak, the Wuhan Institute applied for a grant from Darpa to explore <i>mutating coronaviruses to make them more infectious to humans</i>, particularly through the addition of a Furin cleavage site. (Darpa declined to fund the research).<p>The Covid-19 virus is notable for being the only coronavirus to have a Furin cleavage site. Not only that, but it appears to be basically a <i>perfect mutation</i> that specifically modifies the 12 nucleotides necessary for the Furin site, without modifying other base pairs.<p>Here&#x27;s a quote from email excerpt included in the recent Congress hearing:<p>&quot;Before I left the office for the ball, I aligned nCoV with the 96% bat
CoV sequenced at WIV. Except for the RBD the S proteins are
essentially identical at the amino acid level – well all but the perfect
insertion of 12 nucleotides that adds the furin site. S2 is over its
whole length essentially identical. I really can’t think of a plausible
natural scenario where you get from the bat virus or one very similar
to it to nCoV where you insert exactly 4 amino acids 12 nucleotide
that all have to be added at the exact same time to gain this function
– that and you don’t change any other amino acid in S2? I just can’t
figure out how this gets accomplished in nature. Do the alignment
of the spikes at the amino acid level – its stunning. Of course, in the
lab it would be easy to generate the perfect 12 base insert that you
wanted.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oversight.house.gov&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2022&#x2F;01&#x2F;Letter-Re.-Feb-1-Emails-011122.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oversight.house.gov&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2022&#x2F;01&#x2F;Lette...</a></div><br/><div id="36283184" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36283184" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ricksunny</span><span>|</span><a href="#36282810">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36278243">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36283184">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36283184">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">(That latter quote is Tulane virologist Robert Garry.

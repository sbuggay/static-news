Then, either the device could automatically shut itself off after a period of inactivity or when the battery gets too low, or the user could click and hold the button for some number of seconds to turn the device off completely that way.</div><br/><div id="42875082" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42875082" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bbayer</span><span>|</span><a href="#42874180">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42874381">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42875082">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42875082">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Another alternative is to use ESP32&#x27;s deep sleep mode.

I haven’t had a chance to do anything hardware related for a long time, so it’s fun to think about hardware problems again.<p>On the topic of extending battery life mentioned in the article, one relatively straightforward thing to investigate is simply reducing the processor clock speed. Your application probably doesn’t need to run at full tilt. I think there is a function called setCpuFrequencyMhz — I think it only works with a few specific frequencies, but the lower the frequency you can pick (while still keeping up with your application’s needs), the less power the system should consume while awake.<p>Of course, you want to be putting the processor to sleep between updates anyways, and there is a trade off between sleeping more (which means running the processor faster so it can sleep sooner, “race to sleep”), versus the inefficiency caused by running a processor higher on the frequency&#x2F;efficiency curve, so there might be an optimal frequency that isn’t the lowest or the highest possible option. It’s something that would need to be measured.<p>Just some thoughts! It might not make a big difference if the processor is already sleeping most of the time, but I figured I would mention it as something to try.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42871155" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42871155" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wanderingmoose</span><span>|</span><a href="#42874180">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42876069">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42871155">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42871155">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">First of all -- awesome!<p>Second, if you aren&#x27;t aware or in case others are interested, the main dev from the xdrip project released a custom watch as well: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bluejay.website&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bluejay.website&#x2F;</a>

I learned a lot from open-source reference implementations from similar projects. I was able to get a lot of help while learning the software as well - in this case Fusion 360 and KiCad - though sometimes ChatGPT would invent a setting that should be there but isn&#x27;t.

E-ink might be even nicer.. but the price is a major stumbling block for most form factors.<p>The pebble might be a good option though, not only is the os now  open sourced but there is apparently someone trying to build new watches.<p>Once you get out of the hobby space, Hardware is a tough business, and there are a lot of people that would benefit from a solid solution that won’t be up for tinkering.<p>You might also find that there are Chinese manufacturers with white-box watches that might be running common chips like the nrf52840&#x2F;832. I certainly see a lot of apparently identical smartwatches around 30 dollars that are marketed under different brands.  Those might be a better direction if you are looking at a broad market.<p>OTOH, once you get away from the supportive and nurturing maker environment most of the fun will leak out, so depending on your motives, you might want to stick to your solution - which looks pretty great to me, even if it might not be as simple to scale production.<p>Best of luck with whatever direction you are looking at.  By the way, you might try a resin printer if you are going to be doing any production in house. For  larger multiples of small parts they are crazy fast and the finish is pretty great.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42872539" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42872539" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pigeons</span><span>|</span><a href="#42873261">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42872539">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42872539">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

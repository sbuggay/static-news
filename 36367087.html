It matters very much.<p>If my product is an email platform, and the &quot;API service&quot; accepted the &quot;send email&quot; request by enqueuing a &quot;send email&quot; message for the &quot;email sender service&quot;, if the &quot;email sender service&quot; is down, it absolutely does degrade the experience of API service users: &quot;your email is sent&quot; vs &quot;your email will be sent as soon as we&#x27;re able&quot; is two very different promises.<p>I think I&#x27;d like to work for the company who doesn&#x27;t care about the difference in those two promises. It&#x27;d be very easy to just implement the worst possible solution and provide the flakiest possible experience. Of course, I haven&#x27;t seemed to find those employers yet in my career. Everyone wants reliability and performance and everything else that sounds nice, all without specifying how the product should really behave. Where are the companies where I can implement these brilliant solutions without the downsides?</div><br/></div></div><div id="36368162" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36368162" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bullen</span><span>|</span><a href="#36367872">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36367782">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36368162">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36368162">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How this article does not mention SSE, comet or chunking escapes me.<p>What does their definition of event-driven really look like in practice.<p>Nobody has a clue.<p>Here is the ideal event driven system, it&#x27;s async-to-async: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tinspin&#x2F;rupy&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fuse">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tinspin&#x2F;rupy&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fuse</a><p>The example is not working because I had to shut down the services for multiple reasons, but the high level of it is that you use 4 (potentially different) threads to do one request&#x2F;response middle man transaction.<p>That way you have _zero_ io-wait or thread idling. I&#x27;m surprised nobody has copied this approach since I invented it 10 years ago. I understand why though you need your entire chain to be async and that means rewriting everything and that is a big risk when it&#x27;s hard to debug.<p>But if you succeed you can build something that is 10x perf&#x2F;watt than all other implementations.

When designing a new system, start with events.<p>This article advocates for event-driven systems, but elides their subtle but major downside over request-response: they make your control flow &quot;non-linear&quot; and very difficult to reason about and analyze statically. That is, when an event fires, what happens in response? Well, any bit of code in the entire system could be triggered by it.<p>Events are powerful, but very much a double-edged sword, similar to GOTO.</div><br/><div id="36368439" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36368439" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">erhaetherth</span><span>|</span><a href="#36367792">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36367949">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36368439">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36368439">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We have this problem at my work.

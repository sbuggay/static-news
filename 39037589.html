Governments have tools such as security regulations, migration policies, taxes which act as those disincentives.<p>For (B) to become commonplace, a government would be allowing a job function or industry to decline or disappear domestically, as has happened to Western manufacturing. I can&#x27;t think of many industries and job functions suitable for remote work that a country in 2024 would want to cause the decline of. Western countries in particular have been pushing &quot;critical infrastructure&quot; regulations and supply chain regulations that generally oppose offshoring and domestic decline of a wide range of industries--energy, healthcare, food distribution, etc. For example, a supermarket chain is becoming increasingly restricted from conducting actions such as outsourcing their logistics ICT systems to another country to host and support.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39038794" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39038794" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ozim</span><span>|</span><a href="#39037923">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39038411">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39038554">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39038507">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39038794">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39038794">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Reducing costs by hiring in other countries is not as easy as it seems.<p>In reality there is an opportunity to hire wider pool of full time applicants in US because now you can offer even 1 day a week in the office instead of 5 or doing 1 day a month.<p>If I have to consider company that is 2h driving away - one way - and be there 5 days a week, that is a deal breaker.<p>Doing that once a week is still much more manageable and opens up opportunities for employees and employers as well.

As an engineer and engineering leader, I cannot maintain focus to code, sit in meetings, and a variety of other tasks for more than 2-3 hours without a break.  It is good to get up, move around, catch up on the news, etc.  Taking appropriate breaks and conducting self care gives my mind an opportunity to decompress, allowing me to come back to work more focused and productive.  Very long sessions (5+ hours) without a break tend to run into a wall - I may still be doing work, but the quality drops precipitously.  Sometimes, I can raise my productivity by distracting myself with home chores (e.g. laundry).  Sometimes, I find a quick dip into the news or a catchup on our friend group&#x27;s discord server productive.  This may not be the same for all of us, but studies have repeatedly shown breaks improve productivity for most individuals.  Being outside the office, I find it much more convenient to take a productive break without having other coworkers distracting me.  Looking over studies and suggestions, it seems interesting to me that tasks like meditation, power naps, small chores, snacks, listening to music, and interacting with pets are much more easily conducted in the comfort of our homes.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learningcenter.unc.edu&#x2F;tips-and-tools&#x2F;taking-breaks&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learningcenter.unc.edu&#x2F;tips-and-tools&#x2F;taking-breaks&#x2F;</a>

When you hire a national of a foreign country, in general, you subject yourself to the jurisdiction of the courts of that country for labor related disputes.<p>I am not sure if a clause in an employment contract stating that the agreement is governed by U.S. law would be accepted by a local court; and even if it did, in litigation, you&#x27;d most likely have to represent yourself before the local court to make that objection.)</div><br/><div id="39039056" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39039056" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">redcobra762</span><span>|</span><a href="#39038511">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39038880">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39038760">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39039056">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39039056">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You don’t fire contractors, their contract just ends.

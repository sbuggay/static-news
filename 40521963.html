Dealing with death is never easy.  The thing I miss most about my wife is the depth of emotional connection; she knew everything about me being very deeply in love with me and everything I did really mattered to her.  It has taken me nearly 10 years to build a network of friends who can give me comparable levels of socialization and attention; I have about two dozen very close friends (both male and female) across the world now and it’s finally enough to replace the hole in my life I had which my wife used to fill.<p>I can see why Feynman became sexually promiscuous afterwards, undoubtedly to numb the pain of losing his wife; seduction allowed him to have a form of that connection, albeit without the depth and love of what he had with his wife.

God, I love this quote.  It describes me to a T in my 20s (except replace &quot;calculus&quot; with &quot;programming&quot;).  Everyone that I dated complained similarly.  I used to drag that Bjarne Stroustrup tome &quot;The C++ Programming Language&quot; everywhere I went.  I couldn&#x27;t get enough of that C++ bible at the time.  His writing style really helped to open my mind to become a better programmer.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40522508" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40522508" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jebarker</span><span>|</span><a href="#40522273">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40522410">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40532569">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40532539">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40522508">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40522508">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">After reading lots of biographical material on Feynman it seems like he was a very loving father and husband (especially to his first wife) but obviously devoted to physics.

You don&#x27;t have to feel whatever anyone else thinks you should feel. It feels cliche that it gets better in time, in my experience tho it does. I&#x27;m sorry your dad and family is going thru that. Oddly I found Cyberpunk 2077 to be therapeutic on coming to terms with that situation. In the game you play a character who essentially has a terminal disease, there are a lot of moments in the game that rang very true to the emotions I experienced.<p>When your dad eventually departs, you are allowed to feel anything.

I hope you get to have as much of the remaining time together as possible.<p>What&#x27;s odd is that I still don&#x27;t feel the need to look at photos of him. Like, no need whatsoever. I don&#x27;t have a photo of my late dad on the wall, even though we had a truly excellent father-son relationship with a lot of warmth. The true memory of him resides in my head; and what&#x27;s more, I notice myself replicating his <i>exact</i> body language at times. Explicitly realizing this always feels funny, almost like I want to express gratitude to him for &quot;inheriting&quot; those movements to me :). I think the bonds still hold strong, and they forever will, but, oddly, there&#x27;s no need whatsoever to visualize it with a photo. It&#x27;s simply much deeper than that.<p>On another side, I often miss the ability to ask my dad &quot;factual&quot;, practical questions. E.g. -- because he was a construction engineer -- how to do some specific thing in grandpa&#x27;s house renovations; how to position a beam, etc. During the first months after his death, this was a common recurring thought: I&#x27;m stuck while building something, but &quot;hey, I&#x27;ll just ask dad tomorrow how to do it right; yeah, I&#x27;ll just call him&quot; -- following by &quot;oh, I forgot I can&#x27;t&quot;. After this, there was always an interesting feeling of emptiness or standstill -- <i>not sadness</i>, just a really deep understanding that, no matter what, life moves on. And I still get to live mine. I actually came to enjoy those moments of emptiness.<p>Thanks for sharing your story, it is very moving. Grief will have different stages; to me, it has mostly been really deep introspection.

(He also flat-out lied to women to get them to sleep with him, which is also not OK.)<p>I think it&#x27;s important to distinguish these situations because I think there are a lot of people going through a lot of emotional pain because they believe that any sex outside of a long-term monogamous relationship is morally questionable, and it&#x27;s not.  The challenge is that insuring that all parties have given informed consent is hard, but the emotional toll of throwing in the towel on this can be pretty high, so I think it can be an effort worth making.

Put another way, there is a temporal degree of respect for the dead, i.e. can you and for how long put the wishes of the dead above those of the living.<p>Of course, for immediate death, as others have noted, there are plenty of &quot;stakeholders&quot;, family members, etc. who have direct interest in the wishes of the dead being upheld (not having their communications exposed, as others have noted). These needs must be considered, but eventually those grandchildren will also themselves pass, and those stakes will have also vanished.<p>Even for immediate death, the wishes of the dead can be invalid and ir-respected, such as in the case of a suicide bomber or a recently deceased captor&#x2F;dictator.<p>On the flip side, for those dead (tens of) thousands of years, we engage in a practice known as archeology, that I think you would have a hard time arguing the opposite - the information we glean from their table scraps is too valuable to worry about their death wishes, assuming they had any.<p>In the great in-between, then, the question is, whose wishes matter more? Those of the deceased or those of the living. Usually, those of the living. And it is generally in our interest that we not disturb the dead too much, because at least we would like to live in a society that continues to grow, and does not need to disturb them (too much), respect our own wishes, etc. But ultimately, once it can be said it no longer harms any living, or any <i>future</i> living, then the desires of the living trump the desires of the deceased.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40528168" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40528168" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">multjoy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40522237">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40523774">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40524078">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40522492">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40528168">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40528168">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Because you are dead.

And not just beautiful, but true, I think.<p>I&#x27;ve been working through thoughts about my dead mother the past few months, in concert with a new partner in my life who also lost her mother. We&#x27;ve been working through some thoughts... somewhat related to an information-theoretic view of death. Here&#x27;s an excerpt of something I wrote on the topic[1] in 2018:<p>&gt; [snip] So anyhow, as I’m sitting in on this session [about IETF multistakeholder internet governance], and I’m realizing that what we’re really trying to figure out with internet governance is how to govern a complex system. So it’s perhaps less internet governance, but rather network governance. And so what patterns have we seen in other systems, that deals with this challenge of creating space for new participants, while honouring the history of past participants?<p>&gt; And this lead to some interesting thoughts on the big pattern that often goes unspoken: Death.<p>&gt; ### DEATH IS HEGEMONIC.<p>&gt; It may sound funny to describe death as a pattern. We often talk about it like it’s this fact of existence. And it might as well be. It’s omnipresent. Pretty much every living thing we know of, dies. It has prevailed in all living networks, through countless iterations. Death is hegemonic.<p>&gt; But what about death might be selected for? How does it benefit the network? Perhaps it’s best to imagine this first at the scale of individual personal relationships. That’s simpler, and I believe the reasoning is portable up to larger social scales.<p>&gt; Imagine how we might have moved on from Newtonian physics if that intellectual heavy-weight Newton were still alive and influential within the network. One could imagine that it might be difficult. Newton’s thinking was clever, but we also understand it to be misguided by today’s measure. In a world without death, new ideas would have to grapple and contend not just with static ideas and information, but with the dynamic and increasingly stubborn minds that birthed them. (This [stubbornness and confidence](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdfs.semanticscholar.org&#x2F;c3ef&#x2F;2811b280c069c6a99d66e4eee34233e310f7.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdfs.semanticscholar.org&#x2F;c3ef&#x2F;2811b280c069c6a99d66e4...</a>) of age, is perhaps another selected pattern, with it’s own subtle network rationale, but I digress.)<p>&gt; Instead, the mind of an organism dies, and leaves information scattered throughout the human network in the form of static reference — in the minds of family and peers, in blog posts and newspaper articles, in books and distorted recollections.<p>&gt; So how would one describe the pattern of death? Through an unsentimental network lens, we could perhaps think about it as a data compression or noise reduction tactic of the larger evolving system. Or at a more human scale, we could imagine it as a process by which organisms go from the role of __living dynamic actors__ to become __static references__.<p>&gt; While the Newton example is on a worldly stage, there’s perhaps another example that’s more on the personal level. You can imagine this same dynamic playing in the relations between parents and children. The death of a parent, tragic as it is, is an opportunity for this complex character to move from __actor__ to __reference__ in the minds of their children. This memory is now open to healthy reinterpretation, which perhaps gives their ideas and actions more meaning than when they were alive. A static reference of a human, whether it’s a memory or a book or an article, becomes a bare skeleton picked clean, on which to hang new ideas and emotions and reflections.<p>&gt; After death, what remains is an abstraction — a simplification of the human who once was. But this abstraction can be re-imagined and built upon by the folks who follow.<p>&gt; And maybe this is healthy. Maybe this makes for healthy societies, with the right balance of new imaginings and old wisdoms on which to hang them.<p>I have a hard time with death. I don&#x27;t think of my mother as much as I&#x27;d like. But in the past few weeks, I&#x27;ve started writing to her in an empty group chat that goes to no one. I&#x27;ve been going through old emails and replying to all the messages I never responded to, which have previously been the source of a lot of shame.<p>And it&#x27;s really helping me. It&#x27;s like she&#x27;s continuing to grow with me, and me with her. And not just that, but it&#x27;s helping me override the version of her (the broken versions, the sick versions) that overrepresent my recollections of her in the months before her death.<p>In writing and communing with her, even in her absence, my relationship with her in growing, and she is growing too. And she&#x27;s more alive in my conversations with my living family. And I&#x27;m reflecting my daily interactions and decisions through her consideration. It&#x27;s very strange. I feel like I&#x27;ve been reintroduced to my mother.<p>And it&#x27;s also leading me to odd thoughts. Is every departure or absence of the true and active physical form (not just in death) a chance to consider someone like this. Can I share secret thoughts with a new love, with an imagined version of them, since the flesh-and-blood version of them would be scared of my sharing such things with them? Can I treat the living as dead in some ways, to shape them in my mind just as much as I might shape them later in the real world? Is this what we&#x27;re always doing implicitly, when we build models of one another an empathize and imagine what they might do, in the spaces between when we have access to them? And what might we be losing in the world when we never have these absences, when we are never disconnected, never far enough away to grow alongside the imagined version of our loved ones, rather than trying to grow only with the actual biological one?<p>Anyhow, thanks for hearing me out on these thoughts. I will imagine a reader as entertained and grateful, until you choose to reveal yourself otherwise &lt;3<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@patcon&#x2F;reflections-on-the-evolved-pattern-of-death-and-what-it-might-mean-for-governance-7dfdd0df9f09" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@patcon&#x2F;reflections-on-the-evolved-patter...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40522020" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40522020" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sophoskiaskile</span><span>|</span><a href="#40523683">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40523574">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40522020">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40522020">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s beautiful :))</div><br/></div></div><div id="40523574" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40523574" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hsuduebc2</span><span>|</span><a href="#40522020">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40523574">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40523574">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s hard.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

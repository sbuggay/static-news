Or why it would be reasonable to consider as a <i>baseline</i>.<p>For Safari: we’re currently at 16.4 (March 2023); does “two major versions” mean from Safari 15 (September 2021), or from Safari 16.3 (January 2023)? I’m going to guess 16.3.<p>For Firefox: so this just ignores Firefox ESR? It’s at 102.11.0, while regular is at 113.0. (That is, it’s at nine versions&#x2F;nine months ago.)<p>For everyone else: you know that’s permanently as little as about five weeks ago, right? Put bluntly: that’s stupid, nothing like what a baseline should be.<p>By the sound of it, this may be genuinely ignoring 25–35% of users, and declaring features “baseline” not supported by the browsers used by <i>fully 15–25% of users</i>. (Numbers taken from quick estimation based on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caniuse.com&#x2F;usage-table" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caniuse.com&#x2F;usage-table</a> which mostly uses StatCounter’s woefully misleading and wrong numbers because I’m lazy, but I think my error bars are large enough that they’d hold up to more rigorous calculation using other data sets too.)<p>My only hope here is that “two major versions” means Safari 15. Then all up it’d mean roughly “since September 1–2 years ago” rather than “mostly 5–10 weeks ago”, and that 15–25% would drop to under 5% for most features in the delta, half by simple coincidence.<p>(Aside: I really wish browser makers would switch to some form of calendar versioning, e.g. YY.MM. There was a great opportunity about now when Firefox caught up to Chromium due to a slightly faster cadence.)</div><br/><div id="35913574" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35913574" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">atopal</span><span>|</span><a href="#35910666">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35910909">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35913574">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35913574">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Looking at browser usage for the last two major versions is misleading.

It’s bumping its “major” number <i>once</i> per year, whereas Chromium and Firefox are bumping theirs <i>10–12 times</i> per year. Unless they have radically different deployment strategies, “major versions” is clearly useless as a consistent concept across browsers. But despite Safari being tied to the OS version, when you take everything together (hardware support for their OSes, OS upgrade frequency) it’s only a little different, nowhere near the 10× difference in importance of a “major version”.<p>All up, I say “two major versions” is obviously a completely unsuitable definition to use. It <i>needs</i> to treat Safari differently, e.g. “two major versions of Safari and twelve major versions of all other browsers” (which would catch Firefox ESR) or “thirteen months of browser support” (which would be less for Safari most of the time, but really, consider the deployment cadence and it’s probably not so different, though maybe you’d bump it to fourteen or fifteen months, I dunno).</div><br/><div id="35911735" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35911735" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">waboremo</span><span>|</span><a href="#35910666">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35911099">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35911214">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35911735">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35911735">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Major versions isn&#x27;t a useless consistent concept because it&#x27;s the strategy all browser developers use to determine when major features are added (vs bug&#x2F;security fixes).

We have a baseline of what features as developers we can now implement without worrying about which browser version supports this or that.

Everyone has to tip-tow through talking to Apple about specs because they&#x27;ll just tank anything that doesn&#x27;t go their way.<p>&quot;reasonable&quot; - The first step in launching features is to tell people, write an explainer at a public endpoint, start prototyping, launch origin trials, widen review&#x2F;seek signals from other vendors.

The origin trials allow for end-user experimentation, with a buy in that makes it obvious to users there&#x27;s not commitment to the feature actually shipping; a trial is a trial is a trial.<p>&quot;upstream-first&quot; - The guidelines I shared for launching features is to literally start incubating with a public spec.

Incubating with use case&#x2F;scenarios&#x2F;explainer. Creating a Chrome Status entry. Announcing to blink-dev. All before any actual work happens. Incredible visibility.<p>&quot;with more safeguards than almost everyone else on the planet&quot; - I can&#x27;t think of a single other company with anywhere near this level of maturity about iterating forwards.<p>&gt; <i>Google&#x27;s weapon of monopoly is change. They have the manpower to churn the &quot;standard&quot; more than anyone else and modify their browser accordingly,</i><p>If this were a problem, wouldn&#x27;t we see the old web be broken? Do we see that problem? The only instances I&#x27;m aware of the web breaking in the past decade or so is Apple shipping Intelligent Tracking Protection, which they had to largely roll back &amp; create allowlists around to allow the web to keep working. Google is now spearheading the effort to make actual specifications to for how we can do similar, but with, you know, actual specs, &amp; just just waving the magic wand &amp; changing things unannounced overnight.<p>&gt; <i>while at the same time spreading propaganda about using features only their browser (now) has,</i><p>The amount of tech that other browsers have adopted from Google is also notably high too. Since Google&#x27;s open source, heck yes it&#x27;s great that so many others can re-use &amp; leverage the WebRTC stack Google was core to developing. Heck yes it&#x27;s great that Google went off &amp; built incredible software WebGL implementations in ANGLE, which again everyone else also uses now.<p>There just doesn&#x27;t seem to be a real problem here. We don&#x27;t have the IE vs Netscape web, where huge amounts of sites just don&#x27;t work &amp; use fundamentally different technologies. Things seem to mostly work. Most of these techs being built seem to make sense &amp; be helpful &amp; good. They&#x27;re things we should have.<p>What is the propoganda Google is spinning here? Where do they haze the competition? If anything I see it as exactly the opposite. Google isn&#x27;t negatively campaigning. But we see Apple then a week latter Mozilla make a big stink about how proud they are not to be implementing Web MIDI, or Web USB, which can be such direct &amp; competent ways for users to make user of their devices. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;apple-declined-to-implement-16-web-apis-in-safari-due-to-privacy-concerns&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;apple-declined-to-implement-16...</a><p>&gt; <i>Oh for fucks&#x27; sake...that essentially controls the entire Internet. </i><p>This is the weirdest strangest version of control I&#x27;ve ever seen.

It seems based in bias, in personal Fear Uncertainty and Doubt. I do think there&#x27;s real problems with Google as a company, and there are real problems. But this company&#x27;s success is directly coupled to the web. If you look at blink-dev for real, it&#x27;s incredibly easy to see the truth of what Google does for the web. They try to take care of it. They try to help. The hypermedium we have has indeed made them big and strong, but the only way for them to stay big &amp; strong is to keep the web from going bad, to keep it a good medium.

Right off the bat, Google did say they wanted to try to open up the capabilities to other sites. They wanted to make generic web technology where sites could safely embed content in a &quot;search carousel&quot;, without AMP. But AMP stuck around for years as the only way to do that.<p>The third AMP issue is what they kept wanting to make Google the first party host of a lot of this stuff, again crying that it was the only way they felt sure users would have fast experiences. And again, they said they hoped to have web specs to let them not have to do this in the future, coupled with the above search carousel&#x2F;packaged site ideas. Which again was just incredibly slow to mature.<p>I think AMP really polarized people stronger than it should have. It wasn&#x27;t great. And worse, it was one of the rare times we&#x27;ve seen Google really try to play at picking favorites; they <i>said</i> they were going to open things up so others could also have similar benefits without being AMP, but it was incredibly slow to mature (in part because the standards development for WebPackage has gone soo slow). But they really did tackle real issues &amp; did try to make things better; they really did have a very fast loading, lower jank page system that sites could quickly build with &amp; get consistent good results from. Still, there were so many political land mines they created with this attempt; I want to recognize there are real interests here, but absolutely, in the end, this was an incredibly damaging bad experience.<p>Still, I think there&#x27;s an Occam&#x27;s Razer view here. Either Google is an incredibly crafty top-down well-planned mastermind, who has incredibly complex schemes to &quot;take over&quot; the web. Or it&#x27;s just a variety of different attempts to try to make things better, different organizational fiefs within a huge entity, and sometimes people are a little short-sighted about what a lightning rod their work might become. Yes: I think AMP is a pretty exceedingly bold &amp; indeed misguided attempt, a huge lightning road for understandable frustration. But <i>it&#x27;s 7 years old now,</i> and we haven&#x27;t seen this kind of balderdashery since. Google isn&#x27;t pushing AMP like they were, they&#x27;re fine with it being a sparsely adopted toolkit, most of the teams have moved on, and we don&#x27;t see a lot of similar picking favorites plays since. Some of WebPackage has shipped &amp; we can do a lot of cool things now that AMP dreamed up, with no Google involved.</div><br/><div id="35913405" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35913405" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vasco</span><span>|</span><a href="#35911719">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912792">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912699">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35913405">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35913405">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s lawsuit discovery that uncovered that Google actively throttled non-AMP search results: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searchengineland.com&#x2F;google-throttled-amp-page-speeds-created-format-to-hamper-header-bidding-antitrust-complaint-claims-375466" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searchengineland.com&#x2F;google-throttled-amp-page-speed...</a><p>Must be interesting to defend trillion dollar megacorps on the internet.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35912699" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35912699" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">slushh</span><span>|</span><a href="#35911719">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35911827">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912203">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35912699">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35912699">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;I&#x27;d be so much more interested in safe &amp; stable &amp; supported if there were more players out there also trying to push forward &amp; try new web specs.<p>Google is pushing forward to remove the number of players. The more features have to be implemented the less players are able to afford the number of developers that are needed to keep up.<p>The silly thing is that Google is trying to turn the browser into an application platform. To a certain extend that&#x27;s justified but with Java, they already have such a platform, but they chose to break the compatibility of the byte code. If they realign with the java byte code, there would be no need to push features in browsers. Developers could ship libraries for whatever they need on the Java platform.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35912203" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35912203" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">parasti</span><span>|</span><a href="#35911719">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912928">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35912203">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35912203">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This seems nice on the surface, but in reality I will be scrolling further down to find if the browser I care about supports the feature.

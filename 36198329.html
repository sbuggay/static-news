On here I speak only for myself, but a couple points I want to add.<p>1) EFF has only filed one IPR ever, (linked in the post), against Personal Audio, to invalidate a patent asserted against podcasting. This was crowd-funded by hundreds of people. It required years of litigation beyond the IPR process itself.<p>2) Patent challenges should be open to all. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with a &quot;for profit&quot; org challenging a government monopoly - it&#x27;s a public benefit. A good patent will often hold up (many do), a wrongly granted one will usually go down.<p>Please read the examples in the post of (very) small businesses, individuals, and nonprofits (Wikimedia) who were protected because <i>another</i> organization, often a for-profit, filed a successful IPR.<p>It&#x27;s truly upside down world  when USPTO is concerned its very limited monopoly-challenging services are being overused by &quot;for-profits&quot; that file &quot;serial&quot; petitions. In my career I have analyzed hundreds of shell companies that have (each!) sent out dozens or hundreds of threat letters and lawsuits demanding patent royalty payments (patent trolls). Guess what? They&#x27;re ALL for-profit. They ALL file serial petitions with the hopes of a fast payout.<p>We have limited means to challenge this extortionate business model, and now USPTO is trying to drastically limit one of the best options. I hope they reconsider, and we ask for your support.<p>Thanks to all and I appreciate the discussion here.</div><br/><div id="36203417" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36203417" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Nezteb</span><span>|</span><a href="#36199974">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36205310">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36203417">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36203417">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Please set up a petition with <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;resist.bot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;resist.bot</a> as well!</div><br/><div id="36206073" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36206073" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">0xDEF</span><span>|</span><a href="#36199974">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36203417">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36205310">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36206073">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36206073">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Interesting.

However, I found myself in favor of this change, and honestly questioning the EFF&#x27;s motives given how strong and personal (speaking specifically to the <i>EFF&#x27;s</i> ability to challenge patents, not a generic third party) your expressed opinions were in this piece.<p>I am very sympathetic to the argument that Unified Patents and other folks who offer &quot;IPR insurance&quot; now can&#x27;t fight bad patents, but hopefully if the rules pass they will be able to convert to either a non-profit or a financing model that allows them to sidestep this rule.<p>Also, are you aware of the argument in favor of this change?  In a recent case, a patent troll used an IPR claim to attempt to extort a patent owner when that patent was going through active litigation.  Limiting IPRs from for-profit entities not practicing in the field (also a requirement in the rule change) when small companies are actively suing someone else honestly sounds reasonable in light of this.

The alleged &quot;extortion&quot; here is that VLSI, a non-practicing entity, I believe backed by a hedge fund, would lose their 20-year government monopoly and no longer be able to seek billions of dollars in court.<p>I have no idea who or what OpenSky is, and I don&#x27;t weigh in on huge corporate cases like VLSI v. Intel where everyone has plenty of money for their own representation.<p>But it&#x27;s really wild to me that this alleged &quot;abuse&quot; (that could lead to the loss of... a patent) immediately got the attention of officials, who are taking rapid action. Yet there are <i>thousands</i> of victims of patent troll extortion every year. These extortions are real, and documented, and hurt businesses that are much much smaller than VLSI. (and operate actual businesses, which AFAIK VLSI does not).<p>But here&#x27;s the value proposition: It&#x27;s just not wrong to challenge a government subsidy or monopoly. Period. Especially on computer software and hardware, because they&#x27;re often wrongly granted.<p>Even if you accept that the OpenSky situation is the moral equivalent of patent trolling (I absolutely do not), it&#x27;s happened to patent owners ONE time. (Maybe a few others, but it&#x27;s a count-on-your-fingers thing).

None of them took it seriously. So he went and started a company with his new patent and became successful. Then other companies (Bosch specifically) tried to rip his tech off after they saw how effective it is, and he got to sue them and win.<p>Also, their patents are about to or have already expired (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Tools&#x2F;comments&#x2F;p6bhhb&#x2F;so_are_the_sawstop_patents_really_about_to_expire&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Tools&#x2F;comments&#x2F;p6bhhb&#x2F;so_are_the_sa...</a>)<p>Sounds like the 20 years gave him just enough time to:<p>1. Attempt to license the product and fail
2. Create a company
3. Market the company &#x2F; product effectively
4.

I think 5 years would&#x27;ve been far too short for him. He would&#x27;ve been squashed. There would&#x27;ve been no motivation for companies to license his tech or buy out his company. They would&#x27;ve just waited 5 measly years and then stomped him.<p>Now. If this was software, this whole thing would&#x27;ve played out in what? 5 years? 10 tops?

A company might have many trials going on at once, of greater or lesser costs, but revenue is an aggregation of everything over a year.  A company with $100 million in revenue and 10 trials ongoing and a company with a $1 billion in revenue and 10 trials ongoing would possibly lead one to specific conclusions, but even when it&#x27;s broken down that much it doesn&#x27;t really mean anything for the examples presented, because the mean cost of the trials that the company in question has ongoing could be entirely different.  The 10 trials the $100 million revenue company is administering could average $1 million, and the 10 trials the $1 billion company is administering could cost 80 million each, by nature of the types of drugs they and markets they are aiming for.<p>It could also be that there&#x27;s lots of low cost trials around $20 million, but slightly less than half of the trials that are done are <i>very</i> expensive, and 4-5 times the cost.  This would be more obvious if there were values for bot mean and median, instead of just median.<p>The looser the data, the less you can actually infer. Any time someone tells me the <i>median</i> cost for something across an <i>entire industry</i>, my immediate reaction is to wonder what that means, not assume I actually know what it means, because it&#x27;s far too little data to really know.  How many trials are done in a year on average?  How many a year do companies average based on revenue?  Or simple, what&#x27;s the actual amount spent on trials compared to revenue, and over how many years are those trials run?  Is yearly cost of a trial really a good indicator, if trials take 5-10 years to run, so a failed one results in not just loss of money spent but opportunity cost over many years?<p>Note: If you provided a reference for that median number I would have actually looked it up to see if it made sense to me, or if I had additional questions about how they went about their measurements.

I&#x27;m not pro-pharma, I&#x27;m just pro-informed reasoning.<p>That said, the article you reference is a bit more nuanced than your take.  By the studies they&#x27;re citing, while the trials <i>for drugs that were approved</i> have a median cost of $19 million, they are clear to outline that it does cost a lot to develop a new drug:<p><i>The $19 million median figure represents less than one percent of the average total cost of developing a new drug, which in recent years has been estimated at between $2 to $3 billion.<p>âThe cost of generating this fundamental scientific information is surprisingly low given the total cost of drug development and the high price tags on many drugs,â says study senior author G. Caleb Alexander, MD, MS, associate professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Bloomberg School.</i><p>So, while studies may not be a large cost center for new drug development, they state that new drugs are very costly to develop.  Or maybe studies are costly, and it&#x27;s just that it takes very many of them until one shows success.  Ten concurrent studies on ten variations of a drug to look for something promising would cost ten times the amount, and there&#x27;s still no guarantee that any one study will end in a positive outcome.<p>If we&#x27;re talking about the justification for patents for pharma companies, it seems like we should focus on the &quot;total cost to develop a new drug is estimated at $2 to $3 billion&quot; part and not the &quot;$19 million median cost to run a study&quot; part[1], which as I noted is lacked enough context to know exactly how much it relates to drug development cost.<p>That said, I&#x27;m not sure the total cost number referenced above is accurate (to my taste) either.  How much of that is advertising?  How much of that is kickbacks and trips and drug rep lunches and free samples to doctors? I&#x27;m not sure because I don&#x27;t have access to the full paper, so I&#x27;m not sure what their methodology includes. It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me to learn that a few &quot;blockbuster&quot; drugs had 80% of the cost in massive advertising and good-will pushes to seed the public consciousness about them so they could make more money in the end, so I&#x27;m really skeptical that $2 to $3 billion is an accurate indication of drug development cost just as much as I&#x27;m skeptical that a $19 million median trial cost equates directly to the drug development cost in a way that&#x27;s obvious from that number alone.<p>1: Referenced and linked in JLU article, but here&#x27;s the link as well: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0167629616000291" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S01676...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36200132" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36200132" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rudyfink</span><span>|</span><a href="#36198749">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36199631">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36200756">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36199296">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36200132">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36200132">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it takes 5 years (or more) to both get a patent and litigate it though any appeal.

We get a bunch of startups attempting to push one drug through--succeed and it&#x27;s a big payoff for it&#x27;s investors, fail and they lose their investment.  It&#x27;s actually a bad bet for investors so it moves money from overly optimistic investors to the public.<p>We do have problems elsewhere in the system, though:<p>1)  Drug ads.  They should be pretty much nuked from orbit.  Drugs are a medical decision, any promotion activities should be directed at doctors, not patients.  I would make an exception for drugs that radically improve treatment for something patients might have considered something they just have to live with and not told their doctors about.  (I have Viagra in mind here--and that&#x27;s the only one that comes to mind.)  In such a case I would only permit &quot;there is a new treatment for X, talk to your doctor&quot;, no names of either the drug or the company.<p>2)  Dodgy approval decisions.  The recent Alzheimer&#x27;s drug comes to mind.<p>3)  Drug companies should not be able to find out what doctors prescribe.  That creates a conflict of interest.<p>4)  I question whether drug makers should even be allowed to do the phase III testing at all.  That puts the researchers in a position where a no decision could be bad for them down the road.<p>On the flip side, I think we could benefit from having an appears-to-work type of approval.  It would require extensive real-world use data (either from foreign use or like what we have seen with marijuana being widely used for chemotherapy nausea) but not the usual approval process.  Obviously, no patents, but all companies selling it would be required to put some specified percent of sales into a pool used to fund more research.  (And I wouldn&#x27;t mind doing something like that for all drugs, albeit at a lower percentage.  Every drug has say a 5% tax that goes into a FDA account for that drug.  When there&#x27;s enough money in the account to fund useful research about it the FDA does so.  Common off-label uses would be prime candidates for such studies.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="36200427" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36200427" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kelnos</span><span>|</span><a href="#36198749">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36199697">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36203459">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36200938">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36200427">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36200427">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That public funding has to come from somewhere, though, to the tune of quite a few billions of dollars.

An acquaintance of mine once worked for a startup where the team was diverted from product development to ideation on patentable processes. The focus was less on innovation and more on creating a unique claim to secure funding, which I find misguided.<p>The VC, instead of nurturing the inventive process, largely contributed to the crafting of a patent application. The objective was to design it in such a way that it was cryptic and as widely applicable as possible. Despite its questionable practices, the patent was approved, leading to the subsequent funding of the startup.<p>However, the market didn&#x27;t respond well to the idea, necessitating a pivot. Meanwhile, there were other companies independently pursuing similar ideas. They could have invested significant time and resources, unaware that they were infringing on an existing patent. It&#x27;s a speculative guess, but I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the VC fund is vigilantly searching for successful implementations of the patented idea, ready to initiate lawsuits for patent infringement.

Itâs a security dongle that can execute arbitrary programs.

IPRs are expensive, so this is an easy way to either drive a small entity bankrupt during a high-stakes lawsuit or extort a payout.<p>The EFF isn&#x27;t a for-profit entity, so if they have problems with this rule, it might mean that they are so closely connected to one or more for-profit companies that they are treated as for-profit.

The article here isn&#x27;t about generic third parties.  It&#x27;s about the EFF.  This rule change also came after someone essentially tried to use an IPR to extort VLSI technology and Intel.  The lack of recognition of that extortion and the corresponding limitations on these rules suggests to me that the EFF is not being entirely forthright here.<p>&gt; I mean, I don&#x27;t want to be rude here, but it feels like &quot;I&#x27;ve read the changes, I don&#x27;t think they apply to EFF, so I guess the only explanation is that EFF is corrupt&quot;, seems a bit of a jump, compared to the simpler explanation that EFF does believe its process to be affected, as argued by the OP link.<p>Holy strawman batman.  Read the second paragraph.<p>Also, the rule change is in English.  You can actually <i>read</i> the rule change and you will realize that it&#x27;s a lot more narrow than the EFF is suggesting.  In particular, the new rules only limit IPRs for (a) for-profit companies (b) not currently engaged in litigation on patents that are in litigation (c) where said for-profit company is not in that field.  All 3 of those have to be satisfied for your IPR to be tossed under those rules.  Since the EFF is a non-profit, they should really have no problem with this.<p>If we were to take the EFF&#x27;s words at face value that this rule change applies specifically to the <i>EFF</i>&#x27;s ability to fight bad patents, the only real conclusion we can draw is that some of the EFF&#x27;s funding comes from for-profit companies who want specific patents struck down (invalidating (a) above) or want the EFF to hurt their competitors, which would, in fact, be suggestive of corruption.  The other conditions certainly don&#x27;t apply to the EFF.<p>So that leaves us with one of two alternatives:<p>1.

So maybe new CPUs with some on-die memory with their own channels + 2 classical channels is more likely. But then more on-die L3 or L4 cache (e.g. X3D) is probably more useful then on-die RAM.

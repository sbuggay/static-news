Building a competitive large airliner requires a huge industrial base.  And since it&#x27;s so safety-critical, it takes a lot of time and expertise to build the reputation needed to unseat the incumbents.  China has an aircraft manufacturer, but time will tell if it goes anywhere, since they don&#x27;t exactly have a reputation for high quality.  Russia has built many large aircraft in their Soviet days, but their industrial base has eroded so they probably just don&#x27;t have the capacity to build competitively-priced aircraft in volume now, plus they&#x27;re not well-liked by most countries that would want airliners anyway.  Japan might be able to do it, but just isn&#x27;t geared up for building lots of large aircraft so it would be a huge investment to build such an industry almost from scratch.<p>Fuel efficiency isn&#x27;t a factor because building an airliner doesn&#x27;t involve building engines for that airliner, and engines determine an aircraft&#x27;s fuel economy for the most part.  Boeing and Airbus don&#x27;t make jet engines: those are all made by Rolls-Royce, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and GE.</div><br/><div id="40943794" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40943794" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sofixa</span><span>|</span><a href="#40943544">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40943645">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40943704">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40943794">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40943794">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Russia has built many large aircraft in their Soviet days, but their industrial base has eroded so they probably just don&#x27;t have the capacity to build competitively-priced aircraft in volume now, plus they&#x27;re not well-liked by most countries that would want airliners anyway<p>Russia did design and build a few designs recently - SSJ-100, MS-21, Tu-204&#x2F;214. Almost all of them used Western parts (such as engines&#x2F;avionics) to speed the process up because Russian manufacturers are a few decades behind in some critical parts (like engine efficiency). That being said, they&#x27;re currently trying to ramp up production on a domestic only Tu-204&#x2F;214 version, but it&#x27;s slow, probably quite expensive, and super inefficient.<p>&gt; Japan might be able to do it, but just isn&#x27;t geared up for building lots of large aircraft so it would be a huge investment to build such an industry almost from scratch.<p>Mitsubishi had a regional jet design in progress, the SpaceJet, which got cancelled after a few billion in R&amp;D and years in delays.<p>&gt; Fuel efficiency isn&#x27;t a factor because building an airliner doesn&#x27;t involve building engines for that airliner, and engines determine an aircraft&#x27;s fuel economy for the most part. Boeing and Airbus don&#x27;t make jet engines: those are all made by Rolls-Royce, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and GE.<p>Fuel efficiency is a major factor. Outside of countries big enough to prop up a domestic airliner industry with enough spare cash to compensate for inefficiency (which is a list of 1 country, China), nobody will buy a jet which is less efficient than an alternative. Airline margins are razor thin.<p>And not everyone can buy an engine from Rolls-Royce, GE&#x2F;CFM(their joint venture with Safran that designs manufactures short-haul engines and the future open fan design) and Pratt and Whitney. The Russian UAC cannot. The Chinese COMAC got sold a decade+ old variant for their latest jet out of fear of industrial espionage (the Chinese engine manufacturers have failed at producing reliable and efficient jet engines for <i>any</i> application, usually relying on Russian designs).<p>TL;DR is that modern airliners are extremely complicated, expensive, and have very long lead times. A new design won&#x27;t be making any money within the first 10-15 years of its life, which means that only countries with very developed and advanced industrial bases, lots of money, and the desire for strategic airliner autonomy will invest in them.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40943704" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40943704" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">whalesalad</span><span>|</span><a href="#40943544">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40943645">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40943570">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40943704">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40943704">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is hypersonic.

It has its good and bad points.<p>Based on that experience, we had our very own second-system-syndrome experience.<p>We decided our graph library should be modular, type safe, and efficient. (These properties came up in the comments here, too.) This is probably just a variation of &quot;good, fast, cheap - pick any two.&quot;<p>By modular, want to write collections of graph algorithm libraries that are developed and even compiled independently.<p>By type safe, we mean we want to detect programming errors during compilation, or link time at the latest. We don&#x27;t want programs to throw runtime errors like &quot;your node does not have a color attribute&quot;.<p>By efficient, we mean that accessing an attribute of a graph is as cheap as a field in a C struct. (So, we don&#x27;t want to carry around external hash table, or do a lot of string conversions, for instance.)<p>You can argue about whether these things are worth the price or even make sense, but that&#x27;s what we wanted.  We had some famous C++ creators in our lab, so we figured we could get help, and we were willing to give C++ another chance.<p>Gordon Woodhull, who had been an intern and kept working for us, is a brilliant programmer, and wrote an implementation of this kind of graph library working in templated C++. It&#x27;s even published at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dynagraph.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dynagraph.org&#x2F;</a> via sourceforge. The rest of us were not really sure we could ever understand how the code worked, so we had a code review with said famous C++ inventors. There were a lot of screens of code, and chinstroking, and greybeards pronounced &quot;That would probably work.&quot; We knew we might have gone over the complexity cliff. (Let&#x27;s not even talk about compile-time template errors, where one error fills an entire screen with details that only a... C++ inventor could love.) It was our fault, not anyone else&#x27;s, and Gordon kept plugging away and even made all the dynamic graph layout stuff work, in Microsoft OLE, too. In hindsight it was probably our own Project Xanadu. While we got lost in this, a lot of things like Gephi (Java) and NetworkX and NetworKit (python) happened.<p>Also, John Ellson, a very talented software engineer who had written parts of Graphviz, revitalized the main effort.</div><br/><div id="39599789" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39599789" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Everdred2dx</span><span>|</span><a href="#39594519">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39596465">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39599789">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39599789">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I love comments like this.

It is really an abstraction.<p>Fundamentally, <i>all</i> I need to define a graph is a set of vertices v \in V and function Neighbors(v). And that really is all is needed for the most foundational set of graph algorithms.<p>Everything else are case-by-case constraints. Does A-&gt;B imply B-&gt;A? is the node set partitionable with certain constraints? Are there colors? labels?<p>To make things <i>even</i> more general I can go up one level and consider the hypergraph. In which case I just have a set of vertices, and a set of sets of vertices. This can be represented in a myriad of different ways depending on what you are interested in. Of which (non-hyper) graph is simply a special case.<p>An alternative way to think about it perhaps from the database perspective, is that its a query optimization and indexing problem. Depending on what questions you want to ask about the graph, there will be different ways to represent the graph to answer the question better. Just like there is not one way to represent the abstraction called &quot;Table&quot;, there is not one way to do &quot;Graph&quot; either.

Within one language ecosystem, the API of a vector is small, and that&#x27;s probably what makes it easy to share.<p>For operating systems, the API is relatively small compared to the internal complexity of the OS. This is also true for libraries for numerical problems, which are also easily shared.

The API feels like working with lists because you are essentially consing contexts(node, neighbours) into a list of contexts that form your graph. Many standard graph algorithms are then built up from depth or breadth first search and you can compose really succinct programs to manipulate the graph. Graphs are labelled with any Haskell data structure and there is a graphviz library complementary to FGL to generate dot files which can be rendered according to the data carried in the node labels. Often in an application you want to both perform computations on your graph and render a visualization simultaneously to the end user or for debugging and in FGL you minimise duplication of application and rendering logic.</div><br/><div id="39593832" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39593832" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tikhonj</span><span>|</span><a href="#39592985">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39598100">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39593832">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39593832">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">FGL is a great example of how to make a &quot;nice&quot; high-level graph interface suited for functional programming. I&#x27;m a big fan. But it&#x27;s orders of magnitude too slow and memory-inefficient for performance-sensitive graph computationsâif you have even moderately sized graphs and graph algorithms are a bottleneck, you&#x27;ll need to use something else, and probably something domain-specific. Given the way the interface works, I don&#x27;t think you <i>could</i> have a high-performance version that would scale to large graphs.<p>In my experience this leaves FGL in an awkward spot: on the one hand, it isn&#x27;t sufficient for heavy-duty graph processing; on the other, if you <i>don&#x27;t</i> need fancy high-performance graph algorithms, chance are that encoding your problem as a graph is going to be more awkward than defining some domain-specific types for what you&#x27;re doing. Graphs are such a general structure that they&#x27;re usually the wrong level of abstraction for higher-level domain-specific logic.<p>Of course, sometimes you&#x27;re writing graph code specifically and you need a nice way to express your graph algorithms without worrying about performance. In that case, FGL is great. I wrote a tutorial about using it to [generate mazes][1] and it helped me express the algorithms better than I would have been able to do without it.

There are plenty of application domains that can be conveniently represented using graphs where you might have thousands of nodes and edges â which is what Iâd characterise as âmoderately sizedâ â and your needs might only extend to relatively simple and efficient graph algorithms. FGL is excellent in this kind of scenario.<p>If you do need the kind of algorithms that explode in complexity then even a representation a couple of orders of magnitude more efficient wonât help you much either. Big-O is the thing that is going to spoil your day in this story, not the constant factor. Some problems simply donât have convenient fast solutions and ideally with those you find a way to change the representation so the original problem doesnât arise in the first place.<p>Itâs true that thereâs also a zone where you have significantly larger graphs but still only need computationally tractable algorithms, and in that case the overheads of a library like FGL become a factor in what is viable. I also donât disagree with you (and Hillel in the original piece) that it would be difficult to define comprehensive graph functionality to include in a standard library when there are so many different trade-offs involved.<p>A good â and not entirely unconnected â analogy might be calculating with matrices. Itâs convenient to have support for simple but widely useful cases like 3x3 and 4x4 built into your language or standard library. However, once youâre solving systems with hundreds or thousands of rows, you probably want more specialised tools like BLAS&#x2F;LAPACK, and the structure of your matrix and how you can decompose it start to matter a lot more.</div><br/><div id="39597224" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39597224" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">michelpp</span><span>|</span><a href="#39592985">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39595878">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39594607">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39597224">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39597224">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  you probably want more specialised tools like BLAS&#x2F;LAPACK<p>The GraphBLAS and LAGraph are sparse matrix optimized libraries for this exact purpose:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DrTimothyAldenDavis&#x2F;GraphBLAS">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DrTimothyAldenDavis&#x2F;GraphBLAS</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GraphBLAS&#x2F;LAGraph&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GraphBLAS&#x2F;LAGraph&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39594607" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39594607" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">montmorency88</span><span>|</span><a href="#39592985">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39593832">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39595878">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39598100">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39594607">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39594607">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Interesting.

A typical Java-style object composing other objects composing other objects again, etc etc, often with cycles and parent backreferences and whatnot, is a graph. The html DOM is a graph.<p>I recognize that these are often very tree-like, which feels like cheating in the same way as saying âwell a list is also a graph!â is. But given that cycles are common enough that serializers (eg JSON.stringify) need to special-case those, I think maybe this is simply not true, and theyâre really just graphs. Very few tree-like class structures tend to remain pure trees.<p>The only thing missing from references&#x2F;pointers to be able to represent what the author is looking for, is having data on the edges. I think this is trivially solvable by putting nodes halfway the edge (= add a level of indirection, an operation so common that we donât even think of it as âadding data to the edgesâ).<p>So I think the answer is that thereâs no explicit data structure named âgraphâ because the basic building block of composition in nearly every language (reference&#x2F;pointer) is an edge, and the basic building block of data representation (objects&#x2F;structs&#x2F;records) is a node.

For linked lists, this would save you from needing another memory allocation or wrapper struct, and since C doesn&#x27;t have templates you&#x27;d either have to blindly cast the type or use macros or write a type-specific iterator anyways.<p>Lists eventually became a standard language feature in C++ and other languages, but it&#x27;s trickier for trees and graphs. Taking the DOM example, you might be searching through child elements (div, span, etc) or nodes (text nodes, comment nodes) and different operations might only work with a specific subset of the &quot;edges&quot;. There might be pointers to other objects, like from a DOM node to accessibility tree node. You might even have multiple parent node pointers, such as a pointer that takes you to the nearest shadow root or something.<p>Since there are multiple ways to traverse the same data structure, generic functions don&#x27;t work on it. You could create a separate tree&#x2F;graph for each thing you want to use it for, but that takes additional memory and has to be updated when the original struct changes. Or you could create some kind of adapter that has a get_edges() function, but this might not be very well optimized or might be clunky for many other reasons.

There are several problems with this; most importantly, there can be silent failures when g is not a linked list.

- you can use the edges with or without their own identity,
- you can use implicit graphs unfolded on the fly,
- you can use both adjacency (out-neighbors) and incidence (out-edges + head) interfaces,
- no edge type is emposed by the library, although it does provide the basic tail-head-pair structure as a utility.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;qbit86&#x2F;arborescence">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;qbit86&#x2F;arborescence</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;qbit86&#x2F;arborescence&#x2F;tree&#x2F;develop&#x2F;src&#x2F;Arborescence.Abstractions">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;qbit86&#x2F;arborescence&#x2F;tree&#x2F;develop&#x2F;src&#x2F;Arbo...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39593017" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39593017" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mizzlr_</span><span>|</span><a href="#39597925">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39592706">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39593017">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39593017">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">graph is a data structure, not a data type. if you squint enough pointers are the building blocks (the data type is you please) for building graph data structure. a-&gt;b is pointer access, looks like an edge in the graph.<p>graph data structure is parent of tree, code execution&#x2F; function call stacks work like a tree, think flame graphs.<p>stacks and pointers are baked in assembly and cpu architecture. your claims can&#x27;t be farther from the truth.</div><br/><div id="39596277" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39596277" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Chris_Newton</span><span>|</span><a href="#39593017">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39593113">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39596277">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39596277">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>graph is a data structure, not a data type.</i><p>It can refer to either.<p>Any concrete data structure that uses indirection â which means pretty much anything more complicated than dense arrays and records â is indeed a form of graph.<p>But graphs, and more constrained forms like DAGs and trees, can also be abstract data types, implemented by a variety of concrete representations.<p>One of lifeâs little ironies is that implementing a general abstract graph using a general concrete graph whose records and pointers correspond (roughly) 1:1 with the nodes and edges in the abstract graph is often a poor choice.<p>Moreover, itâs not unusual to have an abstract graph implemented using a non-graph data structure (for example, a dense adjacency matrix) or to use a graph-like data structure to implement an abstract data type whose interface doesnât look particularly graph-like (for example, a piece table).</div><br/></div></div><div id="39593113" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39593113" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">renewiltord</span><span>|</span><a href="#39593017">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39596277">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39592706">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39593113">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39593113">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Pointer-based graph structure will make matrix algos painful to implement.

I have come to see it as generally negative, especially when the developer&#x27;s summary puts these adjectives or something similar front and center.<p>Let me show you the most flexible possible Javascript framework. This will look like a joke, but it&#x27;s not. It fits perfectly into an HN post. The most flexible possible JS framework is simply:<p><pre><code>    eval
</code></pre>
Similarly flexible frameworks exist for dynamic scripting languages. For static languages one must invoke the entire compiler as the framework. Of course, if you think about it hard enough, I&#x27;m doing that for dynamic languages here too, it just has a snappier representation for dynamic languages.<p>Frameworks and libraries provide their value precisely through limiting things, and then building on those limitations. Of course, the limitations must be well-chosen, to make what can be built on them interesting enough to pay for the limitations the framework chooses. But the essence of them are in their limitations. I start out from the get-go with the maximally flexible framework my language allows, which is itself the language, and the additional framework needs to make limitations on my code in order to do anything useful.<p>(A problem when framework designers don&#x27;t understand this is that they make a series of little incorrect design decisions that can often add up to a real pain. For instance, if I were to design a web framework that took over some amount of routing from the user, I would still leave you the ability to claim some bit of the URL space and route it entirely out of my framework, because I understand that my framework is based around limitations and you may need to expose a URL to something that can&#x27;t work under those limitations. But someone who doesn&#x27;t realize that frameworks intrinsically involve limitations might fail to give that callout because they can&#x27;t imagine that someone might have a problem that their framework is not &quot;flexible&quot; and &quot;generic&quot; enough to handle. Imagine a CRUD framework, even a very good one, but I need to offer an endpoint based on streaming server events in the same URL space, which is intrinsically foreign to the CRUD framework&#x27;s concept of page loads. This is just one example; real frameworks designed without this understanding will make dozens or hundreds of such little mistakes.)<p>Graphs have the same problem. It seems like they&#x27;re so flexible and generic that they ought to be more used and more useful. But that&#x27;s precisely what kills them. Even if you nail down the problem to exactly one representation, they still don&#x27;t fit. For instance I have a great need for data structures that don&#x27;t admit cycles, but if all I have is a graph, imposing that limitation from a coding perspective is a real challenge. Mathematically it&#x27;s trivial, I just say &quot;and this graph has no cycles&quot; <i>et voila</i> [1], there are no cycles, but in code I need to enforce that somehow and there&#x27;s no trivial solution to that.<p>Another way of viewing graphs is that we <i>do</i> work in graphs all the time, precisely because everything in RAM can be seen as a graph. GC algorithms even generally work by viewing everything in very raw graphy terms. It just turns out the API you&#x27;d expect to work over a graph just isn&#x27;t useful in the general sense when applied to everything in a programming language&#x27;s memory space. It seems like it ought to be, but it just isn&#x27;t. It may seem like it would be great to have a set of employees and extract their names and then look that up into another database etc. etc. with a general graph query language or something, but it turns out the special considerations at each layer make it so that what the general purpose programming language is already doing is actually generally better. The details at each layer matter.<p>I like the metaphor of architecture astronautics and have often discussed &quot;the 30,000 foot view&quot; versus the view on the ground here on HN, and to my mind the key to the metaphor isn&#x27;t the nerdery of being an astronaut or the difficulty. The key is that when you get high up, everything looks the same. It feels like graphs ought to be awesome when you&#x27;re looking down at the entire computing landscape from metaphorical low Earth orbit. But down in the trenches, the local concerns overwhelm that viewpoint... and this is real. This is not just because we all suck or we don&#x27;t try hard enough or we just Don&#x27;t Get It. It&#x27;s real. The architecture astronaut is just wrong in this case. It&#x27;s not even a beautiful vision this world isn&#x27;t good enough to manifest or any such conciliatory thing... it&#x27;s just wrong. It is good to write good code and reduce the amount of bespoke details to be considered. The programming community has made great progress there and there is still great opportunity to do more. But there are an awful, awful lot of details in the world, and the world being detailed is fundamental.<p>[1]: Or if you are, like me, kinda a fan of surprise stringed instrument attacks, <i>et viola</i>.</div><br/><div id="39595549" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39595549" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Terr_</span><span>|</span><a href="#39592880">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39595549">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39595549">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  when I was a younger programmer, like many people, I considered &quot;generic&quot; or &quot;flexible&quot; a positive when describing a library or framework [...]<p>I&#x27;ve come to prefer what I call &quot;design for deletion&quot;: Most of those long-term &quot;flexibility someday&quot; needs are best-met by making sure the inflexible modules or flows can be clearly identified and ripped out for replacement.

In San Diego pockets of people in every neighborhood own literal battery powered golf carts and use them to drive to grocery stores and such. These things are perfect for the streets of Boston, small, easily maneuvered into small spaces. Instead they are illegal in MA with only very specific exceptions for park services and other municipal works departments.<p>Every time I ask about it people jump all over “they aren’t safe on the highway”. Okay cool. If you own a golf cart in SD, it’s illegal to drive it on the highway. Problem solved right? I mean we have mopeds, motorcycles, literal bicycles sharing all these streets too. Certainly golf carts and kei trucks can have a special license plate for non highway vehicles?</div><br/><div id="41181397" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41181397" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chung8123</span><span>|</span><a href="#41180781">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41222345">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41181397">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41181397">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It is a bit weird.

My preferred vehicle is a coupe, for handling, visibility, and gas mileage. I&#x27;ve even moved the occasional plywood, drywall, and couch on top of my old Civic. My offhanded comment was coming from a place where I <i>want</i> to like kei trucks, but just don&#x27;t see them really fitting my needs.<p>If a kei truck fell into my life, I&#x27;d certainly use it for what it works for - which is seemingly hauling small loads of bulky or heavy goods on local trips. But by the time I&#x27;m towing&#x2F;hauling, I generally want the versatility of a good size trailer. Handling much more weight than a truck, fitting full sheet goods, much lower to the ground for easy loading, versatile with removable sides, and with a little planning I can fork things on&#x2F;off. If I wanted a dump bed, I&#x27;d get a dump trailer. I&#x27;ve been using an inherited &quot;crossover&quot; SUV as the tow vehicle. If I were looking at trucks it would mainly be for a better tow vehicle for highways (heavier and larger engine), which a kei truck does not fill on a few dimensions.<p>I can see kei trucks being handy for certain types of contractors in tight urban environments. But going out to even just the suburbs I think those advantages start go to away in favor of more versatile US-sized pickup trucks. And I think much of the interest in kei trucks isn&#x27;t even coming from contractors, but rather from DIYers that would be better served by small trailers.

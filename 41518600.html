I&#x27;ve been curious about Lean but I got the impression it sort of steps away from Haskell&#x27;s legacy in terms of syntax and the like (unlike Agda and Idris) so was concerned it would be a large investment and wouldn&#x27;t add much to what I&#x27;ve learned from Coq.<p>I&#x27;d love any insights on what&#x27;s a useful way to learn more in the area of dependent types for a working engineer today.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="41525223" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41525223" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bmitc</span><span>|</span><a href="#41520434">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41520608">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41520713">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41525223">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41525223">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When I last looked into Lean, I was highly unimpressed, even for doing math proofs.

I am not certain that such efforts are a net positive on writing good software. By their very definition, the more typed a language gets, the less programs it can represents. That obviously reduces buggy programs, but it also reduces non-buggy programs that you can implement. Highly typed languages force more and more effort into pre-compile time and you will often find yourself trying to fit a problem into the chains of the type system.<p>Rather, I think reasonably multi-paradigm languages like F# are the sweet spot. Just enough strict typing and functional core to get you going for most of your program, but then it allows classes and imperative programming when those paradigms are appropriate.<p>I think the way to go to write better software is better tooling and ergonomics. I don&#x27;t think type systems are going to magically save us.</div><br/><div id="41525731" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41525731" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tsimionescu</span><span>|</span><a href="#41520434">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41525223">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41528817">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41525731">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41525731">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; By their very definition, the more typed a language gets, the less programs it can represents. That obviously reduces buggy programs, but it also reduces non-buggy programs that you can implement.<p>While I generally share your skepticism, I think this is quite wrong. A good part of the point of advanced type systems is to make more complex problems possible while still being well typed. For example, in C, if you want a function whose return type is tied to an input argument&#x27;s type, you either use void* and casts (no type safety), or you don&#x27;t write that function. In languages with even slightly more advanced type systems, you can write that function and still get full type safety.<p>Even more advanced type systems achieve the same things: you can take programs that can only be written in a simpler type system and make them safe. In standard Haskell, for example, you can&#x27;t write a Monad and actually have the compiler check that it respects the Monad laws - the implementation of Monad functions just assumes that any type that implements the right shape of functions will work as a monad. With dependent types, you can actually enforce that functions designed to work with monads only apply to types that actually respect the monad laws.<p>The trade-off with very complex type systems is different, in my opinion: after some point, you start duplicating your program&#x27;s logic, once in the implentation code, but again in the type signatures. For example, if you want to specify that a sort function actually sorts the input list, you might find that the type specification ends up not much shorter than the actual code of the function. And apart from raw effort, this means that your type specifications start being large enough that they have their own bugs.</div><br/><div id="41527537" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41527537" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">User23</span><span>|</span><a href="#41520434">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41525731">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41528817">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41527537">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41527537">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think GP&#x27;s point was that most[1] programs that can be represented will fail to please the programmer or his principals.

Nowadays, several mathematicians coming from algebraic geometry, number theory, etc. are promoting formal proofs, and it seems like most of them have chosen Lean. I don&#x27;t know whether this is because Lean is somehow better suited for working mathematicians, or if it was simply a random personal preference among people who got enthusiastic about this stuff and started advertising it to their colleagues?<p>I am not familiar with every proof assistant out there, but many of them are a very hard sell for mathematicians and lack a comprehensive math library.

For the project itself, one can do fast compiles during development, but say you want to experiment with different GHC versions and base libraries, then you have to wait forever for your whole set of dependencies to compile (or buy some harddrives to store &#x2F;nix on if you go that route). And installing some random Haskell program from source also becomes a drag due to dependency compile times (I&#x27;m always happy when I see a short dependency tree).

The workaround I   have to use in this case is to `cabal get dependency-version` in a gitignored directory and use hasktags to keep a tags file to jump to those definitions and read the source code&#x2F;comments.<p>The later two have open GitHub issues, so at least I know they will get solved at some point.</div><br/><div id="41524612" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41524612" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">devmunchies</span><span>|</span><a href="#41518959">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41519273">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41519292">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41524612">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41524612">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Iâve been using f# in production for 4+ years and havenât used windows in like 15 years.<p>Speaking of LSP, the lsp standard is developed by Microsoft so naturally any dotnet language will have good lsp support.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41519292" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41519292" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">louthy</span><span>|</span><a href="#41518959">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41519273">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41524612">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41523902">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41519292">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41519292">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Since you mention F#, and C# in your previous comment, are you on the Windows platform?<p>Linux Mint.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41523902" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41523902" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">runevault</span><span>|</span><a href="#41518959">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41519273">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41519292">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41519274">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41523902">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41523902">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Since you mention F#, and C# in your previous comment, are you on the Windows platform?<p>Since dotnet core (now dotnet 5+), the Microsoft version of dotnet has not been tied to windows outside a few exceptions like old Windows UI libraries (WPF&#x2F;WinForms) and stuff like WCF once they revived it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41519274" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41519274" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nh2</span><span>|</span><a href="#41518959">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41519171">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41519273">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41519514">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41519274">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41519274">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Haskell LSP crashes less often now than 2 years ago.

It has its quirks, but so does the Kotlin plugin.<p>Sbt is better than Gradle IMO, as it has a saner mental model, although for apps you can use Gradle or Maven. Sbat has had some awesome plugins that can help in bigger teams, such as Scalafmt (automatic formatting), Scalafix (automatic refactoring), Wartremover and others. Scalafmt specifically is best in class. With Sbt you can also specify  versioning schemes for your dependencies and so you can make the build fail on problematic dependency evictions.<p>Scala CLI is also best in class, making it comfortable to use Scala for scripting â it replaced Python and Ruby for me: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scala-cli.virtuslab.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scala-cli.virtuslab.org&#x2F;</a><p>Note that Java and Kotlin have Jbang, but Scala CLI is significantly better, also functioning as a REPL. Worth mentioning that other JVM languages hardly have a usable REPL, if at all.<p>The Scala compiler can be slow, but that&#x27;s when you use libraries doing a lot of compile-time derivation or other uses of macros. You get the same effect in similar languages (with the exception of Ocaml). OTOH the Scala compiler can do incremental compilation, and alongside Sbt&#x27;s support for multiple sub-projects or continuous testing, it works fairly well.<p>Scala also has a really good LSP implementation, Metals, built in cooperation with the compiler team, so you get good support in VS Code or Vim. To get a sense of where this matters, consider that Scala 3.5 introduces &quot;best effort compilation&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scala&#x2F;scala3&#x2F;pull&#x2F;17582">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scala&#x2F;scala3&#x2F;pull&#x2F;17582</a><p>I also like Kotlin and sadly, it&#x27;s missing a good LSP implementation, and I don&#x27;t think Jetbrains is interested in developing it.<p>Also you get all the tooling that&#x27;s JVM specific, including  all the profilers and debuggers. With GraalVM&#x27;s native image, for example, Scala fares better than Java actually, because Scala code relies less on runtime reflection.<p>I&#x27;d also mention Scala Native or ScalaJS which are nice to have. Wasm support is provided via LLVM, but there&#x27;s also initial support for Wasm GC.<p>So to answer your question, yes, Scala has really good tooling compared to other languages, although there&#x27;s room for improvement. And if you&#x27;re comparing it to any other language that people use for FP, then Scala definitely has better tooling.</div><br/><div id="41522770" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41522770" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ldite</span><span>|</span><a href="#41518959">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41520708">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41527050">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41522770">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41522770">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">SBT is awful.

Say, if you specify something complex, like Kotlin&#x27;s multiplatform plugin, in the wrong order with something else, it can break your build definition. I bumped into this right off the gate, with my first Kotlin project.<p>In Sbt this used to matter as well, but because Sbt has this design of having the build definition as an immutable data structure that&#x27;s fairly declarative, people worked on solving the problem (via auto-loading), and since then, I&#x27;ve never bumped again into ordering issues.<p>There are other examples as well, such as consistency. In Sbt there&#x27;s only one way to specify common settings, and the keys used are consistent. Specifying Java&#x27;s targeted version, for example, uses the same key, regardless if the project is a plain JVM one, or a multiplatform one.<p>Sharing settings and code across subprojects is another area where Gradle is a clusterfuck, whereas in Sbt it&#x27;s pretty straightforward.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Gradle doesn&#x27;t bother me, and it has some niceties too. Other ecosystems would be lucky to have something like Gradle. But I find it curious to see so many people criticizing it when almost everything else is pretty terrible, with few exceptions.<p>---<p>Note that Li Haoyi has great taste, and Mill is looking good, actually. But he also likes reinventing the wheel, and the problem with that for build tools is that standardization has value.<p>Standardization has so much value for me that I would have liked for Scala to use Gradle as the standard build tool, and for Scala folks to work with Gradle&#x27;s authors to introduce Scala as an alternative scripting language for it, despite me liking Gradle a lot less. Because it would&#x27;ve made switching and cross-language JVM development easier.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41523924" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41523924" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dionian</span><span>|</span><a href="#41518959">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41522770">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41528139">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41527050">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41523924">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41523924">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">SBT has a learning curve but it also has a nice ecosystem, for example sbt-native-packager is better than its competitors in maven or gradle.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41527050" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41527050" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rbonvall</span><span>|</span><a href="#41518959">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41520708">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41522770">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41519823">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41527050">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41527050">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sbt is too complex and powerful for its own good.

Whereas in GHC land I reload my project in the interpreter (GHCi or cabal repl), set a break point on function name and step through the execution. With OCaml I have to go through the separate bytecode compiler to build it with debug symbols and the I can navigate through program execution.

Also less experienced with this flow, to consider my issues authoritative.<p>I don&#x27;t have that much experience with dune (aside from setting up a project and running dune build), but one thing that confused me at first, is that the libraries I have to add to the configuration do not necessarily match the Opam package names.<p>The LSP is fast, as mentioned before, it supports goto definition, but once I jump to a definition to one of my dependencies I get a bunch of squiggly lines in those files (probably can&#x27;t see transitive dependency symbols, if I where to guess). I can navigate dependencies one level deeper than I can with the Haskell language server, though.<p>I actually want to better understand how to build my projects without Dune, and probably will attempt to do so in the future.

I believe at the time I came across an ancient bug report which concluded that it was an &quot;open research question&quot; which would require &quot;probably a complete rework&quot;.<p>Another issue was that Servant doesn&#x27;t have proper integrated error handling. The library is designed around returning a 200 response, and provides a lot of tooling to make that easy and safe. However, I noticed that at the time its design essentially completely ignored failures! Your best option was basically a `Maybe SomeResponseType` which in the `None` case gave a 200 response with a &quot;{&#x27;status&#x27;: &#x27;error&#x27;}&quot; content. There was a similar years-old bug report for this issue, which is quite worrying considering it&#x27;s not exactly rocket science, and pretty much every single web developer is going to run into it.<p>All of this gave a feeling of a very rough and unfinished library, whose author was more concerned about writing a research paper than actually making useful software. Luckily those issues had no real-world implication for me, as I was only a student losing a few days on some minor project. But if I were to come across this during professional software development I&#x27;d be seriously pissed, and probably write off the entire ecosystem: if <i>this</i> is what I can expect from &quot;great&quot; libraries, what does the average ones look like - am I going to have to write every single trivial thing from scratch?<p>I really love the core language of Haskell, but after running into issues like these a few dozen times I unfortunately have trouble justifying using it to myself. Maybe Haskell will be great five or ten years from now, but in its current state I fear it is probably best to use something else.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Central_Authentication_Service" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Central_Authentication_Service</a></div><br/><div id="41520651" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41520651" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dwattttt</span><span>|</span><a href="#41518959">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41519392">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41519477">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41520651">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41520651">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Your best option was basically a `Maybe SomeResponseType` which in the `None` case gave a 200 response with a &quot;{&#x27;status&#x27;: &#x27;error&#x27;}&quot; content.<p>This seems to be an area where my tastes diverge from the mainstream, but I&#x27;m not a fan of folding errors together.

That&#x27;s my point. One can write an emulator for any programme in Haskell, <i>in principle</i>, but that&#x27;s not at all the same thing as saying <i>you</i> can write <i>any programme</i> in <i>fact</i>.<p>For instance, you cannot write this in Haskell:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;krue.net&#x2F;avrforth&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;krue.net&#x2F;avrforth&#x2F;</a><p>You could write something in Haskell <i>in which you could write this</i>, but those are different complexity classes, different programs, and very, <i>very</i> different practices.

When I consider what the Haskell tooling was like when I first started using it, well, it was non-existent! (and Cabal didn&#x27;t even understand what dependencies were, haha!)<p>So, it&#x27;s much, much better than it was.  It&#x27;s still not comparable to mainstream languages, but it&#x27;s going the right way.  So, I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily take that as the killer.<p>The biggest issue was the library ecosystem.  We spent an not-small amount of time evaluating libraries, realising they were not up to scratch, trying to do build our own, or interacting with the authors to understand the plans.  When you&#x27;re trying to get moving at the start of a project, this can be quite painful.  It takes longer to get to an MVP.  That&#x27;s tough when there are eyes on its success or not.<p>Even though I&#x27;d been using Haskell for at least a decade before we embarked upon that path, I hadn&#x27;t really ever built anything substantial.  The greenfield project was a complex beast on a number of levels (which was one of the reasons I felt Haskell would excel, it would force us to be more robust with our architecture).  But, we just couldn&#x27;t find the libraries that were good enough.<p>My sense was there&#x27;s a lot of academics writing libraries.  I&#x27;m not implying that academics write poor code; just that their motivations aren&#x27;t always aligned with what an industry dev might want.  Usually this is around simplicity and ease-of-use.  And, because quite a lot of libraries were either poorly documented or their intent was impenetrable, it would take longer to evaluate.<p>I think if the Haskell Foundation are going to do anything, then they should probably write down the top 50 needed packages in industry, and then put some funding&#x2F;effort towards helping the authors of existing libraries to bring them up to scratch (or potentially, developing their own), perhaps even create a &#x27;mainstream adoption style guide&#x27;, that standardises the library surfaces -- there&#x27;s far too much variability. It needs a keen eye on what your average industry dev needs though.<p>I realise there are plenty of companies using Haskell successfully, so this should only be one data point.

Without knowing anything about what you want to do, here&#x27;s my general approach:<p>1. Decide on an effect system<p>Remember, Haskell is pure, so any side-effect will be strictly explicit. What broad capabilities do you want? 
Usually, you need to access some program-level configuration (e.g. command-line options) and the ability to do IO (networking, reading&#x2F;writing files, etc), so most people start with that.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.fpcomplete.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;06&#x2F;readert-design-pattern&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.fpcomplete.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;06&#x2F;readert-design-patt...</a><p>2. Encode your business logic in functions (purely if possible)<p>Your application does some processing of data. The details don&#x27;t matter. Use pure functions as much as possible, and factor effectful computations (e.g. database accesses) out into their own functions.<p>3. Glue everything together in a monadic context<p>Once you have all your business logic, glue everything together in a context with your effect system (usually a monad stack using ReaderT). This is usually where concurrency comes in (e.g. launch 1 thread per request).<p>---<p>Beyond this, your application design will depend on your use-case.<p>If you are interested, I strongly suggest to read &#x27;Production Haskell&#x27; by Matt Parsons, which has many chapters on &#x27;Haskell application structure&#x27;.</div><br/><div id="41522421" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41522421" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">solomonb</span><span>|</span><a href="#41519406">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41519778">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41522846">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41522421">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41522421">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; 1.

Professional experience certainly will help you learn some patterns, but honestly my best advice for structuring programs is to not think too hard about it.<p>Use modules as your basic unit of abstraction. Donât go out of your way to make their organization over-engineered, but each module should basically do one thing, and should define everything it needs to do that thing (types, classes, functions).<p>Use parametric polymorphism as much as you can, without making the code too hard to read. Prefer functions and records over type classes as much as possible. Type classes that only ever have a single instance, donât have laws, or type classes defined for unit data types are major code smells.<p>Donât worry about avoiding IO, but as much as you can try to keep IO code separate from pure code. For example, if you need to read a value from the user, do some calculations, then print a message, itâs far better to factor the âdo some calculationsâ part out into a pure function that takes the things you read in as arguments and returns a value to print. Itâs really tempting to interleave logic with IO but youâll save so much time, energy, and pain if you avoid this.<p>Essentially, keep things as simple as you can without getting belligerent about it. The type system will help you a lot with refactoring.<p>Start at the beginning. Write functions. When you see some piece of functionality that you need, use `undefined` to make a placeholder function. Then, go to your place holder and start implementing it. Use undefined to fill in bits that you need, and so on.<p>Fancy types are neat but itâs easy to end up with a solution in search of a problem. Avoid them until you really have a concrete problem that they solve- then embrace them for that problem (and only that problem).<p>Youâll refactor a lot, and learn to have a better gut feeling for how to structure things, but thatâs just the process of gaining experience. Leaning into the basics of FP (pure functions, composed together) will be the path of least resistance as you are getting there.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41521091" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41521091" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mattgreenrocks</span><span>|</span><a href="#41519406">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41527414">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41521562">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41521091">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41521091">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve used Haskell professionally for two years.

Then, just as the light bulb goes off, they move on from the project and I get the next junior dev who I have to explain it to. I&#x27;m hardly going to get to the point where I have a team of people who are Haskell experts when I&#x27;m explaining this basic thing over and over.<p>And, to be 100% clear, this is not their &quot;fault&quot;, because being a junior programmer in 2024 is facing a mountain of issues I didn&#x27;t face at their age: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33911633">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33911633</a> I wasn&#x27;t expected to know about how to do source control or write everything to be rollback-able or interact with QA, or, well, see linked post for more examples. Haskell is another stack of requirements on top of a modern junior dev that is a <i>hell</i> of an ask. There better be some damn good reasons for me to add this to my minimim-viable developer for a project. I am not expressing contempt for the junior programmers here from atop my own lofty perch; I am encouraging people to have sympathy with them, especially if you also come up in the 90s when it was really relatively easy, and to make sure you don&#x27;t spec out projects where you&#x27;re basically pulling the ladder up after yourself. You need to have an onboarding plan, and &quot;spend a whole bunch of time learning Haskell&quot; is spending a lot of your onboarding plan currency.<p>Second, while a Haskell program that has the <i>chef&#x27;s kiss</i> perfect architecture is a joy to work with, it is much more difficult to get there for a real project. When I was playing with Haskell it was a frequent occurrence to discover I&#x27;d architected something wrong, and to essentially need to rewrite the whole program, because there is no intermediate functioning program between where I was and where I needed to be. The strength of the type system is a great benefit, but it does not put up with your crap. But &quot;your crap&quot; includes things like being able to rearchitect a system in phases, or partially, and still have a functioning system, and some other things that are harder to characterize but you do a lot of without even realizing it.<p>I&#x27;d analogize it to a metalworker working with titanium. If you need it, you need it. If you can afford it, great. The end result is amazing. But it&#x27;s a much harder metal to work with for the exact same reason it&#x27;s amazing. The strength of the end part is directly reflected in the metal resisting you working with it.<p>I expect at a true expert level you can get over this, but then as per my first point, demanding that all my fellow developers become true experts in this obscure language is taking it up another level past just being able to work in it at all.<p>Finally, a lot of programming requirements have changed over the years. 10-15 years ago I could feasibly break my program into a &quot;functional core&quot; and an external IO system. This has become a great deal less true, because the baseline requirement for logging, metrics, and visibility have gone up a lot, and suddenly that &quot;pure core&quot; becomes a lot less appealing. Yes, of course, our pure functions could all return logs and metrics and whathaveyou, and sure, you can set up the syntax to the point that it&#x27;s almost tolerable, but you&#x27;re still going to face issues where basically everything is now in some sort of IO. If nothing else, those beautiful (Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int) functions all become (Int -&gt; Int -&gt; LoggingMetrics Int) and now it isn&#x27;t just that you &quot;get&quot; to use monadic interfaces but you&#x27;re in the LoggingMetrics monad for <i>everything</i> and the advantages of Haskell, while they do not go away entirely, are somewhat mitigated, because it really wants purity. It puts me halfway to being in the &quot;imperative monad&quot; already, and makes the plan of just going ahead and being there and programming carefully a lot more appealing. Especially when you combine that with the junior devs being able to understand the resulting code.<p>In the end, while I still strongly recommend professional programmers spend some time in this world to glean some lessons from it that are much more challenging to learn anywhere else, it is better to take the lessons learned and learn how to apply them back into conventional languages than to try to insist on using the more pure functional languages in an engineering environment. This isn&#x27;t even the complete list of issues, but they&#x27;re sufficient to eliminate them from consideration for almost every engineering task. And in fact every case I have personally witnessed where someone pushed through anyhow and did it, it was ultimately a business failure.</div><br/><div id="41521690" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41521690" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cosmic_quanta</span><span>|</span><a href="#41519406">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41521562">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41522091">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41521690">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41521690">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I&#x27;d analogize it to a metalworker working with titanium.

The strength of the end part is directly reflected in the metal resisting you working with it.<p>Iâd say you missed one of the main points of Haskell and functional programming in general.<p>The combinator is the most modular and fundamental computational primitive available in programming. When you make a functional program it should be constructed out of the composition of thousands of these primitive with extremely strict separation from IO and multiple layers of abstraction. Each layer is simply composed functions from the layer below.<p>If you think of fp programming this way. It becomes the most modular most reconfigurable programming pattern in existence.<p>You have access to all layers of abstraction and within each layer are independent modules of composed combinators. Your titanium is given super powers where you can access the engine, the part, the molecule and the atom.<p>All the static safety and beauty Haskell provides is actually a side thing. What Haskell and functional programming in general provides is the most fundamental and foundational way to organize your program such that any architectural change only requires you replacing and changing the minimum amount of required modules. Literally the opposite of what youâre saying.<p>The key is to make your program just a bunch of combinators all the way down with an imperative io shell that is as thin as possible. This is nirvana of program organization and patterns.</div><br/><div id="41522882" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41522882" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jerf</span><span>|</span><a href="#41519406">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41522091">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41523406">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41522882">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41522882">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m well aware of functional programming as focusing on composition.<p>One of the reasons you end up with &quot;refactoring the entire program because of some change&quot; is when you discover that your entire composition scheme you built your entire program around is <i>wrong</i>, e.g., &quot;Gee, this effects library I built my entire code base around to date is really nifty but also I can&#x27;t actually express my needs in it after all&quot;.

That seems very logical to me, but then, Iâm not a functional programmer, I just like map. Itâs elegant, compact, and isnât hard to understand. Not that list comps are hard to understand either, but they can sometimes get overly verbose.<p>filter has also lost ground in favor of list comps, partially because Guido hates FP [0], and probably due to that, there has been a lot of effort towards optimizing list comps over the years, and theyâre now generally faster than filter (or map, sometimes).<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.artima.com&#x2F;weblogs&#x2F;viewpost.jsp?thread=98196" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.artima.com&#x2F;weblogs&#x2F;viewpost.jsp?thread=98196</a></div><br/><div id="41521885" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41521885" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BeetleB</span><span>|</span><a href="#41519079">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41520604">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41520775">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41521885">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41521885">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, but how do you chain them?<p><pre><code>    map(func4, map(func3, map(func2, map(func1, iter))))

  f3 = lambda x: x*1.25
  
  result = iter
  for f in [f1, f2, f3]:

Then the list comprehension can be moved up to mimic more closely what you&#x27;re doing with F#, allowing for operations other than &quot;map&quot;:<p><pre><code>   result = iter
   for f in [
     lambda a: [f1(v) for v in a],
     lambda a: [f2(v) for v in a],
     lambda a: [f3(v) for v in a],
   ]:
     result = f(result)

And a step further if you don&#x27;t like the &quot;result&quot; reassignment:<p><pre><code>  from functools import reduce
  result = reduce(lambda step, f: f(step), [
    lambda a: [f1(v) for v in a],

Haskell has been around for ages but it never really escaped its academic nature. I actually studied in Utrecht in the nineties where there was a lot of activity around this topic at the time. Eric Meyer who later created F# at MS was a teacher there and there was a lot of activity around doing stuff with Gopher which is a Haskell predecessor, which I learned and used at the time. All our compiler courses were basically fiddling with compiler generator frameworks that came straight out of the graduate program. Awesome research group at the time.<p>My take on this is that this was all nice and interesting but a lot of this stuff was a bit academic. F# is probably the closest the community got to having a mature tooling and developer ecosystem.<p>I don&#x27;t use Haskell myself and have no strong opinions on the topic. But usually a good community response to challenges like this is somebody stepping up and doing something about it. That starts with caring enough. If nobody cares, nothing happens.<p>Smalltalk kicked off a small tool revolution in the nineties with its refactoring browser. Smalltalk was famous for having its own IDE. That was no accident. Alan Kay, who was at Xerox PARC famously said that the best way to predict the future was to invent it. And of course he was (and is) very active in the Smalltalk community and its early development. Smalltalk was a language community that was from day one focused on having great tools. Lots of good stuff came out of that community at IBM (Visual Age, Eclipse) and later Jetbrains and other IDE makers.<p>Rust is a good recent example of a community that&#x27;s very passionate about having good tools as well. Down to the firmware and operating system and everything up. In terms of IDE support they could do better perhaps. But I think there are ongoing efforts on making the compiler more suitable for IDE features (which overlap with compiler features). And of course Cargo has a good reputation. That&#x27;s a community that cares.<p>I use Kotlin myself. Made by Jetbrains and heavily used in their IDEs and toolchains. It shows. This is a language made by tool specialists. Which is why I love it. Not necessarily for functional purists. Even though som Scala users have reluctantly switched to it. And the rest is flirting with things like Haskel and Elixir.</div><br/><div id="41520461" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41520461" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pyrale</span><span>|</span><a href="#41519079">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41519562">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41520172">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41520461">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41520461">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I think the tooling being not ideal is a reflection of how mature&#x2F;serious the community is about non academic usage.<p>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more of a reflection of how having a very big company funding the language is making a difference.<p>People like to link Haskell&#x27;s situation to its academic origins, but in reality, most of the issues with the ecosystem are related to acute underfunding compared to mainstream languages.</div><br/><div id="41520606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41520606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jillesvangurp</span><span>|</span><a href="#41519079">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41520461">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41520172">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41520606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41520606">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One doesn&#x27;t happen without the other.

More people have been discouraged from using FP because they started with Haskell than is probably appreciated. The effort to insight ratio for Haskell is incredibly high.<p>You can learn the majority of the concepts faster in another language with likely 1&#x2F;10th the effort. For general FP learn clojure, Racket, or another scheme. For statically typed FP learn F# or Scala or OCAML or even Elm.<p>In fact if you really want to learn Haskell is is faster to learn Elm and then Haskell than it is to just learn Haskel. Because the amout or weeds you have to navigate through to get to the concepts in Haskell are so high that you can first learn the concepts and approach in a tiny language like Elm and it will more than save the amount of time it would take to understand those approaches from trying to learn Haskell. It seems unbelievable but ai found it to be very try. You can learn two languages faster than just one because of how muddy Haskell is.<p>Now that said FP is valuable and in my opinion a cleaner design and why in general our industry keeps shifting that way. Monoids, Functors, Applicative are nice design patterns. Pushing side effects to the edge of your code (which is enforced by types) is a great practice. Monads are way overhyped, thinking in types is way undervalued. But you can get all of these concepts without learning Haskell.<p>So that&#x27;s the end of my rant as I&#x27;ve grown tired of watching people dismiss FP because they confuse the great concepts of FP with the horrible warts that come with Haskell.<p>Haskell is a great language, and I&#x27;m glad I learned it (and am in no way an expert at it)- but it is the single worst language for an introduction to FP concepts.

GHC is optimized for these kinds of patterns, and in many cases it&#x27;ll compile your code to something that does in-place updates for you, while letting you write pure functions that return a new list. Even when it can&#x27;t, the runtime is designed for these kinds of small allocations and updates, and the performance is much better than what you&#x27;d get with that kind of code in another language.<p>If you decided that you really did need in-place updates, then there are a few options. Instead of storing a vector of values (if you are thinking about performance you probably want vectors instead of lists), you can store a vector of references that can be updated. IO is one way to do that (with IORefs) but you can also get &quot;internal mutability&quot; using STRefs. ST is great because it lets you write a function that uses mutable memory but still looks like a pure function to the callers because it guarantees that the impure stuff is only visible inside of the pure function. If you need concurrency, you might use STM and store them as MVars. Ultimately all of these options are different variations on &quot;Store a list of pointers, rather than a list of values&quot;.<p>There are various other optimizations you could do too. For example, you can use unboxed mutable vectors to avoid having to do a bunch of pointer chasing. You can use GHC primitives to eek out even better performance. In the best case scenario I&#x27;ve seen programs like this written in Haskell be competitive with Java (after the warmup period), and you can keep the memory utilization pretty low. You probably won&#x27;t get something that&#x27;s competitive with C unless you are writing extremely optimized code, and at that point most of the time I&#x27;d suggest just writing the critical bits in C and using the FFI to link that into your program.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41519572" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41519572" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lieks</span><span>|</span><a href="#41519451">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41522157">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41519482">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41519572">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41519572">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You... don&#x27;t.

You can mutate them in place either in the IO monad or in the ST monad. They fundamentally work the same way as mutable data structures in any other garbage collected language.<p>When I worked on a relatively simple simulation in Haskell, that&#x27;s exactly what I did: the individual entities were immutable, but the state of the system was stored in a mutable vector and updated in place. The actual &quot;loop&quot; of the simulation was a stream[2] of events, which is what managed the actual IO effect.<p>My favorite aspect of designing the system in Haskell was that I could separate out the core logic of the simulation which could mutate the state on each event from observers which could only <i>read</i> the state on events. This separation between logic and pure metrics made the code much easier to maintain, especially since most of the business needs and complexity ended up being in the metrics rather than the core simulation dynamics. (Not to say that this would always be the case, that&#x27;s just what happened for this specific supply chain domain.)<p>Looking back, if I were going to write a more complex performance-sensitive simulation, I&#x27;d probably end up with state stored in a bunch of different mutable arrays, which sounds a lot like an ECS. Doing that with base Haskell would be <i>really</i> awkward, but luckily Haskell is expressive enough that you can build a legitimately nice interface on top of the low-level mutable code.

Yes, there are all kinds of mutable values for different usage patterns and restrictions.<p>Most likely you end up with mutable containers with some space reserved for entity state.<p>You can start with putting `IORef EntityState` as a field and let the `update` write there. Or multiple fields for state sub-parts that mutate at different rates.
The next step is putting all entity state into big blobs of data and let entities keep an index to their stuff inside that big blob.
If your entities are a mishmash of data, then there&#x27;s `apecs`, ECS library that will do it in AoS way. It even can do concurrent updates in STM if you need that.<p>Going further, there&#x27;s `massiv` library with integrated task supervisor and `repa`&#x2F;`accelerate` that can produce even faster kernels.
Finally, you can have your happy Haskell glue code and offload all the difficult work to GPU with `vulkan` compute.</div><br/><div id="41522767" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41522767" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">icrbow</span><span>|</span><a href="#41519451">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41519591">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41526252">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41522767">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41522767">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; ECS library that will do it in AoS way<p>TLAs aren&#x27;t my forte.

There are more people out there who want to work with Haskell than there are Haskell jobs, and picking Haskell can be a really great way to recruit high quality talent. It&#x27;s also quite possible to train developers on Haskell. A lot of companies hire people who don&#x27;t have experience with their particular language. The learning curve for Haskell may be a bit steeper, but it&#x27;s certainly tractable if you are hiring people who are eager to learn.<p>&gt; The ecosystem of libraries and ancillary tools like monitoring&#x2F;debugging&#x2F;observability<p>Other languages have _more_ of these, but it&#x27;s not like Haskell is missing basic ecosystem things. I actually find that Haskell is pretty nice with this stuff overall. It&#x27;s not quite as automatic as what you might get with running something in the JVM, but it&#x27;s not that big of a lift, and for a lot of teams the marginal extra effort here is more than worth it because of the other benefits you get from Haskell.<p>&gt; The speed-of-development vs cost-of-maintenance tradeoff of the language<p>Haskell is really excellent here in my experience. You can write unmaintainable code in any language, but Haskell gives you a lot of choice in how you build your application, and it makes refactoring a lot nicer than in any other language I&#x27;ve used. You don&#x27;t get some of the nice IDE features to rename things or move code around automatically, but working in a large Haskell codebase you really do start to see ways that the language makes structural and architectural refactoring a lot easier.<p>&gt; But for &quot;what language is easy to employ and has an expansive ecosystem + tooling&quot;, I feel like you have to hand it to Java, .NET, Python, TypeScript, Go, etc...<p>Those are all perfectly good choices. I think what people tend to overlook is that Haskell is _also_ a perfectly good choice. Everything has tradeoffs, but Haskell isn&#x27;t some terrible esoteric choice that forces you to leave everything practical on the table.

But I love how TS handles discriminated unions - if we handle a branch and `return` early, that branch is removed from the union for the subsequent scope, and I was wondering if something of that sort can be achieved in Haskell&#x2F;Scala.</div><br/><div id="41523926" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41523926" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TJSomething</span><span>|</span><a href="#41523477">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41523679">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41523926">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41523926">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve been out of the Scala game for a few years, but I would use a for comprehension with the cats EitherT monad transformer.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;typelevel.org&#x2F;cats&#x2F;datatypes&#x2F;eithert.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;typelevel.org&#x2F;cats&#x2F;datatypes&#x2F;eithert.html</a><p><pre><code>    def divisionProgramAsync(inputA: String, inputB: String): EitherT[Future, String, Double] =

This works essentially identically to the do syntax above, but <i>also</i> includes a call to transform whatever error type is provided into the error type of the function return.<p>Note that in Rust (a) this technique only, today, works at function boundaries and (b) will always be explicitly annotated since all functions require an explicit type.

Usually thatâs sufficient, but when you need to go even further with optimization then it can get hard. Every language can. In Haskell, it usually means starting by dumping core and seeing what the compiler is doing, and getting familiar with the different passes the compiler makes. As a last resort you can also just write in C and use the ffi.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41524194" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41524194" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kevindamm</span><span>|</span><a href="#41523940">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41527526">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41528483">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41524194">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41524194">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This varies by use case and how much &#x2F; which extensions you&#x27;re including in your Haskell source (and, to a lesser extent, which libraries being included in the equivalent Java or Go source).<p>I haven&#x27;t taken a lot of measurements and my production code is biased to Go, C++, Python and Java, with most of my Haskell experience being side projects and toys for learning from, and writing a type-unifier for a production project.  I can summarize what I learned but I would be interested in seeing better measurements.<p>First, though, let&#x27;s be more specific about what you mean by &quot;writing code as fast,&quot; which I think should be refined to &quot;time spent writing code&quot; + &quot;time compiling code&quot; + &quot;time spent in language runtime&quot; + &quot;time spent debugging &#x2F; reading code&quot;.  Depending on your project, and who if anyone is collaborating, each of these might be more or less important.  Sometimes runtime speeds dwarf the needs of development or even debugging time.  Sometimes compilation speeds afford the quick feedback loop that contributes to flow in development time.<p>Within that framing, Haskell can excel at development time with small teams and limited scopes.  It affords writing a domain-specific language within the code, including very custom operators, and this carries the risk of overburdening with complexity, and strongly proportional to the number of people on the team.  Things can get complex fast and it can contribute some to compilation time if there is a lot of recursive complexity to the type system.  But if the source is organized well and doesn&#x27;t need to be very dynamic, this may not be much of a concern.  As an underlying engine for very dynamic data inputs and sufficiently complex numerical analysis or IO management as its primary purpose, it would probably do well.<p>The packaging system (Hackage) is pretty good, and that benefits the development time considerably.  Adding some modules may impede compilation times, for much of the same reason as above, the type inference can become expensive.  And undisciplined source management can lead to a lot of type implementations that are near copies of each other.  Obviously this also ties into the reading&#x2F;debugging time, too.<p>For runtime, though, yes Haskell can be competitive with bare-metal C implementations.  I think there have been a few papers written about that going back a decade or so.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41528483" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41528483" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">revskill</span><span>|</span><a href="#41523940">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41522889">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41528483">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41528483">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It is all about monad.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41522889" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41522889" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">semiinfinitely</span><span>|</span><a href="#41528483">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41523534">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41522889">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41522889">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Haskell had a large impact on the design of JAX which is probably the future of ML development frameworks.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41523534" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41523534" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">1oooqooq</span><span>|</span><a href="#41522889">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41525346">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41523534">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41523534">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What&#x27;s one big web facing application which handles modern authentication protocols?</div><br/><div id="41526274" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41526274" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">whateveracct</span><span>|</span><a href="#41523534">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41525346">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41526274">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41526274">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">mercury.com ?</div><br/><div id="41528543" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41528543" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yakshaving_jgt</span><span>|</span><a href="#41523534">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41526274">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41525346">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41528543">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41528543">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For a bit more context, iirc mercury is at ~2m lines of Haskell over ~10k modules.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41525346" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41525346" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">adamddev1</span><span>|</span><a href="#41523534">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41523026">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41525346">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41525346">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I want Haskell with the tooling, DX, and packages of TypeScript.</div><br/><div id="41528539" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41528539" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yakshaving_jgt</span><span>|</span><a href="#41525346">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41523026">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41528539">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41528539">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I donât.

This is because I typically do (2) in my projects, which does largely eliminate this error.<p>2. representations of âfailableâ computations<p>Basically any modern language can do this.  It might not be 100% as ergonomic as it is in Haskell, but it also isn&#x27;t a large source of bugs in my experience.<p>3. pattern matching and completeness checks<p>Okay, these are nice and ergonomic in Haskell.  Other languages get pretty close.  Again, not a source of time-consuming bugs.<p>4. the avoidance of âprimitive obsessionâ<p>The example he gave for this is innanely contrived, and the bug would likely take a small amount of time to fix, even for a junior.

Keeping track of inter-data dependencies so I don&#x27;t have to litter my code with a million assertions to make sure the sub-type of the sum type I&#x27;m working with is correct.  Or giving me a way to express structural dependencies between pieces of code when writing multithreaded programs.  Like saying &quot;hey, this render pass has to happen after &#x27;DoEntitySimulation&#x27; has completed&quot; .. or whatever.  I&#x27;m not aware of any language that even tries to do that, although I think Bungie wrote something like this in their engine for Destiny2.<p>And metaprogramming.  I ended up writing my own metaprogramming language because none of the ones I tried could even do the basics of what I wanted in an ergonomic way, and be runtime-performant.<p>For reference, my language of choice is typically C++99.

Haskell has had these features since early ~2000s and it was a major competitive advantage in the language space, but today I would argue that if you&#x27;re using a modern language then they don&#x27;t stand out as much. Nevertheless, not all popular languages provide all the above mentioned features and in case they implement them it&#x27;s usually in a compromised fashion. For example, nullable types are still an open issue in Java, while C# and Typescript provide easy ways to circumvent them, a lot of times by accident (the main issue is that they&#x27;re mostly annotations, not runtime checks).<p>On the other hand, you mention several features which Haskell provides, usually through libraries that can only be implemented due to the features provided by the base language:<p>- Refinement types [1] allow to add runtime invariants to existing types in an ergonomic fashion, or you can go even further and use something like LiquidHaskell[2] to enforce properties at compile time.<p>- For multithreaded programs, the existence of STM[3] allows to to write mutable variables which are safe to use across threads. Very few languages offer something like this.<p>- For structural dependencies, you can apply the techniques of &quot;ghost of departed proofs&quot;[4]. Personally I don&#x27;t like to go that route since programming becomes an act of &quot;proving&quot; rather than &quot;doing&quot; but I appreciate the fact that you can encode it if you want&#x2F;need to.<p>- Metaprogramming in Haskell is not as ergonomic as in a LISP yet you have the full access to the language through TemplateHaskell[5]. A more constrained form is available as QuasiQuotations that allow you, for example to write a regex[6] string and have it compiled alongside the rest of the code.<p>There are other features that I personally think are still far ahead from the competition, like lenses[7] to traverse nested data, the async[8] package for ergonomic concurrent programs, effect systems[9] for more granular dependency injection, immutability by default to avoid corrupting state, full type inference, top level functions and values (I can&#x27;t believe the amount of times I find myself missing them in OOP languages like Java and C#), among others.<p>---<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackage.haskell.org&#x2F;package&#x2F;refined" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackage.haskell.org&#x2F;package&#x2F;refined</a>

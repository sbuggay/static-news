You can always use other languages if you don&#x27;t find the memory safety that important---after all, there are many other axes of safety to consider and balance.

That implies the bar to getting proficient is low. A person can reach intermediate more quickly implying the bar to the next levels is lower. And it’s easier to maintain a rust project due to cargo meaning a usable easy build system out of the box that the entire community uses vs opinionated choices each project has to do, and macros that are easier to manage than preprocesser mess. So easier to maintain and easier to jump into any project. Oh and tests and mictobenchmarks out of the box and a very rich ecosystem of supporting libraries.<p>Idiomatic rust is simpler than idiomatic c++ and it’s clearer what constitutes idiomatic rust whereas c++ in practice is rarely idiomatic and there are going to be conflicting ideas on what is idiomatic.<p>This is ignoring the very real benefits of rarely to never dealing with a whole class of difficult to debug bugs (threading and memory safety) in the vast majority of code you’ll write .</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41387758" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41387758" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blub</span><span>|</span><a href="#41387352">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41387403">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41387932">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41387758">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41387758">[15 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Here’s another quote from the same guy:<p>“Enji Cooper asked Somers why he had not used smart pointers in the change, to which Somers said &quot;it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not real great with C++&quot;.

the Rust for Linux project.<p>I am retiring from the project. After almost 4 years, I find myself lacking the
energy and enthusiasm I once had to respond to some of the nontechnical
nonsense, so it&#x27;s best to leave it up to those who still have it in them.<p>To the Rust for Linux team: thank you, you are great. It was a pleasure working
with you all; the times we spent discussing technical issues, finding ways to
address soundness holes, etc. were something I always enjoyed and looked
forward to. I count myself lucky to have collaborated with such a talended and
friendly group.<p>I wish all the success to the project.<p>I truly believe the future of kernels is with memory-safe languages. I am no
visionary but if Linux doesn&#x27;t internalize this, I&#x27;m afraid some other kernel
will do to it what it did to Unix.<p>Lastly, I&#x27;ll leave a small, 3min 30s, sample for context here:

After my 9-5 C# Job nowadays I usually spend a few hours programming with my friends.<p>I was extremely skeptical of Rust, due to the hype and some very obnoxious Rust proponents. I learned Rust, I&#x27;m still learning it, but I&#x27;ve shipped a few smaller backend apps and worked on a few larger projects now.<p>The main reason why I think that Rust should replace C++ in all new projects is actually very simple: Tagged unions, pattern matching, reflection, no OOP and the toolchain.
There is a lot of syntax in Rust that is beautiful, but besides that, those are the most useful features. They save hundreds to thousands of lines of code per codebase, compared to C++. The Option&lt;T&gt; alone is a simple<p><pre><code>    enum Option&lt;T&gt; {
        Some(T),
        None,
    }
</code></pre>
Whereas in C++, std::optional&lt;T&gt; is a massive class with edge cases, weird implicit conversions ({} = std::nullopt, beware), and don&#x27;t even start with differences between different STL implementations. What about `std::make_optional`? At least C++23 adds monadic operations like `.and_then()`, but with the &quot;let&#x27;s capture by reference why not&quot; lambdas in C++, you easily have dangling references in your lambdas if you do anything multithreaded.<p>In Rust, I just write code, and if it compiles, it runs and does *exactly* what it says. I don&#x27;t have to run the code to see if it crashes just because I&#x27;m using multiple threads, or a bunch of tokio async tasks. In C++, sure, if it compiles you cleared the first hurdle, but about 60% of the time the code has edge cases you&#x27;re not considering. Most if not all C++ code I&#x27;ve seen makes assumptions about the lifetimes of things, and&#x2F;or uses globals, and&#x2F;or happily uses shared pointers in ways that they were not designed. Anything using `boost::asio` is a gigantic clusterfuck of &quot;make sure you pass by value, by rvalue reference, or as a shared pointer&quot; that, of course, not a single linter or compiler will tell you about if you don&#x27;t. They don&#x27;t have to tell you, because that&#x27;s UB, and that probably crashes horribly, but maybe not!<p>I can&#x27;t wait for more people to use Rust so their ecosystem matures a little more.</div><br/><div id="41388375" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41388375" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lionkor</span><span>|</span><a href="#41388353">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41388637">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41388375">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41388375">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To add: The only people I know who think C++ is easy to write &quot;good&quot; code for, and who think that you can &quot;just&quot; be careful and skilled, have NEVER written multithreaded server code in C++.<p>Hit a multithreaded C++ server with 20k users a day alone and you would not believe the edge cases and weird states they will generate for you.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41388637" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41388637" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">leni536</span><span>|</span><a href="#41388353">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41388375">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41387743">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41388637">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41388637">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Lambda captures are explicit in C++, so if you dislike capturing by reference then just don&#x27;t.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41387743" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41387743" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sakras</span><span>|</span><a href="#41388353">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41386861">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41387743">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41387743">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Am I understanding correctly that they are proposing to add Rust to only userspace packages, not the kernel like in Linux?

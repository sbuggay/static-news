If you&#x27;re developing an alternative implementation, you probably have a different architecture from the canonical version, and things that are easy to do in the main implementation might be very difficult to do in yours.<p>Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a piece of proprietary software for creating financial reports[1], which is using a weird binary format to store their documents. You want to make  a free alternative, which can load and save these documents. The format is not fun to deal with, so you have a single function that loads the whole document into memory and one that dumps your data structures back to disk and entirely overwrites the file, but you operate purely on in-memory data while the software is running. What you don&#x27;t know is that the proprietary software doesn&#x27;t do this, it was developed in the days when users had very little RAM, so it only loads and saves the section the user is currently operating on, and knows how to modify the document in-place.<p>Then, the proprietary software introduces a way to add attachments to their documents. People keep adding stupidly large files, recordings of investor calls, scanned PDFs with hundreds of pages and so on. THe proprietary software loads documents one section at a time, so this works just fine. You, on the other hand, always deserialize the entire document at once, which suddenly becomes a problem when the documents are bigger than the users&#x27; available RAM memory. You now basically have to re-architect the entirety of your software, to support a change that took a week of a single developer&#x27;s time for the main implementation.<p>[1] a purely hypothetical example, I&#x27;ve never actually worked in this space.</div><br/><div id="40340192" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40340192" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gizmo686</span><span>|</span><a href="#40338087">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40338691">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40340192">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40340192">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I work in an industry that requires 2 seperate implementations of all critical software components; so I have been involved in several reimplemenations to help satisfy that. There are definitely times where I saw a feature and thought &quot;the original implementation was obviously doing X; and this feature does not really make sense given our architecture&quot;. However, I have never needed to rearchitect my program to implement the feature. The only real difference is that a trivial feature for one program takes a bit of work on the other. However, I could also point to functionality that took more work to implement on the original program, that the different implementation made trivial on the second program.<p>I have only had to do 1 major rearchitecturing, and that was on the original implementation, which had some architectural assumptions that forced an exponential blowup. I&#x27;m wasn&#x27;t working on the second implementation, but they started years after us, and managed to avoid our mistake from the beginning.<p>To take a public example, that is far more complicated than anything I have worked on, consider the problem of running Windows applications under Linux.<p>Linux is a completly different implementation of a kernel than NT, and doesn&#x27;t even attempt to be compatible. However, running Windows applications does not require a rearchitecture. Just a few relativly generic Kernel features, and a userspace compatiblity layer. Not to say that Wine does not take a lot of effort to write and maintain; but not nearly as much effort as implementing Windows itself. And, it is running on top of a platform that never aspired to be Windows compatible. Wine does, however, suffer from the problem that the article points outs, in that it is perpetually behind Windows.  Wine also exemplifies a second problem, which is that bugs in the primary implementation end up being relied upon, so in order to be bug-for-bug compatible, you need to first discover what all the bugs you need to implement are.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40338691" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40338691" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">4death4</span><span>|</span><a href="#40338087">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40340192">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40338869">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40338691">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40338691">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; things that are easy to do in the main implementation might be very difficult to do in yours.<p>The author mentions this when they talk about the ease of implementing new features in an interpreted language vs. a compiled language.</div><br/><div id="40339039" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40339039" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">foota</span><span>|</span><a href="#40338087">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40338691">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40338869">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40339039">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40339039">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hm, this is true, but I think it&#x27;s worth pointing out that this is more general.

MicroPython seems to be somewhat successful, despite supporting little more than Python 3.4 (10 years old). It&#x27;s designed to run on microcontrollers so it&#x27;s not competing with CPython - it&#x27;s competing with other microcontroller programming environments.<p>OTOH, I&#x27;m sure the MicroPython maintainers get a lot of feature requests for more recent Python features. I once considered building an alternative implementation of Python that&#x27;s lightweight and focused on embedding in applications - again, it wouldn&#x27;t be competing with CPython, but with Lua.

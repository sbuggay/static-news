On the one hand, being in perfect health, unaccustomed to suffering and therefore easily disconcerted by the thought of death, I was horrified. My attitude toward death was like that of a young person standing blindfolded and tied to a post, awaiting a volley from a firing squad. The whole concept made my blood run cold. Yet the case also aroused in me a feeling of relief. Simply put, there was no risk of malpractice, as my patient was already dead. Many anaesthesiologists have such self-centred thoughts when taking care of ASA 6 patients.<p>&gt; After we moved her from the gurney to the operating table, the doctors and nurses, so used to taking care of living patients, stared at one another stupidly, as if not knowing why they had come together or why they stood around the table.<p>Sorry this strikes me as embellishing for the case of writing a story.<p>Background: I was a neurosurgery resident at a level 1 trauma center. I was involved in determining brain death (though the final certification was by an attending surgeon). I worked closely with the transplant team. I declared (normal) cardiac death many times. I had many agonizing conversations with families about withdrawal of care.<p>Anesthesia is a 4 year residency. Even the 2nd year anesthesia residents I worked with had more of an awareness and lack of naivety that this author shows.<p>And the OR teams were much more prepared and professional than this. They knew what they had to do and why they had to do it.<p>If there are other physicians here, I would love to hear your opinions, but this whole piece strikes me as overwrought and full of embellishments to make a certain point.</div><br/><div id="40496632" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40496632" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ViktorRay</span><span>|</span><a href="#40496581">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40497310">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40496632">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40496632">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes I agree with you.

&gt; the doctors and nurses, so used to taking care of living patients, stared at one another stupidly, as if not knowing why they had come together or why they stood around the table. For a brief moment, each one of us likely had the same supernatural vision, how for the past six hours, after being declared brain dead, this woman had lain under the measureless power of death. Six hours she had been officially dead. Six times had the hour hand on the clock moved – and she had lain dead. Now she had re-entered the world of the living.<p>I saw that reaction to death exactly two times during morgue drop offs: once from a younger L&amp;D nurse—although I think it was more the inside of the morgue walk-in creeping her out—and once from an ER nurse with a 9 year old (asthma attack). Never from any doctor, although granted I almost never saw any doctors at all at that shitty community hospital. I don’t think it really stops being weird, I think it’s baked into our brains just like arachnophobia in some people, but I’d be concerned if an OR team, let alone a transplant team, were sitting around in silence like that. Usually they listen to the radio.<p>It’s fairly common for people to be paid by special interest groups and lobbyists to put their names on ghostwritten articles. It’s what got Amber Heard in trouble. I could see it happening to doctors.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40496859" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40496859" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">elzbardico</span><span>|</span><a href="#40496581">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40497310">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40497161">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40496859">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40496859">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">aeon, atlantic, the new yorker.

More often than not, I have experienced doctors&#x27; being wrong about my health status, and recommending treatment that ultimately does me more harm than good. How could I trust that same class of people to make as important a decision as this, knowing it&#x27;ll be luck of the draw which one I get the day of some fateful accident? Even if I can name the person finally responsible for authorizing taking my organs, they&#x27;re going to be doing it trusting the judgment of whichever doctor happens to be on shift.<p>We also can&#x27;t know if--and if so, how often--they get it wrong. As the author mentions repeatedly, we can&#x27;t know when &quot;brain death&quot; is &quot;real death,&quot; or whether the medications given to preserve organs prior to cardiac death actually cause &quot;real death.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s the most important set of dice I can possibly roll. How can I make that bet? How can I bet that these people will accurately assess when I&#x27;m dead, even if I were to remove potential conflicts of interest from calculation entirely and grant that they were purely well-meaning? Even if the chance of being wrong were miniscule, the consequence to me of being on the wrong end of it is total.<p>I wish we could find a way to revive organs after death rather than having to keep them in a quasi-alive state.

Primary Care is in deep trouble and will only get worse.<p>I nominally have a Primary Care doctor that works for a large health care org - nonprofit that pays its CEO ~$18M&#x2F;year. When he was new and had few patients, he took time and initiative.  Since then and especially after Covid, his attention to detail has dropped and his bosses increasingly dictate what he can and cannot do. He has to refer specialists within the health care org if they have that specialty. On a couple of occasions he has suggested I go to a specialist but he has no names to recommend.  He is perfectly happy to be a salaried employee where the nuts and bolts of running a practice are taken care of by his company.  He won&#x27;t say how many patients he has on his roster but given the time to get an appointment it must be in the hundreds. The front office pushes Urgent Care whenever they can which dumps the whole concept of a doctor who knows you into the toilet.  Pay a premium (natch) for someone who doesn&#x27;t know you and doesn&#x27;t give a damn (see the reviews).<p>He is required to type 90wpm into the Epic system which prompts him on what to do during the 10-15 minutes he is authorized to spend on me.  I am fortunately alert and functional when I have seen him but when that is no longer the case, I am well and truly hosed.<p>If by Direct Primary Care you mean &quot;Concierge medicine&quot; where one pays a private practice Doctor a yearly fee for improved access, I tried that as well before the guy above.  The doctor was a big talker when selling his practice but he was scatterbrained, unfocused, and inept in actuality spending more time talking about his extreme politics than actually paying attention during the exam and my questions.  I bailed after a physical exam and followup.<p>Before that I had Kaiser which is beneath contempt.<p>Every doctor, medical org, and insurance talks up the relationship between patient and primary care but once you&#x27;re in, it&#x27;s a f&amp;*king joke.  There are no success stories I can find among my coworkers and acquaintances.

The plasma is where most of the hormones reside while being transported, so in packed RBC transfusions, there will almost no transfer of hormones. This makes it so that blood type is pretty much the only important factor when determining whether somebody can receive blood.<p>Sometimes doctors do perform whole blood transfusion which does not have the blood plasma removed. This has the chance of increasing hormonal levels temporarily in the recipient. However, the body will quickly compensate and bring levels back to normal. Even if not, the hormones will still degrade and lose their effectiveness over time.<p>Side note: everybody has both male and female hormones in their body, at different levels. These levels can change a lot depending on your age, genetics, menstrual cycle, or even the time of day. As long as there is no prolonged increase in the levels of a particular hormone, there won&#x27;t be any abnormal effects.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40497560" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40497560" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yellowapple</span><span>|</span><a href="#40498225">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40496575">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40497560">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40497560">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The article reads a lot like two articles in a trenchcoat:<p>1. a personal account of the procedural and philosophical weirdness of treating a body with a dead brain but otherwise-alive organs as simultaneously alive and dead<p>2. a criticism of the anticipated role of artificial intelligence and its perceived lack of bedside manner<p>Article #1 is compelling.  One of my relatives is an anesthesiologist and I&#x27;m tempted to reach out to her to ask whether she&#x27;s ever treated an ASA 6 patient and (if so) what her own thoughts are on that procedural and philosophical weirdness.  Brain death is something that fascinates me on both those fronts - stark evidence that the line separating life v. death is fuzzier and more context-dependent than a lot of people would want to admit.  The possibility for a body to be living while the organ responsible for what we usually call &quot;personhood&quot; is permanently dead is a centrally-shared influence behind my views on everything from abortion to animal rights to artificial intelligence to the afterlife.  What even <i>is</i> death if pieces of us continue to live on separate from ourselves?<p>Article #2 doesn&#x27;t feel as compelling.  It seems to come out of nowhere, and I don&#x27;t think its premises are particularly well-founded.  In particular, the conclusion in the last paragraph:<p>&gt; AI promises to elevate healthcare; but, to the degree that it replaces doctors and nurses, it also threatens to depersonalise patients and to wash off their distinctive colours until everyone has the same drab tint.<p>I don&#x27;t perceive AI as the thing that&#x27;s doing that.  That depersonalization was a foregone conclusion the very moment someone came up the idea of privatizing healthcare.  In the case of organ donation specifically, that depersonalization is more than offset by the <i>re</i>personalization of those organs inside of someone who needs them; organ recipients and the loved ones of organ donors alike express all sorts of feelings of connectedness through those donated organs - as if the donor, at least in some sense, continues to live through the recipient.  Indeed, a part of that donor&#x27;s body <i>does</i> continue to live through the recipient, and there&#x27;s a poignant beauty there that no amount of corporate-driven distillation of patients into insurance records and HL7 streams can ever hope to &quot;wash off&quot;.</div><br/><div id="40497645" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40497645" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tivert</span><span>|</span><a href="#40497560">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40496575">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40497645">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40497645">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;&gt; AI promises to elevate healthcare; but, to the degree that it replaces doctors and nurses, it also threatens to depersonalise patients and to wash off their distinctive colours until everyone has the same drab tint.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t perceive AI as the thing that&#x27;s doing that.

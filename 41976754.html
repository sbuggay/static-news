Tipping meant you left your change behind once in a while only if you felt the desire to show appreciation. It wasn&#x27;t an obligation. Yes, I still do think it&#x27;s a funny story.

  [1] FWIW, I hate tipping too. Fuck the till based tips with the ever increasing percentages. I frequently click 0. But fuck it man, I&#x27;m a grad student. Still, if I&#x27;m a regular somewhere and they are giving me special service, I&#x27;m gonna throw a few dollars into the tip jar.

The business&#x2F;servers can&#x27;t renegotiate the menu like that - if they aren&#x27;t getting paid for a service and the customer didn&#x27;t ask for it then there is no reason they should get more money for it.<p>Also, an observation about how the economics of regulars work - if you are a regular the business is probably already making a lot of money off you. Someone who goes back even a single time earns them 2x as much as a one-time walk in. Being a regular is already a favour to a business even if all you do is order something cheap off the menu. In my experience, when a business identifies that I am a regular they try to make me pay less to keep me coming back.</div><br/><div id="41980237" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41980237" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">antaviana</span><span>|</span><a href="#41978402">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41979531">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41979408">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41980237">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41980237">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Actually, there is a restaurant where I go sometimes that when I pay cash instead of with a credit card, the owner gets so elated that rounds down the amount to pay in some 3-7%.

Zune was like that, but the best example is windows phone, version 8 more precisely which is the first proper modern smartphone version.<p>Google realized that if they want to stand a chance in catching up to the iPhone, they need to shove android in people&#x27;s faces, and lure in devs.<p>Microsoft entered the game (WP8) when android already had a foothold, making it even harder. They started with a mostly empty app store, and while they were clever enough to make sure the most widely used apps would be available by effectively bribing those big companies to develop windows phone apps, they pretty much gave the middle finger to all the small indie devs. I remember when android 2 was around I just downloaded android studio and played around a bit, making a simple scrobbler app for my Samsung device. Sideloadong was king back then, but even up to this point I had to pay zero bucks and jump through no hoops to try this out. I don&#x27;t remember what putting this on the Google play store would&#x27;ve cost me back then, but not much.<p>The windows phone experience was: sign up for a dev account to download visual studio with WP support. Start up VS, asked for your account again. I think in the beginning this was actually a paid account, probably because apple did it that way and again, you&#x27;re Microsoft so act like you already own the place. But later in they reversed course here at least and you could log in with a free account.<p>So you start building a small test app and then you want to run it in the shipped emulator but surprise! Your laptop only shipped with windows 8 home which doesn&#x27;t include virtualization features, so tough. So the only way to test the app was to push it to your phone, which was another overly complicated mess where your phone had to be in developer mode and you could only &quot;sideload&quot; one app at a time, iirc. The result was an app store with mostly tumbleweed. Whatever small utility or gimmick you wanted, when on android a search would give you dozens of results, on WP, there was maybe 4, and 3 of them almost unusable and abandoned.<p>I&#x27;m not blaming ballmer for having decided this specifically, but holy hell how did this pass any meetings with the higher-ups? You&#x27;re uo against two tech giants who have a head-start of a few years, you try to get people to switch to your platform by being pricey, having no apps, and being hostile to smaller devs?<p>The same played out with all the phone makers, who had to pay license fees for WP when android was free to use. Guess which phones were cheaper in the end. And when Microsoft bought Nokia, Nokia had the unfair advantage of getting WP for free, making it even less attractive for others to compete in that sector.<p>And let&#x27;s not get into the botched Nokia acquisition because I also don&#x27;t think this can be blamed on ballmer that easily, or primarily.</div><br/><div id="41981051" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41981051" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">creesch</span><span>|</span><a href="#41978723">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41980117">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41978980">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41981051">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41981051">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The windows phone experience was: sign up for a dev account to download visual studio with WP support.

With Mozilla AMO you can just add individual developers to your extension by mail, and with Google it is as easy as setting up a group.<p>With browser extensions specifically (and Edge as well) you can also clearly see where it is still a dedicated motivated internal team setting things up and where things were handed over to more general teams and support was also outsourced to somewhere else.<p>Anyway, my main point is that even now, many years later, Microsoft still struggles in this area making me think this is more fundamental to the company culture and way of operating.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41978980" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41978980" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dataflow</span><span>|</span><a href="#41978723">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41979581">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41980308">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41978980">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41978980">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t know anything more than the next guy here, but just reading this, it seems like a really underrated and insightful comment.

Ballmer was not a cool, trendy, or fun CEO who people rallied behind - but he more or less &quot;got the job done&quot;. He was the captain of a massive ship with a turning radius the size of a continent guiding it through icebergs.<p>Azure&#x27;s success was specifically set in motion under Ballmer. Owed to the fact that it was developed to Microsoft&#x27;s strengths (enterprise support) that it didn&#x27;t piss off too many of their partners and sales channels. Same with Office 365 and all of their other successful services. None are glamourous - but all are impressive with how not awful they are given their design constraints.<p>Even things like Surface, while considered a failure, did its intended job of getting hardware partners to get their act together and make better consumer products.</div><br/><div id="41978721" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41978721" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vjust</span><span>|</span><a href="#41977299">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41978547">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41978721">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41978721">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ballmer hated Linux &amp; open source.

Microsoft survived and thrived once Ballmer had no option but leave.<p>In this era of Python development, Microsoft Windows still feels a step or two behind as far as using a Windows laptop for coding in the cloud.

In Azure you have one user account and one org, with subscriptions for your user account to activate to get permissions. You can have multiple subscriptions but they&#x27;re under the same login&#x2F;user account and you can have multiple active at the same time. In AWS, you get access to an account or accounts that have different logins, so you get to juggle those with login&#x2F;logout, even if there&#x27;s SSO. In GCP, there are multiple projects, under a single login, but you may have to juggle projects.<p>The other aspect is how regions are dealt with. AWS global resource index&#x2F;search thing is useful, but it totally feels like I spend more time juggling regions with AWS. Azure&#x27;s regions themselves are, let&#x27;s just say, interesting.

Choosing to further a monopoly seems that it would be a phenomenally bad decision for the company.<p>Despite that, Windows remains the dominant operating system for businesses worldwide. So I would argue that the OS is far from &quot;irrelevant&quot;.<p>Beyond the OS, they are comfortably #2 in the public cloud market, with little threat from #3. Indeed, #1 has been relatively stagnant in market share, while Azure has been steadily growing.[0] It seems that a consistently growing market share in such a large industry shows that not only are they relevant, but they are becoming more so, and have not &quot;lost their ability to become relevant&quot;. Additionally, it seems that they <i>are</i> &quot;overcoming competition&quot;.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s a decline from being the monopolist to simply a player ....<p>&gt; MS should&#x27;ve been able to keep control of the internet, but they lost their moat to Google (Chrome),<p>They legally could not maintain that monopoly. Again, see the antitrust ruling. The antitrust case was about the impact on Netscape, and was too late to save Netscape. But it is a pretty straight line from a case about bundling IE with the OS.<p>To be clear, the finding in this case originally held that Microsoft needed to be broken up.[1] Microsoft won on appeal, because of impropriety by the original judge in the case, but the appeals court upheld all findings of fact.[2]<p>Much of what you are saying Microsoft should have been able to do on the basis of their OS monopoly would have been begging for further antitrust action.<p>&gt; Bing was a decent win<p>Bing, on its own, would be the 12th largest tech company in the world, per the original article.<p>And Microsoft is worth $3T today, largely on the basis of investment under Ballmer (and continued strong execution under Satya).

If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve read into my comment, that is reflective of your perspective, not mine. IE was never that good. It was bundled with the predominant operating system, so had massive market share. As soon as Microsoft had to open the OS more and draw a line between OS and IE, it was pretty much inevitable that there would be other browsers. And too-aggressive positioning of IE would be highly legible to regulators.<p>I agree that, absent regulatory scrutiny, Microsoft could have flexed muscle here to effect different outcomes in the general internet space. I disagree that such a decision would be a good idea for Microsoft in the climate of the aughts.<p>Server market share is tougher to find, but it appears that Microsoft captures a large majority of revenue in the server OS space. I know the install base proportion is smaller than the revenue proportion, but it seems to me that they are capturing most of the market willing to pay for a server OS.[0]<p>As to your 7 major battlefields and Microsoft&#x27;s major advantages:<p>1. Operating systems. Most other major OS vendors collapsed or were collapsing in the 90s. It seems naive to expect that there would continue to be no pressure on the OS front. Part of their dominance was circumstantial. Nevertheless, they continued to dominate desktop market share and server market share (both by revenue). Losing install share to OSes that people don&#x27;t pay for is expected, especially as those options improve.<p>Apple came over to x86, making MacOS (again, an OS that people don&#x27;t pay directly for) much more viable, because application developers no longer had to target two ISAs.<p>And mobile came to the fore. Consumer devices is a separate category, though.<p>Overall, I&#x27;d consider this a win for Microsoft and a continuing area of dominance, in the face of many new entrants and threats: ChromeOS; tablets becoming a viable option; Linux becoming usable for laypeople; and much of computing moving to the browser such that the OS doesn&#x27;t matter as much, yet Windows still dominates when OS doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>2. Search. Google was already positioned for market dominance in the early 2000s. Microsoft began their indexing project in the early 2000s. Other players entered and left the market. Amazon had a search engine, and they are all about the consumer market (especially before AWS). That folded in the mid aughts. Yahoo collapsed. AOL, Excite, Lycos, and many others failed. Yahoo now uses Bing&#x27;s index. DuckDuckGo uses Bing&#x27;s index.<p>Bing is a solid #2 in search, earning $10Bs annually. That is an entire business.<p>Microsoft started from a disadvantage on search and is #2. #2 is not a loss. Also definitely not an overwhelming victory, but the world is not binary. Writing off a business with $10Bs of revenue as a loss seems absurd ... may we all be so blessed as to lose like this.<p>3. E-commerce. Amazon was already positioned for dominance and was solely focused on this for the early aughts, and primarily focused on this for the duration of the aughts. Microsoft had no major presence here.<p>To make significant headway, Microsoft would have had to go against one of the most single-minded and aggressive companies that was out there. (Amazon is less single-minded today). And we know what Amazon&#x27;s successful strategy is in retail, and that is essentially no profit. Microsoft, both in terms of its corporate culture and in terms of its major shareholders, would never have been able to compete with Amazon in that way.<p>Microsoft had no major advantage here. This is certainly not a win, but they didn&#x27;t want a piece of it anyway.<p>4. Social. Do we count messengers as social media? If yes, then yeah Microsoft had MSN messenger. If we don&#x27;t count messaging, then they had no specific expertise or advantage here. In fact, many of their attempts at more lighthearted computing were panned: clippy, Microsoft Bob, Comic Sans. Microsoft has always been nerdy and never cool until others made nerds cool.<p>Regardless, they purchased Skype and LinkedIn and have a combined MAU of ~1.2B, putting them comfortably in the top 10 of social media companies.[1] I&#x27;ll note that this list includes Teams, but I&#x27;m going to count that as enterprise software, because it is included with almost every O365 SKU.<p>LinkedIn was a Satya purchase, so Ballmer can&#x27;t get credit there. Nevertheless, I wouldn&#x27;t argue that Microsoft had a major advantage for social media. I&#x27;d agree that they lost in this space.<p>Arguably you could put github in here, too, but also a Satya acquisition.<p>5. Consumer devices. Microsoft is a software company to its bones. Windows was a definite advantage here. But Microsoft does not have a strong history of device manufacture to lean on. They tried to acquire for this with Nokia. And yeah, they failed here.<p>Again, though, they were against one of the most single-minded and aggressive companies out there, this time Apple. And Apple already had the pedigree for prestige consumer devices. Apple was defining hip and cool with regard to technology through the aughts. Again, Microsoft is neither.<p>Additionally, they were up against another competitor for whom smart phone market share was an existential concern, Google. Google does not have the single-minded focus of Apple, but when it comes to threats to their core business (selling ads), they can execute well enough.<p>Microsoft does not have the single-minded focus of Apple, nor did they have the fundamental imperative to make something work on mobile that Google had. Still, Microsoft should have done better here, and in fact Windows Phone OS and devices were largely well reviewed. Nevertheless, they couldn&#x27;t make headway against their rivals.<p>Microsoft had an advantage here and lost.<p>6. Enterprise software. Microsoft was the dominant player and remains the dominant player in this space. O365 is undisputed. You will pry Excel from many people&#x27;s cold, dead hands. Microsoft may not be cool, but no other tech company has a product on ESPN. The Excel championship is something else.<p>And I will note, specifically, that O365 began under Ballmer.<p>Microsoft is also a huge player in data platforms. They have specific product wins and losses, but as a whole, they do very well in this space. Data is a specific niche of mine, and I can tell you that there is no other vendor than Microsoft that companies will routinely go all-in on for their data platform. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is not the norm, but I only ever see it happen on Microsoft, never for another vendor&#x27;s platform all-in.<p>I covered Windows Server above, but again I will note that they capture a large majority of server OS revenue share (which I argue is the category to measure this in).<p>Microsoft is a dominant player in this space, and I would count this as a win. It was part of their core business, and that business tripled sales and doubled profit under Ballmer.<p>7. Cloud. Amazon moved first. Microsoft followed quickly. They are #2 in the market and growing fast. Google is no threat to either Azure or AWS. Alibaba probably will be in the next 10 years.<p>Azure would not exist in the way it does today without significant investment under Ballmer.<p>#2 for a second mover (using &quot;second&quot; as &quot;non-first&quot;, here) is not at all a loss. And threatening to overtake the first mover is a powerful position to be in.<p>I expect you&#x27;ll disagree that any #2 position is worthwhile, or at least that seems to be your stance.<p>Regardless, I&#x27;d put the counts as:<p>Advantage: 4: OS, Enterprise software, cloud, consumer devices<p>Disadvantage: Search, E-commerce, Social<p>Competed: 6: OS, Enterprise software, cloud, consumer devices, search, social (questionable)<p>Success: 4&#x2F;5: OS, Enterprise software, Cloud, Search, Social (social only by acquisition, mostly post-Ballmer, but they were in a position to make multi-billion dollar acquisitions, so Ballmer can&#x27;t have ruined things)<p>Failure: 1&#x2F;2: Consumer devices, Social (if you want to argue that only Satya&#x27;s acquisitions count, and no credit toward Ballmer).<p>Did not compete: E-commerce<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;915085&#x2F;global-server-share-by-os&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;915085&#x2F;global-server-sha...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_social_platforms_with_at_least_100_million_active_users" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_social_platforms_with_...</a></div><br/><div id="41979094" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41979094" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">KaoruAoiShiho</span><span>|</span><a href="#41977135">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41978751">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41977955">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41979094">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41979094">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I don&#x27;t know who you&#x27;d buy it from, certainly not me. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve read into my comment, that is reflective of your perspective, not mine. IE was never that good. It was bundled with the predominant operating system, so had massive market share. As soon as Microsoft had to open the OS more and draw a line between OS and IE, it was pretty much inevitable that there would be other browsers. And too-aggressive positioning of IE would be highly legible to regulators.<p>I was not thinking about being more aggressive with bundling, but was commenting on the quality of IE. Not sure why you&#x27;re giving a pass on IE sucking. It&#x27;s not a coincidence that Ballmer, the Enterprise sales guy, developed an excellent enterprise sales machine at Microsoft. If he were a good tech guy he would&#x27;ve developed good tech there too. So yes, that Microsoft&#x27;s tech sucked is on him.<p>There&#x27;s a certain inertia to a huge company, if we&#x27;re talking about executive wins I expect something above what I consider the bare minimum. For example everyone agrees that Intel is a failed company, but if you actually look at them they still have majority marketshare of x86 CPUs in both client and server. So would you say that they successfully defended their traditional business or would you call them a failure? I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that if you strip away everything else about MS, and just look at Windows by its lonesome, it would be considered a loss today. It&#x27;s only bigger by dint of the entire market being larger. But in the market it has lost a lot of power vs the day Ballmer started.<p>So<p>1. OS - Loss IMO.<p>2. Search - Loss, similarly to above Bing is a bare minimum for what I expect a company of this size to do. Look at Sogou vs Baidu in China for example for what other companies are able to achieve. But all in all I&#x27;m knocking Ballmer less for Bing than for how late Bing was. For 9 years of his time as CEO we had trash MSN as MS&#x27;s search engine and the default through IE. Gave away all that time to Google to build incumbency, develop an ecosystem around gmail, etc, and grow their cash position. IE was a huge advantage for a long time... but by the time Bing came out it had eroded and Google Chrome was released. Microsoft was in a great advantageous position due to their Windows monopoly but acted too late to serve relevant products.<p>3. E-commerce - Loss, I wasn&#x27;t thinking about competing with Amazon but more the Windows Store, bookings.com, airbnb, and steam. Why did the windows store take until the app store to come out to copy them? Why did steam come out in 2003 and Microsoft did nothing? It&#x27;s because Ballmer isn&#x27;t smart enough to understand how these things work. By the time windows store came out it was very late, and once again the software sucked. Owning the operating system was an advantage that a good CEO could&#x27;ve made something of, and he didn&#x27;t.<p>4. Social - Loss, yeah MSN was a huge deal, along with windows to push it and later acquisition of skype, MS certainly did try. You can also consider something like Steam or xbox Live to be a social network. Regardless went nowhere and loss of opportunity. Certainly he made acquisitions too late and failed to make much of the social networks he had. Also anyone could&#x27;ve bought Instagram, anyone could&#x27;ve bought Youtube, he just didn&#x27;t. Bought Skype instead. Sure after him there&#x27;s more acquisitions but it has nothing to do with this discussion really.<p>5. Consumer devices - Loss, this one I&#x27;m most willing to give him a pass on actually. MS is mostly a software company, and partnerships are hard. But Zune was an alright product, and here is mostly a marketing fail. But wouldn&#x27;t you place blame for bad marketing on the CEO? You can also imagine there&#x27;s a lot more you can do with Zune. Microsoft had xbox too but never tried to get these parts together, letting Nintendo DS take the handheld market. Today zune is dead and xbox is not successful.<p>6. Enterprise Software - Unequivocal win, probably the best thing Ballmer did and most of his score.<p>7. Cloud - Win, acted not too late and was okay with it, Nadella fixed it though.<p>So definitely I would put E-commerce and social up into &quot;advantaged but loss&quot; and I tried to explain why I count search and OS as loss.</div><br/><div id="41979494" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41979494" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bigstrat2003</span><span>|</span><a href="#41977135">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41979094">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41979169">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41979494">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41979494">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; For example everyone agrees that Intel is a failed company...<p>You are literally the first person I&#x27;ve ever seen say this.

It may well turn out that we are witnessing Intel&#x27;s death spiral, but to claim that with certainty, and further to ascribe that belief to &quot;everyone&quot; tells me that we see the world incredibly differently.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.yahoo.com&#x2F;quote&#x2F;INTC&#x2F;analysis&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.yahoo.com&#x2F;quote&#x2F;INTC&#x2F;analysis&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="41979318" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41979318" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">KaoruAoiShiho</span><span>|</span><a href="#41977135">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41979169">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41977955">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41979318">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41979318">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What does analyst have to do with anything?

I never met Ballmer but I heard some stories of people that did. Intense guy apparently. I was at two joint meetings with MS to discuss some of the details of things related to the thing I was working on. Ultimately that wasn&#x27;t transferred to MS.<p>MS made a big mess of the whole windows phone project. First it royally screwed Nokia over by deciding to do a big overhaul of Windows Phone OS internals and effectively leaving Nokia dead in the water with now obsolete products that they just launched. I&#x27;m sure this was intentional on Ballmer&#x27;s side: weaken Nokia and acquire their phone business. But he threw out the baby with the bathwater. The first generation of windows phone was basically windows CE repackaged. The second one was a whole new kernel (windows NT based, I guess). The transition took crazy long. MS announced early and this made the old generation of Lumia phones a really hard sell. There was a vague promise of upgrades that of course never happened. And then the acquisition rumors destroyed the OEM ecosystem because they&#x27;d be competing with MS on phones.<p>Then MS bought what remained of Nokia&#x27;s phone division and it got busy demolishing it right away (including an actual Nokia Android phone that existed). When Nadella inherited this train wreck, he unceremoniously put an end to the whole thing and fired pretty much the whole team. At that point it very little hope of catching up because the OEMs and users had left. As much as I loved Nokia, it was the right decision at that point. All the good stuff had long been killed&#x2F;cancelled already.<p>It was Ballmer&#x27;s fixation on Windows that led to this. Nokia had a bonafide Android competitor in the form of Meego. Backing Linux would have been the right move. Nadella might have approached this differently.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41978744" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41978744" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Nevermark</span><span>|</span><a href="#41977221">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41977118">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41978744">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41978744">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Microsoft under Ballmer made deep, long-term bets that set up Microsoft for success in the decades after his reign<p>This is no doubt true.<p>Under Ballmer, Nadella &quot;led a transformation of the company&#x27;s business and technology culture from client services to cloud infrastructure and services.&quot; [0]<p>But the number of failed mobile (phone, small PC) initiatives and products, from long before the iPhone to multiple waves of multi-billion dollar write downs afterward, (phones, music players, ...) despite Ballmer clearly wanting Windows &quot;everywhere&quot;, and no limit on his spending, was just as large of an opportunity, cyclically bungled for a couple decades.<p>I had one of the earlier generations&#x2F;extinct-species of Windows phone.

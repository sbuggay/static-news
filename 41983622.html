A pig selling ham, sausages and, presumably, cuts of pork is a bit morbid (and also hilarious in a black humor sort of way), but it fits in with the world so much that I didn&#x27;t even think twice about it as a kid. It just slid past me.<p>I still remember one of the books I had as a child—can&#x27;t recall the title exactly—that had a bunch of urban scenes with various objects labeled. What really stood out were the little details and funny little stories going on. The stories and the humor got me to pay attention and actually care about the objects (and their labels!) far more than any generic vocabulary book for kids.<p>What I love about Richard Scarry is that he is never patronizing or condescending. Too many authors of children&#x27;s books either try to write <i>down</i> to kids, try to write what they <i>think</i> kids ought to read, or both. But kids aren&#x27;t idiots and they can tell! Well, I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, but at least as a kid myself I found a lot of children&#x27;s works either patronizing or unpleasant—works that were trying too hard to be childlike or, especially, works that were transparent morality plays.<p>Scarry&#x27;s work is nothing like this at all. It&#x27;s oriented for and accessible to kids, but it manages to be simple and silly in a <i>genuine</i> way. The art and stories are actually cute and funny rather than caricatures of what an adult thinks a child would find cute and funny. You can tell Scarry was making something he would enjoy himself. That&#x27;s why I loved his books when I was five and why I still love his books now.<p>It&#x27;s hard to find other children&#x27;s books like that. I collect illustrated books and the majority I see in stores are awful. The most successful exception I&#x27;ve seen are books by Joe Klassen (of <i>I Want My Hat</i> fame) along with his common collaborator Mac Barnett. Their books are legitimately funny <i>and</i> visually attractive to adults, they&#x27;re willing to write stories that aren&#x27;t entirely saccharine, <i>and children absolutely love them</i>. I&#x27;ve seen that first-hand.</div><br/><div id="41993010" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41993010" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Lutger</span><span>|</span><a href="#41984730">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41985773">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41993010">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41993010">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for mentioning Jon Klassen, I&#x27;ll check it out. Our son absolutely loves busytown. We try to get most of our stuff second hand, the vast majority of books are terrible. And he knows. For at least 80 percent of the time, we are just re-reading busytown. And we have like 20 books or so that we might just as well get rid of.<p>Another one we really like is the Gruffalo, by Julia Donaldson. A classic, which is also really fun to read as an adult. I wish I know of more of these kinds of high quality children books.<p>Roald Dahl is another such writer who just doesn&#x27;t care and writes what is fun for kids to read. I loved his books when I grew up.

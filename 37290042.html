Hoare (1978-08), where it was named &quot;array of processes&quot;. Hoare was an important contributor to the definition of Occam.<p>The Occam &quot;replicated parallel&quot; (1985) is the same as the &quot;PARALLEL DO&quot; of OpenMP Fortran (1997-10) and the &quot;parallel for&quot; of OpenMP C and C++ (1998-10), i.e. the concurrent execution of many threads that share the same code.<p>This structure is essential for being able to use CPUs or GPUs with many cores, because if a programmer would have to write one thousand different function definitions, or even just one thousand different function invocations, in order to fully occupy a processor able to execute simultaneously one thousand threads, that would be hopeless.<p>That is why &quot;parallel for&quot; is the main structure used by CUDA, OpenCL and by the graphics shader languages, even if for some weird reason all these GPU-oriented programming languages use an obfuscated terminology, where many things have different names than in the rest of the computer-related literature, without any rational justification, so they do not say &quot;parallel for&quot;, but &quot;kernels&quot; or the like.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37290591" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37290591" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">OldGuyInTheClub</span><span>|</span><a href="#37290885">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37290945">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37290591">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37290591">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Now that&#x27;s a name I have not heard in a long time!

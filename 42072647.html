I&#x27;d like to share a few of my thoughts and experiences too.<p>English is often put on a very high pedestal. Speaking fluent English is associated with being &quot;elite&quot;.  A tech company in my city is slowly moving to doing all development work in English. I went to a casual tech talk event they held.  Every talk was given in Japanese and most of them started with a joke along the lines of &quot;[In English] Hello everyone, good evening! [In Japanese] Hahah, of course I&#x27;m not going to give the whole talk in English&quot;  It makes sense to give all the talks in Japanese to a Japanese speaking audience, but the whole vibe was that English was so impossible that the idea of giving a talk in English was absurd.<p>Some of my friends have kids with mixed-roots.  They have grown up speaking English and Japanese. They sometimes modify their English pronunciation to sound &quot;more Japanese&quot; when they start English classes in school.  They don&#x27;t want to stand out amongst their peers.<p>I remember one kid, who was tri-lingual. He told a story about being called upon in English class to translate the Japanese word for &quot;great-grandfather&quot;.  He translated it correctly but his teacher said &quot;No, it&#x27;s grand-grandfather&quot;. They teacher and the class laughed at him.  Of course, there are bad teachers everywhere but one wonders if the teacher would have tried to take him down a peg so much if he fit in a bit better. He ended up moving to Germany with his family. It makes me feel quite sad that a kid born and raised here can end up feeling more at home in a place he has no connection to.</div><br/><div id="42074701" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42074701" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anal_reactor</span><span>|</span><a href="#42074434">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42074541">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42074701">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42074701">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; It makes sense to give all the talks in Japanese to a Japanese speaking audience, but the whole vibe was that English was so impossible that the idea of giving a talk in English was absurd.<p>When I was a student I took some classes in English, and some in my native language. Having someone speak your native language makes things infinitely easier to understand and more engaging. Even if you&#x27;re a fluent speaker it&#x27;s still a foreign language, so it&#x27;s a mental hurdle. I can compare it to talking to a friend in a casual setting vs having a work meeting.<p>&gt; He translated it correctly but his teacher said &quot;No, it&#x27;s grand-grandfather&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s a trait of hierarchical societies. Questioning your superior is a bigger threat to the society than saying things that are objectively wrong.<p>While it&#x27;s a fair argument that English became the lingua franca and if you don&#x27;t speak it, you will be left behind, I feel like most Americans are completely oblivious to the idea that other cultures might exist. I work for an American company in Europe, and most of Americans don&#x27;t do any effort to learn the local language, and those who do, simply use local words to express their American thoughts.</div><br/><div id="42074827" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42074827" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TulliusCicero</span><span>|</span><a href="#42074434">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42074701">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42074541">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42074827">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42074827">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; those who do, simply use local words to express their American thoughts.<p>I feel like there&#x27;s almost the reverse stereotype of this for Americans living in Japan.

This article largely reinforces that theory.<p>If people do not have a need to learn another language, it becomes an uphill battle. People in Finland report higher levels of English competency than people in France (despite French being much closer to English than Finnish is) because there are so many fewer Finnish speakers. Finns wanting to experience warm beaches or global cities need to communicate when traveling to those places outside of Finland. France meanwhile has mountains, beaches, a big domestic market, ample media, and international reach.<p>Japan is much more like France than Finland - the geographic diversity allows one to ski or sunbathe within the same country. The domestic market for goods and services is huge. Japan creates and exports so much culture that English speakers wish to learn Japanese to consume more of it. When there is little &quot;need&quot; to learn another language, it is not only less enticing but actually harder to do so.<p>This culminates in anglophones being at a disadvantage in acquiring a L2 compared to nearly anyone else. A lot of people worldwide do want to practice their English with a native speaker. Many international institutions use English as the lingua franca. Even during a layover in Montreal, my (then) girlfriend ordered a smoothie in French and was replied to in English (this could be a commentary on Canadian bilingualism, but I&#x27;ll leave that for another day) - it&#x27;s <i>hard</i> for an anglophone to practice and perfect another language when the world around them already speaks better English than their L2.<p>So considering Japan&#x27;s strong domestic market, culture, and the stark differences between the languages, it was never a shock to me that their English proficiency isn&#x27;t where one would immediately expect it.

I don’t have much else to do in my free time so I “study”. These days, I even browse Reddit in my target language. I believe people are really quite capable of learning language, especially adults!

There is a certain phenomena where foreigners when they meet each other in the supermarket experience a moment of awkwardness like we entered each others TikTok feed. You don&#x27;t know if one should smile or not, nod, or ignore. One of the main reasons here is that foreigners in most non-tourist parts of Japan stick out like a sore thumb. Therefore, you are quickly falling into a main-character type of mindset. 
Then, for decades Japan has been the embodiment of the future. Most of William Gibsons cyberpunk work is build around Japan. That Tokyo in particular is a huge concrete Moloch that constantly bridges centuries old history and neon lights and tech underlines this. Anime&#x2F;Manga have established Japan as a new cultural leader as the west has falling behind telling engaging stories. The recent Netflix success of OnePiece and the Korean Squid Games are just two data points on this. Japan is mysterious.<p>With all that said, it may be the last true adventure into a unique culture that is challenging yet safe and accessible.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42074212" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42074212" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">twiceaday</span><span>|</span><a href="#42074137">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42074206">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42074905">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42074212">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42074212">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If I were to guess, Japan has a huge cultural presence in the west via comics, cartoons, and video-games.

(warning: not gonna be fun read)<p>* As far as I can tell, most Japanese programmers can read at least some portion of English software documentations<p>* English in Japan is always about the U.S. Not the U.K, not South Africa, not Singapore. I still remember my English teacher in the university, who was from South Africa, complained about that he was always assumed to be American.<p>* I find it interesting that, your article doesn&#x27;t mention on the Japan&#x27;s political dependence and subordination to the United States. The people who study at Tokyo Univ. are not commoners at all. They&#x27;re the political and economic ruling class elites, and don&#x27;t give a shit to the median Japanes people. They don&#x27;t have to learn English because...why do they have to?<p>* English is basically for the elites. As Tatsuru Uchida pointed out, most of LDP elites have learned in American universities. [0] They&#x27;re literally colonial elites.<p>&gt; 逆に、植民地的言語教育では、原住民の子どもたちにはテクストを読む力はできるだけ付けさせないようにする。うっかり読む力が身に着くと、植民地の賢い子どもたちは、宗主国の植民地官僚が読まないような古典を読み、彼らが理解できないような知識や教養を身に付ける「リスク」があるからです。植民地の子どもが無教養な宗主国の大人に向かってすらすらとシェークスピアを引用したりして、宗主国民の知的優越性を脅かすということは何があっても避けなければならない。だから、読む力はつねに話す力よりも劣位に置かれる。「難しい英語の本なんか読めても仕方がない。それより日常会話だ」というようなことを平然と言い放つ人がいますけれど、これは骨の髄まで「植民地人根性」がしみこんだ人間の言い草です。[1]<p>So, that&#x27;s the reason why they focus on the conversational English instead of reading&#x2F;writing. Seriously, &quot;you can teach tourists how to get to the station&quot; as a motivation to learn the language is insane. And that&#x27;s the elites want us Japanese commoners to learn in English education.<p>* My university English teacher (not the guy I mentioned earlier), who was a former bureaucrat who worked for the Ministry of Economy IIRC, told us that the Japan is a unique nation state, unlike the Western countries, that have kept single people and single language through the history. This <i>is</i> the Japanese ruling class. It was the most disgusting time I ever had in the univ, and that may be the reason I still feel very uncomfortable with English education.<p>* Although I&#x27;m very against the current English education, I genuinely believe learning English have improved my life. I can watch 3Blue1Brown on YouTube, I can read the books from Slavoj Zizek not translated in Japanese, and of course, I can post on HN!<p>* It&#x27;s important that, the means to fight against colonialism is <i>not</i> blindly praising the native culture (see how Japanese have internalized &quot;Japan is unique! Japan is cool!&quot; bullshit), but to understand the relativism of the history and cultural development, and take universal values like democracy and human rights seriously - more seriously than their inventors. While American politics is becoming a kind of tragic farce, I hope Japan will present itself as a <i>true</i> representative of those values. It&#x27;s unlikely to happen, but I hope so.<p>[0]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.tatsuru.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;10&#x2F;11_1037.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.tatsuru.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;10&#x2F;11_1037.html</a>

More likely that they look at you akwardly or say a joke and try to carry on.<p>Some artist couldn’t care less about colours. A sculptor thinks much more about shapes, a 3d animator thinks much more about motion.<p>A writer or poet cares a lot more about what connotations different colour descriptors carry. “The sky above the port was the colour of television, tuned to a dead channel.” doesn’t quite hit the same as just calling it grey, for example.<p>Painters have a much more intimate connection with colour. But instead of thinking in primary colours they will be much more familiar with the mixing of the pigments they use. (Cadmium red, cobalt blue, burnt sienna, etc)  A print artist or someone designing figurines or design objects would think in terms of pantone colours. Someone doing thread painting with embroidery floss will think about DMC colour codes.<p>And then of course there are colourist working on movie and TV productions who would know all the article describes and more. It is their job to know.<p>I don’t know why an otherwise quite okay article has to start with this image of the dum-dum arist “launching into a treatise” of kindergarden level colour understanding. It feels a bit degrading, as if the author has low opinion of artist. (And certainly not considering the full palette of the arts.)</div><br/><div id="40943864" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40943864" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Daub</span><span>|</span><a href="#40943668">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40943811">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40943864">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40943864">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In my experience, artists have a very fuzzy understanding of color, even those who use it wonderfully.

I see nothing in what he has written that supports the idea that Color Wheels are wrong.<p>Color wheels are, in essence, highly abstracted slices across the equator of a color space. Only two color wheels are commonly used: the RGB and the RYB (aka the artists color wheel). Color from pigments and color from light are two wildly different things, but easy to confuse. For its absence of green as a primary, CMYK can be understood as a version of RYB. Black is used not just because it is cheap but also to add opacity to the inks (printing inks are more like dyes... very thin and transparent).<p>The color opposites the author describes are red&#x2F;cyan in RGB and red&#x2F;green in RYB.<p>One property of these opposites is that they mix to neutral. For this, the RBG pair works best. The other property is that they are perceptually antagonistic, for which the RYB pair works best.<p>Interestingly, the perceptually antagonistic pair set (red&#x2F;green, yellow&#x2F;purple, blue&#x2F;orange) were spoken about well before Newton placed these colors in a circle. Leonardo Da Vinco refers to them as &#x27;retto contrario&#x27;, literally exactly opposite.<p>The author asks &#x27;why a wheel&#x27;? which is a good question, and the answer he gives is reasonable. But... Newton was the first to employ this device, and he did so almost certainly because the harmony structure of the musical scale was commonly visualized as a wheel, and Newton was keen to draw an analogy between music and color and harmony and the music of the spheres and god etc etc. He may have been the first physicist, but he was also an alchemist.<p>Color is a frustrating beast... so many different ways to understand the same thing: perception, physics, aesthetics, chemistry etc. Truly the seven blind men and the elephant.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40943488" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40943488" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rothron</span><span>|</span><a href="#40943811">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40943763">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40943488">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40943488">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This topic has been written about in more depth by people who didn&#x27;t try to work it out by themselves.<p>The classical artists color wheel is based on pigments. Printers use dyes. Screens use light. That&#x27;s the whole reason why the primaries are different. The wheels are just tools.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40943763" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40943763" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wirrbel</span><span>|</span><a href="#40943488">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40943787">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40943763">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40943763">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The way traditional artists think and thought about colors is definitely not in the shape of color wheels.<p>Traditional artists think in terms of palettes and of mixtures of colors on the palette. They also think about colors in relation to each other. They think of layering, and about the perception of the eye.<p>The point is, when you discuss colors as a multi-dimensional coordinate space, you already lost (from the perspective of the painter).<p>Painters will explore the medium they are working in for its capabilities. Is &quot;dark on bright&quot; (watercolors) or &quot;bright on dark&quot; (soft pastel) the way to go? Can I dilute and perform washes (watercolor), or will the medium break down (acrylic).<p>I can only recommend James Guerney&#x27;s &quot;Color and Light&quot; book to get impressions.<p>Then again, if you do digital art to scren, or if you are printing things from a computer, you need to anticipate how the devices render your colors. This is where color spaces and coordinate systems for colors and how to translate between them becomes relevant.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40943787" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40943787" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">robobro</span><span>|</span><a href="#40943763">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40943537">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40943787">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40943787">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Goethe... his contemporary Schopenhauer has interesting notes on color theor, from an historical perspective<p>Wittgenstein also wrote some interesting notes on color.

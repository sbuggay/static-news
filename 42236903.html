The main reason that these organizations need volunteers is, is because most folks don’t think they are worth supporting, financially.<p>This is often because they serve segments of the population that represent a small demographic, or because the causes they champion don’t enjoy mainstream support.<p>There are some organizations that abuse volunteers, but they are few and far between (but are treated as typical, when folks want to attack).<p>Also, when you pay for work, you get work, but there’s no guarantee of “heart.” In many cases, the emotional investment is worth far more than the financial worth.<p>I’ve been doing volunteer work for over 40 years. Much of it has been <i>extremely</i> valuable tech work, and much of that work has been treated in rather shabby fashion. When people get stuff for free, they often devalue it. This is common, in nonprofit work. It can certainly be maddening.<p>I do it anyway.

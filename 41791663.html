The project was experimental, Ford explains, and so there wasn&#x27;t any quantifiable success criteria that was set. But in Ford&#x27;s view, it&#x27;s been a resounding success. The dunes have already reached between one and three feet tall (30 to 90cm).<p>The whole article is aspirational fluff and projects such as these prevent us from forwarding solutions, that would rather work, versus some heartwarming stories.

I don’t have an answer for that, nor have I worked at a company that found the perfect balance. Plus, I’m not a technical lead, manager, or business owner. So if you are one of them, I’d love to hear how you or your organization plans to tackle this<p>I&#x27;m a technical lead, business owner, and ex-manager. So I guess I qualify to answer :)<p>The short answer is that we have only ever had a very (very) small development team. Typically around 3 or 4 people.<p>Secondly we&#x27;re using &quot;old&quot; tech, nut with up-to-date tooling. Our product contains code written in 1996 and iterated on since.<p>I&#x27;m lazy, and I&#x27;m not interested in writing it all again in some new language. So we haven&#x27;t done that. I&#x27;m lazy, so I&#x27;m not interested in re-architecting it every 5 minutes. I&#x27;m lazy so i prefer simple, maintainable, easy to read, code over cleverness.<p>Most of all, as a startup (boot strapped) I didn&#x27;t get paid in we didn&#x27;t make sales. (That happened a lot in the early years.) So shipping is a priority. Business is a priority. But since I&#x27;m lazy I avoid solutions that&#x27;ll break things, that&#x27;ll cause unnecessary work in the future.<p>I have enough autonomy to dictate pace of delivery. I have enough incentive to move the business forward (in the short and long term.) I don&#x27;t need to resume pad (this is the first ,and last, job I&#x27;ll ever have.)<p>Alas none of this advice is transferable. What works for me likely won&#x27;t work for you. Our context is likely too different.<p>So yeah, there are businesses in between the extremes. Ones with competent developers. Ones either competant managers. Ones where all the business interests are kept in balance. They are not easy to find.

While there are some limitations to the comparison this framing makes sense to business people in general, especially well with finance or operations departments, and can work with internal stakeholders too.<p>The sources of the depreciation are tech debt and general turnover&#x2F;churn in the method and process within an industry&#x2F;vertical (like if you built a web app in 2002 based on ASP.NET, it&#x27;s pretty tough for that to be a lively project today).<p>We know there are systems out there that have been running well and doing their job for 30 years, and there are systems that need to be replaced&#x2F;rewritten from scratch every couple of years. Which one do you want to buy&#x2F;fund&#x2F;budget for?<p>If the customer or stakeholder only cares about a two year horizon you approach the project one way. If they say they want this thing to be firing on all cylinders 10 years from now then we approach it and price or budget for it differently. When you talk like this it doesn&#x27;t sound too weird to introduce the idea that we should do an annual tune-up to a system that they don&#x27;t want to have to replace until 2035. The tune-up is how you get 15 years of life out of your intellectual property instead of 10, this is how you sell time to pay down tech debt. The eventual rebuild is also part of the discussion (not if it will happen, because it will. But when it will happen is something we can influence, so the framing can be, would you rather do an expensive rebuild every 10 years, or do it in 15-20 because you paid for a regular maintenance along the way?).<p>Boom now in their head this software you&#x27;re writing is like a car. Everyone understands cars. A car has a lifespan. If you didn&#x27;t go to the mechanic and do your annual scheduled maintenance and the car breaks down, that&#x27;s what you get for being cheap. Like I said big ops and finance departments actually really like the idea of a tuneup that prevents the car from breaking down. They&#x27;re used to thinking about that with lots of physical assets anyway. A marketing department at a startup maybe not so much but their time horizon is usually short anyway.</div><br/><div id="38187963" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38187963" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rahkiin</span><span>|</span><a href="#38186409">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38187544">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38186333">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38187963">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38187963">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you, this is very insightful and I might try this to explain software.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38186333" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38186333" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">latchkey</span><span>|</span><a href="#38186409">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38187530">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38186333">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38186333">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; There must be a middle ground where developers can focus on the core business logic that yields the most value without incurring technical debt and making the development process a nightmare.

We had 4 developers and 4 consultants, so we mostly paired up and that was super productive. Pivotal tracker was better than Jira. They had a strong focus on getting something working and collaborating. It was eye-opening.<p>Unfortunately, the company was picking 4 random employee developers from across the organization each week. Most of the organization was contractors, including everyone on my team aside from me. My team used Jira and had no option to use something else.

So you generally get the best of the best on consulting agreements like that.<p>I&#x27;ve heard some horror stories about Pivotal as well. Not everyone or every project was perfect. Their pricing is also insane. I&#x27;m sure your company paid through the roof for what you got.<p>But overall, the general education that I got there for how to run projects and build products is hands down the best thing I&#x27;ve ever learned in software engineering.

These things have existed before microservices, and will continue to exist.<p>A good DI implementation allows for one to define these business services as interfaces and implementations within an initial monolith, and then trivially reimplement those interfaces against an API or RPC when it comes time to scale. Interfaces can be separated out into a common library which can be referenced in all parts of the system. I am simply curious as to why this has been so staunchly avoided over the past decade of microservices hype.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38187312" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38187312" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yeswecatan</span><span>|</span><a href="#38186648">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38187429">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38186789">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38187312">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38187312">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is an interesting paper and one I would never have found on my own.

Yes, nominally everyone is trying to do this, but in practice this comes down to a lot of tradeoffs in terms of timeframes, team sizes, and maintainability&#x2F;scalability.  Even if you have balanced perspectives, what usually ends up happening in larger corporations is some group has a louder voice and more power, and ends up influencing decisions in a way that is globally suboptimal because executives are too busy, and local managers are too focused on their own silos&#x2F;perf evaluation.<p>For example, complexity is often built into the product and systems according to the resourcing allocated to a particular problem at a certain point without a full understanding of the implications over time.  However, when that complexity is found to have a poor ROI there is then a natural aversion to removing it because at that point it&#x27;s hard to quantify how exactly the business depends on it.  This creates a tax on the entire org, which many can observe, but structuring incentives to fix is fiendishly difficult, especially in comparison to new growth opportunities that get executives, board members and investors excited.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38186431" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38186431" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chefandy</span><span>|</span><a href="#38186082">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38186242">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38186425">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38187892">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38186431">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38186431">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">People aren&#x27;t that self-aware though.

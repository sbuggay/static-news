In retrospect, I’m not 100% sure why it earned this reputation, because the configuration file format, which is plain text, has remained essentially the same since I started using Linux in the mid-1990s.<p>It&#x27;s because X&#x27;s config files were asking you questions that there was no good way of knowing the answers to other than trial-and-error. (After all, if there was some OS API already available at the time to fetch an objectively-correct answer, the X server would just use that API, and not ask you the question!)<p>An example of what I personally remember:<p>I had a PS2 mouse with three mouse-buttons and a two-axis scroll wheel (&quot;scroll nub.&quot;) How do I make this mouse work under X? Well, X has to be told what each signal the mouse can send corresponds to. And there&#x27;s no way to &quot;just check what happens&quot;, because any mouse calibration program is relying <i>on</i> the X server to talk directly to the mouse driver — there wasn&#x27;t yet any raw input-events API separate from X — so in the default X configuration that assumes a two-button mouse, none of the other buttons on the mouse get mapped to an X input event, so the mouse calibration program won&#x27;t report <i>anything</i> when you try the other parts of the mose.<p>So instead, you have to make a random guess; start X; see if the mouse works; figure out <i>by the particular way it&#x27;s wrong</i> what you should be telling X instead; quit X; edit the config file; restart X; ...etc.<p>(And now imagine this same workflow, but instead of something &quot;forgiving&quot; like your mouse not working, it&#x27;s your display; and if you set a resolution + bit-depth + refresh rate that add up to more VRAM than you have, X just locks up the computer so hard that you can&#x27;t switch back to a text console and have to reboot the whole machine.)</div><br/><div id="40938831" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40938831" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">robinsonb5</span><span>|</span><a href="#40938693">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40941602">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40938831">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40938831">[18 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yup, things are so much better now that they just work.

Copy everything past &quot;Modeline&quot; into a cut buffer.<p><pre><code>    % xrandr --newmode &lt;paste the line from above&gt;

Keep a note of the first line in the field, it will look something like &quot;1920x1080_60&quot;, this is the &quot;mode name&quot;<p>Next, find out what your monitor is named:<p><pre><code>    % xrandr | grep &#x27; connected &#x27;
</code></pre>
It will be HDMI-1 or VGA-1 or something like that, this is your &quot;interface name&quot;.<p>Now add the mode to your monitor specification:<p><pre><code>    % sudo xrandr --addmode &lt;interface name&gt; &lt;mode name&gt;
</code></pre>
Finally, switch to the new mode:<p><pre><code>    % xrandr --output &lt;interface name&gt; --mode &lt;mode name&gt;

I am mindful about what families of hardware I buy, though, but that&#x27;s not too restrictive.  The only piece of hardware of mine that needs manual configuration is the Logitech TrackMan Marble, but that&#x27;s only because I operate the mouse with a right-handed layout with my left hand.  Interestingly the TrackMan Marble does not work with its full feature set in Wayland (core example: the buttons to enable horizontal&#x2F;vertical panning of a wide or tall document), and this is not exotic hardware.  How configuration is being handled in the X to Wayland conversion is a mystery to me.  Some of it is happening in libinput (I think), but other parts aren&#x27;t.  This is one of the reasons I am deferring the Wayland migration for as long as I can.<p>Configuring software stack that runs (think: what the ~&#x2F;.xsession file manages) is the place I&#x27;ve invested most of my effort, and that&#x27;s purely about aesthetics and behavior: DPI, font rendering settings, window manager, etc.  And this is pretty easy to do these days, because most of these things can prototyped and altered in an existing X session (keeping a tight edit-run loop).<p>And both of these situations can be alleviated by storing critical configuration files (e.g., ~&#x2F;.xsession or the X Server configuration) under version control.  There&#x27;s no point in having to invest in reconfiguration of the same hardware these days when there&#x27;s cheap version control and storage.</div><br/><div id="40943465" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40943465" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ssl-3</span><span>|</span><a href="#40938693">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40943274">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40941941">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40943465">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40943465">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh, for sure.  I&#x27;ve been using X in various capacities for ~3 decades.<p>I remember how it was.  I&#x27;m impressed with how it is.<p>I recently switched back to X as a primary desktop after a rather long hiatus of doing [mostly!] other things.  There was some initial driver discourse (standard nVidia vs. OSS necessary nonsense), but it wasn&#x27;t really so bad once I sorted out what I needed and most &quot;regular&quot; Linux users can skip by a lot of this by default.<p>So far, I&#x27;ve done zero manual configuration of X itself outside of using XFCE4&#x27;s GUI tools to arrange the three monitors in front of me in the right order -- and I don&#x27;t presently see any reason to change anything else.<p>It&#x27;s been very pleasant, all said, even though I got here on Medium-Hard Mode with an a rather barebones base install of Void on an existing ZFS pool for root.<p>X really was one of the easier parts of the whole operation.<p>(I have no interest in Wayland.  It offers no clear advantage to me as a user that I can identify; even the games I like to play run splendidly in X.  I&#x27;ve also always adored the concept of remotely displaying GUI applications.  It&#x27;s convenient -- I ran remote X apps for years immediately prior to this recent switch, and it worked well.  Remote X apps have saved my bacon a few times by allowing me to quickly get a thing done in a familiar way instead of learning how to do it using something else entirely and maybe stuffing it up in some unforeseen fashion.)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40941941" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40941941" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jandrese</span><span>|</span><a href="#40938693">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40941061">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40943274">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40941164">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40941941">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40941941">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You want arcane, try doing the same thing in Windows when it can&#x27;t detect your monitor properly and doesn&#x27;t like your video card.</div><br/><div id="40942187" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40942187" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ssl-3</span><span>|</span><a href="#40938693">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40941941">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40941164">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40942187">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40942187">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks.

Cheap(er) monitors allegedly reused the horizontal sync frequency for the power supply oscillation, to save an oscillator, so if the horizontal sync frequency was very different from expected, or worse, completely stopped, it could burn out the HV power supply.<p>Has anyone tested this hypothesis? It could also be that the horizontal sync itself burns out, although that seems less likely.<p>(In even more detail: Like any other switching power supply, the HV supply in a CRT runs on a two-phase cycle: first, a coil, which creates electrical inertia, is connected to the power source, allowing current to build up. Then the current is suddenly shut off, and the force of the coil attempting to keep it flowing creates a very high voltage, which is harvested. If the circuit gets stuck in phase one, the current never stops increasing, until it&#x27;s limited by the circuit&#x27;s resistance, much higher than it&#x27;s supposed to be. The excessively high current overheats and burns out the switching component. Anyone working on switching power supplies will have encountered this failure mode many times.)</div><br/><div id="40940891" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40940891" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">disqard</span><span>|</span><a href="#40938534">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40940063">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40938761">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40940891">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40940891">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your (parenthesized) explanation of switching power supplies made a lot of &quot;secondhand knowledge&quot; click in my head -- like, for instance, why there&#x27;s lots of high-frequency noise in the DC output.

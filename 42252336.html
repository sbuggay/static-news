I’ve anlways worked with Azure because Denmark is basically Microsoft territory in a lot of non-tech organisations because of the synergy between pricing and IT operations staff.<p>I’ve done bicep, terraform and both Kubernetes and the managed (I forgot what azure conteiner apps running on top of what is basically Kubernetes is called). When I can get away with it I always use the Azure CLI through bash scripts in a pipeline however and build directly into Azure App services for contained which is just so much less complicated than what you probably call “cloud shit”. The cool part about the Azure CLI and their app services is that it hasn’t really changed in the past 3 years, and they are almost one size fit any organisation. So all anyone needs to update in the YAML scripts are the variables. By contrast working with Bicep&#x2F;Terraform, Jenkins and whatever else people use has been absolutely horrible, sometimes requiring full time staff just to keep it updated. I suppose it may be better now that azure co-pilot can probably auto-generate what you need. A complete waste of resources in my opinion. It used to be more expensive, but with the last price hike of 600% on azure container apps it’s usually cheaper. It’s also way more cost efficient in terms of maintaining since it’ll just work after the initial setup pipeline has run. This is the only way I have found that is easier than what it was when organisations ran their own servers. Whether it was in the basement or at some local hardware house (not exactly sure what you call the places where you rent server rack space). Well places like Digital Ocean are even easier but they aren’t used by enterprise.<p>I’m fairly certain I’ve ever worked with an organisation that needed anything more than that since basically nothing in Denmark scales beyond what can run on a couple of servers behind a load balancer. One of the few exceptions is the tax system which sees almost 0 usage except for the couple of weeks where the entire adult population logs in in at the same time. When DevOps teams push back, I tend to remind them that StackOverflow ran on a couple of IIS servers for a while and that they don’t have even 10% of the users.<p>Eventually the business case for Azure will push people back to renting hardware space or jumping to Hetzner and similar. But that’s a different story.</div><br/><div id="42254180" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42254180" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DanielHB</span><span>|</span><a href="#42253231">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42253468">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42254186">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42254180">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42254180">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Terraform has the same problem as Kubernetes sidecars with terraform providers trying to do magic for you.

From there, pretty much everything else is done via FluxCD (workloads, dashboards, alerts). And while I detest writing helm charts (and sometimes using them, as they can get &quot;stuck&quot; in several ways) they do allow you to wrap up a lot of the kubernetes components into a single package that accepts more-or-less standardized yaml for stuff like resource limits, annotations (eg for granting and AWS role to a service) etc. And FluxCD .postBuild is extremely handy for defining environment vars to apply to more generic template yaml, so we avoid a sprawl.

If you&#x27;re using Consul and Vault, good luck - you have to integrate all of that into whatever mess you&#x27;ve built, and you&#x27;ll likely have to write puppet code and scripts to hook it all up together. I lost a chunk of my life writing &#x27;dockerctl&#x27; and a bunch of puppet code that deployed it so it could manage docker containers as systemd services. Then building a vault integration for that. It worked great across multiple data centers, but took considerable effort. And in the end it&#x27;s a unique snowflake used by exactly one company, hardly documented and likely full of undiscovered bugs and race conditions even after all the hard work. The time it took to onboard new engineers was considerable and it took time away from an existing engineer.

It would be like saying AWS Lambda is a lot easier to use than EC2. I&#x27;ve used both Kubernetes and GCR at the current company I cofounded, and theres pros and cons to both. (Team of about 10 engineers)<p>GCR was simple to run simple workloads, but, an out of the box Postgres database can&#x27;t just handle unlimited connections and so connecting to it from GCR without having a DB connection proxy like PG bouncer risks exhausting the connection pool. For a traditional web app at any moderate scale, you typically need some fine grained control over per process, per server and per DB connection pools, which you&#x27;d lose with GCR.<p>Also, to take advantage of GCR&#x27;s fine grained CPU pricing, you&#x27;d have to have an app that boots extremely quickly, so it can be turned off during periods of inactivity, and rescheduled when a request comes in.<p>Most of our heaviest workloads run on Kubernetes for those reasons.<p>The other thing thats changed since this author probably explored Kubernetes is that there are a ton of providers now that offer a Kubernetes control plane for no cost. The ones that I know of are Digital Ocean and Linode, where the pricing for a Kubernetes cluster is the same as their droplet pricing for the same resources. That didn&#x27;t use to be the case.

Long running TCP connections. By default, Cloud Run terminates inbound TCP connections after 5 minutes. If you&#x27;re doing anything that uses a long-running connection (e.g. a websocket), you&#x27;ll want to change that setting otherwise you will have weird bugs in production that nobody can reproduce in local. The upper limit on connections is 1 hour, so you will need some kind of reconnection logic on clients if you&#x27;re running longer than that.<p>Ref: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;run&#x2F;docs&#x2F;configuring&#x2F;request-timeout" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;run&#x2F;docs&#x2F;configuring&#x2F;request-timeou...</a><p>2.

Autoscaling. Cloud Run autoscales at 60% CPU and you can&#x27;t change that parameter. You&#x27;ll want to monitor your instance count closely to make sure you&#x27;re not scaling too much or too little. For us it turned out to be more useful to restrict scaling on request count, which you can control in settings.<p>Ref: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;run&#x2F;docs&#x2F;about-instance-autoscaling" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;run&#x2F;docs&#x2F;about-instance-autoscaling</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42253953" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42253953" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">madjam002</span><span>|</span><a href="#42253665">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42252547">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42253953">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42253953">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t get these recent anti-Kubernetes posts, yes if you&#x27;re deploying a simple app then there are alternatives which are easier, but as your app starts to get more complex then suddenly you&#x27;ll be wishing you had the Kubernetes API.<p>I&#x27;d use Kubernetes even if I was spinning up a single VM and installing k3s on it.

The main complexity I&#x27;ve found from managing a cluster is the boring sysadmin stuff, PKI, firewall rules, scripts to automate. Kubernetes itself is pretty rock solid. A lot of cluster failure modes still result in your app still working.

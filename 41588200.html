Except this small anecdote.<p>One of the kids in my 4-year old son&#x27;s class is blind. I went along for a day to help out on a school trip to some massive playground, which involved loading 60 kids into a bus (they usually walk&#x2F;bike to school, so not everyone was used to the idea of large buses); keeping track of them in the playground, feeding them, etc etc. Lots of potential for disaster, haha.<p>Throughout the day, it struck me that for the most part this blind kid was just another kid amongst peers. It was very wholesome to see the kids understand his limits instinctively, help him out whenever needed but mostly just bantering and playing alongside him.<p>I never gave these things much thought before, but observing this I saw the importance of having quality, supportive peers to interact with. I hope you can find a supportive, nurturing environment for your boy: one that highlights and reinforces his strengths, not his weaknesses.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41589348" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41589348" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jesterswilde</span><span>|</span><a href="#41589088">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41589931">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41589348">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41589348">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I am blind, it was degenerative so it sounds different than what your kid has.<p>I have a few pieces of advice. This is more about my own upbringing, so don&#x27;t take any of it as an accusation towards you.<p>1) Don&#x27;t hide things about their condition or prospects.
I grew up in a very loving home. However, my parents found out I was going blind when I was ~8, I didn&#x27;t find out until I was 13.  My mother wanted to protect me from &#x27;being the blind kid&#x27;. But I was. Not knowing made everything so much harder and more confusing.<p>2) Don&#x27;t rely too much on technology. Stick and dog are the best tools blind people have. Everything else, in my opinion, is a flash in the pan and won&#x27;t have long term support. Not made by blind people and with minimal consulting for them. Like what a sighted person thinks a blind person needs after closing their eyes and walking around their house for a few minutes. (Screen readers are useful, I&#x27;m not talking about those.)<p>For a piece of tech I was excited for and is now dystopian: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spectrum.ieee.org&#x2F;bionic-eye-obsolete" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spectrum.ieee.org&#x2F;bionic-eye-obsolete</a><p>3) Foster independence. The world is not made for us. It&#x27;s also full of high speed metal deathtraps. The easiest thing to do is stay inside where I know where everything is. Even walking to the grocery store is a deeply uncomfortable endeavor. But I need to do it. I need to be able to live with that discomfort and not let it dissuade me from living the most human life I can.<p>The blind cane is very valuable. It took me too long to accept blindness as an identity, get over the shame, and start using it. I lost a lot of time to that.<p>Blindness sucks in every conceivable way. It affects every part of ones life. But I had a good childhood and I have a good life. All things considered, I&#x27;m extremely lucky for the circumstances of my birth because of the family I was born into. You can&#x27;t take away the blindness but you can still give them a wonderful life.</div><br/><div id="41589734" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41589734" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tomcam</span><span>|</span><a href="#41589348">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41589684">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41589734">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41589734">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have a couple of handicapped kids and definitely vouch for #1.

Thing is, that clicking can actually be used to develop a type of vision that operates similarly to echo location in cetaceans (whales, dolphins, etc.) – it comes about because the child realizes that if they make a sharp sound, they can begin to orient themselves with the reflections of the sound waves. After all, vision is in the brain; the eyes are just the sensors. Point being, if your son starts making clicking sounds with his tongue, you likely won&#x27;t want to discourage that. And on the flip, teaching him to click may provide a means of developing his vision in an alternative way.<p>Edit: Here&#x27;s a Pubmed article on a study where blind and sighted people were trained to echolocate: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC8171922&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC8171922&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="41589911" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41589911" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pvaldes</span><span>|</span><a href="#41589363">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41589410">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41589911">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41589911">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Blind people could benefit of carrying one or several ultrasonic sensor like those used on cars to park.

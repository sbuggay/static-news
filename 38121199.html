For a daily driver, if you have a garage or a place to plug in daily, EVs are just a better experience than gas cars. They&#x27;re smooth, quiet, and powerful and you never have to worry about stopping at a gas station - the car is ready to go every morning and you don&#x27;t even have to think about it!<p>An electric drivetrain is a way better driving experience than the miserable turbocharged 4-cylinder engines that everyone has been forced to use for fuel economy reasons today, even premium brands like Mercedes and BMW. These are nasty, underpowered, vibrating pieces of shit with no torque and no power unless you run them at thousands of RPM, where they&#x27;re loud and buzzy. Just complete fucking garbage.<p>It&#x27;s a shame EVs are not catching on, because they&#x27;re really just better cars. I&#x27;d definitely pay a premium for an EV (and I have). I suppose the problem is that, if you&#x27;re not a car enthusiast, a $30k Toyota hybrid is still a better deal, even if it drives like shit.</div><br/><div id="38126112" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38126112" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">arka2147483647</span><span>|</span><a href="#38125522">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38125756">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38126112">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38126112">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the driving feel of toyota hybrid is actually closest to ev of ice cars, because of the smooth and gearless starting and stopping it does with its integrated electric motor.

Legacy car manufacturers had $250 billion profits, but didn&#x27;t spend any money on building this capability. Meanwhile, Tesla made electric cars, built supercharger network, built gigafactories, expanded these capabilities globally.<p>(3) Dealers hate EVs. Even if legacy manufacturers make EVs, dealers won&#x27;t sell them. I&#x27;ve been going to dealerships every year for more than five years, dealers treat you like shit if you wanna buy an EV. Which is understandable, ICE cars have 2000+ moving parts and tons of repairs, EVs have 20 moving parts and zero repairs. They aren&#x27;t going to make much money replacing windshield wipers.<p>(4) Meanwhile, China has figured out how to do EVs at scale, iterating and improving batteries and EVs. Eventually, legacy car manufacturers will go bust (after taking tens of billions in bailouts). We&#x27;ll import cars from China either directly or indirectly. If there are too many tariffs, China is going to build assembly plants in Mexico or Canada, sell them very competitively in US.

The insurance tends to be a bit more expensive. 
  2. You need to have a place with charging infrastructure (like your own home or an apartment etc. that has free charging). 
  3. Paid chargers often have similar costs to buying gas for ICE vehicles. 
  4. Battery degradation is a thing. As someone who lives in the SouthEast and likes to keep cars for 10-15+ years that becomes an issue with cars like the Volt where the only option that makes economic sense when the battery dies is to try to find a refurb from another vehicle if the car is out of warranty. As these refurbed batteries age, or people buy batteries from salvaged volts for home solar batteries that will become an issue (and already is for many 1st gen volts). The Tesla is not as likely to have that issue because a lot more were produced, but if other offerings have after sales support similar to the volt because of lower than expected sales volumes that becomes a perception issue down the road unless you want to just purchase a car, take a big depreciation hit and then trade it in a few years. 
  5. depreciation see #4. 
  6. Sales are currently slowing down with inventory piling up even with federal subsidies right now. Imagine how much lower it would be without them. 
  7. To add more range to a car like the Tesla you need to add more batteries which adds a lot of weight to the car (they have already gone after most the low hanging fruit with motor efficiency and vehicle wind drag). Because of the weight it goes through tires a lot quicker. (30K miles vs 60K average for tires)
</code></pre>
With the Tesla, it is practical for my needs, but I bought it more so because it is fun to drive, I like the tech etc..<p>Other countries, outside of Europe, China and other developed nations are a mixed bag.<p>For example in Costa Rica, where I have a property, even with the government tax discounts it doesn&#x27;t make any sense because electric is really expensive there and it is difficult to get parts is something goes wrong. Also, if you want a car that you are not going to drive a lot of miles in every year there is also the issue of time degrading your battery which is going to be a lot more expensive and difficult to replace there.<p>South Africa has so many current problems with their electric grid that they heavily tax BEV&#x27;s and plug in hybrid cars instead of offering tax breaks like other countries. Ironically, having solar panels and batteries for a house makes more sense there.<p>....and guess which car brand is has one of the higher theft rates because of parts and resale around the world....Toyota, who has been very slow to go BEV. The formula for Toyota is to wait until technologies are perfected and to then build reliable products that will last for years which the majority of buyers seem to prefer worldwide.<p>Because of the slow market adoption it will not surprise me if the legislation around the world to ban ICE sales ends up being relaxed before it takes effect and the transition happens much more slowly.</div><br/><div id="38125351" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38125351" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Rebelgecko</span><span>|</span><a href="#38125089">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38124117">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38125351">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38125351">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">FWIW I haven&#x27;t found some of these to be the case for me.

Equivalent to buying gas for $2&#x2F;gallon (and I live in a place with pricy gas, around $5-6&#x2F;gallon).

The market keeps on growing by healthy percentages quarter on quarter, year on year. This year is no exception to that. The trouble for some manufacturers is that they aren&#x27;t able to tap into that growth and are under-performing.<p>GM, Toyota, and Ford talk a lot about EVs but they struggle to build a lot of them. Upstarts like Rivian are actually threatening to displace these companies in terms of volume production of EVs. That&#x27;s how bad it is. And of course Tesla and a range of Korean, Vietnamese, and Chinese manufacturers are already running circles around the legacy manufacturers with about an order of magnitude difference in volume production. And profits.<p>It&#x27;s just the legacy manufacturers that are struggling to keep up. Some are further than others. But they all are burdened by supply chains that are mismatched with their EV strategy, legacy business units and product lines that are facing a steep cliff in terms of competitiveness and profitability, and just the reality of having to basically transition away from that on an accelerated timeline. And they are trying to figure out how to manufacture competitive EVs at scale and aren&#x27;t as far as they&#x27;d like to be relative to their competition.<p>The strategy of building transitional vehicles that can be delivered in ICE, hybrid, or bev versions is flopping hard. They are compromise vehicles and just not as good as pure battery electric vehicles. More expensive to make, less efficient with space, weight, etc. Less desirable to own. Less competitive in what is a pretty competitive market. And priced unrealistically high to &quot;protect&quot; the &quot;cheaper&quot; hybrid and ICE range.<p>That was all fine until the macroeconomic circumstances changed. Some countries are already in a recession and others are pondering the semantics of whether they are or aren&#x27;t in a recession. Interest rates have gone up and the cheap capital needed to bootstrap new EV manufacturing capacity is evaporating rapidly. And on top of that the new entrants in this market have started a price war in China. And of course sales are down in a recession. EVs are affected. Ice vehicles are affected more. And that&#x27;s what legacy manufacturers depend on for revenue. Despite this, the EV market is still growing. But weaker companies might not make it. And the likes of the companies mentioned in the article are looking weak. It wouldn&#x27;t be the first time for GM to go bankrupt. And they might need to do that again to cut loose from their legacy business.<p>The next few years are going to be brutal for these companies. The US is lagging other countries a bit but basically, like elsewhere, EVs are going from single digit (most of the US) to double digit percentage (much of northern Europe) market share to eventually a majority market share (Norway). Price points are coming down too. Sub 20k$ vehicles are already on the market. Just not in the US because of import regulations. But the world market is where the money is. It&#x27;s going to be a massacre there for ICE vehicle manufacturers. All that EV growth is going to come out of their revenue. Unless they figure out how to take a cut of that, they are going to be going out of business.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38125527" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38125527" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jonplackett</span><span>|</span><a href="#38125645">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38122677">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38125527">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38125527">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">*admit</div><br/></div></div><div id="38122677" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38122677" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway5959</span><span>|</span><a href="#38125527">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38124154">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38122677">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38122677">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The amount of anti-EV FUD being pushed right now is insane.

I believe currently in China 30% of all new car sales are EVs, and it&#x27;s not showing any signs of slowing down. Pretty soon, that should mean petrol cars in China enter a death spiral where it&#x27;s unprofitable to keep service stations operational and filled with expensive underground fuel storage because demand for fuel is falling so filling up gets harder and prices get higher, then because filling up is harder and prices are higher EVs become even more attractive, rinse and repeat. They are well on track to that, while here in the Anglosphere we&#x27;re stuck at &quot;only&quot; around 8% of new car sales (still very impressive compared to where it was five years ago).<p>Basically, China is doing a better job than us, therefore the job isn&#x27;t worth doing anyway and frankly who even cares about competing?

That goes without saying: the grid was built for the needs of the present, not for the needs several decades ahead. The grid will be upgraded to handle it, just like the grid has been upgraded many times in the past to deal with increased demand.<p>The region around Oslo has hundreds of thousands of EVs without any upgrades to the grid. The Norwegian government has studied the issue and found that no grid upgrades are even needed if most cars charge at night. There&#x27;s lots of spare capacity at night. I have my car charging set up to be controlled by the electric company based on price right now. It&#x27;s super easy to set up.<p>&gt; Electric cars are privacy nightmare<p>False. The drive train has absolutely nothing to do with privacy. SOME modern cars are a privacy nightmare. There are plenty of &quot;smart&quot; ICE vehicles too.<p>&gt; Electric cars can be hacked (Hyunday and Kia could be stolen using USB cable). It is more vulnerable<p>False. There&#x27;s no difference between EV and modern ICE here. Both are started electronically these days, and that can make them less vulnerable than older cars since you can have cryptographic verification of your key.<p>&gt; There is still a ton of energy required to create a electric vehicle<p>True, but over the whole lifetime the energy required is less. When the battery is recycled and a second EV created from the materials, the energy needed is FAR less.<p>&gt; and uses slave labour<p>I&#x27;d say false. Anything we manufacture has a risk that the materials were unethically mined. Since EV car makers care about their image, they tend to audit their supply chain to reduce the chance of unethical mining.<p>Do you think the company refining your gasoline care if the cobalt used in refining gasoline comes from slave labor? What about the cobalt going into your metal alloys? Nobody cares, because nobody is trying to use &quot;cobalt slave labour&quot; to attack those industries. But fossil fuel lobbies are constantly pushing this as an argument against EVs.<p>&gt; EV is not plan to last a decade. Electronic parts do not last that long. You can easily find a decade old Mercedes<p>False. We have plenty of decade old EVs here in Norway. The Nissan Leaf came out in 2011 and there&#x27;s plenty of them here. Yes, quite few of them have degraded too much, and needs a new battery. But that&#x27;s because they started out with a tiny battery (gets cycled more often), had an old battery chemistry and bad BMS with no cooling.<p>Even if the battery must be replaced, the rest of the car is totally fine. An old EV with a new battery is MUCH more reliable than an old ICE car. Since newer batteries are better, you can also end up with a car that&#x27;s better - with longer range - than when it was new.<p>My old Kia Soul EV is 7 years old and has zero issues, and not much degradation. My neighbors decade old ICE car just broke down, and they&#x27;re borrowing our old EV right now. (We have a second newer one as well)<p>Solid state electronic parts can last multiple decades. Electric motors can essentially last forever (there are EVs from the early 1900s still working with no motor refurbishment). Mechanical parts generally do not last long without having to be refurbished&#x2F;replaced. It&#x27;s an inherent problem when you have moving parts rubbing against each other.<p>&gt; No real plan for battery disposal<p>Completely false. EU has battery recycling regulations, and EV battery recycling is already up and running at an industrial scale.<p>&gt; Does not work well in winter<p>False. I drive my EV to my moms cabin in deep snow every winter. Modern EVs are MUCH better than ICE cars in winter. Yes, the range is shorter. But try driving a modern AWD EV in snow. The traction is insanely good. That&#x27;s what being able to adjust the torque precisely 100s of times a second gets you.<p>Yes, the range of my older 7yo old EV is rather short in winter. But nobody makes EVs with such a small battery anymore. And it&#x27;s still much better than an ICE for short trips around town and commutes to work.<p>&gt; You cannot park it everywhere, as malls and garages will not allow it<p>Hilarious. EVs catch fire far less often than ICE cars. The statistics are crystal clear on this.<p>An airport car garage burned down in Norway. Started by a spontaneous fire in an ICE car. It was also full of EVs, and despite being surrounded by a firey hellscape, NOT A SINGLE EV BATTERY PACK CAUGHT FIRE. Can you imagine if every car was EV? If there&#x27;s no gasoline to fuel the fire, it might not have spread as fast, and it might be easier to extinguish the fire before the whole building burned down.<p>&gt; There are many downsides of having EV<p>There are a few. But there are way more downsides with ICE.<p>Most of all: you are literally poisoning yourself and your neighbors by driving one.<p>The air quality around Oslo has noticeably improved the last few years.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

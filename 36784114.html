It’s so, so easy to be a passive consumer, a critic. It is so much more dangerous and vulnerable to put yourself out there and make something - anything - beyond simply doing what you are told. Whether it’s making art or making businesses.<p>If you start businesses, you will fail. Fact of life. Happened to me many times. You know what investors like to back? Second and third time founders - “serial entrepreneurs”. Backing a 20 year old college dropout with a few million bucks is a down payment on the future because they will inevitably fuck it up, but 10 years from now if they are still in the game and failed a couple times they will take your check and the odds of failure have gone down significantly.<p>With the market the way it is right now, many entrepreneurs (and their employees) reading are likely staring down the barrel of failure. Bite the bullet and move on because no one wants your zombie company with a too-high valuation that’s going to putter along for 2 more years and collapse anyway or get acquihired. Just restart with a clean cap table and a more cost efficient idea.</div><br/><div id="36824383" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36824383" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">safety1st</span><span>|</span><a href="#36823141">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36824578">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36824383">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36824383">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I really needed this right now.

There is a stigma associated with failure that society still hasn&#x27;t accepted.  My last job I held the title of VP of Engineering.  It was a small company and during my time there I recognized that the title was outsized for what I actually did.  I was actually more of an Engineering Manager.  All of my direct reports were ICs not other managers.<p>I ended up leaving that job because politically at that company I had no voice, and people above me lacked basic leadership skills and continually failed to recognize it.  Additionally whenever I would call out issues, it always would somehow manifest into a problem with me.  So I ended up leaving, and not on great terms.<p>Once I took a long break, I started looking for jobs again.  The title I carried on my resume was bullshit, and trying to interview for Senior Engineering positions proved difficult.  When I made the interview I made it clear what I did at that company.  I told them that the title didn&#x27;t represent my duties.  I feel like some saw this as a blight.  I finally accepted a job as a Software Engineer and now am slowly fixing my career.<p>The lesson I learned was to never accept a worthless title.  Somehow people still misunderstand my directness about this job in my history.  It carries a strange weight, but hopefully with time I can correct it.</div><br/><div id="36824609" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36824609" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Arisaka1</span><span>|</span><a href="#36823267">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36823631">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36824609">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36824609">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;There is a stigma associated with failure that society still hasn&#x27;t accepted.<p>I don&#x27;t think that the stigma is only associated with failure, but also with lacking talent&#x2F;gift. Founders, developers, etc. simply want to look pristine, flawless, gifted. The mythical unicorn who &quot;everything who touches turns to success&quot; and any setback or effort is downplayed.<p>In the company I previously worked for as a junior developer I had 2 colleagues. Let&#x27;s call them Tom and Bob. I once made the mistake of asking for feedback on how to improve from Tom. And the mistake I made was thinking that his feedback would focus on maximizing constructiveness aka. inform me with ways that would be actionable for me. When I asked him how to &quot;become as good as you are&quot; what he instead gave me as an answer was &quot;my brain simply works differently&quot;.<p>We can argue over whether I asked the right or wrong question and I will agree with you that perhaps if the question was posed differently the answer may have been more constructive. However, I don&#x27;t think that this detracts anything from my original point: When communicating, especially in career&#x2F;business contexts, we have multiple goals in mind. And one of the goals that we have is to ensure that we don&#x27;t show to others how hard we had to work, or how many times we failed until we understood a concept.<p>And this need will never ever go away, because impressions and perceptions are important. It&#x27;s also the reason why companies will insist on keeping in their job openings &quot;call for talents&quot;, &quot;seeking talented developers&quot;, etc. I&#x27;ve even seen Linkedin job posts with 200+ applicants and at first was impressed, but then found out that some companies just reopen the same job ad to avoid resetting the counter because apparently having &quot;200+ applicants&quot; is giving the impression that lots of developers out there who would do anything to join them.<p>You&#x27;ll always have people or&#x2F;and companies that prettify or up-sell something they did because (especially in career contexts) perception and impression is important, and it&#x27;s not just about being constructive&#x2F;educational to other founders&#x2F;developers etc. but to also look great while doing it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36823631" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36823631" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dwrodri</span><span>|</span><a href="#36823267">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36824609">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36822799">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36823631">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36823631">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Was there a strong reason why you never just… changed the title on your résumé?

The SF cut-throat vibe shines through the post. I did like the post though, most people don&#x27;t seem to be able to make it that far. And I don&#x27;t think their intent is to be judgmental. There&#x27;s a lot of work to reintegrate into humanity after being deep in that culture. Accepting &quot;failure&quot; is definitely a first step. Not seeing the world in terms of a single-axis success vs failure might be the next one.

Failure is a contested concept.<p>What is defined as failure for one, is success for another. Failure detection is skewed by &quot;the loudest voice&quot; and &quot;the strongest arm.&quot; Morals, ethics, scientific standards, and social hierarchy all fighting for a chance to define and redefine failure. What one person can happily do without question could be the kryptonite for another. Not to mention gender roles.<p>The weird part, at least for me, is that people are not consistent. What is a failure in one aspect is a success in another; it&#x27;s not objective. There&#x27;s almost always a spin. Probably autism a bit but, at least be consistent and honest.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

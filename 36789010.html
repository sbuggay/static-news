For me, when I&#x27;ve been in solitude for a while, I feel a restless desire to go out and interact with people. When I&#x27;m in that lonely state, I find social interaction &quot;charging&quot; and further solitude &quot;draining.&quot;<p>But when I go interact with people for a long time—especially in a large group where I don&#x27;t know people well—I feel an urge to retreat to solitude.<p>So am I charged by solitude and drained by interaction, or the other way around? It feels like the answer is &quot;both&quot;... so what am I supposed to do with all this?<p>One way you could think about my model is that you have four &quot;batteries&quot;, each of which has an optimal &quot;charge level.&quot; If you&#x27;re under that level, you&#x27;ll feel a desire to be in that state for a while. If you&#x27;re over it, you&#x27;ll feel an aversion to being in that state. And it&#x27;s possible that if you&#x27;re quite introverted, your optimal level of large-group interaction is close to zero.<p>If you&#x27;re somewhere in the middle like me, though, the simple idea that you&#x27;re &quot;drained&quot; by one thing or the other feels off.</div><br/><div id="36795235" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36795235" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pizza</span><span>|</span><a href="#36790496">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36791866">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36792146">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36795235">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36795235">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Two aspects I can think of that contribute to a sense of ‘draining’:<p>- how much one ‘masks’ one’s feelings<p>- how much attention&#x2F;energy one spends deeply engaging with the other thoughtfully<p>Eg two very different examples of draining conversations:<p>1. you’re at a party hosted by someone you care about and being a fun guest, but more for the host’s sake because you care about them and want to show up for them and help assuage their worries their party might not be a success. you can keep your energy expenditure lowish but likely find yourself on social autopilot. passive engagement + commitment to fixing oneself to the event = energy cost<p>2. you run into a total stranger whose interests align exactly like yours and who is just as excited to talk to you as you are to them.

i can definitely see that the comfort level is a factor. however, it can take a long time before i get comfortable with someone. i have no idea how much, but a few hours at a party are almost never enough, unless we hit the right topic. so yeah, after those conversations i was bouncing off the walls too.<p>likewise i have given presentations on various topics in front of dozens or hundreds of people. my comfort level depended on how well prepared i was, and how the audience reacted. during the speech part anxiety is higher because i get little to no feedback, but then the Q&amp;A can turn things around if people have lots of questions that show their interest in the topic.<p>oh, and when i am drained, i can&#x27;t go to sleep. i have to do something interesting for myself for at least an hour or more in order to divert my thoughts away from the draining experience.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36793602" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36793602" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pydry</span><span>|</span><a href="#36790496">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36792134">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36795351">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36795475">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36793602">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36793602">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Im pretty sure everybody gets energized once they&#x27;ve gotten fully comfortable with someone.<p>That process of getting comfortable is the relevant context though - not a virtual dial in their brain that goes from &quot;introvert&quot; to &quot;extrovert&quot;.</div><br/><div id="36794400" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36794400" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SketchySeaBeast</span><span>|</span><a href="#36790496">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36793602">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36794127">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36794400">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36794400">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m saying - I&#x27;m saying conversation drains me even if I&#x27;m with someone I&#x27;m comfortable with.

There are underlying issues that cause people to swing between introversion and extroversion. When those underlying conditions change that can shift a person&#x27;s place on the spectrum.<p>If you are some flavor of neuro-divergent with any awareness of yourself then you realize that you need to moderate some of your own annoying behaviors to fit in better with those you are currently in the presence of. Doing this is draining when you are around &quot;normies&quot;, even if you like these peoples company. It&#x27;s also likely that you only moderate certain behaviors around certain people and again, the degree with which you have to moderate yourself can affect how drained you are over time changing the duration you can withstand others company.<p>When you detect that you are around similar neuro-divergents a person can relax and just be themselves. The lack of drain on a person in this condition can swing an introvert into a full-on extrovert. Anyone who spends time at a makerspace or hackerspace probably understands this. It can be fun watching new people show up who usually are introverts and then they slowly shift their personality since they can safely be themselves and come out of their shells.<p>Again, it&#x27;s the underlying reasons driving a persons introversion or extroversion. When those reasons shift then the personality shifts as well. This is not directly correlated to crowd size, but it&#x27;s a given that the larger the crowd the less safe it is for someone to be themselves if they are neuro-divergent in any dimension. Only people who are &quot;naturally normal&quot; can safely be themselves 100% of the time in large crowds and not be worn down by the experience.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36798000" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36798000" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alex-moon</span><span>|</span><a href="#36792876">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36790213">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36798000">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36798000">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;I actually do enjoy crowds and &#x27;enthusiastic get-togethers.&#x27; Yes, I feel drained by them eventually&quot; - in other words, the author is an introvert.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36790213" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36790213" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sublinear</span><span>|</span><a href="#36798000">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36790033">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36790213">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36790213">[21 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think the dichotomy is a bad rule of thumb to help understand someone, but it&#x27;s certainly not their identity.<p>I&#x27;ve come to find that it&#x27;s down to the person&#x27;s experience with and resulting preference for crowds and individuals.

I&#x27;m not shy, but I <i>am</i> an introvert.<p>Being in crowds of people I&#x27;m expected to interact with on a personal level drains my energy. Baseball games, concerts, and the like? No problem! Crowds of strangers don&#x27;t bother me a bit. But if there&#x27;s a hell, my corner of it looks like a cocktail party where I&#x27;m expected to mingle with everyone and never get a moment to myself.<p>Being an introvert is nothing I was raised to be. My mom&#x27;s one. My dad was a natural salesman: put him in a room with 50 strangers, and 10 minutes later he was on a first name basis with them all and had plans to vacation together. They both raised me, and they both stressed the importance of good social graces. The difference is that after my dad&#x27;s social butterfly antics, he was happy and fully of energy, while my mom was ready to go home and recharge for a while. I&#x27;m definitely my mom&#x27;s kid on that one.<p>I have stuff to do. There are things I want in life. I&#x27;m doing all that successfully.

You can focus on people, you can listen to them, speaking rights are respected. Sometimes there is also nothing to say and that&#x27;s fine.<p>Crowds are also no issue. Find or form your bubble, or just be part of the faceless crowd. Or just drift around, bump into people, be part of a pit or another. It&#x27;s wonderful.<p>But being forced to get to know 50 people over the next 20 minutes just a little bit? That&#x27;s terrifying and I know I will shut down and flee from the situation.

There&#x27;s a strictly traditional (conservative&#x2F;Victorian, though I&#x27;m coming from a western perspective) way to do it, but every branch of counterculture has effectively created it&#x27;s own version. I would count everything from chivalry to fashion here: anything that helps people make <i>useful</i> assumptions about you. As soon as you are having a <i>comfortable</i> conversation with someone, you are ready for #2.<p>#2 is more meaningful and more genuine, but it&#x27;s also really difficult to do without starting with #1. Every person in every social interaction exists somewhere on a spectrum from anxious to confident. You can&#x27;t directly change a person&#x27;s position on the spectrum, but you <i>can</i> move the spectrum itself.<p>Lately, I&#x27;ve been watching the sketch comedy series, I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson. Robinson is a master at playing with that spectrum: He squeezes it together, making intensely awkward cringe moments for the characters; then at the most unexpected moment, he stretches the spectrum out with impossibly intimate social interactions where everyone in the scene is suddenly loving and respectful to each other, totally leaving behind the awkwardness they started with.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36792460" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36792460" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sublinear</span><span>|</span><a href="#36790213">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36792174">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36794048">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36790577">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36792460">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36792460">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not sure if this is sarcastic or not since my reply went a bit sideways.

A famous one is repeating someone&#x27;s name back to them. I can&#x27;t think of a smellier tactic than that.<p>The goal of any social interaction is up to you. You don&#x27;t have to be best friends with everyone. That&#x27;s just a bonus when it happens. I suspect this is where the emotional drain occurs for a lot of people. You can&#x27;t make people like you, but they&#x27;re more likely to do so if you can make them think twice about disliking you.<p>Determine what appeals to someone, adjust your style accordingly, funnel them towards what you really want to talk about, make a decision about how strong the signal is and whether to move on.<p>I hope you see how this is kinda like gambling. This is how it can be very easy for someone to talk to 50 people and still be super pumped up to keep going. The upshot is that energy really attracts people. This energy... that&#x27;s the charisma.

I like their approach to looking at different kinds of social interaction, but I think just focusing on group size misses other important differences:<p>* How close or long-term the relationship with the others is. Do you like meeting new people or prefer the company of old friends and family? Do you want to be able to let down your guard and be your true self without worry, or do the higher stakes of the long term consequences stress you out?<p>* How balanced the power is and where you are on it. Do you like rousing a team of minions, give and take with peers, or being inspired to follow a visionary?<p>* How cooperative versus adversarial the relationship is. Do you want to make sacrifices for the greater good so that we all win, or do you want to defeat your opponent? Do you want to give people the benefit of the doubt and show compassion, or protect others from dangerous bad actors?<p>Also, not limited to social interaction, I think many people often fail to distinguish:<p>1. I don&#x27;t like this thing.<p>2. I feel anxiety about this thing.<p>If social interaction stresses you out but you&#x27;re always glad after you did it, you&#x27;re not an introvert, you have social anxiety. If you don&#x27;t want to go to a social function, but you go anyway and it goes perfectly fine, but then afterwards you still wish you hadn&#x27;t gone, that&#x27;s more likely to be actual introversion.<p>I strongly suspect that most self-described introverts (including myself for many years) are actually people with a normal or even high level of extroversion but high social anxiety.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36793234" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36793234" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">coldtea</span><span>|</span><a href="#36797661">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36798105">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36793234">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36793234">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;<i>This entire introvert&#x2F;extrovert&#x2F;ambivert thing just amounts to &quot;most people like to be alone sometimes and around people some other times&quot;??

It&#x27;s not that I, as an introvert, didn&#x27;t like people or exclusively preferred being alone. It&#x27;s that too much social interaction is, quite literally, exhausting.

For such people, social interaction really can resemble a high. It can be something they crave and they can crash from.<p>Larger groups are just more social interaction.

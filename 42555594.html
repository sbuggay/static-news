RFC.<p>As an aside this situation is well known. People have talked about it for literal decades. The vendors have shown little to no interest in making security better except point fixes for the kind of dumb shit they get caught on.

Nearly all of the guidance is standard cybersecurity best practices for monitoring and visibility, and lowering attack surface with few exceptions (in the CISA guidance).<p>The major changes appear to be the requirements to no longer use TFTP, and the referral to the manufacturer for source of truth hashes (which have not necessarily been provided in the past). A firmware based attack for egress&#x2F;ingress seems very likely.<p>For reference, TFTP servers are what send out the ISP configuration for endpoints in their network, the modems (customers), and that includes firmware images (which have no AAA). Additionally as far as I know the hardware involved lacks an ability to properly audit changes to these devices (by design), and TR-47 is rarely used appropriately, the related encryption is also required by law to be backward compatible with known broken encryption. There was a good conference talk on this a few years ago, at Cyphercon 6.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_hk2DsCWGXs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_hk2DsCWGXs</a><p>The particular emphasis on TLS1.3 (while now standard practice) suggests that connections may be being downgraded, and the hardware&#x2F;firmware at CPE bridge may be performing MITM to public sites in earlier versions transparently, if this is the case (its a common capability needed).<p>The emphasis on using specific DH groups, may point to breaks in the key exchange of groups not known to be broken (but are broken), which may or may not be a factor as well.<p>If the adversary can control, and insert malicious code into traffic on-the-fly targeting sensitive individuals who have access already, they can easily use information that passes through to break into highly sensitive systems.<p>The alternative theory while fringe, is maybe they&#x27;ve come up with a way to break feistel networks (in terms of cryptographic breaks).<p>Awhile back the NSA said they had a breakthrough in cryptography. If that breakthrough was related to attacks on feistel network structures (which almost all modern cryptography is built on), that might explain another way (although this is arguably wild speculation at this point). Nearly every computer has a backdoor co-processor built-in in the form of Trustzone, Management Engine, or AMD&#x27;s PSP. Its largely only secured by crypto without proper audit trails.<p>It presents a low hanging concentrated fruit into almost every computation platform on earth, and by design, its largely not auditable or visible. Food for thought.<p>Quantum computer breaks a single signing key for said systems, acting like a golden key back door to everything. All the eggs in one basket.

There are no end-to-end encrypted systems in the world today that have any use, and in fact the term has been repurposed by the tech industry to mean pseudo encrypted, where the encryption is done using software that is also controlled by the adversary, making it meaningless.

If you&#x27;re a state-level attacker and you want to coordinate a deployment of listening capabilities on Signal, say, you need to persistently compromise Signal&#x27;s software supply chain and&#x2F;or build systems, and do so in advance of other attacks you might want to coordinate with, because you need to wait for an entire App Store review cycle for your code to propagate to devices. The moment someone notices (say, a security researcher MITM&#x27;ing themselves) that traffic doesn&#x27;t match the Signal protocol, your existence has been revealed. Whereas for the telcos in question, it seems it was possible to just compromise a server-side system to gain persistent listening capabilities, which could happen silently.<p>Now, this can and should be a lot better, if, say, the Signal app was built not by Signal but by Apple and Google themselves, on build servers that provably create and release reproducible builds straight from a GitHub commit. It would remove the ability for Signal to be compromised in a non-community-auditable way.

    U.S. telecommunications infrastructure supporting fixed and mobile service
    providers in processing and routing calls and text messages between networks,
    enabling interconnection between fixed and mobile networks, and providing call
    session information such as Caller ID and billing data for circuit switched
    infrastructure. Over the last several years, numerous reports have called
    attention to security vulnerabilities present within SS7 networks and suggest
    that attackers target SS7 to obtain subscribers’ location information.

This is dated March 2024. It&#x27;s talking about the very thing you say <i>you haven&#x27;t seen for more than a decade</i>.

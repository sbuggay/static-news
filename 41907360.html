They all used the same in-house software for job management and whatnot, with nice abstractions (as nice as you can get in C) for distributed half-sparse half-dense half-whatever linear algebra.

And they still had <i>bona fide</i> computer labs with in-person tech support.<p>Computers were also ubiquitous in places like the coffeehouse, the library, practically every classroom, etc. And, of course, there were ubiquitous WiFi and USB charging ports, so that students with BYOD could get by (although WiFi was often overloaded and contentious.)<p>Within the main computer lab I was using, there was also a networking hardware lab, with genuine Cisco equipment such as routers and switches. The Cisco certification prep classes would go in there and do experiments on the hardware, so that students could get accustomed to seeing it in action, however outdated it may be.<p>The lab itself was chock-a-block with both Apples and Windows PCs, as well as scanners and printers available, and even headphones you could borrow from the desk attendant. You&#x27;d need to sign in and sign out. There were strict rules about silence and not leaving your station unattended. There was always space for more users and a generally relaxed atmosphere, where people could feel comfortable studying or doing homework.<p>I believe that there was also an A&#x2F;V lab where students could get access to cameras and recording equipment, as well as software for that kind of thing.<p>The library, in addition to allocating lots of space for Windows PCs and Apples, would also loan out Chromebooks to any student, and I believe they had other things for loan, such as WiFi hotspots, for kids who couldn&#x27;t afford to carry around their own Internet.<p>There were also Tutoring Centers, such as the Math one, where most of the desks featured a computer where you could log in to your collegiate account, and access your online course materials.<p>And the Testing Center was essentially a big computer lab, with cameras and in-person proctors monitoring it. It was partnered with Pearson and CompTIA, so I took more than one certification exam in there.<p>There is a fully-staffed IT Help Center on campus, so during office hours, you could count on a 1:1 in-person interaction to help you get logged in, debug your device&#x27;s WiFi, or whatever.<p>Despite having a great computer setup in the comfort of my own home, and plenty of online courses on my schedule, I still appreciated the immersion of collegiate computer labs, and especially the relaxed coffeehouse access, where I could use Apple systems to work on my English homework and essays.<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, all this went topsy-turvy, and a lot of these labs closed down, or took extreme health precautions, and of course, a lot more classes went online-only.

There are only &quot;presumption of privacy&quot; restrictions which apply to places such as bathrooms and private property that is not visible from a public location (ex. a sidewalk).<p>Obv. IANAL and this is not legal advice.</div><br/><div id="41908697" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41908697" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">almostgotcaught</span><span>|</span><a href="#41908019">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41908352">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41908418">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41908697">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41908697">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">By this logic the dorm room bathrooms at public universities are also public and I should be able to setup cameras &#x2F;s</div><br/><div id="41909626" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41909626" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ozzmotik</span><span>|</span><a href="#41908019">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41908697">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41908418">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41909626">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41909626">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">just for the sake of conversation…<p>if you did, where would you have set them up at anyway?

It seems impossible to give accurate accreditation for which source material influenced which AI generated image.  Given the political power of copyright holders in NA this will probably be regulated in some way.<p>* It&#x27;s unclear how different this process is to humans observing copyrighted material and then making original works.  In the long term (10+ years) we can run into real problems if the first point isn&#x27;t addressed correctly.<p>* I&#x27;m not sure if I fully grok the copyright argument for wealth gap described in the article.

Weighing the ethics of that decision, would be ironic to pirate a book on copyright, I think I will support the authors tho.

Literally a book can be written in a day, published electronically the same day and published overnight.<p>30 years longer than the term when the country was founded.<p>Surely the term should be going down, not up.<p>I have three ideas:<p>1. A short flat term, say 3 years, after which the work becomes public domain<p>Or<p>2. Copyright is not automatic.  You have to publish the work to the Library of Congress and the publication fee is $1000 for one year.  You can extend as long as you like but each additional year costs 10x what the previous year cost (pick your favorite exponential values)<p>Or<p>3. You get your choice of copyright as we have today XOR non-discriminatory non-DRM distribution.  That is, you can choose copyright protection under todays laws, but if you do, you may not use any form of DRM or exclusive licensing and you must make your content available to all distributors at the same price.  Or, you can distribute however you want and DRM however you want, but your content will not receive copyright protections.<p>—-<p>These all balance the enforcement costs and societal costs of copyright with the right to be remunerated for creative work, and take into account that creation is faster than ever before.</div><br/><div id="39087624" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39087624" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aoanla</span><span>|</span><a href="#39084988">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39085111">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39086725">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39087624">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39087624">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Back in 2011, the UK Government commissioned an &quot;independent review&quot; of copyright etc (The Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property&quot;).<p>It broadly agrees with your ideas - at least in terms of the fact that copyright is far too long (the report thinks 20 to 30 years would be long enough, possibly in two phases with a renewal needed in between) but notes that the UK is bound by international law to keep copyright longer than that.<p>It also recommends on weakening copyright with more exemptions...<p>...and in the case of patent law, making it more expensive to renew patents to encourage people to not just renew by default, and not allowing any additional things to be patented (cf US software patents).<p>It&#x27;s also very grumpy about the way copyright law just happened whenever a wealthy industry asked for it</div><br/></div></div><div id="39086725" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39086725" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ronsor</span><span>|</span><a href="#39084988">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39085111">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39087624">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39086930">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39086725">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39086725">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think only allowing DRM xor copyright would result in the most <i>interesting</i> outcome—not necessarily ideal, but certainly interesting.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39086930" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39086930" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jazzyjackson</span><span>|</span><a href="#39084988">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39085111">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39086725">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39085126">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39086930">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39086930">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just for context, the language in the US constitution said &quot;limited time&quot; and was codified as 14 years in 1790 [edit: hey, 14 years after the declaration of independence, never noticed that before [subedit: just a coincidence I guess, UK statute from 1710 was also 14 years.]]<p>Personally I think that&#x27;s pretty good and anything longer IMO is unconstitutional. If you&#x27;re making royalties off something published before 2010 I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s actually helping you sit on your ass as opposed to encouraging creativity.<p>On one hand I don&#x27;t love putting a paywall on legal protections, but it&#x27;s not without merit. I think it&#x27;s neo-georgism that holds that you should pay for the right to monopolize - whether that&#x27;s land, natural resources, or intellectual property. If you&#x27;re keeping something walled off from the public, then you should be taxed so the public still seems some benefit from it. Encouraging only monopolizing the truly profitable.<p>I&#x27;ll also add that copyright was intended to protect publishers until they could recoup their investment in the printing of some work. Now that they cost of publishing is zero I don&#x27;t really see the point.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

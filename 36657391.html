Both in life and in death William Atchison was made fun of by the members of multiple communities, gaining the posthumous nickname âCouch Cuckâ. A âhavenâ for murderers would not obsessively archive information relating to murderers, such as social medias (which consistently delete the information to avoid being associated), prior convictions, etc with the intent to study and publicly shame them. One can argue of the efficacy of this, but it is no different than what MSM does. In fact, KiwiFarms can be attributed to the destruction of a CP&#x2F;animal torture ring and multiple arrests, due to their archival efforts and Internet sleuthing.<p>Additionally, on the topic of âreprehensible behaviorâ, companies like CloudFlare happily accept money from animal abuse websites. And under every metric KiwiFarms is legal under US law. So while companies are legally allowed to disassociate for almost any reason, we have to ask why illegal websites remain while legal ones are disassociated. And considering CloudFlare initially sided with KiwiFarms, it truly is not as clear cut as âthey found the content disagreeableâ.<p>On topic to your off topic, I was definitely not expecting KiwiFarms to mentioned either.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36662258" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36662258" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lmm</span><span>|</span><a href="#36660501">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36662057">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36662325">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36663115">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36662258">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36662258">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; No one is silencing these people, they are being lawfully discriminated against (refused service) for their reprehensible behavior.<p>They&#x27;re not just being refused service by hosting companies or the like, ISPs are not routing to them.

Quite a few of the victims are convicted criminals.<p>Take Chloe Sagal, who fraudulently crowdfunded money to pay for a sex change. Not misappropriated--  <i>defrauded</i>. Prior to her demise, she made a speech in a public park about homelessness or something and self-immolated to raise attention to it. One would think she&#x27;d have named her abuser and drawn attention to <i>that</i> were they responsible for her death...<p>...like Byuu tried to do, when he faked his own death and blamed KF in a forged &quot;suicide&quot; note. Surprise, KF &quot;victim&quot; commits fraud.<p>Chris-chan was another of their victims. Poor guy (or girl? I can&#x27;t keep up). This tortured soul was recently released from prison for raping his own 80 year old mother. Kiwi Farms <i>made</i> him do this.<p>Your link complains about Onision being harassed by Kiwi Farms. Poor Onision. He&#x27;s been deplatformed since that article was written. I&#x27;m sure the entire subsection of his Wikipedia article addressing &quot;allegations of abuse, child grooming and rape&quot; is all fake news. These allegations are substantive enough that two victims are suing him and Chris Hansen got personally involved in the reporting.<p>There&#x27;s Keffals-- SWATed by KF, we are told...around the same time KF was asking questions about $100K misappropriated from a Keffals-administrated fundraiser for Trans Lifeline. So, more fraud. Prior to that, there were detailed discussions about Keffals&#x27; ownership of the &quot;Catboy Ranch&quot; child-grooming Discord channel and conspiracy with another party to sell back-channel hormones to children without parental knowledge or consent. The media lapped up the persecuted victim narrative though. Keffals fled to Ireland after the raid, for no credible reason. This is the most egregious example I saw.<p>Exposure of sexual impropriety involving children and&#x2F;or crowdfunding fraud are disturbingly common stories involving most of Kiwi Farms&#x27; &quot;victims.&quot; These are very damning public accusations, yet despite this, nobody I&#x27;m aware of has bothered to sue the owner for defamation. By contrast, Onision is facing multiple lawsuits from his own victims (remember, <i>he&#x27;s</i> the real victim here). Instead, the social media campaign against them relies entirely on histrionics, extralegal abuses like sustained DDoS attacks, smear campaigns and falsifying abuse claims to upstream providers. For as terrible as they supposedly are, the truth alone should do the job, but the story is that they&#x27;re just <i>so full of hate</i> they must be banned from the entire internet with no questions asked. This narrative is brought to us by the very people the site identified as fraudsters.<p>It&#x27;s only fitting that when you call out public figures engaging in abuse and fraud, people with an interest in getting away with either will leverage both in their efforts to silence opposition.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36661847" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36661847" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">defrost</span><span>|</span><a href="#36660501">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36661783">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36662057">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36662663">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36661847">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36661847">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The KiwiFarms issue is less what was said online in a club like forum context and more what was done in the real world by members and coordinated from KiwiFarms.</div><br/><div id="36661882" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36661882" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lmm</span><span>|</span><a href="#36660501">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36661847">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36662663">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36661882">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36661882">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As far as I can see that was a smear campaign if not an outright false flag.

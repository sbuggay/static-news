DevOps was sold as a way to avoid dev and ops teams blaming each other for not shipping software. It was at the time true that devs did not understand hardware and networking and ops did not particularly understand  software. We got nice things like Docker and k8s, but the core issues have not gone away, devs don&#x27;t understand hardware and networking and ops are an almost extinct species. We are re-learning the hard way that certain performance problems are not solved by throwing more hardware at them and that devs will always write Helm charts for convenience and not security. We are also learning that the complexity of networking and backed designs has not gone away we just got more modern tools to describe it. One other unintended negative consequence of misunderstanding DevOps is the proliferation of &quot;full-stack engineers&quot;, which is basically an ops, a DBA, a secops, a backend dev, a frontend dev, and a website designer rolled into one. What we have today is a situation pretty much the same as it was before the arrival of DevOps... devs thinking ops are useless, ops thinking dev are no good and ... both thinking the others have no sense of style.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40889107" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40889107" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JanneVee</span><span>|</span><a href="#40888741">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40888984">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40889107">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40889107">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Companies do what they always do.

These poor performers are most likely doing ops in a traditional way they just adopted the vernacular of modern practices and claiming it doesn&#x27;t work.<p>The core of DevOps and agile is essentially tightening the feedback loops and using the feedback to adjust to become more efficient. &quot;Oh we are failing deploys&quot; and not figuring out why to adjust well that isn&#x27;t DevOps.

We would like that to be daily or more, but we are probably one to two years of maturity away from making that a reality.<p>Not that we do DevOps in the way it was envisioned. We have a &quot;DevOps&quot; team that is responsible for platforms, processes, and operations, and a developer team that is responsible for the application code. The DevOps team works closely with devs to plan and architect the designs to make sure we&#x27;re using the right services, scale, tuning, etc.<p>Within our org, the only real difference between DevOps and classic Ops is the skill level within the DevOps org is dramatically higher than what you used to find in the sysadmin crowd. Most of our DevOps people are cloud native, but a few have deep systems knowledge and decades of hardware, Linux, networking, security, etc experience. All of our DevOps team is very comfortable with Python, that ends up being our default for glueups. We even have a few former devs who also write custom tooling for our pipelines and other QoL improvements.<p>So for us, developers deliver application code, devops does everything else.</div><br/><div id="40889016" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40889016" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fock</span><span>|</span><a href="#40888984">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40888667">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40889016">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40889016">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">ended up at a place like this too + in our project we, the devops-people, also develop and support the z&#x2F;OS-data-integrations.

I build my stuff (or fix my stuff), test it, build some deployable artifact, and deploy it.  I do it all on my own schedule, immediately when I&#x27;m ready to do each step, and I don&#x27;t have to wait on someone else.<p>But if I&#x27;m being honest, I have spent so so so many hours dealing with &quot;ops bullshit&quot;, that I probably would have been more productive overall (perhaps worse latency, but better throughput) if I could have just focused on the build&#x2F;fix and test parts, and kicked the final result over to another team to deal with deployment concerns.<p>I&#x27;m still not sure which is better.  Maybe neither is objectively better, and it depends on the person and organization.  Maybe have separate teams, but make your devs do a tour of duty through the ops team every now and then so they understand why the ops people get mad at them from time to time.  And vice versa.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t buy the CYA&#x2F;hand-wavy reasons in the article guessing why DevOps is supposedly dying.  I suspect it&#x27;s for the same reason Agile turned out to be a drag on so many developers: people cargo cult and don&#x27;t really understand why they&#x27;re doing a particular thing, so they never adapt it properly to their environment.<p>So the managers bring in consultants, and the consultants just roll out their cookie cutter solution, with their favorite issue tracker, CI&#x2F;CD product, deployment system, etc., without really understanding the org&#x27;s needs.<p>Then the managers get upset, and we get articles like this.</div><br/><div id="40888713" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40888713" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ngc248</span><span>|</span><a href="#40888667">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40889057">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40888713">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40888713">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Exactly, dunno what to call it ... but every new concept starts out good, gets crazier and crazier and sometimes it may become good again, but most of the time it just devolves into more crazy.<p>In one of the orgs I worked, ther was a team which worked on the basic devops framework which the application teams could use to then configure their resources.

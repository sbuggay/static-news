It&#x27;s basically the go to platform for software and hardware engineers (for example, it&#x27;s where Flipper Zero started). Usually, to have a good article, especially if you represent a company, you need to spend quite some time on editing your post to perfection, because the platform also has karma. Karma is important for corporate blogs - it&#x27;s good for the image (Habr also has Habr Career - if readers are interested in your posts they may apply for a job at your company). Previously, when our company maintained its blog a few years ago, we even had to hire a copywriter to proof-read our posts, and a designer for the pictures. The main problem was that it took a lot of time of our engineers to write a single post (plus the back-and-forth with the copywriter&#x2F;designer). We also had difficulties with finding employees who want to spend time on all of that. Not long ago Habr introduced short-form posts, exactly to allow individual writers and companies write &quot;rambly twitter threads&quot; without investing too much time in it (while still providing value, in small bits). This year we want to restart our corporate blog - we had a call with Habr staff a few days ago and they recommended to try the new short-form format. We haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but it sounds like the both formats have their place.</div><br/><div id="39163619" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39163619" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">8n4vidtmkvmk</span><span>|</span><a href="#39163210">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39163709">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39163619">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39163619">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This sounds like the exact same argument as long vs short form video.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39163709" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39163709" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sph</span><span>|</span><a href="#39163210">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39163671">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39163709">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39163709">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The engagement reason is the simplest, so let&#x27;s look at that first.

Linked content, useful, but too much blithering before they get to the actual terms. The important content: &quot;In the first phase, fighting would stop for about 30 days while women, elderly and wounded hostages were released by Hamas. During that period, the two sides would work out details of a second phase that would suspend military operations for roughly another 30 days in exchange for Israeli soldiers and male civilians being held. The ratio of Palestinians to be released from Israeli prisons is still to be negotiated but that is viewed as a solvable issue. The deal would also allow for more humanitarian aid into Gaza.&quot;

I have ADHD.<p>I can relate... I have attention deficit disorder too and it&#x27;s extremely difficult to start working on anything. I take top tier medication and it makes it much easier to maintain focus but getting started <i>is still</i> difficult.<p>Somehow against all these odds I managed to publish a bunch of articles. They languished unfinished for quite a while though. Wish I had a general solution for people but my advice is probably too specific to my case: it turned out the only tool that can make me productive is Termux. It gave me the ability to start working on stuff anywhere and anytime. So whenever I get the sudden motivation to do something, I make the most of it. Requires enormous effort to write any amount of text on a tiny screen made even tinier by the touch screen keyboard but it beats the alternative which is writing nothing because my laptop is too far away.<p>Hell I wrote my own goddamn programming language inside Termux because of all this. As far as I know it&#x27;s the first and only programming language to be literally born inside a mobile device. Lots of C code, all written in a tiny 135x8 terminal emulator window. Never stopped to think about how <i>insane</i> that is until now.<p>&gt; if I try to make a blog post, it&#x27;ll end up being abandoned and unfinished, as I am unable to edit it into something readable and postable.<p>I felt that one too... I would worry way too much about perfection, try to make sure everything&#x27;s correct and substantial. Actually felt guilty if I published before it was perfect. Which is the same thing as saying I felt guilty if I published anything at all.<p>It took someone here on HN telling me something like &quot;if your comments are good enough content for this place then they&#x27;re good enough content for your blog&quot; for me to finally stop caring. I got that sort of realization that seems obvious in hindsight. It&#x27;s my site, I can do whatever I want. I dunno why I ever thought otherwise. If I make mistakes I&#x27;ll just fix them. If at a later date I have more to add, I&#x27;ll just add it.<p>I&#x27;m starting to think &quot;readability&quot; and &quot;postability&quot; are very harmful concepts. It&#x27;s OK to be imperfect. Actually it&#x27;s probably <i>better</i> to be imperfect. Everything is more sincere that way, more human. Perfection is a machine&#x27;s job.<p>&gt; but I can do rambly tweet threads. they don&#x27;t require a lot of attention for a long time, they don&#x27;t have the endless editing I get into with blog posts, I can do them.<p>I do the same thing but with HN comments instead of tweets. The rate limiting the moderators applied on my account is actually helping stop this addiction. I&#x27;ve realized that over the years I discussed certain topics many times. HN has definitely helped me shape my world view but the moderators are right about the fact this isn&#x27;t the place for repetitive discussions.

This event led me down a series of rabbit holes trying to understand the true history of the West, since my interactions with many locals born close to the 19th century who had first-hand knowledge of my property made me realize that I understood nothing about the complex history of the mountain west.<p>I became obsessed with the history of the Nevada Territory and its surrounding environs. An enormous amount of fascinating historical context in the Mountain West has effectively been erased. The State of Nevada is larger than the Nevada Territory, but some of its historical territory was lost in armed border skirmishes with surrounding States, primarily for the purposes of controlling water supplies. Over the years, I’ve developed a hobby of reconstructing the history of the American Mountain West north of the Mexican border regions.<p>The history of the American West is being lost in great part because the records and documents only exist on paper in the archives of counties and dying towns. No one is digitizing these records. The people I’ve approached for access to their historical archives are lovely, but they are typically in their 70s, their knowledge is slowly dying with them because no one cares, and their archives are rotting. My inquiries were often the first they’d received by anyone vaguely young (and I am not) for many years.<p>This is where I will take the McCarthy framing of the American West to task, though in fairness he focused on the border regions. To be clear, the border was a violent and anarchic place, but the former not necessarily being caused by the latter, and the border was worse than many other places in the West. The Nevada Territory was, by my view of the documents I’ve seen, an eminently pragmatic and cooperative environment across factions that didn’t necessarily see eye to eye but had common goals. The Mountain West was a difficult place to live. In the historical record you often see Chinese, black, white (which are often factionalized separately as Confederate and Union sympathizers in records) as equal partners at the negotiating table. You don’t even see a visible Chinese political faction today in places where it was politically powerful in the 19th century. I had no idea this was even a thing but apparently that was the norm in many areas and well-documented in local archives. These ethnic&#x2F;race factions specialized and it was well-understood that they needed each other to survive at the time. It was a respectful coexistence.<p>Similarly, the relationships with the Natives were complex, and the modern fashion of treating them as a uniform group with uniform interests is historically misleading. Individual groups of Natives had complex motivations which often aligned them with white people. They had agency and understood the complex political dynamics of what they were involved in. They are not given enough credit for playing a savvy game given the hand they were dealt.<p>Another thing that is often lost in modern American history is that the American West was deeply affected by the social dynamics of the Civil War even though they largely weren’t involved and did not want to be involved. Soldiers from both sides settled&#x2F;occupied towns in the American West and tried to influence politics toward their own political ends. The consequences of this history are evident today among States in the Mountain West. Mark Twain’s “Roughing It” was written in part about his time in the Nevada Territory when he lived in a town that was named both “Dixie” and “Unionville” at various times.<p>One of my ambitions, given time and money, is to systematically preserve and digitize the isolated and dying archives of historical records across the American West. What is there is detailed, rich, and almost none of it is online. Americans have an extremely narrow view of this complex and fascinating time and place in American history. It may not be important but it feels worth doing. In many ways the history of the Nevada Territory shows the positive elements of humanity in the 19th century. You had white, black, Chinese, Native, and other factions willing and able to work together for their common betterment with little evidence of animus across these groups in that time and place. In a way, it reinvigorated my faith in humanity.</div><br/><div id="35944242" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35944242" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">woolion</span><span>|</span><a href="#35944092">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35944271">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35944242">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35944242">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Beautiful project!

They feel like pointless exercises in sadism and cruelty, where the forces of evil are literally superhumanly powerful (like the judge) and nihilistic misanthropy is the only sensible philosophy.<p>I think Blood Meridian and No Country for Old Men are like this, and The Road to a lesser extent (the evil is mortal men, it&#x27;s just there&#x27;s a lot of them). As others have mentioned, not all his books are like that. Suttree is downright funny at times.<p>I&#x27;ve always thought Cormac McCarthy has a great fear of evil and war and those bleak stories are his expression of it. Humans are in a downward spiraling race of shedding their humanity to be capable of greater acts violence so that no violence could be done against them. And those that don&#x27;t engage in that are eventually overcome, like Llewellyn Moss in No Country For Old Men - someone capable of handling themselves, but was never able or willing to be so ruthless. It&#x27;s why ironically The Road, grim and miserable, is one of his most hopeful books - the boy lives and they remain &quot;the good guys&quot;. Blood Meridian certainly the most hopeless, and possibly a reflection how he was feeling about these fears at the time.<p>I&#x27;m not a literature person but that&#x27;s my take on those.<p>Consider the Border Trilogy if you ever want to give him another chance. Blood Meridian is an anti-western, but the Border Trilogy looks at the frontier lifestyle from a more humanist perspective and deeply mourns the loss of it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35943524" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35943524" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">armitron</span><span>|</span><a href="#35943094">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35944214">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35943548">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35943524">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35943524">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is a strong philosophical message in the works of McCarthy, but it&#x27;s not explicit, you have to synthesize it.

It&#x27;s not an exploitation story designed to shock for the sheer fun of shocking.<p>To me it&#x27;s a beautifully-written poetic exploration of a world without evil. For evil to exist there must be something else to compare it to. And there&#x27;s nothing else in <i>BM</i>. It&#x27;s just a mundane world of unceasing animal violence reduced to the quotidian. I imagine the inhabitants of WW II concentration camps might recognize such a world.<p>A world without evil is a <i>much</i> scarier place than one where the concept of evil needs to exist in order to contrast it with something else.</div><br/><div id="35944134" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35944134" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">_match</span><span>|</span><a href="#35935615">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35943629">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35943763">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35944134">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35944134">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I appreciate what you’re saying but I thought McCarthy was not suggesting this is a world without good and evil. But rather the forces at work are beyond our ability to control or even understand. Termites never know why pesticide is being sprayed. At least that was my take from Blood Meridian, the Road and No Country. For instance, the scalp hunters are often horrified but in awe of the judge, subconsciously aware their souls have been signed away. And that part at the end where the kid falls before the dying woman and almost begs for some explanation for what is happening. As McKenna said, trying to use our reason and science is like “throwing an ice cube into a blast furnace.”<p>And I should say McCarthy is not fixated on just evil, but equally on the goodness that miraculously finds us. Only time I’ve ever openly sobbed from a book was the end of The Road.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35943763" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35943763" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thomasfromcdnjs</span><span>|</span><a href="#35935615">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35943629">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35944134">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35944820">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35943763">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35943763">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I barely though it was violent.<p>Everyone should read it for the writing style alone, it&#x27;s great.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35944820" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35944820" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">f5ve</span><span>|</span><a href="#35935615">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35943629">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35944820">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35944820">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">perhaps the downvotes are because you aren&#x27;t adding to the discussion.  you haven&#x27;t read the book, you don&#x27;t say why, and you have no comment on the linked essay.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

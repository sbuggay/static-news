Most people professionally employed as K-12 math teachers wouldn’t even be able to teach this kind of curriculum well. I looked at the author’s blog history to find out if they were doing this for some huge amount of money and found a blog that suggests not only were they doing it for free (skimmed it, but didn’t see any reference to pay) but they had to try to convince other parents to let their kids participate! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buttondown.email&#x2F;j2kun&#x2F;archive&#x2F;a-foray-into-math-circles&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buttondown.email&#x2F;j2kun&#x2F;archive&#x2F;a-foray-into-math-cir...</a><p>In my opinion, there is a relatively unknown (to those outside mathematics) huge “privilege” gap in mathematics education that makes it so those that only follow a cookie standard or accelerated curriculum are relatively unprepared for careers in mathematics compared to those tutored (or taught in special magnet programs, or by their mathematician parents) in these kinds of non-standard-curriculum concepts from a young age. Mostly, the problem is that the standard curriculum is almost purely rote-computational until you become a college ~Sophomore and it abruptly changes to being open ended and proof-based (which is the world most pro mathematicians live in) requiring skills in creatively applying logic. So students with this kind of exposure from a young age have a much easier transition to that while also scooping up all the math-career-builders like early papers and contest wins on the way.<p>Those other parents probably don’t know this but OP is providing an immensely valuable service that is hard to find in some areas and which some parents would pay a huge amount of money for.</div><br/><div id="37278836" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37278836" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pro-kythera</span><span>|</span><a href="#37278525">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37279604">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37278836">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37278836">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; those that only follow a cookie standard or accelerated curriculum are relatively unprepared for careers in mathematics<p>Culture-dependent?

This is natural for any computer programmer, but there&#x27;s some key aspects to it that help with math education.<p>This is quite fun for them as your question of &quot;Do you know how to count to a thousand on your hands?&quot; appears like magic or a superpower to them. So I demonstrate the beginning counting to 20 or so (quickly moving through 4 and 6). Then I start to ask them to predict certain unseen configurations (i.e. zero shot generalization). Re-demonstrate when failure to predict. Once the pattern is successfully learned, then I present a quiz&#x2F;puzzle, and ask how many fingers &quot;this many&quot; is (all fingers unfurled). Always stumped, I provide the hint &quot;if I had an additional finger and that finger were open and all others were closed, how many would that be? Can you figure out the other number from here?&quot; It takes time, but they almost always get it.<p>The beauty of this is that we have a low barrier to entry, as the kid just needs to know how to multiply by 2 and know the names for numbers up to 1024. It surprisingly has many avenues of thinking that can help a kid better generalize concepts of math while still being entertaining (similar to concepts in this article). First, we teach the kids that there are multiple representations of things, and that we need to formulate things to match our goals. That we can break away from the common and expected thinking that most people have to gain &quot;super powers&quot; (i.e. not count like most people). Another important aspect is the above puzzle, where we specifically teach them that there are often better ways to go about solving a problem if we can find patterns. Rather than brute-forcing your way through this (summing each finger) you can exploit the iteration pattern to know that hinted at position is only one away from the desired. Frame of reference is such a crucial concept to mathematics and is at the root of solutions to many famous problems. Obvious post hoc, but inconceivable a priori.<p>We can even go quite deep and talk about proofs and how to design algorithms! I&#x27;ll explain the algorithm identical to how we would perform a proof by induction (this is not how I teach kids, at the beginning):<p>k0th step: starting palms facing user, and an initialized position where all fingers are closed (thumb is a finger and at left most and right most positions). Starting from the right, increment the right most finger (thumb)<p>knth step: start from the right most position. If finger is closed, then unfurl. If finger is unfurled, close it and attempt to increment the next right most finger recursively following this condition.<p>There&#x27;s more that you can build off of this one concept and similarly that with the topics in the article. What I&#x27;ve found is that which ever &quot;game&quot; the kid likes best is the one you should focus on and formulate your basis around. When they have difficulties with one game you use a different game that they are successful at to teach the difficult one. After all, math is a language and so many things can simply be rephrased.<p>I find that one of the difficulties many have with math is that the internalize it as quite strict. That it is often taught &quot;this is the way,&quot; with no other methods accepted and thus people gain quite low generalizability of the concepts. Something that &quot;word problems&quot; are intended to resolve, but this approach is quite brute forced and more akin to how one might teach a machine rather than a human. This is coupled with the fact that so many are at a young age taught by people void of passion for the subject. This dispassion only passes from teacher to student (I&#x27;m sure many people can remember the breath of fresh air if they were lucky enough to find a teacher who loved math and encouraged the creative side of it. Honestly, that&#x27;s how I came the love the subject and prior to that Junior in High School class, I hated the subject despite being good at it and in advanced classes).</div><br/></div></div><div id="37279189" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37279189" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">akermany</span><span>|</span><a href="#37279026">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37277700">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37279189">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37279189">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I am wondering if this has been tried with children on the Autism Spectrum.

Then you can do a little bit of group theory and how the game is Z3^4 (iirc this is the right notation? been a while), 4 copies of Z3. And there are similar card games that represent other games that you can print out cards for if they&#x27;re getting excited about group theory, so you can talk about axioms of groups, and how the games represent the groups, and why it makes sense.<p>Also you can introduce a bit of programming too and explain like how would you teach a computer how to play this game using the invariant property that a definition of a set is that sum c_i = 0 for all i 0 -&gt; 3. and you can also easily generalize the game to other lengths by adding additional traits (background color of the card to add one) or fewer (remove bg color of the symbol).<p>Anyway yeah this game is the best.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37277770" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37277770" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rahimnathwani</span><span>|</span><a href="#37277700">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37279862">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37277059">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37277770">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37277770">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We played Set with my son when he was ~6.5yo, and he immediately loved it.

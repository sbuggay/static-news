Zettelkasten (at least the way Luhmann used it) is meant for this purpose—it is not a system for storing information and retrieving it but rather for supporting the <i>creation</i> of new connections.<p>The computer aided tools are suboptimal for this because they lack the good constrains of paper (severely limiting the search space) and the good features (seamless ability to incorporate a variety of representational modes, text, image, equation, with zero overhead, and the ability to organize things freely in space). As much as the digital knowledge base sounds good in theory, I don&#x27;t think it will ever be as optimal for <i>generation of thought</i>. If all you want to do is summon existing information, digital tools are evidently superior. I personally think a hybrid system where one &quot;thinks&quot; on paper and &quot;archives&quot; digitally (after the thinking is done) might be best, but ultimately, we will be most productive with whatever system we actually <i>enjoy</i> using.</div><br/><div id="42583823" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42583823" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JellyBeanThief</span><span>|</span><a href="#42580947">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42581117">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42583823">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42583823">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; the ability to organize things freely in space<p>This is the key.

With a hundred notes, it&#x27;s still manageable. But what happens when you hit 10,000 notes? Or a million? We quickly run into the limitations of context windows and processing capacity. Vector search helps narrow things down, but it&#x27;s prone to missing important connections that a human mind might naturally make.<p>I run into the same problem. I made a RAG system and imported 15 years of reddit and HN content (my own message logs) + 2 years of LLM chats, totaling about 80MB of text. I can use it to retrieve fragments but there is duplication, and almost all duplicate fragments have slightly different approaches. How do I merge all of them, and how do I get a deduplicated taxonomy?

You’re not asking your customers what to build. You’re asking them to help you understand the reality against which your logic plays.<p>Then there’s the opposite, where a business marches forward because some axiomatic thinking has determined that the macro environment should support it, not updating itself against a pending catastrophe in cash flows that leads to cuts that further undermine its ability to exist even within its own framework.<p>Design and test from first principles, but operate for the pain of as many rounds as possible.

Some growth is nice, but there are plenty of one-man &#x2F; familiy businesses to show that growth is not required.<p>By contrast a successful VC business goes out of business early, or with (these days) a multi-billion $ exit. Like a company that exits with a $50 million OVER investment is a failure.<p>If you want to win huge or nothing, then VC is the path to that. As a founder if you want to retire with money in the bank, then VC is &quot;probably&quot; not the right choice.<p>Of course the optimum might be a mix- take VC money till you&#x27;re 30, if it doesn&#x27;t work out you still have time to build a nest-egg the old fashioned way.</div><br/><div id="41280724" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41280724" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">EGreg</span><span>|</span><a href="#41280633">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41280749">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41280724">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41280724">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I never understood, what is to prevent a startup from raising a VC seed round, then a series A round, and then simply grow at its own pace?<p>Is there something in the SAFE note or whatever, that says the startup MUST fail fast, go big or go home?

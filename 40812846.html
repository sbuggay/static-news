For those that were really involved in the sport, their entire life revolved around it, to the point where it became part of their identity. Young competitive players will spend most of their available time outside of school to play, that being multiple hours a day, seven days a week, year-round. To stop playing, is not just to make an easy pivot like the guy you responded to thinks it is, but is more like giving up on a religion that you&#x27;ve devoted your entire life and being to.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40825047" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40825047" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">krisoft</span><span>|</span><a href="#40822860">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40822914">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40823634">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40826805">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40825047">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40825047">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But if you are the number 1 tennis player in your country in some objective sense, can’t you build a coaching career out of that?<p>Unless it is some pocket sized country (like the Vatican, or Andora) you should be able to find enough students to support yourself and being the number 1 player should help with marketing your coaching business.</div><br/><div id="40826576" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40826576" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">daseiner1</span><span>|</span><a href="#40822860">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40825047">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40827178">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40826576">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40826576">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Of course you could.

This is a great question and I&#x27;ll try to answer it.<p><pre><code>    Like, after a few years of trying it’s got to be obvious.
</code></pre>
It took Roger Federer a few years on the pro tour to break into the top 100.<p>The difference between the top 100 players and the players ranked 400-500 is not that large and crucially, it&#x27;s perhaps not the sort of difference you might think.<p>It&#x27;s not like, say, power lifting where one guy can lift 500lbs every time and another guy can only lift 300lbs and if he&#x27;s not able to get near 500lbs then yeah, he can probably see this isn&#x27;t for him.<p>In tennis, the 100th ranked guy is doing the same stuff as the 1st ranked guy. <i>Just not as consistently.</i> Even a weekend player occasionally smokes an unreturnable winner right down the line.<p>A few more reasons.<p>1. As you climb the rankings and earn more, you can afford better coaching etc.<p>2. A lot of the low ranked guys have <i>some</i> skills equal to the top 10 guys. But one part of their game may be lacking. They think: if I can just improve that one thing I can go on a run. This isn&#x27;t delusional, it happens a lot, and even the Federers and Nadals of the world improved their games over time. (Nadal had a subpar serve for years; for example)<p>3. These guys are young. Athletes peak around ~25 years. A 19 year old ranked #500 is still growing. It&#x27;d be different if he was 38 years old and still ranked #500.<p>4. These guys aren&#x27;t dumb. They know the odds.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40823292" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40823292" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neaden</span><span>|</span><a href="#40822860">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40827775">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40823567">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40823292">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40823292">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">At a guess, is it to become a tennis coach&#x2F;pro later on?

The only alternatives to get into tournaments are entry by wildcard or qualification via a qualification tournament, each of which only grants entry to a small minority of players in any given tournament. For the US Open, the top 101 ATP ranking spots are given direct entry. As I mentioned, ranking spots are largely self-reinforcing, so the entries do not vary considerably.

What I suspect is happening on top of everything else for these players is that (a) they&#x27;re in a competitive field so they have to stay on top of their rest and diet at all times, (b) isolation is definitely a thing, but (c) many of them come from upper middle class backgrounds and it&#x27;s a culture shock to bleed through money just to travel for tournaments and have proper gear.</div><br/><div id="40823229" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40823229" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alexpotato</span><span>|</span><a href="#40822730">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40823610">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40823229">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40823229">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A family acquaintance of mine was a consultant with an interesting work&#x2F;life balance:<p>- He had no permanent physical residence aka he didn&#x27;t own a house or rent an apartment (he did have a PO Box in a city just for a legal address)<p>- Everything he owned was in 4 suitcases<p>- Other than scheduled PTO, the firm decided where he would go for consulting projects (often on short notice) which could be anywhere in the world<p>- When he DID have PTO, the firm would pay for ANYTHING he wanted to do. Rent a speedboat? Check! Fly him to Asia to see a friend? Check!<p>He had a girlfriend (who I was friends with and how I knew him) so I don&#x27;t think he was totally isolated.

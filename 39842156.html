Rather, my ideal lab would be dedicated to providing an environment that enables researchers to pursue ambitious visions that will change computing.  Xerox PARC would easily return to its former glory if it returned to its style under Bob Taylor in the 1970s.  In fact, it would be quite fitting if Alan Kay gets tapped to run the lab.<p>While there’s a need for more directed short-term research, I feel that industry has largely moved away from more free, longer-term, “pure” research, and I also feel that academic research has become affected by “publish or perish” and fundraising demands.  There seems to be no room these days for researchers who want to do more exploratory work, short of becoming independently wealthy or relegating such exploration to nights and weekends.</div><br/><div id="39857073" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39857073" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rented_mule</span><span>|</span><a href="#39856504">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39857761">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39857073">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39857073">[23 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would love to see the glory days of pure research groups like PARC and Bell Labs return. But, so many business folks are aware of how Xerox was embarrassed by PARC that it&#x27;s unlikely that approach will be tried again anytime soon. When I speak of embarrassment here, it&#x27;s not about the incredible innovation that came out of PARC, but about Xerox management&#x27;s handling of that innovation.<p>Billions and billions (trillions?) of dollars in value was created (e.g., Adobe, 3Com, SGI→NVIDIA, Mac &#x2F; Windows, laser printers, ethernet, etc.) based on their research, but ~0% of that value went to Xerox. From a business point of view, it was a disaster. And business folks are primarily the ones deciding what&#x27;s funded at this level. If I&#x27;m an executive who&#x27;s not sure if I, or my organization, will be able to tell the great ideas from the duds, why spend money that might expose that?</div><br/><div id="39857529" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39857529" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bruce511</span><span>|</span><a href="#39856504">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39857073">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39857233">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39857529">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39857529">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Between laser printers and photo copiers (built on laser printer tech) Xerox did just fine.<p>If anything, Xerox&#x27;s &quot;willingness&quot; (intentional or not) to allow the root ideas to grow in various places has been a blessing to the IT industry as a whole.<p>What you are suggesting is they could, or should, have become all the companies you listed.

Xerox had the  copier machine market pretty well to itself for a good 20 years which enabled them to fund PARC (sure, there were some competitors in that time, but they weren&#x27;t taking a huge bite out of Xerox&#x27;s profits yet).<p>I think Apple could&#x27;ve done this a few years back when they had something like $100B cash on hand - they could have established a research foundation and provided it with funding that would&#x27;ve lasted for long enough for it to become self sustaining. Maybe Apple still could do this as they&#x27;ve got $73B cash on hand. $10B would go a long ways towards establishing an institution like this. Even better if other FAANG companies joined by providing seed funding, but maybe that looks too anti-competitive these days? (the incentive for providing initial funding could be a stipulation that funding companies get a break on IP license fees)<p>Of course, as someone else mentions in this thread, this institution should learn from PARC&#x27;s mistakes and do a better job of licensing their IP in order to keep operating for a longer term.<p>I suspect we really need something like this. Bell Labs (and PARC) gave our economy a technological boost that it wouldn&#x27;t have had without them.

Had Xerox held onto this stake of the company, approximately 5-8% of the total outstanding equity in Apple at that time, their investment could be worth tens of billions of dollars today. Famously however, Xerox did not even retain their stake until Apple’s 1980 IPO. Instead, they almost immediately turned around and sold their shares for approximately $1.2 million, netting a return on their investment of around $200,000. Apple and their competitors, inspired by PARC’s inventions, would go on to generate trillions of dollars of revenue over the coming decades selling desktop personal computers with bitmapped displays and mouse-driven GUIs just like the Xerox Alto.&quot;<p>What a facepalm! &gt;_&lt;</div><br/><div id="39859056" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39859056" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cancerhacker</span><span>|</span><a href="#39857491">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39858848">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39859056">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39859056">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When Steve Jobs came back to Apple in 1997, he was given 1.5M shares - he sold all but 1 share almost immediately.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39858848" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39858848" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nilamo</span><span>|</span><a href="#39857491">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39859056">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39857293">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39858848">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39858848">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; What a facepalm! &gt;_&lt;<p>Making 20% profit, and freeing up that capital for other uses, is not a face palm event.

Thus began a decade of great research but even greater hype ... But after 12 years of failing to capitalize on all the technologies invented at PARC and Office Systems Division - from 1983 to 1987 - Xerox experienced a mass exodus itself and many researchers in Computer Science joined Dec Systems Research Center or DEC Western research Lab (DEC SRC and DEC WRL).<p>The latter (DEC WRL) was credited with developing the DEC Alpha CPU; DEC SRC invented Altavista which was the #1 search engine until Google arrived.<p>I was an Office Systems Division engineer 1984-6 and watched the exodus unfold before I left for grad school.

What came before in a similar genre? Maybe Diablo II in 2000-2001. And while the Guild Halls were planned for D2 they never actually shipped. There were forums etc but nothing like the scale and possibility of WoW. There were no patterns for this before.</div><br/><div id="41752275" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41752275" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">temp0826</span><span>|</span><a href="#41751620">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41751915">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41751852">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41752275">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41752275">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ultima Online, Everquest, Lineage...Blizzard definitely had a leg up with their brand recognition which boosted the genre to new levels, but it really wasn&#x27;t a new idea.</div><br/><div id="41752311" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41752311" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chx</span><span>|</span><a href="#41751620">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41752275">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41751852">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41752311">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41752311">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In 1997 UO had ~100 000 subscribers, in 2004 WoW had over a million.

Thereâs that initial excitement when we desperately want to share our joy with our parents or siblings, but all too often that joy is dashed by popular misconceptions, media sensationalism, and flat-out fabrications about âstrangers onlineâ and the like. I found solace in online communities as an introvert traumatized by repeated cross-country moves growing up, and when I tried sharing my online friends with my parents, they deleted my social messenger accounts at the time.<p>So thatâs why this stuff often pops up as a âsurpriseâ to those left behind, or comes across as a âdouble-lifeâ. We often tried to open up and share ourselves, but were shut down for the unorthodox ways we found happiness or identity, and realized the best approach was hard segregation of the two.<p>Heck, itâs why I still donât tie my meatspace and authentic selves together. The meatspace me is this reserved but honest engineer who just wants to make good systems that customers like using and be left alone, but the online dinosaur isâ¦_starkly different_, more open and authentic, exuding more confidence and more empathy as well.<p>Weâre unique creatures who adapt to our surroundings, but make no mistake: we always want to share our found happiness with others. Unfortunately, experience often dictates that sharing ourselves so completely is more likely than not to end up causing us great harm, and so we just donât do it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41752553" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41752553" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Tor3</span><span>|</span><a href="#41751620">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41751852">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41751768">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41752553">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41752553">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They <i>were</i> aware, but hadn&#x27;t got the correct understanding.

Lets put it mildly, its a rare case that the parents of a disabled child&#x2F;person truly understand their needs&#x2F;desires&#x2F;wishes&#x2F;dreams.  Its much more common that the barrier that appears between disabled and non-disabled people will persist, and will not get broken down.  Most disabled people I know (and I am disabled myself) basically had to run away from home to get some degree of freedom.  Its a rather sad thing, which involves a lot of things, mostly the trauma of the parents which they likely never overcome.  And the desire of the disabled peerson to gain some independence.  Which is usually not compatible with family.</div><br/><div id="41751976" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41751976" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">StefanBatory</span><span>|</span><a href="#41751620">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41751768">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41751913">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41751976">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41751976">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And longing for a family that you could have had...<p>I find it that people who grew up with attentive parents just don&#x27;t understand how one can not trust their parents, or what it is like to have to hide everything from them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41751913" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41751913" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bdjsiqoocwk</span><span>|</span><a href="#41751620">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41751768">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41751976">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41752095">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41751913">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41751913">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That post really made me sad.<p>I&#x27;m not disabled and neither is anyone in my family.

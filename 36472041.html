It&#x27;s actually extremely easy to do because of how &#x27;invisible&#x27; it is. Imagine there was a society where literally every single woman had an average of 1 child. It&#x27;d be quite weird to claim they were being driven extinct as everybody loads up on diapers, yet that society&#x27;s population would indeed be trending towards 0 at an exponential rate, but with an 80 year &#x27;lag&#x27; in the first wave of deaths that would mask the impact.<p>And country after country has demonstrated how relatively easy it seems to be to reduce fertility. Iran is a not so well known example. Back in the 80s Iran started to feel that their fertility was a problem. Their population was growing far faster than they had the resources to sustain, so they instituted birth control availability and 
mandated &#x27;marriage classes&#x27; [1], not entirely unlike what&#x27;s being suggested here. And in these classes they worked to try to reduce overall fertility.<p>It succeeded far beyond any expectation. Their fertility went from 6+ to 2 in less than a decade. And then it just kept dropping. Today it&#x27;s down to below 1.7 and it keeps falling. They&#x27;ve long since tried to reverse this trend and started an equal but opposite pro fertility program, but like China also showed - it&#x27;s <i>far</i> easier to reduce a population&#x27;s fertility, than it is to bring it back up. These sort of programs work as a perfectly viable proof of concept of a practically invisible eugenics program, and that&#x27;s quite dangerous.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Family_planning_in_Iran" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Family_planning_in_Iran</a></div><br/><div id="36476824" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36476824" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dustypotato</span><span>|</span><a href="#36476056">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476593">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476931">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36476824">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36476824">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Eugenics is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population.<p>What you described is not eugenics though.</div><br/><div id="36476909" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36476909" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">somenameforme</span><span>|</span><a href="#36476056">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476824">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476931">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36476909">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36476909">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Eugenics is generally carried out not through selective breeding, but by removing the populations you do not want to breed.

It&#x27;s simply that eugenics fell out of fashion, following it being taken to extremes by a certain vegetarian artist in Germany with a knack for rhetoric.</div><br/><div id="36477247" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36477247" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">EGreg</span><span>|</span><a href="#36476056">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476909">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476931">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36477247">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36477247">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">People have this weird thing where, if something comes about as an emergent property of a market system, then it’s fine, but otherwise a much more carefully organized result is not fine. Like if corporations raced towards an AI apocalypse then there’s no one to blame but if a central planner did it, then that would be an evil plan that should be stopped. Same with non biodegradeable plastic, destruction of ecosystems, loss of biodiversity, and so on. (By contrast to all these, fossil fuels are a slowpoke.)<p>For example — we don’t particularly need to do anything to reduce birth rates of technologically advanced societies societies with human rights. That’s because women choose to study and work on their career in their 20s, while men try hard to save up to afford the sky-high real estate prices. The market does the eugenics for everyone.<p>If anything, the fear that uneducated populations or those in low-cost-of-living countries are going to “replace us” is a result of that simple fact. Comparing continents, Africa is expected to continue to have a ton of kids per woman compared to, say, Europe or USA.<p>Religion, of course plays a role. When the condoms are off, the religion doesn’t matter — you’re going to have a lot of babies. The only difference is, how early do you get married?

We&#x27;re genetically driven to pick out mates most likely to produce fertile, healthy, and effective offspring. Even in relatively isolated tribes with 0 access to advertising of any sort, preferences like low waist-to-hip ratios are ubiquitous [1] (random study that also references a bunch of others - this is not a controversial statement). The reason is that low waist-to-hip ratios correlates with all sorts of health, fertility, and genetic strengths. So we are genetically attracted to such.<p>I think you could also make an argument in reverse here as well. An increasingly large chunk of Western advertising is actively seeking to push values like contravening said genetic proclivities, yet it seems to have had little to no impact on what people find attractive. That&#x27;s even more telling as obesity is rapidly becoming the norm rather than the exception.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-017-01916-9" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-017-01916-9</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36476145" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36476145" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">beau_g</span><span>|</span><a href="#36476056">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476089">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476101">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36476145">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36476145">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This already exists if you wish to adopt in the US - just doesn&#x27;t apply to the other method</div><br/><div id="36476169" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36476169" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">noname2021</span><span>|</span><a href="#36476056">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476145">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476101">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36476169">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36476169">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">interesting - one way to test the efficacy of something like this might be to compare median outcomes of adopted kids (whose parents went through some parenting education) with that of the non adopted general population (after controlling for other factors).<p>Now which PhD candidate will bite :)</div><br/><div id="36476297" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36476297" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">NhanH</span><span>|</span><a href="#36476056">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476169">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476101">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36476297">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36476297">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hard to imagine how to design such study: (close to) 100% of people that adopt kid WANTED to have kid, and planned for them.

When you think of someone who values their masculinity, who do you perceive? Now do the same for femininity. Which model is healthier?<p>Men and women have, on average, physiological differences. These differences are pronounced in puberty. That’s when these frameworks matter the most; they thus must be embedded in childhood.

Boys understanding and speaking to their feminine sides is, ironically, a classically masculine strength in the way women understanding and acting on their masculine sides is, traditionally, a classical sign of motherhood and through that feminine strength.

That seems to be a crisis in-and-of-itself. When I look at socially-successful men, they often have had multiple older men  in their lives to model themselves after - usually grandparents, uncles, teachers, etc., on top of their father (or in lieu of). This is two-fold redundant, in creating fallbacks for both a central father figure and in skills or traits which that figure may lack.<p>I think this is important because the &quot;absent father&quot; is often used as an excuse, when it rather represents the last breached line in a long list of failures of society, which have ripped boys from the men who would look after them.<p>(I admit that there&#x27;s likely some who won&#x27;t like hearing this, as it cuts against the grievances of those who find pride in specific fatherhood (&quot;I will raise MY child.&quot;) and see society&#x27;s manner, or the dissolving of the nuclear family into a larger community unit, as working against that.)</div><br/><div id="36473193" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36473193" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pyuser583</span><span>|</span><a href="#36472322">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36473024">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36475783">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36473193">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36473193">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It isn’t either&#x2F;or.

Like, how much can you afford? If it&#x27;s anything measured only in the hundreds or single digit thousands of dollars, daddy is much more likely to ignore that low-wage offer entirely. He can make it up (and more some) elsewhere.<p>I mean, goddamn. People are griping that they hate the idea of working their 8 hour shift at the coffee shop for a higher wage, doing all that silent-quitting and great resignation crap... but the government offering him an extra $1500&#x2F;year is going to make the difference here?

There was a $35 million film made where the villain was based on him, with the director having this to say:<p>&quot;We based that character on this insane man, Jordan Peterson, who is this pseudo-intellectual hero to the incel community. You know the incels? They’re basically disenfranchised, mostly white men, who believe they are entitled to sex from women. And they believe that society has now robbed them—that the idea of feminism is working against nature, and that we must be put back into the correct place. Yeah, they’re actually succeeding in many different ways. But this guy Jordan Peterson is someone that legitimizes certain aspects of their movement because he’s a former professor, he’s an author, he wears a suit, so they feel like this is a real philosophy that should be taken seriously.&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re integrated into the modern US corporate society and media landscape, and think that some portion of Peterson&#x27;s outlook is potentially helpful, <i>keep that shit to yourself</i>. That you will even humor his ideas is grounds for people with brain worms to attack your moral character. If it starts to make noise, your employer may not want to deal with it. Your friends and family may not want to deal with it.

Meanwhile, in Watson’s native England, activists from women’s organizations recently blamed the shortage of services for abused women on efforts to accommodate abused men (despite the fact that, as Guardian columnist and blogger Ally Fogg demonstrated, even the lowest estimates of the prevalence of domestic violence against men suggest that male victims are far less likely than women to get help).</div><br/></div></div><div id="36472576" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36472576" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hkt</span><span>|</span><a href="#36472487">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36474875">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36473295">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36472576">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36472576">[72 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Totally.

Everywhere else in English, an adjective limits the scope of the noun it&#x27;s attached to. &quot;Toxic chemicals&quot; doesn&#x27;t imply that chemicals are inherently toxic, &quot;red car&quot; doesn&#x27;t imply that cars are inherently red. &quot;Toxic&quot; is probably needlessly sensational though, I&#x27;ll grant that.<p>&gt; bad traits like being violent or domineering can be called out without having to pointlessly gender the terms.<p>I agree with this. To clarify I think part of the frustration&#x2F;misunderstanding with the term comes from it being applied at the wrong level. It&#x27;s a descriptor of a social&#x2F;cultural phenomenon, not a trait of an individual. If a man is being violent, it may or may not have anything to do with toxic masculinity, and invoking toxic masculinity to describe his actions would be inappropriate and needlessly gendered.<p>It really only makes sense to start talking about toxic masculinity when asking higher level sociological questions like, for example, why men are so over-represented in violent crime stats. It&#x27;s a term to use when exploring causes, not effects, if that makes any sense.<p>It&#x27;s like the difference in terminology between an ER nurse and an epidemiologist. The nurse might just say &quot;flu&quot;, because at the level they operate that&#x27;s the issue at hand. For them to speculate about the origins of the specific strain would be inappropriate. For the epidemiologist, however, these questions are exactly the point, because understanding the details of how an outbreak spreads can help us be more prepared in the future.</div><br/><div id="36475947" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36475947" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Natsu</span><span>|</span><a href="#36472487">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36475647">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36474670">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36475947">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36475947">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I&#x27;m open to this argument because it&#x27;s clear that many people take it this way, but how else would you state it?<p>I&#x27;d frame them in a way that centers on behavior (&quot;domineering&quot;, &quot;violent&quot;) without gendering them.

Things like this just make me think that if we want to avoid harmful associations, we have to simply not pair up the words at all.  If someone is being violent, we can complain about that without bringing their identity into the frame.<p>&gt; why men are so over-represented in violent crime stats<p>But the term is bad because it does nothing whatsoever to illuminate which things might actually cause that and there are probably many causes it lumps under a single umbrella wrongly.<p>I&#x27;ve seen stats that indicate one of the bigger causes is untreated psychosis, which has nothing in particular to do with being male, or any other identity that&#x27;s over-represented in arrest data for that matter.<p>And to me that just reinforces the idea that the identity shouldn&#x27;t be used at all when framing the problem.  I&#x27;m aware of the correlations, but we have to find actual causes and, e.g. get people mental healthcare to fix the behaviors creating toxicity, rather than accepting a framing that centers on someone&#x27;s very identity as if that&#x27;s the thing that&#x27;s problematic.<p>And I can say &quot;causes&quot; because causal modeling is a thing now.

Multiple people are interviewed and their experiences differ, but stuff like this really stands out, and especially that last paragraph is pretty relevant here:<p><i>Prior to my transition, I was an outspoken radical feminist. I spoke up often, loudly and with confidence. I was encouraged to speak up. I was given awards for my efforts, literally — it was like, “Oh, yeah, speak up, speak out.” When I speak up now, I am often given the direct or indirect message that I am “mansplaining,” “taking up too much space” or “asserting my white male heterosexual privilege.” Never mind that I am a first-generation Mexican American, a transsexual man, and married to the same woman I was with prior to my transition.</i><p><i>I find the assertion that I am now unable to speak out on issues I find important offensive and I refuse to allow anyone to silence me. My ability to empathize has grown exponentially, because I now factor men into my thinking and feeling about situations. Prior to my transition, I rarely considered how men experienced life or what they thought, wanted or liked about their lives. I have learned so much about the lives of men through my friendships with men</i><p><i>What continues to strike me is the significant reduction in friendliness and kindness now extended to me in public spaces. It now feels as though I am on my own: No one, outside of family and close friends, is paying any attention to my well-being.</i><p><i>I can recall a moment where this difference hit home. A couple of years into my medical gender transition, I was traveling on a public bus early one weekend morning. There were six people on the bus, including me. One was a woman. She was talking on a mobile phone very loudly and remarked that “men are such a–holes.” I immediately looked up at her and then around at the other men. Not one had lifted his head to look at the woman or anyone else. The woman saw me look at her and then commented to the person she was speaking with about “some a–hole on the bus right now looking at me.” I was stunned, because I recall being in similar situations, but in the reverse, many times: A man would say or do something deemed obnoxious or offensive, and I would find solidarity with the women around me as we made eye contact, rolled our eyes and maybe even commented out loud on the situation. I’m not sure I understand why the men did not respond, but it made a lasting impression on me.</i><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;20&#x2F;feature&#x2F;crossing-the-divide-do-men-really-have-it-easier-these-transgender-guys-found-the-truth-was-more-complex&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;20&#x2F;feat...</a></div><br/><div id="36476259" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36476259" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Khaine</span><span>|</span><a href="#36472487">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36474267">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36475211">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36476259">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36476259">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This isn&#x27;t even new, what is surprising is how society refuses to listen to Men.

Someone from the postmodern left or intersectional queer theory milieux, certainly young, not a cisgender man, who is frustrated with the ability of powerful men to continuously escape accountability for the violence they enact against women and queer people.

I don&#x27;t agree with the slogan, I am just able to explain the thought processes and background of those who do.<p>&gt;Because jokes are used by extremists to gauge the tone of the rest of the group, and, if the group is conducive, they magically aren&#x27;t jokes anymore.<p>I&#x27;m familiar with the concept you&#x27;re discussing but I don&#x27;t think it applies here. For one, it&#x27;s not a joke - it&#x27;s insincere, but not humorous. For another, I have known neo-Nazis (I have worked in deradicalisation, specifically exit programs for young men in neo-Nazi groups) who would do the whole &quot;day of the rope&quot; thing and claim they were joking but were actually chomping at the bit to enact it, and I would consider myself well-equipped to judge whether these &quot;kill all men&quot; people were &quot;secretly serious&quot; like those neo-Nazis are. Genuinely, they really weren&#x27;t.<p>Or, to put it another way, out of the people I knew who would be willing to say or agree with the slogan &quot;kill all men&quot;, if they were in a social situation where they had the opportunity to contribute to the slaughter of a group of men in a socially supported way, they would not contribute and would almost certainly actively resist if they weren&#x27;t having some sort of nervous breakdown at being in such an unusual situation. The same is not true for neo-Nazis or theocratic Islamists or some other groups that I have interacted with who are calling for the death of people with contingent insincerity - outside of a few of the younger members of those groups, given a social situation which allowed them to act out said social murder they would do it, and they all know it, as does anyone who interacts with them for any length of time. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t think the analogy is valuable, because in a practical sense these people aren&#x27;t actually engaging in domestic terrorism and don&#x27;t have any power to enforce their beliefs even if they were sincere, and also because I am familiar with the dynamics of the phrase and the sort of people that say it and they would not actually support mass murder even in an imaginary social context which was specifically supportive of that.</div><br/><div id="36476388" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36476388" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mecha_ghidorah</span><span>|</span><a href="#36472487">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476127">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36474117">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36476388">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36476388">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I would consider myself well-equipped to judge whether these &quot;kill all men&quot; people were &quot;secretly serious&quot; like those neo-Nazis are.

Lately we have culturally been moving away from jokes that are about genders&#x2F;races&#x2F;identities being considered acceptable... or at least we have been for all identities other than &quot;white&quot; and &quot;men&quot;, such as in this case where this whole group of people will listen to someone saying &quot;kill all men&quot; and just understand it is a joke and let it go by.<p>I actually do understand why someone who feels frustrated by certain things might make a joke like that, and I have nuance enough to understand that context and audience matters, and that often things said in jest are a way to emotionally deal with something without any desire to cause any sort of hurt (emotionally or physically) to the people being joked about.<p>For me at least though that sort of joke is frustrating and hurtful when I have had to listen to years to (an often overlapping set of) people talking about how men have a responsibility to speak up when their male friends make those sorts of jokes and tell them to stop. &quot;Silence is Violence&quot; and all that sort of thing.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m getting at is you may say that people upset about people saying it don&#x27;t understand the people saying it, but I do. I do hang around these sorts of people, some of my good friends belong to the local socialist party and their social circles include these sorts of people. And it still does upset me, not so much because of what they are saying - although it isn&#x27;t a great thing to say - it&#x27;s the hypocrisy of it that upsets me. I have legitimately heard the exact same person have a little rant about how misogynistic the phrase &quot;bi--- be crazy&quot; and also make jokes about how &quot;the straights aren&#x27;t ok&quot;, etc.<p>I think people in general, and myself especially, would be a lot more receptive  to &quot;oh it&#x27;s just a joke&quot; if those people hadn&#x27;t spent a bunch of time policing what was said as part of comedy shows and stuff because as of right now it feels like a lot of people have decided that certain groups I am in are the <i>only</i> acceptable targets for this sort of thing, which is just... incredibly frustrating.</div><br/><div id="36476996" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36476996" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lucubratory</span><span>|</span><a href="#36472487">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476388">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476985">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36476996">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36476996">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">(2nd half)<p>&gt;make jokes about how &quot;the straights aren&#x27;t ok&quot;, etc.<p>I think you may be misunderstanding what that means, although in this case you have correctly identified that this is a joke. It doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;not okay&quot; as in they&#x27;re not acceptable or they&#x27;re bad, it means they&#x27;re &quot;not okay&quot; in the same way you might say to someone &quot;The situation in Russia is not okay&quot; or &quot;Thank you for your concern, I&#x27;m not okay at the moment&quot;. It&#x27;s an expression that someone needs to check in on them, not that they&#x27;re bad. You&#x27;ll find it said when straight people are doing something really weird for frivolous reasons related to their sexuality, like starting wildfires using a gender reveal party. It&#x27;s sort of like concern trolling (not really, but explaining actual jokes is not my strong suit), in that it&#x27;s a ~false expression of concern. If it bothers you a lot, I&#x27;d advise you to laugh at it and do some thorough research to learn what sort of weird things queer people are doing (as in actually doing, not the fake nonsense propaganda like grooming children or whatever - go to queer sources and find what they&#x27;re complaining about queer people doing). I guess something like &quot;At least straight people aren&#x27;t declaring a national crisis over the top shortage when they could go outside and find one by literally just talking&quot; or &quot;I think the degree of drama involved in your average lesbian break-up definitely means they need a check-in&quot;. Just make sure you&#x27;re always approaching the topic with the understanding that the people you&#x27;re talking to and joking about are currently having their children taken away from them in America or being beaten up by fascists around the world or being mass murdered in Chechnya etc for being queer, and for that reason it would once again be a very bad idea to use the hypocrisy argument, because it&#x27;s very easy for them to dismiss it (and you) by pointing out that these situations are not actually the same and therefore there&#x27;s no obligation to talk about or treat them the same way.<p>&gt;if those people hadn&#x27;t spent a bunch of time policing what was said as part of comedy shows and stuff because as of right now it feels like a lot of people have decided that certain groups I am in are the only acceptable targets for this sort of thing, which is just... incredibly frustrating.<p>Just because of statistics, I know there&#x27;s at least one group of acceptable targets for comedy that you&#x27;re not in, which is the capitalist class. You can make jokes about Beyonce running sweatshops or Barack Obama drone striking weddings and the people you&#x27;re talking about aren&#x27;t going to have an issue with it unless they&#x27;re the sort of identity opportunists&#x2F;morefemalecampguards people I don&#x27;t have any time for (and I don&#x27;t think anyone should have any time for).<p>More generally, good comedy is about punching up. It might make you laugh (I don&#x27;t know you) to hear that really funny one about how feeding disabled homeless women into a wood chipper is cool, but most sane people are going to view it as mean-spirited. It&#x27;s a lord having a big old laugh about how the peasants look like scarecrows during the famine - true, and very funny for the court, but unlikely to get a laugh from the peasants for really obvious reasons. You still have things in common with the people making jokes that punch up though, and there are people above both of you that you can both joke about. If it&#x27;s too personally distressing to deal with jokes about you being white or straight or a man or cisgender or abled, you almost always have the option not to listen to them. Even if you&#x27;re a diehard comedy fan, the vast majority of standup comics are not making jokes about how &quot;straight cisgender white abled men suck amiright?&quot; Guarantee it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36476985" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36476985" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lucubratory</span><span>|</span><a href="#36472487">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476388">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476996">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36474117">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36476985">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36476985">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;I know you have said you don&#x27;t agree with it, so please don&#x27;t take the following as me accusing you of excusing the slogan or agreeing with it, I&#x27;m trying to further conversation and am interested in your thoughts and really don&#x27;t want to come off as accusatory.<p>No problems, thank you for clarifying.<p>&gt;Even if it is 100% definitely, totally, absolutely, meant as a joke should we be making allowances for that?<p>It is not a joke, I think you may have missed me saying that earlier. It is insincere, but not a joke. I think maybe you&#x27;re conceiving of every statement that someone doesn&#x27;t literally mean as being only okay if it&#x27;s a joke (assuming it&#x27;s a harmful thing to say in the first place, like &quot;kill all men&quot;). Have you ever talked with a co-worker and said (or heard them say) something like &quot;I wish I could punt my boss into the sun&quot;? It&#x27;s not a joke, the person expressing it really does hate their boss and it&#x27;s not intended to get a laugh, but it is insincere. By &quot;insincere&quot;, I mean that the person does not have any intent to follow through with the literal specific thing they actually said. People just don&#x27;t always talk literally, without there being a requirement that it&#x27;s for humourous purposes. People can say these things as jokes and expect a laugh, but that isn&#x27;t most of the use. It is definitely not the use when it&#x27;s being graffitied onto a wall.<p>&gt;such as in this case where this whole group of people will listen to someone saying &quot;kill all men&quot; and just understand it is a joke and let it go by.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true unless you&#x27;re in a very strong filter bubble. In population-representative company &quot;kill all men&quot; will always get pushback, it&#x27;s never going to be just accepted. I mean, just think about it being said in a group that&#x27;s half men, it would be incredibly uncommon and would definitely receive pushback if someone did say it. It&#x27;s not like society has agreed that &quot;kill all men&quot; is a cool thing to say, that just hasn&#x27;t happened. It&#x27;s also worth noting that &quot;kill all men&quot; is way, way, way less common than either &quot;kill your local rapist&quot; or &quot;all men are bad&quot; or &quot;men suck&quot;, all much less controversial and much more common. &quot;Kill all men&quot; is a super fringe thing. My professional experience is in Australia and maybe it&#x27;s different where you are, I can&#x27;t comment on that. But I am familiar with the phrase and know where it comes from, and that it&#x27;s not some common thing that goes unremarked in company.<p>&gt;For me at least though that sort of joke is frustrating and hurtful when I have had to listen to years to (an often overlapping set of) people talking about how men have a responsibility to speak up when their male friends make those sorts of jokes and tell them to stop. &quot;Silence is Violence&quot; and all that sort of thing.<p>Yeah I&#x27;m very familiar with those campaigns, and I understand the facial similarity you&#x27;re drawing. Those campaigns exist because domestic violence against women exists with a social and cultural support structure that normalises that violence, and the theory behind the campaigns is that intercepting the support structure earlier might stop some amount of domestic violence against women before it ever happens, by stopping its justification in culture.<p>It&#x27;s not the same thing as the &quot;kill all men&quot; example because while some women definitely have killed some men, broadly speaking almost no men are being killed by women, and the number isn&#x27;t spiking or any other observation that should make us concerned that that may change.<p>The reason those domestic violence campaigns got approved isn&#x27;t because governments decided that the hurt feelings of women were worth spending a lot of money to prevent - it wasn&#x27;t about the jokes and frankly at the time basically no government would have cared about that. They got approved because firstly, domestic violence by men against women is very common and most people want it to stop, and because it has a significant cost to the government in terms of healthcare, funerals, legal processing, various support services that need funding for the victims, children need to go into the foster system, etc. And secondly, there were credible theories that predicted the levels of violence should decrease if men are joking about violence against women less.<p>&gt;I do hang around these sorts of people, some of my good friends belong to the local socialist party and their social circles include these sorts of people.<p>If they are socialists and you want them to stop saying things like &quot;kill all men&quot;, I think your best bet is going to be an argument along the lines of &quot;Communism is about the interests of the broad masses, and half of the masses are men - it doesn&#x27;t help the revolutionary cause to alienate oppressed men who can and should be on our side. No program to end chauvinism against women can succeed without broad support from all proletarians, including men. Trying to fix chauvinism against women doesn&#x27;t separate the class, but the slogan &#x27;kill all men&#x27; does.&quot; If they respond with &quot;it&#x27;s just a joke bro don&#x27;t be so emotional&quot; or some variant, note that communists have an obligation to be truthful, and that includes being precise in your language when there&#x27;s a misunderstanding. I have used those arguments successfully to convince people of this and similar issues. If you&#x27;ve made that point in a reasonable way without being overly aggressive or dismissive towards the oppression of women (for example by not indicating that you understand that women are oppressed more deeply and in different specific ways than men) and they still aren&#x27;t interested in stopping it long term., you should probably find other friends if it (understandably) really bothers you, or ignore it and move on if that isn&#x27;t worth it to you. Even if the conversation doesn&#x27;t end with &quot;Wow I didn&#x27;t think about it like that, you&#x27;re very right&quot; (almost no disagreements end like that after one conversation), if you stick with it there is a good chance that they do at least change their behaviour and maybe come around to understanding why it&#x27;s not a good idea. I would strongly advise you to avoid any and all variants of &quot;This is hypocritical&quot;, because they&#x27;re not going to be persuasive as arguments. Hypocrisy is treating the same fundamental situation differently based on factors that are superficial, and it&#x27;s very easy to note that violence against women by men and violence against men by women are not the same fundamental situation, so hypocrisy doesn&#x27;t apply.<p>This message was too long, so I&#x27;ll reply to this with the second half.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36474117" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36474117" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tbihl</span><span>|</span><a href="#36472487">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36473719">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36474101">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36473860">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36474117">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36474117">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just to be clear, &quot;kill all men&quot; <i>literally</i> means &quot;kill all men&quot;, whatever the mindset of the man broadcasting it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36473860" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36473860" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">logicprog</span><span>|</span><a href="#36472487">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36473719">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36474117">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36473771">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36473860">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36473860">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah I&#x27;m very left wing and in trans circles and that combination of rhetoric never made sense to me.

Plus it&#x27;s just... stupid? Like, sure, patriarchy, but one of the crucial parts of third wave feminism was seeing how patriarchy doesn&#x27;t benefit all men at all, it only benefits a few, and even the mechanisms of their privilege can also harm men a lot. And saying stuff like that really does psychologically harm men <i>even if they still have privilege</i> (especially since they may not actually be in a good life position despite that). It&#x27;s actually become a point of discussion in online trans spaces bc trans men have begun pointing out how harmful this rhetoric is — being made to feel evil and like &quot;gender traitors&quot; and stuff for being men, or, if they&#x27;re excludeded from &quot;KAM,&quot; being made to feel like men-lite.

This is maybe the dumbest thing I&#x27;ve ever read.<p><pre><code>    The Massacre of the Bani Qurayza (627 AD): According to Islamic sources, during the siege of Medina in the aftermath of the Battle of the Trench, the Jewish tribe of Bani Qurayza was accused of conspiring with the attacking Meccans against the Muslim community. After the Meccans retreated, Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s followers turned against the Bani Qurayza. The men were executed en masse, while the women and children were enslaved.

    The Sack of Isfahan (1387): Timur, the Turko-Mongol conqueror, laid siege to the city of Isfahan, which was then part of the Jalayirid Sultanate. When the city finally fell, Timur reportedly ordered that every soldier in his army should return with at least two severed human heads. The total number of people killed is estimated to have been about 200,000. Women and children were often spared to be taken as slaves.

    The Massacre of Nanking (1937): Also known as the Nanking Massacre or the Rape of Nanking, this atrocity was committed during the Sino-Japanese War when the Imperial Japanese Army captured the city of Nanking. Over a period of six weeks, mass killings, rapes, and looting were perpetrated against the city&#x27;s residents. While not every man was killed, the death toll was incredibly high, with estimates ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. Many women were raped, and some were killed or taken away.

    Srebrenica Massacre (1995): This was the largest mass murder in Europe since World War II, perpetrated during the Bosnian War. Over 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were systematically executed by units of the Bosnian Serb Army. Women, children, and some elderly men were forcibly transferred and deported, making it an example of ethnic cleansing.

    The Assyrian Empire: The Assyrians, who built a powerful empire in ancient Mesopotamia, were notorious for their brutal military tactics. Their treatment of conquered peoples often included mass killings, forced deportations, and enslavement. However, it&#x27;s important to note that not every city they conquered was subjected to this treatment; it was often employed as a form of psychological warfare, to intimidate other cities into surrendering without a fight.

    The Mongol Empire: While not exactly &quot;ancient&quot; by some definitions, the Mongols under Genghis Khan and his successors in the 13th and 14th centuries were known for their ruthless conquests. Cities that resisted Mongol rule could expect no mercy; the men would often be killed and the women taken as slaves or wives. This strategy was also a form of psychological warfare, encouraging other cities to surrender without a fight to avoid a similar fate.

    The Roman Empire: The Romans are known for their tactic of &quot;decimation&quot;, which involved killing one in every ten men in a unit as punishment for serious infractions, like desertion or cowardice. But when it came to conquered peoples, the Romans were sometimes ruthlessly thorough. For example, after the Third Punic War, the Romans reportedly killed or enslaved the entire population of Carthage.</code></pre></div><br/><div id="36474695" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36474695" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">somewhereoutth</span><span>|</span><a href="#36472487">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36474603">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36474644">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36474695">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36474695">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Right, but not men as a whole class simply for being men.

I am taken aback by the suggestion that Jews have never been rounded up purely for being Jewish. I find this notion historically unfounded and antisemitic.<p>Your comment broadly argues that killing of one group by another is never done with purity of intention. I submit almost nothing people do is for its own sake, but rather woven within individual and collective stories. To think otherwise is to deny the role narrative plays in human consciousness.<p>A cursory glance through a list like this one:
<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pogrom" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pogrom</a> shows numerous examples of massacres of Jews (and others, but mostly Jews). The attackers always claim justifications--again, no group attacks any other group without somehow justifying it to itself, either initially or post-hoc.<p>1. What about the many massacres of the Jews for rejecting Christianity? Surely those are examples of being rounded up for the sake of being Jewish, since the Jewish religion is incompatible with, for example, the concept of the divinity of Jesus. A key point here is that Judaism is a tribal and not universal religion. Thus, it is hard to divorce attacks on the Jewish religion from attacks on the Jewish people.<p>2. What about the massacres justified by absurd pretenses, such as (As you mentioned) poisoning wells, corrupting the host (Communion), or the blood libel (That Jews kill Christian children and use their blood to bake Matzo). These justifications, which do not hold up to scrutiny, only work for a population that wants to believe them in the first place. The sheer number of nonsensical justifications points to the underlying fact--there is no justification at all.<p>3. Need I mention the Holocaust, in which the stated aim of the Nazis was to eliminate the Jewish race? Even those with Jewish ancestry but with no religious practices (and who were not considered Jews by themselves or other Jews) were nonetheless sent to the death camps.<p>By the way, I have focused on historical violence from the Christian world, but this is not to the exclusion of violence from the Islamic world, of which there has been much as well.<p>In sum, if there was ever an example of a group persecuted for purely &quot;being themselves&quot;, it is the Jews.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36475057" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36475057" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yowlingcat</span><span>|</span><a href="#36472487">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36474695">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36475585">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36475477">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36475057">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36475057">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But should it be assumed that you can appreciate that distinction?

I let this kind of thing slide because obviously the problems facing minorities&#x2F;women as groups are far worse than the problems facing men as a group, but just shifting the conversation from &quot;I think group A of people is the problem&quot; to &quot;I think group B of people is the problem&quot; is creating downstream problems. And there are very real issues facing men - suicide rates are dramatic enough to indicate that. I think the goal should be reduce social&#x2F;economic&#x2F;criminal expectations based on what group(s) a particular individual is lumped in, because we are all simultaneously part of, victims of, and perpetrators of a system that damages people, though obviously some groups are hurt way more than others.<p>Public opinion oversimplifies things to good vs bad and works like a pendulum, and I just hope it doesn&#x27;t swing too much in the opposite direction. If people saying &quot;men suck&quot; is a temporary by-product of addressing systemic gender inequality then that&#x27;s a price I&#x27;m willing to pay.

And definitely did not intend to minimize mens problems - I&#x27;m a man myself and have first hand experience. I&#x27;ve had this conversation with a friend who is a outspoken feminist who I felt erased the problems men faced.<p>I don&#x27;t have time to show my thoughts with any objective metrics, so I&#x27;m just going to lay out how I see things, so this will be touchy-feely. This is merely my opinion and I have no problem with people disagreeing.<p>I think the biggest impact is in how people can function in modern society - pay gap, positions of power, tokenization - a good book is &quot;Invisible Man&quot; by Ralph Waldo Ellison which is about more than being black in America but about being an individual that everyone wants to put in a box or a particular group - he&#x27;s invisible because people don&#x27;t see the individual. It&#x27;s universal, and everyone feels that to some degree, but the degree I feel it as a white male is much smaller. Basically your ability to project your will on the world is easy mode for white male (btw - me).<p>Anecdote alert: For example I was literally just talking to an old friend who I&#x27;ve worked with in the past who is a great architect but kept getting the in-the-middle-of-nowhere projects at a very well known and old NYC firm, so she started her own architecture business and is doing quite well.<p>But not that it makes things easy for men! Because there is also expectation to be a provider, suck up your emotions and be tough. These things, which some point to as &quot;the problem&quot; are harming men as well and should be addressed. And this is where it gets very messy - some of the things that are &quot;evidence&quot; that men are privileged are also things that harm men in non-obvious ways. And as for the &quot;easy to project your will&quot;, there is also an expectation that you have to and you&#x27;re a failure if you don&#x27;t. Why can&#x27;t someone live a simple life without feeling like a failure?<p>Ultimately I think the ideal goal should be to not push gender based expectations - both for male and female.</div><br/><div id="36476545" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36476545" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lelanthran</span><span>|</span><a href="#36472487">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36474044">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36474913">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36476545">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36476545">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I don&#x27;t have time to show my thoughts with any objective metrics,<p>Here&#x27;s the thing though, there <i>are</i> objective metrics.

It does not turn out well for men:<p>&gt; I was not prepared to hear over and over from men how the women — the mothers, sisters, girlfriends, wives — in their lives are constantly criticizing them for not being open and vulnerable and intimate, all the while they are standing in front of that cramped wizard closet where their men are huddled inside, adjusting the curtain and making sure no one sees in and no one gets out. There was a moment when I was driving home from an interview with a small group of men and thought, Holy shit. I am the patriarchy. Here’s the painful pattern that emerged from my research with men: We ask them to be vulnerable, we beg them to let us in, and we plead with them to tell us when they’re afraid, but the truth is that most women can’t stomach it. In those moments when real vulnerability happens in men, most of us recoil with fear and that fear manifests as everything from disappointment to disgust.<p>I posted this on HN before, and out of the woodworks came all the anecdotes of bad reactions to male vulnerability. I strongly advise other men to not discuss their feelings in depth with any woman they have romantic interest in, and possibly women in general since I&#x27;ve seen mothers similarly affected.</div><br/><div id="36476329" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36476329" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dumpsterdiver</span><span>|</span><a href="#36472131">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36474321">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36474952">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36476329">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36476329">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah, this resonates.

Anyone who is a potential customer for a lathe has SOME experience, even if it&#x27;s just enough to say &quot;I want a lathe&quot; and the amount of effort they will need to go through to onboard to using the lathe properly is directly proportional to the applicable mental models they have for similar tasks. This probably involves hand eye coordination and gestures along with physics and a bunch of other things to onboard quickly.<p>Intuition is about using the most fundamental mental models that your customer(s) should have and simplifying the connection of those to the new task.<p>So intuition is contextual. The main goal is to save the user time. The narrow goal is to make the product easier to learn compared to your competitors. The big problem is no matter WHAT you do, the mental model a user will use when they approach a new task for the first time is inevitably different than the one you did.<p>Or, &quot;You are not your customer&quot; or however you want to phrase it.</div><br/><div id="40252114" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40252114" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fuzzy2</span><span>|</span><a href="#40251390">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40252684">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40252114">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40252114">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Haha, oh yes.

presented on the display, the equipment should offer qualitative display formats. Qualitative display
formats convey rate and trend information better than quantitative (e.g. digital) presentations.<p>• Controls whose functions are not obvious (they mean yoke, throttles, etc.) should be marked or identified so that a flightcrew
member with little or no familiarity with the airplane is able to rapidly, accurately, and consistently
identify their functions. All the abbreviations seen on cockpit controls are standardized. There&#x27;s a list, and it&#x27;s not that long.<p>• To avoid visual clutter, graphic elements should be included only if they add useful information

interpretation error.<p>The section on &quot;Menus&quot;, on page 156, is definitely worth reading. And following.<p>This stuff isn&#x27;t a mysterious unknown.

It is simple.
2. It is small.
3. It is cheap.
4. It is light.
5. It can be built very quickly.
6. It is very flexible in purpose (“omnibus reactor”)
7. Very little development is required. It will use mostly “off-the-shelf” components.
8. The reactor is in the study phase. It is not being built now.&quot;<p>The whole paper is well worth reading, IMHO:<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whatisnuclear.com&#x2F;rickover.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whatisnuclear.com&#x2F;rickover.html</a></div><br/><div id="40353019" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40353019" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">preisschild</span><span>|</span><a href="#40352241">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40352700">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40353019">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40353019">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Does &quot;small&quot; and &quot;light&quot; really matter outside naval reactors?<p>Nuclear power plants seem to be more economic the bigger they are.

Without nuclear scare the developed world electricity mix could have look like France&#x27;s as early as the 90s, saving countless tons of CO2 emissions, and millions of lifes. Renewable are eventually coming but the tech took 40 more years to come, and that&#x27;s how much we&#x27;re late.</div><br/><div id="40352205" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40352205" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fsh</span><span>|</span><a href="#40351675">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40352132">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40352527">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40352205">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40352205">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The french energy mix is around 50% fossil fuels [1].

Despite the fact that a significant number of the 600k liquidators who worked on the cleanup received radiation doses that resulted in cancer one or two decades later with a statistical much higher chance, when compared to the overall population.<p>Then, they will argue that while green energy is beneficial, we need a combination of energy sources due to storage challenges.

Those are all very different motivations.<p>Likewise, there are people who &quot;unschool,&quot; people who use very formal curricula, people who make use of co-ops and traditional classroom settings, people who use a lot of remote learning, people who value social interactions and have their kids involved in lots of activities with other kids, and people who are more focused on academic achievement.  These are all very different methods of education.<p>Beyond that, there are parents who are well equipped to homeschool and parents who are not.  And there is a small but hard-to-ignore percentage who claim to homeschool but really neglect their kids.<p>Treating all these scenarios as a single thing that you can hold a single, consistent opinion about suggests to me a lack of familiarity with its wide spectrums along multiple dimensions.  It&#x27;s like passing a judgment on a person based on their race, country of origin, gender, etc.<p>Disclaimer: Our family homeschools.  Both my wife (previously a public- and private-school teacher) and I were biased against it prior to having kids, but we came to find that a lot of our biases and concerns were unfounded.</div><br/><div id="38090008" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38090008" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jandrese</span><span>|</span><a href="#38089319">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38089780">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38090008">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38090008">[329 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is a huge spectrum, but back when we homeschooled (my wife wasn&#x27;t yet comfortable sending the kids back to the classroom in 2021) we did a few events where local homeschool kids got together for various activities.  Tree identification&#x2F;nature trail at the park, visits to historic sites, stuff like that.<p>Of the parents I met there was some variety, but 9 times out of 10 it seemed like they were mostly doing it because they thought the public schools were too secular and were teaching &quot;sinful&quot; sciences like evolution.  They were all polite about it, but it started making me wonder if all of these other aspects of homeschooling were just a fig leaf over a whole lot of religious indoctrination.

The worst behaviors, the least faith, the most fear, all hidden by duplicity and a weekly practice of virtue signaling. This is not isolated, my parents were involved in the church in many states and internationally, it was everywhere.<p>I am old enough now that I have seen the outcomes projecting into peoples 30s. I know so many poorly educated homeschoolers whose lives have been destroyed with no hope of recovery by the complete lack of skills their hyper religious parents imparted them with, in jail, broke, unable to hack it in college and too lacking in common sense to make it in the trades or professional work, with living standards insanely far below their parents. That being said, I am not against homeschooling personally and may do it myself.<p>I think your outsider perspective makes sense since you didn&#x27;t see the self-righteousness and persecution complex inherent in the system. It&#x27;s like a northerner taking &quot;bless your heart&quot; at face value because they&#x27;re dealing with a degree of cowardice and dishonest duplicity they haven&#x27;t experienced before.

I believe there is no way around the idea that without religion, there is no such thing as morality. It all comes down to the question: how do you know what&#x27;s right and wrong? If you don&#x27;t have an external moral code, that is, you decide what is right and wrong, then the odds are stacked against you, 1 out of every individual with a unique opinion to ever exist; it is conceited for anyone to believe they are the one. Not even the majority is always correct; at one point in time the majority of the Earth believed slavery was fine, yet today we are so comfortable to say that was evil. I couldn&#x27;t agree more strongly that it is evil, but what will the majority of society think about our morals in a millennium? Why start &quot;the 21st century popular culture religion&quot; when it is inevitably fallible to time?
The only possible solution is an external moral code. That is what the Bible, the Koran, etc... are: absolute right and absolute wrong. If that doesn&#x27;t exist, why should I believe I&#x27;m any better than Hitler? He believed he was right. You wouldn&#x27;t even be able to reason that murder is evil.

Please show me the empirical test for this. Or is it just about whether you feel your actions accord with the word of God? Because even then you&#x27;re just practicing moral relativism and waving your hands at a book composed by fallible humans, all of whom were doing the same, all the way back to before the canons were written. Is it because the book is supposedly divinely-inspired? How do you know the correct divinity inspired the correct people in the correct way? even standing on the soapbox of &quot;well uh uh uh of course my religion is the correct one you smelly heretic&quot; you literally have nothing to go off of except your own feelings and perspective.<p>So, in short, I don&#x27;t find your position very convincing. Also, if Christians were some sort of uniquely enlightened group with special access to the metaphysical groups of the universe, why do they keep falling into the same patterns of behavior as all the other humans who don&#x27;t have this divine guarantee? Like, if religion was actually some special basis upon which to erect a human morality, why does it achieve such similar outcomes as every other basis? If it&#x27;s because &quot;humans are fallible and don&#x27;t always accord perfectly to the perfect divine plan allocated to them,&quot; then, again, how is that exactly non-relativistic? Is it because the book exists as some sort of measuring stick by which to determine the essential goodness of someone? Because even that depends on the fallible interpretation of the interpreter, unless you presuppose some special person who is blessed with divine discernment to determine the actual divinely-approved interpretation.<p>It all ultimately devolves to &quot;you just gotta have faith bro.&quot; I do not have faith in an entire group of people thumbing their noses at everyone else like their shit doesn&#x27;t stink.

I suspect if she had attended a secular school with no religious role models, she may would have ended up an atheist.<p>I think the point I&#x27;m trying to get across is that I think agnostic atheism is generally born out of a lack of indoctrination.  Both theism and strong atheism usually come from being indoctrinated into that sort of thing.  The fact that your family is different -- and IMHO fairly rare -- doesn&#x27;t really invalidate that.

The most controversial topics are ones related to sexuality. But there&#x27;s an utterly trivial, and even perfectly reasonable, explanation for why so many different religions look down on any form of sex except man+woman+babies. As one looks back in the past, the &#x27;effective fertility&#x27; rates had to have been just barely hanging on by a thread. By &#x27;effective fertility&#x27; I mean having children who also have children. Having 80 kids, but where only 1 succeeds in having kids, would be an &#x27;effective fertility&#x27; of 1.<p>So let&#x27;s consider some numbers for effective fertility. Imagine it was 4. That means each generation (which we&#x27;ll call 30 years, even though it was probably close to 20) would be twice as large as the one prior. And this could be reversed (to see how big your parents&#x27; generation was) by multiplying by 0.5. So let&#x27;s look back to see what the population would have been 2100 years ago, or 70 generations, using various effective fertility rates.<p>---<p>4 effective fertility =&gt; 8 billion people today * 0.5 (reversible fertility factor) ^ 70 (total generations) = global population in 100BC of... 0!<p>3 effective fertility =&gt; 8 billion * 0.66^70 = global population in 100BC of... 0!<p>2.5 effective fertility =&gt; 8 billion * 0.8^70 = global population in 100BC of... 1316.<p>---<p>So we can say that effective fertility rates had to be lower than 2.5 on average! Average being important since we probably went through cycles of higher and lower effective fertility, but that only makes this scarier. There were probably times in the past where humanity&#x27;s effective fertility dipped below 2, which means we&#x27;re on our way to extinction. Anybody seeing this, and thinking about the future of humanity, would have realized how fundamentally critical to our survival simply producing more children was. And what&#x27;s the lowest hanging fruit there? People having non-reproductive sex.</div><br/><div id="38094677" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38094677" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xyzelement</span><span>|</span><a href="#38089319">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38094638">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38093523">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38094677">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38094677">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I glazed over on the math but I agree with your statement.

I think also yes.<p>And on the flip side, secular society prides itself on how smart, objective, no &quot;sky daddy&quot; fantasies, etc it is as it marches towards self-selected extinction.</div><br/><div id="38094862" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38094862" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">somenameforme</span><span>|</span><a href="#38089319">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38094677">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38093523">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38094862">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38094862">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Exactly. But I want to also quickly clarify the math, because I realize I put lots of numbers out there - but it&#x27;s all pretty straight forward and very helpful for modeling and understanding where things are headed. There are two main components to the math:<p>1) An effectively fertility rate of &quot;N&quot; will result in the next generation being N&#x2F;2 times as large. So a fertility of 2 means the next generation will be exactly the same size (2 people, having 2 kids who have 2 kids...) while a fertility rate of 4 would result in a doubling of size, and a fertility rate of 1 would result in the next generation being half as large.<p>2) To reverse the multiplication of some value by &quot;X&quot;, you simply multiply by 1&#x2F;X. So if our population increases by 1.5 in a generation, then to reverse that and get from the new population, back to where we started, we&#x27;d multiply by 1&#x2F;1.5 or 0.66. So for instance 100 * 1.5 = 150. And 150 * 0.66 = 100.<p>---<p>So taking the most complex example. Fertility rate of 2.5 = a population increasing factor of 1.25. Reversing that means multiplying by 0.8<p>So if our parent&#x27;s generation had a fertility rate of 2.5, that would mean that their population would be 0.8 times the size of our population, which I take as the global population which is about 8 billion. And if <i>their</i> parents also had a fertility rate of 2.5, then the exact same would follow for <i>another</i> multiplication of 0.8. So if we go back &quot;N&quot; generations, we&#x27;d end up with a population, for that generation, of 8 billion * 0.8^N.<p>So going back 70 generations with a fertility rate of 2.5, we finally get the original formula: 8 billion * 0.8^70 = world population 70 generations ago.

You get all kinds of people in a religious group: the legalists, the people who think they believe but actually have a higher priority, the immature people, and the mature self-givers. Legalism has inherent contradictions that can easily end up treating people poorly. The people who have a higher priority that than the values of the group are likely to act outside the values of the group, which is especially noticeable if they are in leadership. The immature people want to do the right thing, but fear, emotional issues, etc. exert a stronger pull.<p>I don&#x27;t think the purpose of religion is to &quot;align yourself to the highest aspirations&quot;, though, but rather to make sense of our place in the world and how to rightly live within it. They have rather different views of this, of course. Traditional Christianity says our place in the world is as children of God who are intended to be the image of God in the world and shepherd it with God&#x27;s self-giving love. (Getting saved to go to heaven is a relatively new simplification.) Buddhism, in contrast, observes that all composed things are impermanent, so nothing is actually real and forming attachments to things causes pain.

There is no belief there, its just us observing the world.</div><br/><div id="38093318" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38093318" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">patrick451</span><span>|</span><a href="#38089319">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38092819">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38092134">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38093318">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38093318">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh I know, I&#x27;ve heard all that before. But it&#x27;s a cop out. Just more sophistry. If science doesn&#x27;t try to explain our origin, they have no business thinking about the big bang or evolution or anything else that happened billions of years ago. They should only be concerned with the here and now and future prediction. And this is part of the problem. They can&#x27;t actually test these theories. It&#x27;s all conjecture. Nobody is running a big bang experiment under various hypothesized conditions to see if actually works. The most charitable characterization of Cosmology is that it is a history, not a science. I think a better description is pseudo science.</div><br/><div id="38093407" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38093407" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Jensson</span><span>|</span><a href="#38089319">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38093318">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38092134">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38093407">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38093407">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; They should only be concerned with the here and now and future prediction<p>Anything that can help us figure out ways the past played out can help us understand the future. For example, if we see that many stars have likely gone supernova in the past, we can look at our own star, the sun, and figure out when or if it will go supernova as well. We can&#x27;t test stars and supernovas because we don&#x27;t have control over them, but studying those things means we will have a more accurate understanding of the topic than if we didn&#x27;t.<p>Gathering data and making theories about that data is science. The scientific method with experiments is the most important signal and it trumps everything else, but when we lack the ability to do experiments then extrapolating what we know from those experiments is the next best thing and it is still science.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m not sure why you are so anti-science here. Can you explain why you feel you need to put the big bang on the same level as &quot;God did it&quot;? Do you really think that those two things are on the same level here? The big bang comes from extrapolating what we know from experiments and applying it to the universe and then looking at what happens if we play that backwards. It is a very mundane thing.<p>Edit: An example that is similar to big bang:<p>You stand on an open field. You feel something hitting your head. You look down and see a ball. You turn around and see a person standing there, nobody else in sight. Do you think these two are the same level:<p>&quot;God created the ball and dropped it on your head&quot;<p>&quot;The person you see had the ball and threw it at your head&quot;<p>You would say &quot;We can&#x27;t know for sure which is true, they are equally valid beliefs!&quot;, right?

Home schooling has an incredible amount of inequality built in to it. Affluent parents can hire instructors. Poor parents may not even be able to meet their children’s basic schooling needs, if it weren’t for public schools.<p>Obviously there’s a lot of middle ground between those two extremes, and the circumstances today don’t exactly match the circumstances of the mid-19th century, which is roughly when modern public schools started appearing in the US (based on the “Prussian model”).<p>There are a lot of different objectives that public schooling sets out to achieve. It can be too easy to focus on narrow sets of metrics like test scores, or collect a bunch of anecdotes about bad experiences in public schools (or bad experiences in homeschooling).

I&#x27;m not great at history, but my understanding is that the mid-19th century was a little lacking in videoconferencing software, educated people with the resources to be on the other end of that video link, population density to have enough other like-minded kids within driving... uh, horse-riding range, up to date books, parents who weren&#x27;t gone to the factories or fields during the day, etc.<p>&gt; There are a lot of different objectives that public schooling sets out to achieve.<p>Agreed. There is a smaller set of objectives that they actually do achieve.<p>&gt; IMO it’s probably a lot easier to fix this broken system rather than burn it to the ground and do homeschooling instead.<p>I would assert that it&#x27;s impossible to fix this broken system, and I can cite a lot of past history. I would also assert that replacing it entirely with homeschooling (which is not a single thing, but whatever) is also a guaranteed path to failure. The only hope I see is for exploration to be possible, and for people in the different situations to learn from each other. The public school institutions do try to experiment, but are incredibly restricted in all sorts of ways. Homeschoolers have the training wheels off and are much more free to crash straight into the bushes or off a cliff, but in practice plenty don&#x27;t and plenty come up with a lot of different ways of doing things, some of them that seem to be working quite well in practice — academically, socially, etc.<p>I agree that sucking resources out of public schools to benefit the privileged few is very troubling and worrisome. But so is the current state and trajectory of public schooling, and holding everyone back may be short term fair but long term disastrous.<p>We&#x27;re homeschooling one of our kids (both until recently, when one went to a public charter high school). We&#x27;ve seen the institutional effects firsthand. Simple example: we found excellent math resources, but they weren&#x27;t &quot;A-G&quot; accredited for University of California entrance requirements. Which gave us pause, since we wanted to leave that option open. We ended up going through a A-G accredited program, the best of what we could identify, for a semester. It was crap: rote memorization of algorithms exactly matching to the state standards, lots of repetitive exercises, minimally useful feedback from teachers and their assistants. My son passed all of their tests and got an A+ grade, and is now a semester behind in math because none of that stuck in a way that is useful for building on. It was a waste of time. We gave up on it and the whole accredited path, and went back to an online program that is far more conceptual, rigorous, and just plain effective. (His earlier public school experience was somewhere in the middle, Again he did quite well there according to the state tests.)<p>My guess is that it&#x27;s yet another form of enshittification: A-G accreditation is very valuable, but once you get it there&#x27;s no profit in increasing quality, only in growing your student base. There aren&#x27;t enough accredited places to provide any competition on quality, especially when there&#x27;s so much disagreement about what &quot;quality&quot; is in the first place, and as usual any useful definition ends up being expensive. Non-accredited places have to compete on quality.<p>(For anyone who finds value in my personal opinions: Silicon Valley High School math bad, Art of Problem Solving math good.)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38089371" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38089371" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dmazzoni</span><span>|</span><a href="#38085981">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38086572">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38089184">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38091682">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38089371">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38089371">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are you comparing the best public schools to the best homeschools?

The school had been expanded several times, and was more or less at capacity. Some facilities were scaled out well, others weren&#x27;t. There were fights on a weekly basis, tons of security trying to prevent that, but, they could only do so much. Lunch lines were very long, sometimes I&#x27;d be lucky to get 10 minutes to eat, mostly brought my own lunch because of that. The school was locked down a few times that year because of weapon scares. It was hell.<p>Then my sophomore year, they cut the school in half, sending most of the students, save for the seniors, to a new school across town. That landed the school I attended at around 1400 kids, my junior year, all of the extra seniors had graduated, so, it shrank further to around 1300. From sophomore year on, there was not a single fight, everyone knew eachother and got along, they cut the security team down to just two people and they both were well liked. Test scores were way up, class sizes went from 40+ to consistently under 30, and things overall were fairly good as far as highschool goes. The new school across town was a similar situation from what I gathered from friends who went there.<p>Now you might write that off as it was simply too crowded, but, they closed about a third of the school, which was held in portable classrooms when the split happened. Some of those were re-purposed for offices and whatnot, most got hauled away. So the actual density of people didn&#x27;t really change much. We got some extra space to have PE classes in, but that was about it, space wise.<p>You might also write that off as demographic changes, which was also not true. In fact, the roughest part of town all went to the school I attended, while the nicer, more affluent side of town, mostly got sent to the new school.<p>The way I see it, the school was simply too large, and managing that many students day to day, and all of their needs and affairs, did not scale well, and bred inefficiency, inefficiency that existed long before I got there and everyone got to keep their job and maintain that as the status-quo. Sure the buildings&#x2F;campus could physically contain them well enough, yes they were all reasonably well fed and watered, but they&#x27;d become unmanageable in such a way that was not likely to be fixed.<p>In terms of reinvention in public education, smaller schools are a decent model, as are smaller class sizes. The real deciding factor in how well a student does however, is parent buy-in, which homeschool models have in spades, and in addition the class sizes are about as small as you can reasonably go as well. Understand of course that, parents opting to homeschool are paying taxes to public schools, while receiving no benefit, and that in addition to paying for the costs associated with homeschooling. Not all families can afford to effectively pay for schooling twice, hell, most can barely afford to exist while paying once. You could very likely fix your concerns about privilege by simply redirecting money back to homeschool parents that would normally be spent on public school. There are very well defined $&#x2F;student numbers out there, so, the amounts would be fairly trivial to come up with. You could also really work around the whole right&#x2F;left politically polarized bullshit factory by perhaps giving a little more to the lower income families and a little less to high income families. I think that&#x27;d sufficiently frame the nominally &#x27;right wing&#x27; framed homeschool ideals as neutral, or at least dissonant enough that you might get most of everyone on-board provided you could get the right palms greased in state government.<p>Understand of course that, the public education system is an enormous apparatus, and they&#x27;re managing unfathomable numbers of students. They&#x27;re also not setup in fairly clean competency hierarchies either. At the local level, seniority tends to be king, at the broader level, the ability to navigate the political system is the selection factor. Neither of those have anything to do with &quot;who&#x27;s talented at educating kids&quot;, and while you do have means to measure performance, those same means are also decided upon by the very same people being effectively measured, so there&#x27;s an incentive to make them easier over time, as that looks politically better. So if anything, the incentives we&#x27;ve created are exactly backwards, and the system cannot change until those incentives are fixed. I don&#x27;t really know how you&#x27;d prevent standardized testing from being watered down or trifled with. I don&#x27;t really know how you&#x27;d create sufficient educator turnover with the unions in place to weed out bad teachers. More or less, the system is broken, we need bloodsports to fix it, but they&#x27;ve thought of that, and have prevented it from happening.<p>I&#x27;m not holding by breath of course. People are more than likely going to write it off as &quot;privilege&quot; regardless of the changes proposed, with a whole list of valid enough sounding reasons that they haven&#x27;t really thought through, most of which won&#x27;t really have any baring on reality, and nothing will change aside from actual children being mortally wounded by poor education. That&#x27;ll continue as-is, furthering the class divide, increasing unrest, increasing predatory behavior toward people who, could have been saved by better policy, but were thought more useful as sacrifices on the altar of &quot;the other team&#x27;s&quot; apparatus.<p>As for me? I&#x27;ll be eating beans and rice and driving a 15 year old honda while putting my future children through a homeschool program regardless of what happens.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38089150" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38089150" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lapetitejort</span><span>|</span><a href="#38085981">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38093179">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38089150">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38089150">[79 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was home-schooled until high school.

They went to private school that ran from 1-8 grade, so they essentially skipped the middle school experience that was detrimental to so many. Honestly, I believe middle school as I experienced it (a whole bunch of elementary &quot;feeder&quot; schools that fed into one giant middle school for 7-8 grade) is the dumbest invention in the history of humanity. It sticks together kids, at wildly different stages of development, in an unfamiliar environment where everyone is trying to find their place in the social hierarchy - Lord of the Flies should have been set in middle school. Much better IMO to just have kids stay together 1-8th grade, and by then most folks are at least well into puberty by the time they get to high school. Not saying of course bullying doesn&#x27;t happen in high school, but I think by then more kids are able to find their &quot;tribe&quot;, so if they are bullied they have friends to fall back on (again, I&#x27;m of course painting with broad strokes).</div><br/></div></div><div id="38089470" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38089470" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">arrowsmith</span><span>|</span><a href="#38086166">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38086521">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38089025">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38089470">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38089470">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I work remotely, my wife freelances.<p>Are you both working full-time?

At least homeschooling is something that the individual can control, public funding not so much.<p>But it boggles my mind how people can assume, with a straight face, that they are equipped to educate their child alone - something which is normally a profession for which you have to study O(years) (and even then most people aren’t really good at). What gives parents this confidence? And what gives parents the right to squander the future of their children on a whim?<p>I have two kids, would consider myself very well educated (have a PhD, etc), and I habe absolutely 0 confidence in myself schooling my kids.<p>Finally, public schooling is obviously an attempt at leveling the playing field between children from different backgrounds.

The kids can socialize and the parents can share responsibility for teaching and supervising.<p>It also doesn’t mean just the parents participate. At my local public library, the children’s floor has a huge amount of programming aimed at homeschooling families. The librarians run activities with the kids, showing them how to find books in the library for science research, make crafts together (by hand and with library 3D printers), learn about engineering by building cars and robots with electronics components.<p>Homeschooling can of course be done badly and we should worry about kids in those environments. However, homeschooling done right can be far more dynamic and engaging than the best public schools around. It also doesn’t have to be expensive, it just takes time and commitment from the parents involved.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38089459" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38089459" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bluefirebrand</span><span>|</span><a href="#38085942">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38086138">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38086049">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38089459">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38089459">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In Alberta, homeschool is really more akin to &quot;remote school&quot; than homeschool.<p>The kids are still required to pass the same exams to get their high school diploma, and they still get a package of course work and required reading and such.

A school is part of American culture, it can&#x27;t somehow choose not to participate. To use a historical example, there was a culture war over teaching evolution in schools. A teacher at the time could describe the history and facts of the controversy without stating their opinion on it, but when the students leave that classroom, they are still in a school that either teaches evolution or doesn&#x27;t. By existing and having a curriculum, the school takes a position in the culture war.<p>Imagine if your country held a referendum on a certain issue, and said &quot;if more than 50% of citizens vote yes, the law passes, otherwise it fails&quot;. You could have a genuinely neutral opinion on the issue (&quot;I don&#x27;t care which side wins&quot;), but you cannot take a neutral action, because not voting makes the law less likely to pass. This is unfair, and you can be mad about it, but the only way to be &quot;neutral&quot; would be to leave the country and renounce your citizenship so that you are no longer part of the equation. Similarly, in a culture war, the only way to be neutral would be to not participate in the culture in question, which is even more difficult than leaving a country.<p>Let me give one more example: whether or not to tip your server in a restaurant. Tipping 10% instead of 20% is not neutral. Tipping 50% of the time you go to a restaurant is not neutral. You could say &quot;I don&#x27;t wish to take a position, so I will no longer go to restaurants&quot;, but I&#x27;m confident the anti-tipping side would claim you as one of their own.

You don&#x27;t have a right to use their money to teach something that a lot of people don&#x27;t want to be taught. Of course, there&#x27;s some line where something is fringe enough and you don&#x27;t have to accommodate every last person. Again, try to be neutral, don&#x27;t aim for perfection.<p>And you know what? Evolution is a nuanced topic. The actual claims that can be backed up by first principals using the scientific method are fairly narrow. Much of the reasoning is very prone to confirmation bias and all kinds of after-the-fact fitting rather than forward-looking predictions. To stick to the science on the topic of evolution you have to be pretty careful and most teachers are not. Not saying it shouldn&#x27;t be taught...

I’m not really sure why his parents homeschooled him. He was an only child, and strikingly similar to the character of Cartman from Southpark. Him mom was also strikingly similar to Cartman’s mom. He didn’t learn anything, as his mom was not very strict about making sure he did his lessons. He had terrible social skills and very few life skills, which all came from hobbies that he pursued. He was an intelligent kid, and is struggling today due to generally poor work ethic and few job skills.<p>The second family was a typical anti-government family with cult-like religious beliefs. They believed God was in charge of their reproductive systems and had way more children than they could care for. It was a huge family. The first born was able to secure a job as an airline attendant, and led a reasonably normal life. Last I heard, many of the rest had succumb to methamphetamine and&#x2F;or opioid addictions and have been in and out of jail. All of them were substantially undereducated, several with severe speech impediments and none with GEDs or high school diplomas.<p>The last family were the kids of my family’s pastor. They were generally successful. Their parents were strict, but very involved in their kids’ education. In many ways, they were successful - ahead in reading and math.

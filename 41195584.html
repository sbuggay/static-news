The trend was started and accelerated by motor companies and hardware just followed suit.<p>Then, some other points are just...there. Apple is America&#x27;s semiconductor problem because Apple is so big it purchases things in bulk and gets discounts - like every other big company in every industry.<p>TSMC sold 100% of the capacity to Apple for 3nm chips because no one else had the designs ready, Apple needed them in bulk, and the yield wasn&#x27;t that high. It is problematic, but you need to mention these things when making a claim.<p>The problem is two fold - other companies are not really innovating and experimenting at semis with a scale at which Apple is. This is a market failure more than an Apple failure. Others were reliant on Qualcomm, broadcomm, samsung, and Intel, with slower pace of innovation. Then there is Asian countries with cheap economies of scale.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to assume the most nefarious intent from the start and then look at everything from that lens.

If they had delivered a version of Windows for ARM capable of seamlessly emulating x86 code with no compromises<p>This is hardly possible on most ARM chips because x86 has a much stronger memory model than ARM. Also concerning &quot;with no compromises&quot;: common x86 implementations have a very fast implementation of the SIMD instruction sets (SSE..., AVX&#x2F;AVX2, perhaps AVX-512) that is much slower to emulate on ARM because their SIMD instruction set is different. The only reason why people don&#x27;t realize this is that a lot of common software makes no intense use of these SIMD instructions. Then there are the subtle parts that (as far as I am aware) the ARM FPU handles multiplication of denormalized floating-point numbers slightly different than x86 (both implementations are allowed by the standard) etc.</div><br/><div id="41199638" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41199638" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rob74</span><span>|</span><a href="#41196551">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41199558">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41198985">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41199638">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41199638">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well, Apple seems to have achieved this (for all intents or purposes) on MacOS (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rosetta_(software)#Rosetta_2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rosetta_(software)#Rosetta_2</a> - &quot;In some benchmarks, x86-64-only programs performed better under Rosetta 2 on a Mac with an Apple M1 SOC than natively on a Mac with an Intel x86-64 processor&quot;), so there&#x27;s no reason why Microsoft shouldn&#x27;t be able to do the same for Windows?

It’s pretty much the definition of a loss-leader to get people into the ecosystem for things that google <i>can</i> monetize. So android as a product is <i>implicitly, foreverially</i> tiedup with marketing and spyware, because google isn’t onboard otherwise.  Same as gmail or search was a loss-leader to get people onboard for advertising too. Google only cares about these things insofar as they might stop being a funnel into their money-makers.<p>SOC vendors can’t make a run providing 7 years of driver&#x2F;firmware support for a product they sell once at bleedingly thin margins. Or at least, they really don’t wanna.<p>OEMs can’t make a run providing 7 years of support for someone else’s software, especially when they also have to do a lot of the driver work themselves thanks to IHVs abdicating their job.<p>Consumers get stuck with a product that loses support in 2 years or whatever, and may even have landmines involved with unlocking it to continue support (Sony wipes the camera firmware if you unlock the bootloader for example). They face a completely unnecessary hardware and software treadmill due to all these other factors.  Supporting your own phone is not a reasonable expectations for Joe Sixpack either.<p>The idea is supposed to be the “linux model” but honestly linux has the same problems, it is reliant on the same unpaid labor around driver work to make up for the inability of vendors to track the ecosystem and provide the long-tail of support. In cases where the vendor can’t open source it, the functionality simply ends up broken, and driver support, kernel versioning, and DKMS is a <i>constant</i> battle for end users. Just like with custom roms for android.<p>Android simply has too little margin split among too many disinterested parties to ever really work. And fixing it would involve either increasing the size of the pie (margin), which consumers in this segment <i>hate</i> to an unfathomable degree (android users = cheapskates is a reliable first-order approximation, borne out by the app store revenue too).<p>But that&#x27;s the free-market system working as intended, right? Literally every penny has been squeezed out of margins, software costs pushed onto free labor in the open-source community, and ad revenue used to contra-fund and push end-user prices even lower. Android is the finest solution the free-market can deliver, that&#x27;s <i>how the system is supposed to work</i>, and it’s delivered an excellent product for the needs of the customer - it&#x27;s just you&#x27;re not the customer, you&#x27;re the product.<p>The alternative is vertical consolidation and bringing more things under the same roof, raising the price, and targeting the consumer needs instead of the ad revenue needs. Basically the apple model. But that can never be a viable path in a GPL world. And it will still probably involve paying more - phone costs are currently subsidized by all these indirect costs like ad money and vendors cutting corners on support.  There is more work that will need to be done, and that contra-revenue from advertising revenue needs to be backed out of the purchase price, so at the end of the day consumers will simply have to pay somewhat more (hopefully not apple prices of course). But again, people are cheapskates, android users doubly so.<p>I don&#x27;t know why people got so allergic to the idea of <i>paying for their operating system</i>, the baseline assumption now seems to be that it needs to be free, and if that&#x27;s the case you will never be free, only stuck in a choice between advertising-mongers and exploiting unpaid labor.  And that can either be in hardware costs, or in actual recurring support costs, but either way, someone needs to be paid to sit down and make sure the bluetooth and sound drivers work.<p>You see the same problem in software too - open-source projects get commercial entities tapping their value without providing contributions back, or existing via patronage to the needs and goals of the commercial entity. Without an incentive by the actual developers to provide end-user value, and with permissive licensing, you end up with a constant struggle for financial homeostasis. Firefox&#x2F;Mozilla, for example.<p>People <i>complain</i> about android but they still are not willing to pay a little more to opt-out of these problems.  The revealed preference is for purchase price above all else, and people still think in the yardstick of Apple being &quot;too expensive&quot; rather than Android being &quot;too cheap&quot;.  The yardstick is still the artificially-cheap advertising-subsidized Android product.<p>These are fundamentally problems of not enough margins to support all the players in this ecosystem, which leads to them looking for places to find the revenue to make it work.  Pay a little more and these problems go away.<p>If you want to stop being the product, get used to opening up your wallet. That transactionality is a <i>good thing</i> - you can’t really demand boundaries when you’re living on someone else’s dime. It’s Google’s house and they’re letting you crash for free. But this is the very deepest core of the problem - people will do anything <i>except</i> just pay a little more.<p>You will never stop being the product if you can’t bring yourself to be a customer.<p>(Yes, I pay for kagi, how did you know!?)</div><br/><div id="41197706" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41197706" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wrsh07</span><span>|</span><a href="#41196116">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41197433">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41197674">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41197706">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41197706">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I mostly agree with your take.

Not out of anything they really did wrong, but actually just by well-intentioned success.<p>It’s about “code revenue” vs “services revenue”. If I can’t sell you a copy of Office 97, well, obviously that pushes things to the Office 365 model.  And the unfortunate reality is that a huge amount of important code is now GPL, which means a huge amount of the world’s codebase is now un-monetizable in that sense.  This has fueled a massive push for “alternative revenue”, and the whole google model has been that the &quot;alternative source&quot; is advertising dollars.<p>Moreover, GPL itself has conditioned people that the right price for software is “free”.  And obviously software is not free to produce, nor is the ecosystem of phones conductive to the Linux “hardware bazaar” model in the same way as 1990s era IBM-compatible PCs. [0]<p>Well, if the only valid price for consumer-facing software is “free”, and a huge amount of the software in the world is now un-monetizeable in the sense of being able to sell a copy of the software to fund your R&amp;D effort… obviously that just pours gas on the fire of the tivo’ization and SaaS revenue models.  That is a <i>correct</i> business-development response to the changing market conditions.<p>GPL has essentially forced the collapse of the traditional “fee for source” or “fee for binary” model.  I think it probably would have been out-competed by service revenue eventually <i>anyway</i>, given that consumers obviously prefer “free” to paying money, but basically this is an accelerationism thing whereby GPL has more or less collapsed the entire proprietary-software market (to the extent that many people now view hardware that doesn’t have open drives as being somehow fundamentally bad or illegitimate), driving everyone into the arms of the SaaS providers.  It has accelerationism’d us right into tivo’ization.<p>Big “my neighbor’s cats keep getting eaten by coyotes and he says that he just goes to the shelter and gets another cat and I said it sounds like he’s just feeding shelter cats to coyotes and his daughter started crying” energy.  Like GPL literally has been <i>so successful</i> that people think proprietary software is illegitimate… <i>except</i> for the “free” ones backed by advertising dollars.<p>GPL has been feeding consumers to the coyotes.  It doesn&#x27;t mean they meant to do it, but, functionally by killing fee-for-software models and by conditioning everyone that the only valid price is &quot;free&quot;, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s kinda done.  Proprietary software still exists... you just don&#x27;t pay <i>with money</i> anymore.<p>I am of course human too, I groan at the thought of paying $350&#x2F;year for a personal jetbrains license or paying $1000 more for an apple laptop than a comparable commodity one... but software costs money to develop and you make your choices about what is worthwhile and which relationships you want to accept enshittification on.  My point is just that transactionality (ie, you pay money and receive a service) is actually a good thing, because those services are much less likely to enshittify if it&#x27;s going to come at the expense of actual paying customers rather than just some livestock waiting to be sheared.  It changes the nature of the relationship.<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t bad companies that do enshittification anyway, but if the expectation is pay money =&gt; receive good, then obviously you can reasonably hold expectations about the nature of what you&#x27;re going to receive, vs GPL and proprietary models fostering the &quot;it&#x27;s free, why are you complaining&quot; mindset.  GPL and SaaS models are alike in that respect and GPL has both directly reinforced that mindset, and also pushed far more companies to SaaS far more quickly with its own success.<p>[0] (Wireless+modems have specific regulatory requirements that are <i>inherently</i> incompatible with open-licensing, it is <i>illegal</i> to release a wireless chipset which is capable of violating local band-regulation requirements, which functionally imposes the requirement that devices listen to the local band to detect weather radar upon bootup to see if they&#x27;re allowed to use the band in a given locality.  This is part of why modern routers are so slow to boot up!  And to prevent tampering&#x2F;replacement, this effectively <i>must</i> be put in a closed blob to pass certification.  Which is why projects like OpenWRT are struggling with Wifi 6E&#x2F;6GHz and other newer hardware - when I checked maybe a year ago, there were zero 6E devices supported.  And unfortunately, it is not possible to make a very good phone without wireless connectivity.  It literally is one of the most challenging domains to try and go open-license on because the FCC ain&#x27;t playin&#x27;.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34134905">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34134905</a><p>--<p>Outlawing this &quot;contra-revenue&quot;&#x2F;ad-supported moel is low-key one of the biggest things the EU could tackle though.  Big problem, wide problem.<p>Granted they&#x27;re walking down that path with GDPR dismantling a lot of the worst of the surveillance capitalism, and with forcing Android to have actual reasonable OS support lifespans... they are gradually forcing these externalities&#x2F;defects to be priced in properly.  But I think it is explicitly worth stating as an end-goal:  transactionality and fee-for-service or fee-for-product is a good thing, because then companies are competing to service customers and not competing for more livestock to be the product.<p>If you want to stop enshittification, get rid of contra-revenue models.  The thing you are paying for, should be profitable to produce at the price you sell it.  If you have engineering effort that&#x27;s shared with other products: fine, amortize&#x2F;attribute it however makes sense.  But if you are selling a widget that costs $10 to produce for $9, on the expectation of $3 of revenue:  no, that should be illegal.<p>If nothing else it&#x27;s a <i>competition</i> issue, you can&#x27;t have &quot;honest&quot; firms ever break this situation if you have other companies &quot;dumping&quot; and selling below-actual-cost.  It is really no different from any other kind of dumping.<p>Otherwise, the advertising-supported companies will always be able to out-compete the &quot;honest&quot; companies, so it will always be a race to the bottom.<p>--<p>anyway, as far as hardware startups specifically: those exist and they just haven&#x27;t gotten any traction.  Fairphone, pinephone, lightphone, etc.  These inevitably end up getting very little traction among enthusiasts etc.  I don&#x27;t think the existence of these solves any real problem with the android ecosystem.<p>Also, ecosystem is a major factor in OS adoption.  Like you could go run MenuetOS right now, so why don&#x27;t you?  Ecosystem and network effect and available codebase etc.  So these hardware startups <i>have to</i> work within the existing OS ecosystems etc - almost all of these startups are android and the ones that aren&#x27;t, frankly are doomed.  Consumers don&#x27;t want featurephone or phone-specific app stores in 2024, <i>especially</i> for some niche product with no actual apps released for it.  There is very little point to making a custom OS from vxworks or whatever, that&#x27;s not where the problem lays here.<p>Similarly: Framework and System76 are attempting to thread that needle of supported hardware+OS configurations on &quot;generic linux&quot;. This exists, just not to massive success or fanfare or changes in how the world works.  And they&#x27;re not re-engineering the OS.  Even System76&#x2F;PopOS is based on ubuntu iirc.  Jumping to MenuetOS or other completely-new-OS things is a whole other can of worms.<p>Despite Framework&#x2F;System76 existing, the world still runs on Windows 11 ad-supported installs or free Linux labor.  So I don&#x27;t know why it would be different for phone hardware+android.</div><br/><div id="41199957" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41199957" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Y_Y</span><span>|</span><a href="#41196116">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41197943">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41197674">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41199957">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41199957">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Overall great comment, I wanted to highlight the part about &quot;dumping&quot;.

As indicated in the article they create slave labor conditions in a lot of these manufacturers because they&#x27;re wholly dependent on Apple&#x27;s whims. This also creates an e-waste problem globally as Apple inhibits the ability to more easily repair their hardware. Louis Rossman has some great examples [0] of Apple continuing to put defective hardware into devices that Apple knows will, and has, failed and there is no easy way to replace these components because Apple has locked up the supply chain via purchasing all available inventory and having exclusive rights to non-proprietary chips.  This means you can&#x27;t repair a device you own at a fiscally fair price. Instead you&#x27;re forced into buying an entire assembly so Apple can charge a much higher multiple on a part that has higher margins which may just force you to buy an entirely new product because of the price point differential.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Z0DF-MOkotA&amp;feature=shared" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Z0DF-MOkotA&amp;feature=shared</a></div><br/><div id="41197448" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41197448" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JumpCrisscross</span><span>|</span><a href="#41195922">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41196436">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41197891">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41197448">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41197448">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>Apple forces other chip manufacturers into exclusive deals to lock out the ability for 3rd party repair to be done cost effectively and reliably</i><p>How is this relevant to the chips TSMC manufactures?

Apple might depress the prices for themselves, but not for other fab customers. On the contrary, if there is a supply issue, with one customer getting all the production, then prices should go up overall, helping competing fabs. In a situation with a huge production shortfall, it becomes a matter of initial capital, with which governments can help effectively (either with subsidies or with tax incentives). If the customers are there and demand is strong, eventual RoI should be ok.<p>In your example, not only has the government huge bargaining power, but the law itself limits other customers, and this there is no demand outside of the government. In contrast, there are plenty of customers for semiconductors. Demand is still here.<p>So yes, Apple might reduce TSMC’s margin, but the real problem is not that. It’s that there is nobody else operating on the same scale. The fact that there is no alternative for cutting edge nodes is a sign of a market failure.<p>Besides, this “it’s Apple fault and they depress margins” sounds disingenuous. Apple famously invested quite a lot in TSMC’s fabs in exchange for this access to the latest nodes. And TSMC also benefits from stable, predictable demand. The real problem is the spectacular failure of Intel and the complete lack of effectiveness of the handful of governments that could do something. Things seem to be changing, even if it is slow, but we should never have been in that situation in the first place.</div><br/><div id="41196651" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41196651" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Barrin92</span><span>|</span><a href="#41195922">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41196497">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41195951">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41196651">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41196651">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;but not for other fab customers<p>there aren&#x27;t that many, that&#x27;s the point.

Demand is clearly there.<p>&gt; Apple is responsible for most of its suppliers revenue as the article points out, otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t have price setting power to begin with.<p>Apple has price setting power because they helped funding the fabs and the process. I agree that the result is not great for the industry overall, but they did not show up one day and kick the other customers out. Again, the main issue is the limited bandwidth because everyone depends on effectively a single supplier.<p>&gt; we&#x27;ve bin in a supply glut.<p>Not on the leading nodes, though, right? The ones over which AMD, Apple, and nVidia are fighting. Or I missed that, in which case I would love to have more information (I mean solid, with numbers). That said, if that’s the case it does not help the story’s argument. Oversupply leads to lower margins, but one customer taking a large chunk of production restricts supply, which has the opposite effect.<p>&gt; AI chips aren&#x27;t the only chips in the world, DRAM makers like Micron, an American manufacturer are the kinds of companies that are effectively at the mercy of Apple because of how outsized of a portion of the market they are.<p>DRAM and CPUs tend not to use the same processes, so the only way they are in direct competition is because investment is limited but that point is undermined by Apple financing the fabs.

Similarly, the ban of Apple Watches over IP theft has nothing to do with the supply chain issues that the authors attempted to outline.<p>The thesis is also all over the place. The title indicates the problem is semiconductors, but then lots of the arguments have to do with suppliers outside of semiconductors. If Apple’s reliance on TSMC is the big problem, then why isn’t even mentioned that TSMC is the only competitive fab on cutting edge nodes?<p>Lastly, the overarching theme is severely misguided. All of these supply chain dealings are as old as semiconductors themselves. When the industry moved towards targeting consumer electronics in the 70s, semiconductor manufacturing moved out of the US long before Apple was relevant. And if Apple weren’t a powerhouse of consumer electronics today, other companies would be doing the same things.

Poor pay and working conditions in the semiconductor hubs of China has been a problem as long as and before Apple made the iPhone. Apple certainly isn&#x27;t HELPING that situation, but none of them are. All these fabs have made the news at different times for everything from suicide prevention nets to using slave labor to make Apple products, sure, along with every other major tech OEM in the business.

This feels like a piece banking on outrage clicks about Apple.<p>&gt; In 2017, when Apple announced it was moving away from using UK-based Imagination Technologies for graphics processors, the company lost two thirds of its value overnight.

TSMC is in a better position, everyone is clamoring for their products (or really their services and production capabilities) so if Apple left they&#x27;d hurt a bit, but all the other buyers would be thrilled and TSMC would see a blip for maybe a quarter.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41195900" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41195900" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lwkl</span><span>|</span><a href="#41195822">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41195911">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41195912">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41195900">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41195900">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Monopsony is the correct term here it means that there is only one buyer.

So the author here commenting that the data is quite different pre- and post-Industrial Revolution shouldn&#x27;t be surprising considering the data is literally based on completely different metrics!

That&#x27;s ostensibly the point of this article--trying to actually use data to establish whether or not this &quot;obvious&quot; principle is true [1]. But if you turn to the actual data, the author of the data is creating the historical data using one of three assumptions: either real GDP per-capita is correlated with population growth, which comes both with and without an arbitrary pre-industrial haircut, or real GDP per-capita is literally flat pre-industrial.<p>It really isn&#x27;t clear to me if there really is a step change in per-capita GDP growth around the First (and&#x2F;or Second) Industrial Revolution, or if it&#x27;s a one-off jump, or if it&#x27;s a continuous, consistent per-capita growth rate with no real impact. All of those would look pretty similar in a linear-scale graph at first glance.

Across any range of x values, it&#x27;s possible to choose a scale of y values that shows the classic shape of the exponential graph (ie, the hockey stick).  If you then zoom into the flat part of the graph, and choose a different y scale, you&#x27;ll see a bend there.  If you zoom out and choose a different y scale, you&#x27;ll see your previous bend as part of the flat part.<p>Unless there is a natural and obviously significant range of y values that, independent of the mathematical properties of the graph, is clearly what you actually care about, you can just make the &quot;bend&quot; in an exponential graph be anywhere you want it to be.<p>Here is the graph of e^x from 0 to 10, showing the &quot;bend&quot; is at around x = 7.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=graph+of+e%5Ex+from+0+to+10&amp;sca_esv=8ea0361af31360af&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWILfr0kgB4okSkZ1j7gfeKB3Ti_hvA%3A1717657063276&amp;ei=511hZrzMEPWuptQP9pGV-As&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj82-iYs8aGAxV1l4kEHfZIBb8Q4dUDCBE&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=graph+of+e%5Ex+from+0+to+10&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiGWdyYXBoIG9mIGVeeCBmcm9tIDAgdG8gMTAyBBAjGCcyCBAAGIAEGKIEMggQABiABBiiBDIIEAAYgAQYogQyCBAAGIAEGKIESP8JUMoGWMoGcAF4AZABAJgBiwGgAYsBqgEDMC4xuAEDyAEA-AEBmAICoAKVAcICChAAGLADGNYEGEeYAwCIBgGQBgiSBwMxLjGgB98E&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=graph+of+e%5Ex+from+0+to+10&amp;...</a><p>And here is a graph of e^x from 0 to 100, showing the &quot;bend&quot; is at about 85:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=graph+of+e%5Ex+from+0+to+100&amp;sca_esv=8ea0361af31360af&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIKWLsH_wO8fn-xLZG6hzjGUEvxlgA%3A1717657057015&amp;ei=4V1hZqpOnfym1A_IuauhAg&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqwuqVs8aGAxUdvokEHcjcKiQQ4dUDCBE&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=graph+of+e%5Ex+from+0+to+100&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiGmdyYXBoIG9mIGVeeCBmcm9tIDAgdG8gMTAwMgUQIRigATIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigATIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKsCMgUQIRirAjIFECEYqwJIgQhQgQZYgQZwAXgBkAEAmAGPAaABjwGqAQMwLjG4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgKgApkBwgIKEAAYsAMY1gQYR5gDAIgGAZAGCJIHAzEuMaAHvgc&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=graph+of+e%5Ex+from+0+to+100...</a></div><br/><div id="40594508" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40594508" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tempestn</span><span>|</span><a href="#40591961">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594376">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40592833">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40594508">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40594508">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Let me rephrase.

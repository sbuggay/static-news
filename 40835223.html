Naturally, this is a fundamental source of inefficiency.<p>This is something I appreciate about the Lilium aircraft: they use canards to avoid this problem. Their latest design places the rear wing slightly <i>above</i> the canard[1], minimizing the downwash disadvantages[2] inherent in many canard configurations.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qZ73PftBfFg&amp;t=273" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qZ73PftBfFg&amp;t=273</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aviation.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;83584&#x2F;are-canards-actually-more-efficient" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aviation.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;83584&#x2F;are-canar...</a></div><br/><div id="40843718" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40843718" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">roelschroeven</span><span>|</span><a href="#40842077">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40842084">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40843718">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40843718">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; &gt; Additionally, a horizontal stabilizer in the back needs to be pitched down relative to the wings, creating downwards lift, pitching the plane up.<p>&gt; Naturally, this is a fundamental source of inefficiency.<p>It&#x27;s also not correct. The stabilizer in the back (or more generally: the wing in the back) needs to have a smaller angle of attack than the wing in front. In the common case (wing in back much smaller than wing in front) the wing in the back often is designed with negative angle of attack to create enough margin, but it&#x27;s not strictly speaking necessary.<p>There are planes (like the Lilium you mention, or the planes designed by Burt Rutan) that have a small wing in the front (a canard) and a large wing in the back, providing most of the lift. In that case the wing in the back obviously needs to have a positive angle of attack to create the lift for the plane to stay in the air.<p>That may look like a special case, but it is not, aerodynamically speaking. The rule is the same for all types of planes: for stability, the back needs a lower angle of attack than the front, and that does not necessarily mean it needs to be negative. It also means the plane&#x27;s center of gravity does not necessarily have to be in front of the front wing.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.av8n.com&#x2F;how&#x2F;htm&#x2F;aoastab.html#sec-basic-stability" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.av8n.com&#x2F;how&#x2F;htm&#x2F;aoastab.html#sec-basic-stabilit...</a>, and more specifically <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.av8n.com&#x2F;how&#x2F;htm&#x2F;aoastab.html#sec-canard-same" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.av8n.com&#x2F;how&#x2F;htm&#x2F;aoastab.html#sec-canard-same</a>.<p>I don&#x27;t really know whether canard configurations solve the inefficiency problem of horizontal stabilizers with negative angle of attack: canards necessarily have a high angle of attack, which also creates drag.<p>(Note that all of the above is only relevant for planes with classic static stability (which is almost all of them); planes with relaxed static stability and fly-by-wire are kept stable by computer instead of aerodynamics.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="40842084" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40842084" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cjbgkagh</span><span>|</span><a href="#40842077">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40843718">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40842276">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40842084">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40842084">[18 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Lilium Jet does not appear realistic to me, most VTOLs barely fly in the best of circumstances.

The difference is that a prototype is close to the final product and test flights can be used in the early phases of the certification path, demonstrator flights cannot. Or to put harsher: all Lillium has is two model aircraft that have close to nothing in common with the 7 seater they are selling.<p>And one could call it a scam, when tuh product you sell has nothing to do with the product you show (and no, mock-ups at airshows don&#x27;t count at all), and the product you sell has, so far, no clear timeline until certification. The aerospace version of vaporware. Whether or not it amounts to an actual scam woupd be for courts to decide. Right now it looks a lot like Nikola, without the option to use a hill to fake the product demo.<p>As a sidenote regarding test flights: last time I checked, those were unmanned, with a demonstrator and not a prototype and no longer than 6 minutes. Which is as far from what serious people in the field call a test flight of it could be. Good for PR and investors so, it looks cool.<p>Also, one can make everything fly, if you put enough thrust to it.

A scam would be intentionally misleading people about the ability of this thing to fly at all and then grabbing the money and run.<p>scam would also involve disgruntled investors trying to sue and getting their money back. There have been a few such cases about investors wanting their money back. But the headline is that Lilium is continuing to raise lots of money and making steady progress to getting their products launched. And those court cases seem to be going nowhere so far. The nature of VC funding is of course that things don&#x27;t always go to plan.<p>Just because this company isn&#x27;t satisfying your need for instant success and instead is following an entirely reasonable path to certification, which is slow for any airplane, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a scam. By that logic anything is a scam until it emerges fully designed and manufactured on the market. That&#x27;s not how things work in the real world.<p>This thing has investors, prospective customers with letters of intent, and flying prototypes.<p>Nikola is actually shipping trucks at this point too. Yes, they got caught with a non driving prototype running downhill and they got punished for that and the CEO might do some jail time for that. But the thing works now and they are selling lots of trucks that actually move cargo around. A scam would have been if the thing proved to be vapor ware. As it turns out, it wasn&#x27;t.

The variable nozzle is still present[1], but Lilium long ago dropped variable pitch[2]. &quot;Tilt-wing&quot; is also inaccurate, since they only move the (already moving) aileron and elevator surfaces, not the wing and its associated structures.<p>Hopefully this can help clear up these (hastily-Googled) concerns.<p><pre><code>  &gt;Their availability estimates for battery capacity is double the long term rate of improvement

This is an interesting claim that I&#x27;ll look into, thanks. Do you have a source? I found a few slide decks but I couldn&#x27;t immediately find this part, so any help would be appreciated.<p>I do expect in the nominal case that Lilium will take perhaps twice as long to come to market, so in the end the delays may roughly cancel out.

They increase the camber of the wing so that the pilot can fly slower without pitching the nose up, which is important for example when maintaining sight of the runaway on landing approach.</div><br/><div id="40841620" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40841620" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hyperpape</span><span>|</span><a href="#40841510">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40842277">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40841620">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40841620">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; You will notice that past a certain angle, the lift starts to decrease, and is replaced by a lot of drag, a force trying to slow down the wing.

A proper airfoil geometry can generate more lift before stalling, and creates less drag for a given amount of lift, which is why most airplanes use them.<p>I&#x27;m a bit of a novice, so it sounds like this is the same explanation you&#x27;re giving.

Putting the flaps down increases lift and drag and lowers the stall speed.<p>As for why the article mentions decreased lift whereas flaps down increases lift, that&#x27;s maybe a bit more complicated. Lift vs. Angle Of Attack is a curve that tops out at about 15°.[0] Flaps often go to steeper angles than that, but I&#x27;m not sure if lift actually starts to decrease again in that scenario. Certainly adding a curve to the back of the wing (flaps) isn&#x27;t quite the same as changing the angle of the entire wing.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commons.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Lift_curve.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commons.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Lift_curve.svg</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40842107" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40842107" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nvy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40841510">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40841620">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40842078">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40842277">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40842107">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40842107">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">.</div><br/><div id="40842152" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40842152" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">carabiner</span><span>|</span><a href="#40841510">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40842107">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40842277">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40842152">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40842152">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No, flaps increase CL. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;figure&#x2F;Figure-1-4-Effect-of-flap-and-slat-on-lift-coefficient-13_fig1_331718321" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;figure&#x2F;Figure-1-4-Effect-of-fla...</a><p>You might be thinking of total lift on a 3D wing, which is something you alluded to re: wing loading.

I noticed that they started lacking basic networking knowledge and couldn&#x27;t set up networking inside AWS. They just didn&#x27;t know what a gateway, NAT, or subnet is.<p>Similar things are happening with AI co-pilots. We have an increasing number of people who &quot;write code&quot;, but the number of people who can understand and review code is not increasing. There is also a problem of injecting ethics and politics into those tools, which can produce silly results. I asked Bard to write me a Python function to turn the US Constitution into a palindrome. Bard refused and gave ma a lecture on how the US Constitution is too important to be played with in such trivial fashion. I then asked it to produce code that turns the US national anthem into a palindrome, it refused again. So I asked it do the same but with the Russian national anthem and it spat out code without telling me off. I then asked it to generate code for simple tasks and it did an OK job, except the formatting and the fonts used were different every time, because it just lifted code from different webpages and recombined it like a massively hungover student waking up to realise he&#x27;s supposed to hand in the assignment in one hour.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40254012" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40254012" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sasaf5</span><span>|</span><a href="#40255488">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40250835">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40254012">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40254012">[67 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Early 2023, when everyone started using chat GPT for coding, I thought it would be a big boost because it enabled us to quickly employ a large number of people in a project regardless of language or framework.<p>An year into the project I am forced to revise my opinion.

Good for you. I myself recently used ChatGPT to understand how to write a web-app using Rust and I was able to get things working with some trial and error so I understand your feeling of liberation and of accomplishment.<p>Many of us on this discussion thread work in teams and on projects where the code is written for professional reasons and for business outcomes.

 I ended up with a few 750+ line chunks of js, beyond the ability of chatgpt to parse back at me. So my go-to technique now is to break it into smaller chunks and make them files in a folder structure, rather than existing inside a single *.js
So readability is an issue for me- even more so because I rely on ChatGPT to parse it back- sometimes I understand the code, but usually I need the llm to confirm my understanding. 
I&#x27;m not sure if this scales for teams. My work has sourcegraph, which should assist with codebases. So far it hasn&#x27;t been particularly useful- I can use it to find specific vulnerable libraries, keys in code etc, but that is just search.<p>What I really need is things like &quot;show me the complete chain of code for this particular user activity in the app and highlight tokens used in authentication&quot; ... - something senior engineers struggle to pull from our hundreds of services and huge pile of code. And so far sourcegraph and lightstep are incapable of doing that job. Maybe with better RAG or infinite context length or some other improvement there will be that tool. But currently the combined output of 1000&#x27;s of engineers over years almost un-navigable. 
Some of that code might be crisp, some of it is definitely of llm-like quality (in a bad way)- I know this because I hear people&#x27;s explanation of said code and how they misremembered it&#x27;s function during post mortems. Folks copy and pasting outdated example code from the wiki etc. ie making things they don&#x27;t understand. I presume that used to happen from stackoverflow too. Engineers moving to llm won&#x27;t make too much difference IMO.<p>I agree, your points are valid, but I see &quot;prompt engineering&quot; as democratization of the ability to code.

The issue of not asking the right questions has been around as far as I can remember but I guess it wasn&#x27;t seen as the bottleneck because people were so focused on solving problems by any means possible that they never had to think about solving problems in a simple way. We&#x27;re still very far from that though and in some ways we have taken steps back. I hope AI will help to shift human focus towards code architecture because that&#x27;s something that has been severely neglected. Most complex projects I&#x27;ve seen are severely over-engineered... They are complex but they should not have grown to hundreds of thousands of lines of code; had people asked the right questions, focused on the right problems and chosen the right trade-offs, they would have been under 10K lines and way more efficient, interoperable and reliable.<p>I should note though, that my experience with coding with AI is that it often makes mistakes for complex algorithms, or it implements them in an inefficient way and I almost always have to change them.

My personal experience is that such advice usually comes from people who understand neither AI nor what I teach. Most of them are university administrators of sorts, and AI is a problem for them more than for me.<p>Introductory classes teach skills that can be performed reasonably well by AI. Those skills are the foundation you need to build higher level skills. Just like kids need to know how to read to be functional in society and in their later classes, despite screen readers doing an excellent job.<p>When I teach a foundations class this is my focus, and I don&#x27;t fool myself or my students into thinking that they will be using those skills directly, but I try to convey the idea that the skills pervade through much of what they will later learn and do.<p>However that means that I cannot force students to learn. They can cheat, and it&#x27;s easy, and I prefer spending my efforts on helping the learners than catching the cheaters.<p>The university administrators, however, are in the business of selling diplomas, which are only worth what the lowest common deminator is worth. So cheaters are a big problem for them.  Typically for such people, they just bury their heads in the sand and prefer to claim that teaching students to use chatGPT (that lowest common denominator) is where the value is.</div><br/><div id="40254792" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40254792" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tombert</span><span>|</span><a href="#40250835">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40254202">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40253751">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40254792">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40254792">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re implying that I&#x27;m making shit up by putting &quot;people&quot; in quotes, but here&#x27;s at least a little evidence.

Naturally to avoid conflicts you would use a namespace, but since most of the examples I saw used prefixed function names, I decided to try that as well.<p>In my opinion, coding just feels much clearer when you prefix all your names, like my_library_my_func. When I see my_library_, I just immediately know that is my code. If you use different prefixes for different modules, you can tell from a glance which modules a piece of code interacts with. In C++, you can tell a random word is a field by the simple fact everyone prefixes them with m_. I&#x27;ve seen people using prefixes for pointers as well.<p>This is the same concept you have when designing an UI. Everyone agrees a problem with hamburger menus is that you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s inside the burger until you click on it. If you want people to be aware something exists, you need to make it appear on screen, explicitly.<p>Instead, languages have evolved toward the very opposite. We ran away from self-documentating variable names and prefixes, and toward namespaces, &quot;const&quot; and other keywords, and &quot;OOP&quot; that feels less object-orientated and more press-the-dot-key-to-get-a-list-of-methods orientated. We depend on docstrings that show in the IDE, and then on auto-generated documentation from those docstrings. Typescript is probably the worst case of this, because it gives you a lot of tools to make the dot work the way you want, you&#x27;ll spend way too much tinkering with the dot instead of just writing code that actually runs.<p>Thanks to this, when you look at code, you have to wait until your language server figures out what you&#x27;re looking at for you. If the IDE doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s effectively impossible to code anything in many cases. But the variable names are shorter so people think it&#x27;s cleaner and better, like removing features from an UI to make it cleaner.</div><br/><div id="40254404" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40254404" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">raincole</span><span>|</span><a href="#40253998">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40254256">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40254375">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40254404">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40254404">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You just reinvented Hungarian notation (the bad version).</div><br/></div></div><div id="40254375" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40254375" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PaulDavisThe1st</span><span>|</span><a href="#40253998">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40254256">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40254404">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40254350">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40254375">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40254375">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; We ran away from self-documentating variable names and prefixes, and toward namespaces<p><pre><code>   namespace Gujarati { class Masala { ... } }

Although, if you need, say, to convert .fbx to Collada, there won&#x27;t be enough examples out there for an LLM to infer how to do it. There&#x27;s progress; most tools that wrangle meshes now speak glTF, so at least you only need O(N) converters, not O(N^2).<p>There are a number of programming in the large problems that tend not to be taught. A large collection of problems revolve around having state in one place that you want somewhere else. Sometimes you can just pack up the whole state and send it. That works if it&#x27;s not too big and doesn&#x27;t change too often. Perhaps the data is huge. Or somebody isn&#x27;t allowed full access to it. Or it&#x27;s changing rapidly. Or you need to keep up with changes with low latency. Or you must have guaranteed eventual consistency. Those problems come up all the time in areas from finance to game dev.<p>Inefficient solutions to such problems lead to bloated browsers, slow web pages, and inefficient back ends. 
An example is XMLRPC. 
Efficient solutions to those problems are complex, hard to modify, obscure, and hard to debug. An example is the internal representation of Microsoft Word .doc documents. Much of the web is trying to ship state from somewhere to somewhere else, in rather bulky ways.<p>This can have business implications. In the metaverse area, where I&#x27;ve been doing some things, Improbable tried to deal with such synchronization problems in a very general way. They blew through about US$400 million in venture capital, and produced a working system that needs so much server capacity that five indy games went bust, and their big demo, Otherside, is so expensive to run that they only turn it on for demos a few times a year.
This may also be why Meta blew their metaverse business so badly and spent so much money.
Doing this by special casing code results in an obscure, hard to modify system with race conditions and consistentency problems. That&#x27;s the classic MMO approach, and is used by Second Life&#x2F;Open Simulator.<p>A general understanding of such problems is useful, and is teachable. But what do you read for that? Not books on &quot;how to do thing X in framework Y&quot;.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40253501" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40253501" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">llm_trw</span><span>|</span><a href="#40250538">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40250585">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40253951">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40250782">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40253501">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40253501">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;(Last night I ended up writing that kind of code because GPT-4 didn&#x27;t quite get it right for me, but 90% of my code like that has been LLM-created in the past 6 months and I look forward to that creeping closer to 100%)<p>I have bad news for your long term employability if that&#x27;s the case.<p>I find that my code is 25% LLM-able on a good day with minor editing.<p>On a bad day it is 10% LLM-able with me having to edit every line to get them to fit together.</div><br/><div id="40254652" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40254652" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">simonw</span><span>|</span><a href="#40250538">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40253501">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40255326">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40254652">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40254652">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wasn&#x27;t talking about all of the code I write, I was talking about code along the lines of &quot;convert this XML format to JSON&quot;.</div><br/><div id="40255708" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40255708" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">llm_trw</span><span>|</span><a href="#40250538">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40254652">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40255326">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40255708">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40255708">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Fair enough.<p>I have to admit I&#x27;ve written a gpt4 api shell utility which transforms text based on descriptions like &quot;split string on &#x27;-&#x27; after a &#x27;~&#x27; but only if it&#x27;s in a the second csv column and select the third&quot;.<p>I feel dirty using it - send your data to the cloud and use a ~peta flop- but it&#x27;s faster than trying to remember how to do it in awk for under 1000 lines.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40255326" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40255326" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kragen</span><span>|</span><a href="#40250538">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40253501">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40254652">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40250782">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40255326">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40255326">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">i really don&#x27;t think simon motherfucking willison needs to worry about his long-term employability, unless either he suffers a disabling injury, or llms get better than humans at everything, or somehow people stop wanting software</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40250782" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40250782" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mrcode007</span><span>|</span><a href="#40250538">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40250585">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40253501">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40250867">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40250782">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40250782">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why would you write code for that?

I&#x27;d rather trigger it explicitly. That way one can afford a bit more compute per suggestion as well. I think you would get a feel for when the suggestions will be useful and when they won&#x27;t.<p>One feature I think could be useful is to ask it to correct very basic errors in a section of code, but this need to be well-integrated in the editor to be worth it. This could also be automatic (the <i>detection</i>) - like an slightly more intelligent jetbrains inspection.<p>I&#x27;ve also tried some &quot;whole program&quot; synthesis with mixed results. It usually can get something up and running, but almost every time it has had subtle bugs in it - fixing these (with or without the AI) often got me close or higher to what it would have taken me to do it from scratch.<p>The advantage(?) is I might never have bothered beginning from scratch - getting the first rough draft get you immediately into iteration mode.<p>As an example - I asked GPT-4 to write a python program reading in a json file conforming to a jsonchema[1] and transforming this into a GPX file.<p>It ended up generating code trying to get `properties` keys from the json *file*.

We may stop calling such people software developers, but I don&#x27;t see why that matters.<p>Now, as whether we need less software developers because of efficiency gains?

The syntax are not that actually important, you can compose new terms from basic terms and create a language that way. You abstract that way, expanding or reducing the vocabulary you have to work with, finding some specific relations between the term that facilitates describing (paradigms). Syntax is important because the machine only understand those specific terms arranged in those specific ways. It just that the set of problem it can solve is very large, the solutions more so, and your program is just only one element. Solving the problem is not programming, restricting it to what the machine can do is.

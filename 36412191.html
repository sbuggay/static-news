The professors weren’t world famous but they were solid and always seemed to have some paid extracurricular coding for me to do for one of their research projects.<p>On the administration side, I agree with this article that Crow’s vision has been basically validated. Despite its increasing size, ASU’s academic stature via research output and reputation among academics has continued to improve in the last 15 years. For example, ASU was just added to the prestigious Association of American Universities.<p>Watching ASU transform over the years as Crow realized his vision has been very cool.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36415942" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36415942" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">drawkbox</span><span>|</span><a href="#36414383">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36414540">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36415942">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36415942">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Historical note: Obama spoke at the commencement in 2009 in regards to this New American University idea and the Obama Scholars Program, it was one of the first things he did as president.

But can something also &quot;spiral upwards&quot;?<p>Maybe it can, maybe it can&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve never heard someone use the &quot;spiraling upwards&quot; analogy. The phrase originates from planes that lose their ability to maneuver and control themselves so they fall out of the sky in a spiral corkscrew fashion while trying to re-gain control, which fits with the general usage of the phrase. But spiraling upward is just funny to me, within the same anology it isn&#x27;t probably possible or realistic. &quot;Shooting upwards&quot; is better probably.<p>I really don&#x27;t mean this as a critique to the author, i find the article very interesting. However, the writer inside of me just couldn&#x27;t ignore the opportunity to discuss this usage.<p>Now, shifting gears to the author&#x27;s original point so I am actually adding value here. I agree that tech really degrades against academia right now. To the point of even praising or glorifying those who drop out of school. But there really is some incredible research happening in academia right now within tech. I wish more attention was spent on favoring this work and those who participate in it instead of focusing on silly algorithm puzzles and memorizing programming language syntax oddities. This stuff really isn&#x27;t useful while being able to produce thoughtful technical reports and being able to effectively spread and share good ideas (which academia emphasizes) are positive traits that actually benefit any company and make your workplace  better.</div><br/><div id="36415092" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36415092" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">111111IIIIIII</span><span>|</span><a href="#36414540">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36414579">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36415092">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36415092">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>The phrase &quot;spiraling downwards&quot; is common for something falling out of control, and is the correct usage here in terms of a degree&#x27;s value.

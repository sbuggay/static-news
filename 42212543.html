Sorry about the lack of clarity, this article is the transcript of a 5 min lightning talk and it was really hard fitting all the relevant content in that little time :) (In retrospect that was a poorly chosen topic. When I picked it I thought the talk would be 10 min, 5 min is too short to explain a subject like this.)<p>&gt; How that curve is initially drawn isn&#x27;t clear at all. Is it flat and becomes complex over time by forking (+ data modification)?<p>Yes, the initial curve is typically constant 0.<p>&gt; Why are interval boundaries real-value in a system that cannot actually express real numbers?<p>Like snthpy said &quot;real&quot; is a shortcut to say infinitely subdivisible. The numbers themselves are actually rationals.<p>&gt; How are the intervals &#x2F; portions decided? Is that simpler than generating UUIDs?<p>Nodes are forked from an existing node, that node decides which portion of its interval it gives to the new node. You pick the splitting point to keep complexity low.<p>Regarding comparison: you always know the values of the whole curve. When I say &quot;a node only has to know about its share of the interval&quot; I only mean the ID space. In a version vector there is a direct link between identifiers and counters, whereas here outside of your share of the interval you don&#x27;t know who owns what or how many devices there are at any given point.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42225887" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42225887" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rdtsc</span><span>|</span><a href="#42225508">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42226308">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42224968">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42225887">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42225887">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Why are interval boundaries real-value in a system that cannot actually express real numbers?<p>They can be represented as a binary tree, that is a nested list or tuples, for instance.

But unfortunately I canât think of a way to reliably have a system automatically subdivide an interval to bring new servers up without getting pathological behaviour sometimes. Or, if an identifier (interval) goes offline indefinitely, I canât think of any good way to clear it.<p>In practice, vector clocks &#x2F; version vectors built using uuid identifiers for machines seem easier to work with, and theyâre very predictable. Slightly less efficient - but versions take up a tiny percentage of network traffic and disk space that I donât think it matters.<p>I really want to use interval tree clocks for something. Itâs such a cool algorithm.

I had considered them for Lima but we were actually find with version vectors.<p>I think the case where ITCs can really shine is when you have a lot of short-lived nodes.

If I use a CRDT, I need clients to be able to emit changes with unique IDs. The obvious way to do that with ITC is to have a server (or set of servers) hand out part of their interval to clients. And the normal way to hand out part of the server&#x27;s interval is to split it in two each time.<p>If you have N clients join the server, the server will end up with 1&#x2F;2^n of the keyspace - since it keeps halving each time a client joins. And some of those clients will just - go away, indefinitely, without &quot;giving the key back&quot;. So the server&#x27;s interval gets smaller and smaller, and the key (interval) that new clients are given will take more and more bits over time. Linearly more bits.<p>With random IDs, the client never needs to give the ID back. You still have problems that the version grows over time - but I can think of a bunch of ways to deal with that.

All you need is some periodic process that can observe the state of the clock, find gaps, and communicate the merge with one of the adjacent nodes. It is something that can be eventually consistent.

Sure you have to ensure single writes from the coordinating process, but thatâs easier to solve bc of the relative infrequency that the coordinator needs to run, leaving lots of time for consistency in between updates.<p>The key assumption Iâm making here is that nodes communicate much more frequently than nodes are added and removed from the system.

They don&#x27;t know it, simply last time we bought them a PC I put it there, explained how to open the web browser, play solitaire&#x2F;FreeCell&#x2F;whatever other game they like, how to shut it down etc. I live in another city and I almost never had to adjust anything there in all these years, differently on what happened when they had windows (they unknowingly installed a lot of spyware and bloatware, I had to clean it up periodically).<p>Still, for me this is one of the few experiments that went well, probably because the only &quot;complex&quot; need they have is a web browser. Now if a friend (not a technical one) needs a new computer advice I tell him to buy a second-hand MacBook and enjoy. No one ever complained (in fact all compliment me for the choice). The vast majority of users is not like my parents, has some specific needs, like they need Microsoft Office, or Photoshop, or they play on PC and still don&#x27;t want to face the challenges you need to overcome if you want to do <i>everything</i> with Linux.
I would never use MacOS on my PC (not because it&#x27;s not good, just because I&#x27;m a FOSS maniac), but it&#x27;s the perfect operating system for casual users and even for many power users.

Still, they are now yet another choice that the developer needs to make when distributing their software on Linux.<p>Someone has yet to explain to me how the Linux desktop is supposed to just agree on a universal standard for everything without a proprietary ecosystem, at which point it would just be a shittier Windows. And that&#x27;s not even touching on the fact that alternatives often exist for valid reasons, i.e. Pipewire being obviously better than Pulse, which used to be a de facto standard. Or the fact that some companies like Bitwig have already demonstrated that commercial Linux software via Flatpak is viable - Adobe simply does not care, and they never will.<p>The irony of Windows users sharing their opinions on the Linux desktop is that they often sound how they picture existing Linux desktop users: people who treat their computers as toys.

It&#x27;s not my main laptop but I fire it up once or twice a week for some light gaming (I have some indie games that I like). It works great for that despite Intel performance not being great, obviously. Every few weeks I use the Manjaro settings tool to update the kernel to the latest and greatest. And of course I update packages regularly with a command line tool called yay.<p>I can&#x27;t say it has been completely without issues. But so far I&#x27;ve been able to solve these issues. And this doesn&#x27;t happen a lot. But probably not a great distribution for beginners as you are expected to solve problems on the command line. But if you know what you are doing, this is pretty nice and stable. I like having rolling updates and not missing out on all the latest stuff.<p>Having Steam means that Windows is now optional for gaming. You don&#x27;t need it for most games. They&#x27;ll work fine on Linux. There are exceptions of course but mostly everything I have just works fine. And between Mac and Linux, I just have no patience for the dreary experience that is Windows.<p>Most other work stuff you can get via snap&#x2F;flatpak (I use both). IMHO both need work but software availability is pretty good. But for things I care about, I tend to install them manually anyway so I don&#x27;t have any middlemen to deal with between me and the software project. E.g. Firefox can update itself if you just install the tar ball from them. Works great.<p>With most linux distributions, the main differentiators seem to be the amount of effort they do to have users needing to use a terminal window with various degrees of success.

Everything must be monetized.<p>Very well then, let us ask what is the business model for this monetized desktop Linux?<p>* People who already use Linux won&#x27;t suddenly decide to start paying money for support that they never relied on before.<p>* People who were never into Linux before aren&#x27;t going to suddenly start jumping ship just because they can choose to pay for a supported distro. Let&#x27;s face it, most people don&#x27;t like spending their time thinking about what OS to run, and maybe that&#x27;s even healthier, since the more I learn about computing, the more I realize it all kind of sucks in one way or another.<p>* If the idea is sell proprietary software to people on Linux desktops, it&#x27;s not impossible (as shown by success stories like Steam and Matlab.) However, it also needs to compete with the ecosystem of free software, as well as web-based apps which are inherently OS-agnostic, along with the pre-existing markets like Steam.<p>* Before our glasses get too rose-tinted, let&#x27;s remember that although Linux works fine on desktop, it&#x27;s <i>not easy</i>. You either need to go the Ubuntu route of being opinionated and one-size-fits-all, or you need to accept that the flexibility of Linux makes support difficult. I&#x27;ve been using Linux exclusively for 15 years, so I&#x27;m used to fiddling with all the knobs required to keep it ticking over smoothly. I would thoroughly resent any pressure anyone would put on me to change the way I do things. On the other hand, I would <i>never</i> suggest to a newbie that they should try doing things the same way as me. In fact, I advise against it. &quot;Kids, just try ubuntu first.

That could be more prominent, admittedly.<p>The real problem is that there&#x27;s just <i>so</i> <i>much</i> commercial software out there and most of it runs on Windows or (often rather grudgingly) on Mac. It&#x27;s been an issue for <i>decades</i>.<p>Back in the mid 90s I was working with &quot;Windows for Workgroups&quot; at the same time as messing with Linux. Linux was enormously superior at that point; pre-emptive multi-tasking, memory protection, high quality scheduling, and an excellent networking stack versus a very clunky OS balanced precariously on top of DOS.<p>But Linux didn&#x27;t have Microsoft Word, it didn&#x27;t have Excel, it didn&#x27;t come pre-installed if you bought a PC, and it couldn&#x27;t run MS DOS software. Windows won, and once Windows NT was out it was a much more even race even on the technical qualities.<p>The best thing that ever happened to desktop Linux was the commercialisation of the web, because it effectively made a huge swathe of important software usable on Linux. This is sufficiently the case that I&#x27;ve been able to use Linux (usually Ubuntu) at work for several of my recent gigs, but I still can&#x27;t use it at my current day job (for example) because the miscellany of Data Loss Prevention software doesn&#x27;t run on it but does run on Windows or MacOS.<p>I&#x27;m not sure Linux will ever &quot;win&quot; the desktop, though the share of desktop might increase in proportion to the dwindling of that market versus mobile devices.</div><br/><div id="40606673" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40606673" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rurban</span><span>|</span><a href="#40606617">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40606525">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40606673">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40606673">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; ... but as far as I can see that&#x27;s Canonical and they&#x27;re a long way from owning the desktop<p>So far I see Redhat owns GNOME and all the base systems, and they already do own the linux desktop.

Check out SteamOS. Home theater? Use Kodi. Focused on security? Kali is the way to go.<p>I even built my own distros for my product to automate endoscopy machine interfaces. You can build whatever you want to solve whatever problems you have.<p>Trying to solve this problem is like merging all the transcontinental countries into one union called USSR.<p>I really admire any billionaire or community that continues Mark Shuttleworth&#x27;s effort to raise awareness about Linux desktops.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40606382" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40606382" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zubairq</span><span>|</span><a href="#40606644">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40606432">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40606382">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40606382">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Good article.

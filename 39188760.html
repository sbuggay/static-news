One suggestion - a nitpick usually that I wouldn&#x27;t write, but because it&#x27;s a language product, you want to give the right impression of your language skills:<p>In English, <i>uni-</i>, the prefix, means &#x27;one&#x27;. For example, <i>unidirectional</i> doesn&#x27;t mean &#x27;all directions&#x27;, it means &#x27;one direction&#x27;. [0] The name of the app means something like &#x27;one language&#x27; or &#x27;one word&#x27;. Again, normally, who cares? But this is a language service and people need to perceive you as authorities on language whom they will trust. I read the name and thought, &#x27;well maybe they are great programmers but they aren&#x27;t using serious linguists&#x27;.<p>You might want <i>omni-</i>, such as Omniverbal, &#x27;all words&#x27;; or <i>ambi-</i>, Ambiverbal, &#x27;both words&#x27; (reflecting both languages, the learner&#x27;s native language and the one they are being taught, and &#x27;ambidextrous&#x27; - able to use both hands equally well). Both sound like fun words to me (but I&#x27;m not in marketing!).<p>[0] People sometimes think of <i>uni-</i> as all, I think because they think of <i>the Universe</i> and <i>universal</i> (from which I assume &#x27;Univerbal&#x27; is derived). Perhaps another way of thinking of <i>universe</i> &#x2F; <i>universal</i> is meaning &#x27;the single complete thing&#x27; or &#x27;the single thing containing everything&#x27;.</div><br/><div id="39201341" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39201341" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Kiro</span><span>|</span><a href="#39198113">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39199967">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39201341">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39201341">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I strongly disagree.

I think that the sooner Univerbal is on the market the better - it&#x27;s marketable as it is.

Really love it overall. I have an IRL tutor as well and it&#x27;s very interesting to compare. Happy to give feedback offline but high-level so far:
1. Adding pinyin for Chinese words when clicking would be great, and adding &#x27;word&#x27; rather than character-only clickable dictionary, e.g. from Pleco. That&#x27;s a Chinese specific issue
2. Harder, but when I say something wrong, pause, and re-state, if it could fix my answer with what I said and delete the wrong bit that would be insanely cool.

At this stage, I think it is pretty far off from being useful as a conversation-partner&#x2F;tutor replacement.<p>I agree with most of your assessment on tutoring, but replacing the human and emotional connection with a person isn&#x27;t something that will be easily replicated (or at all!) with AI.  I&#x27;ve been successful in hiring tutors that I&#x27;ve liked and tailoring the curriculum to meet my needs.  You do need to put in the work, but coming prepared with a curriculum and what I want to learn in each lesson has been very effective for me.  I&#x27;ve also tried to pick tutors with similar interests so that the conversation is interesting and engaging.<p>I prefer my tutoring sessions to be mostly conversation, but I usually reserve some time in the beginning of the session to ask questions about grammar or to review something I have written.  I mostly used non-professional tutors who were doing the tutoring to make a little extra money on the side, so at times schedules would change and I would need to find a tutor.  There was definitely some time lost in getting to know a new tutor and getting back into the flow of things.<p>Building a curriculum or taking detailed notes after and during a lesson aren&#x27;t things every student is going to have the ability or desire to do.

As with a number of other folks here, I too have been playing with using LLMs for language learning. Primarily I&#x27;ve been using the Voice Control for ChatGPT extension with custom GPTs, learning Japanese.<p>One of the things I notice right away about your app is that your learning arc is moving from saying simple things to saying complex things, as opposed to aligning with increasing grammatical complexity. One of the things Duolingo does well is start with simple verbs, simple nouns, then slowly introduce language complexity over time: new particles, new tenses, new grammatical structures, etc. So the learning arc follows the complexity of the grammar, not the complexity of what I&#x27;m trying to express. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m communicating that well :-) But for Japanese, as an example, there is a series of proficiency tests that do a good job of laying out a rough learning arc, which makes it easier to scaffold someone in, meet them where they are, and then start building on the knowledge they already have. When I futz with LLMs it&#x27;s largely been to box the LLM in at a particular language level and then use it to practice language concepts at that level: for example, use JLPT N4 vocab and grammar and let&#x27;s have a conversation about my day at university using formal language. If there was some way to roughly align the Univerbal conversation against tiers in language learning and then help me progress along that arc, it would be even more valuable.<p>My actual expertise is in games for learning though, and I appreciate what I saw you doing with &quot;goals&quot; in the &quot;meeting a new friend&quot; stage. Gamification is primarily about engagement, keeping me motivated, keeping me involved, keeping me coming back. Duo does a ton of gamification and uses it to good effect even though I know it does drive some people bonkers. But am I about to break my 500-day streak? No I am not. Gamification works! :) With the capabilities that you already demonstrate you could probably walk closer to making it an actual game, if you wanted to: the primary difference being that you&#x27;d need to add learning elements in there beyond the suggestions you have now (which are great, btw). Think of the way Zelda teaches you a new control mechanic through the individual shrines and bosses (formative and summative assessment, essentially), and adds the control details to your options menu once you&#x27;ve learned them (like having a grammar guide or vocabulary list once you&#x27;ve demonstrated mastery). What your game would be would be something very different from Zelda, but... it is fun to think about!<p>Love what you&#x27;re doing!</div><br/></div></div><div id="39189940" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39189940" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ifyoubuildit</span><span>|</span><a href="#39198310">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39191441">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39189940">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39189940">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I like it (was actually just thinking about a bot like this after seeing a related submission on hn yesterday).<p>Bit of feedback: the UI confused me when it asked for what language I want to learn. I didn&#x27;t realize the flag was a button to choose my language and spent a little while in two different browsers thinking the space next to the microphone was a textbox to type in or the microphone was the button for letting me talk. For some reason &quot;use the buttons above to continue&quot; didn&#x27;t make any sense to me until now. Maybe cause there was only one button?<p>Anyways, I don&#x27;t use a lot of apps and when I do I often find the UI to be confusing, so I might be an outlier here.

You can click on the message itself and you&#x27;ll get the translation of the entire message.

Now when the sun heats the earthen substance, and the water mingled therewith, it causeth the earth to be dried up, and then the air is filled with smoke, and the smoke riseth up into the clouds, and there it is mixed with fire; and when the cloud is full, it bursts open, and the smoke goes forth, and strikes against the ground, and thereby makes thunder; and the fire goes before the smoke, and maketh the lightning. Therefore, lightning is caused by the sun&#x27;s heat, and the mixture of smoke with fire. And therefore, if any man shall tell you that lightning is caused by the sun&#x27;s rays, or that the sun&#x27;s rays make it, he speaks falsely, and he knoweth nothing of the truth. For the sun&#x27;s rays do not make anything; but they are the means whereby the sun works, and the sun works by means of the heat.

Here is my first attempt:<p>Me: How can I write a good essay?<p>MonadGPT: The best way to write a good Essay is by following these instructions: First of all, you must have a good and well-grounded knowledge in that subject which you intend to treat upon; for it is not possible to write any thing well that you do not understand well. Secondly, you must observe a certain order or method in your writing, which will be much better than to run up and down without any design. Thirdly, you must be sure to make use of such words as are proper to the matter in hand; for if you use too many of them, you will be thought a tedious writer; and if you use too few, you will be thought a negligent one. Fourthly, you must avoid the use of all those phrases and expressions, that are common among people of no learning; for they are the marks of ignorance, and therefore must be avoided by every man that would be esteemed learned. Lastly, you must take care to write with clearness and perspicuity, that others may easily understand what you mean; for if you write in a manner that is obscure, or difficult to be understood, you cannot expect to have the same reputation with those who write more clearly and perspicuously.<p>I ran the same question by GPT-4, Claude 2.1, and Bard. Each replied with advice on how to write a good <i>school</i> essay: “understand the assigned topic,” “follow the required formatting and citation guidelines,” etc. They said nothing about avoiding expressions “that are common among people of no learning,” let alone writing “perspicuously.”</div><br/></div></div><div id="38418638" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38418638" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ziptron</span><span>|</span><a href="#38417972">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38418217">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38419779">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38418638">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38418638">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Makes you appreciate how far we&#x27;ve come..<p>Here is my attempt at asking the model to cure a headache:<p>&gt;How do you cure a headache?<p>&gt;If the Head-Ache be by reason of any cold and moist Humour proceeding from the Brain or Spine; the best remedy for it is to make the Patient sweat, either by applying hot Apples, or some such thing as will draw out the cold Humour from his Body, and bring it into his Skin; then by laying him on his back with his Feet downwards, and his Arms over his Head, and if the pain be in his Neck, to lay a Flannel about his Neck, and let him lie so till he sweats, then turn him, and give him some strong Liquor to drink, which will make him vomit, and thereby purge out the cold Humour. If the Head-Ache be by reason of the Stomach or Liver, it may be cured by giving the Patient some good Cordial, as Spirit of Wormwood, or such like; and if the cause be by reason of the Heart, then give him some strong Liquor, as Wine, or Ale, which will raise his Spirits, and make them run to the Head; and if it be by reason of the Brain, then give him some good Herb, as Pennyroyal, or some such thing, which will open the Pores of the Brain, and make the Humour come forth.<p>&gt;should I send my son to school?<p>&gt;It is the Opinion of some Physicians, that Children should not be sent to School before they be seven years old, because at that Age they have not so much of their natural Heat left in them, nor so much strength of their Vital Spirits; but if they be sent before that time, they will be apt to catch cold, and thereby to lose their strength, and become weak and sickly, and so liable to many Diseases. But others think that if Children be sent to School before they be sev&#x27;n years old, they will learn to read and write, and to speak well, and to do many other Things with greater Ease than if they were to wait till they were seven Years old, when their Bodies are<p>&gt;Why do objects fall to the ground when dropped?<p>&gt;The reason why heavy bodies fall to the ground, is because there is a certain impetus or force given them by the hand that throws them, which makes them descend to the earth; and this force continues to act, till the body meets with some obstacle to hinder its motion; therefore, as soon as the body reaches the ground, it must of necessity stop its motion, and be at rest. It is true, that heavy bodies have a natural tendency to fall downwards, but yet it is not on account of their weight, but on account of the force imparted to them by the hand that throws them; for if the hand did not give them any force, they would not fall at all.</div><br/><div id="38418972" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38418972" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sdenton4</span><span>|</span><a href="#38417972">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38418638">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38419779">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38418972">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38418972">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Truly the act of falling is simply the release of potential energy, stored by whoever lifted the thing up in the first place.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38419779" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38419779" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">qingcharles</span><span>|</span><a href="#38417972">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38418638">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38415978">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38419779">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38419779">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Q: What are the top 10 books right now?<p>A: I will give you a Catalogue of the best Books that are extant at this time, and then you may take what you please.

And forasmuch as I have found by experience that there are many who would doe much good to their dogs if they knew how to keep them in order, and yet want some means to bring them into such a state, I will endeavour to shew you some ways to doe it, and if you will follow my directions I hope you will find no fault with me. The first thing is to keepe your dog from barking when you go abroad, and the next is to keepe him from barking when he is at home, and this is the best way to doe it. First, when you goe abroad, take a piece of bread with you, and give him one or two pieces when he barks, and then he will cease, but if he still continue to bark, strike him on the head with the stick you carry with you, and he will then cease. If he does not cease after you have struck him once or twice, let him alone until he comes home again, and then give him a piece of bread, and when you go out again, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again when he comes home again. In this manner you may proceed till you see him cease, and then give him a piece of bread again, and when you go out again, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if he continues to bark, strike him again, and if</div><br/><div id="38419115" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38419115" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">earthboundkid</span><span>|</span><a href="#38419016">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38419008">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38419115">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38419115">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Interesting glitch.

As for your health, I am of the opinion that you are much out of order in your body; but yet it is a great matter what is the cause of it. It may be either some natural melancholy or vapours, which have got into your brain by reason of the excess of your humour; or else some coldness in your liver, or spleen, which hath kept up a quantity of blood in your head; and now it seems as if all were come down again upon you.<p>&gt;User: You&#x27;re right. It seems to be melancholy. What should I do?<p>&gt;Monad-GPT: It is a very hard matter for me to prescribe any thing to you in your present condition, I must first know what hath caused this melancholy. What have you been doing? have you taken any physic since you were well? and what kind of diet do you eat?<p>&gt;User: I eat nearly nothing, for I am in love.<p>&gt;Monad-GPT: Aye, I see that by your eyes; for love hath the power to wither up the spirits of a man as much as a fever: and yet it is hard to know whether you are in love or no, for some do take so great delight in their own fancy, that they imagine themselves more in love than ever they were.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38420130" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38420130" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tgv</span><span>|</span><a href="#38418954">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38418952">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38420130">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38420130">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Then we would now live in the 25th century.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

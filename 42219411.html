A license for a 3D modeling package like Softimage or Alias cost at least $10-15k, and you probably also needed a separate raytracing package for high-quality output.<p>Someone is selling a copy of Alias for SGI for $2500 on eBay today:

It was a very rare skill that needed very rare hardware. You could get highly paid freelance work by simply calling up ad agencies.<p>That scarcity a bit hard to imagine today, when anyone can download Blender onto their standard desktop computer and learn it by watching online videos.

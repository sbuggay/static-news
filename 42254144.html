It happens for user interfaces and APIs when the documentation is absent, or only consists of examples. If there&#x27;s no reference documentation, everything is a copy of something someone else did. Nobody understands how it really works.<p>Now, for some interfaces, this isn&#x27;t too bad. Most people don&#x27;t know why US AC power plugs are polarized, or what the ground prong is for. Electricians have to, but users do not.<p>For more complex interfaces, it means that many functions will either be misused or undiscovered. This is the source of the plaint that only 10%-20% of a product&#x27;s features are used.<p>On user interface design, the classic is &quot;Tog on Interface&quot;, Bruce &quot;Tog&quot; Tognazzini, 1992.
That&#x27;s from the Mac UI era. A more modern take is &quot;The Gamer&#x27;s Brain&quot;, by Celia Hodent, designer of Fortnite&#x27;s UX.<p>Software internal documentation seems to suffer today from a mindset that comments are unnecessary and waste space. Especially in the Javascript era. It&#x27;s worst in languages that don&#x27;t have data declarations. There&#x27;s no place to properly document the data.<p>Rust has good conventions and tools for documenting data. There&#x27;s a well defined place where the documentation for each structure and field goes, and reasonable tools for checking it and turning that into documentation. If you fail to do this, when you publish your crate on crates.io, the documentation pages will come up blank, which screams &quot;loser&quot;.<p>Rust is weak on function parameter documentation. There should have been a defined place where each formal parameter gets a comment, which then appears in the documentation of the call.<p>Most other languages don&#x27;t take such a hard line. More should.</div><br/><div id="42284270" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42284270" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">IgorPartola</span><span>|</span><a href="#42284054">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42284186">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42284270">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42284270">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How do you view self-documenting interfaces?<p>Have you ever read the manual for your browser which you are using to make this comment?

These are of course user interfaces, not necessarily APIs. But if you are creating something like a library of basic math functions I would rather read your code than your docs.<p>Some of the worst docs I’ve read lately have been for ffmpeg and mp4box. The former sometimes straight up has things like “so one guy tried this and it worked for him so we recommend you try it and see how it works for you”. The latter has like 4 examples with no explanation of what you are looking at or how to make anything else work. The project used Stack Overflow for their docs because nobody can really figure out what to do with it right away. I’d rather take readable code in this case over the terrible docs.</div><br/><div id="42287067" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42287067" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lelandbatey</span><span>|</span><a href="#42284054">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42284270">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42284545">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42287067">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42287067">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; How do you view self-documenting interfaces?<p>&gt; Have you ever read the manual for your browser which you are using to make this comment?

Even orgs with the best documentation don&#x27;t have a great mechanism to capture and make available tribal knowledge which is un-authoritative, sometimes conflicting, and constantly changing.<p>In the past I made an effort to address this by creating a unofficial but quickly searchable document repository documenting every question I have gotten from a teammate by either answering it or pointing to where the authoritative answer could be found.<p>What I found was the following:<p>1. Questions are repetitive, you can quickly build a base of tribal knowledge and point people to the answer.  
2. If the document tool is quick and efficient, team members will generally check it first instead of asking.
3. Sometimes document tribal knowledge conflicts with someone else&#x27;s tribal knowledge.  This is a great opportunity to hash out the more correct answer and update the document.
4. Tribal knowledge gets stale fast and needs constant curating.
5. The less friction to find an answer, eg fast access and fast&#x2F;accurate searching, greatly increases success.<p>NB.

The links, seemingly complaining about iOS or Android, don&#x27;t really seem to clarify.<p>It seems many want Unix technology or ideas to be about what Unix meant in the 70s and 80s and don&#x27;t have much interest in moving things forward from that plateau. (To be clear, I think <i>all</i> the major operating systems of today leave a lot to be desired, but each one has their own pros and cons.)<p>Aside from the file system parts, my understanding of the <i>idea</i> of Unix is that it is a bunch of small utilities interacting with each other. I think almost anyone agrees with that idea, see functional programming and node based tools that link up data between dedicated functions and nodes, respectively. This idea is quite pervasive, and I don&#x27;t think it was necessarily Unix that conceived of it. But in reality, the implementation of this idea in Unix leaves a lot to be desired. The collection of utilities that have very few standards in interfacing, documentation, naming, usability, and more importantly, data structures leaves one wanting. The idea that everything should be text is implicit and highly limiting. This is why programming languages that are somewhat OS-like and have their own scripting are so well liked, becuase it removes the need to worry about the various OSes&#x27; implementation of these ideas, leaving one to stay at a virtual machine level. For example, Elixir and the BEAM.<p>It&#x27;s typically viewed as blasphamous, but I think the PowerShell model is the more powerful one if we&#x27;re just considering OS-level provided interactions. But even then, restricting oneself to the terminal is limiting. I find the ideas in Smalltalk to be much more powerful and forward thinking, despite being as old as Unix itself.</div><br/><div id="37220035" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37220035" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dale_glass</span><span>|</span><a href="#37219876">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37219937">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37220035">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37220035">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree, PowerShell does the same thing better.<p>And I&#x27;m disappointed that things have stagnated so much.

Hack was one guy. Unix was collaborative, personally collaborative between some extraordinary intelligent people. If you read Kernighan&#x27;s memoir, it talks about the second version problem. Unix solved a problem. GNU solved a problem. Linux solved a problem, and WSL2 solved a problem. Using a hammer to rid your house of ants is a solution, that does not fit the problem. I do not consider a hammer harmful in itself, if its used to drive nails. Everything needs a tersely named tool is outdated, useful for trouble shooting but outdated UX&#x2F;UI.

In fact as technology becomes more pervasive I would argue that the ideas it encapsulates are no longer only relevant to computer architecture, they&#x27;re now relevant to the survival of a free and open society. This isn&#x27;t just about how to build the best widget anymore (though I still think the Unix philosophy is a great contender for that).<p>In particular I&#x27;m referring to the principles of composability and universal interfaces. These principles make the Unix philosophy inherently democratizing - when you apply it you&#x27;re producing something that&#x27;s intended to interoperate with other agents in a diverse ecosystem beyond your control. This is in stark contrast to the monoliths that tend to emerge from proprietary software development where the socioeconomic goals are to control everything strictly and limit interoperability because there&#x27;s commercial value in having a &quot;moat&quot; or a &quot;walled garden&quot; which people can&#x27;t escape.<p>As computers become interwoven with our lives and our society the general purpose computer has become a tool like the printing press. The printing press was a precursor for democracy as we know it because it enabled the dissemination of information on a scale that was previously impossible.<p>What sort of social progress we might ultimately achieve through the general purpose computer is yet to be fully determined. But in the modern era we have many examples of what the competing philosophy of proprietary monoliths looks like - it&#x27;s a hellscape where more your time and attention are harnessed by the monolith&#x27;s owner, to serve his own ends, even at the detriment of your health and well-being [2].<p>Facebook and Instagram wouldn&#x27;t be killing our children if they had been designed around the Unix principles of composability and a universal interface. How many people have lamented their inability to take their data, content and relationships away from Meta&#x27;s silo? It&#x27;s a constant refrain in our industry that people wish they could get away from a service that started out great and gradually &quot;enshittified&quot; - had these services been designed with the Unix philosophy in mind, it would be possible.<p>Either way, the Unix philosophy is now just as much about your human freedom and well-being, as it is about whether your code works well.<p>Stallman of course saw this coming decades ago and predicted with disturbing prescience - that &quot;either the user would control the program, or the program would control the user.&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unix_philosophy" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unix_philosophy</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jonathanhaidt.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;social-media-mental-illness-epidemic" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jonathanhaidt.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;social-media-mental-ill...</a></div><br/><div id="37219895" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37219895" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dale_glass</span><span>|</span><a href="#37219143">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37219329">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37219864">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37219895">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37219895">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The principles are good, the implementation sadly is not.<p>Plain data streams have outstayed their welcome. Pretty much nothing but the classic old Unix tools communicates with plain text streams. Smarter, new commandline tools tend to provide at least JSON, but there&#x27;s plenty that don&#x27;t and that makes them absolutely painful to reuse. I&#x27;ve written large amounts of code that amount to running a process, parsing its output, and then translating that to the actual API I want: methods and events. Basically all that work is a waste that doesn&#x27;t actually get what I want done.<p>Of all things, Microsoft had a better idea with Powershell: it does the same concept, but far better.<p>The internet has seen something similar: a huge amount of users take a TCP socket and proceed to build an improvised messaging protocol on top, because that actually fulfills the needs of many applications far better, yet the API doesn&#x27;t actually provide it.<p>IMO, there&#x27;s been too much Unix philosophy worship. We&#x27;ve stuck to an early, simple idea and on the long term it&#x27;s a huge detriment.

The code is based on the Linux kernel, which might make you think it&#x27;s Unix, but isn&#x27;t Unix [1]<p>An OS is where 3 things meet: code, data, and people.<p>AKA apps, files, and users.<p>AKA CPU, storage, and networking when viewed from hardware (in the old days, you&#x27;d have terminals and serial ports, not Internet)<p>I&#x27;d argue that (if you take away the historical &quot;hairs&quot;), Unix is a minimal and efficient implementation of those ideas.<p>It&#x27;s efficient enough to build heterogeneous &quot;platforms&quot; on top -- Lisp, JVM, JavaScript, Python, etc.  Databases, hardware virtual machines, the entire modern cloud<p>The shebang line is basically &quot;polymorphism&quot; for those runtimes -- everything looks like .&#x2F;foo arg1 arg2<p>The args are often unstructured files that you share between different programs<p>--<p>Android breaks from that design in many, many ways<p>- Applications are written to the Java runtime, not to the OS<p>- They written in Java or Kotlin.  Escaping to C++ is a &quot;special&quot; thing, you use the &quot;NDK&quot; for that<p>- It doesn&#x27;t expose raw files to applications, or at least it seems apps can&#x27;t really share files.  It uses its own security model, not Unix security (which was almost certainly necessary!)<p>Hm I clicked on the original link, and Rob Pike said it better: <i>The very idea of a &quot;Files app&quot; is high on my list of world-defeating idiocies perpetrated by technology.</i><p>- It doesn&#x27;t use Unix IPC, it has its own &quot;binder&quot; mechanism between apps.

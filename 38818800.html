Still I can&#x27;t help but be intrigued by the wistful tone of the website. Judging by the &quot;about&quot; page, the guy running it is relatively young, so he can&#x27;t quite have the Yugo-nostalgia. And yet passages like<p>&gt; there were many in Yugoslavia who refused to fully integrate into this communist-led multi-cultural society [...] During the hey-day of Yugoslavia, this resentment and anger was very much kept in check by the Yugoslavian government&#x27;s intense efforts in stamping out inter-ethnic retaliations, nationalism or religious hatred in any form, accompanied by the intense promotion of the ideals of &#x27;Brotherhood and Unity&#x27;.<p>— to me read like they celebrate the Yugoslav communists.

I would guess that many young people see that as the last tragedy and not communism.<p>FWIW Yugoslavia was open to tourism during the Cold War. My father drove from the UK to Dubrovnik with a friend in the 60s. I retraced part of that trip about 5 years ago. I&#x27;d have seen more had this site and book been available, but I stumbled on a few of the places on their map.<p>Not on their map is Zeljava [1] which was an airbase with extensive underground tunnels under a mountain on the Bosnia&#x2F;Croatia border. At the time, a few parts of it were cleared out with bits of spares amongst the debris. There is a UXO hazard away from worn pathways. This is highlighted by the mine signs. I think there have been a few accident since the war in the 90s, but inside there was a bigger risk from falling concrete (look up for blast door). Recent photos [2] show it has been cleaned up a lot.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%C5%BDeljava_Air_Base" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%C5%BDeljava_Air_Base</a>

It was a forced combination of different states or regions (within Yugoslavia they were called republics) that were culturally or ethnically distinct, like much of Europe, but that identity per se wasn&#x27;t the issue, rather that it was a forced combination and that people were treated differently, with Serbia having a dominant role to the detriment of others. It wasn&#x27;t due to a lack of &quot;brotherly love&quot; but more like the presence of &quot;brotherly oppression&quot;.<p>Some might argue with this but it&#x27;s notable that a majority wanted out of Yugoslavia and Serbia was willing to use force to stop that.<p>In my travels, those who think of the communist era as &quot;the good old days&quot; are usually those who had a relatively privileged position in those times and were affiliated with the communist party and often Serbian. For most people communism was an oppressive system that delivered little in the way of quality of life compared to democratic states and repressed personal freedoms.<p>Full disclosure: I&#x27;m an ethnic Croatian.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38828791" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38828791" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">senderista</span><span>|</span><a href="#38829497">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38828648">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38828791">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38828791">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Jasenovac should be as well-known as Auschwitz.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

I think things have changed a lot less than we tell ourselves (though they have changed a little bit, in that we are no longer bound to each other by feudal oaths - possibly for the worse).<p>The idea behind governments, even the most liberal, has always been that you give up some of your freedom in exchange for security against violence. This was also the primary motivator for swearing serfdom to a feudal lord. And the idea behind corporations is effectively giving up a large share of your labor value (the other part of serfdom) nominally in exchange for security against economic instability, in that you get a steady paycheck regardless of revenue fluctuations.<p>In practice, I think many people are finding that security is dubious since corporations lay off employees, but they don&#x27;t understand what the tradeoff is that they made. Lack of loyalty by employers has then fueled lack of loyalty by employees, and overall the situation is more tenuous now for employees.<p>And for that matter when people complain about crime (and why crime against its own citizens is particularly heinous), they&#x27;re complaining that the government is not holding up their end of the contract with protection from that. I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s easier or harder today to find a different &quot;lord&quot; in the form of emigration. On one hand we&#x27;re not bound by feudal oaths so leaving as such is usually pretty easy, but on the other hand the process of living somewhere long-term and changing citizenship can be very difficult on the other side depending where you go.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37867490" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37867490" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">verisimi</span><span>|</span><a href="#37867366">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37867697">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37867418">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37867490">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37867490">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes.<p>I don&#x27;t think it is possible to have a true understanding of what these (tax exempt) foundations are really intending - we only have what they tell us, which is a form of spin.<p>As far as I am concerned, these foundations are about paving the way for commercial interests - their job is to prepare the ground with a view to the long term benefits that the corporate side will then reap.

Replicating the effects of tutoring with technology was exactly what they tried to do. If there were such massive gains to be had, why didn&#x27;t they at least manage to capture some gains?<p>You don&#x27;t have a theory to answer that. The article writer does. In their view, learning is a social activity, and kids don&#x27;t like to sit in a room with dozens of others each with their own personalized algorithmic &quot;teacher&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s not really all that surprising. If it was only about personalization, it would be easy enough to do that with far simpler technology than modern computers.<p>The article writer&#x27;s theory also neatly and immediately suggests an explanation for why personal tutoring still works, when automated custom tutoring manifestly hasn&#x27;t so far. That&#x27;s because it <i>is</i> social. Even if it&#x27;s just you and your overworked homeschooling parent, you care because they care.<p>Personalization isn&#x27;t key. Personalization from a tutor works because it&#x27;s hard and costly, and convinces the student that this matters.<p>That&#x27;s just a theory. It&#x27;s not necessarily right, but it does present a convincing explanation for what we observe, and in particular the observation worth repeating, that <i>no one can seem to get algorithmic personalized education to work</i>, no matter how rich and clever they are.<p>And from my personal experience with teachers (including my parents) I have often heard from them that the challenge isn&#x27;t explaining, it&#x27;s to get the students to care.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37866363" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37866363" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">KRAKRISMOTT</span><span>|</span><a href="#37864167">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37867676">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37864273">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37866363">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37866363">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Nothing beats good old fashioned one on one tutoring.<p>You don&#x27;t need fancy foreign math syllabuses or newfangled gadgets<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem</a></div><br/><div id="37866690" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37866690" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tkgally</span><span>|</span><a href="#37864167">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37866363">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37864273">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37866690">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37866690">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You do need one tutor for each student, though.

Bit I feel there are multiple (different) goals in play here, and the outcomes vary greatly based on the goal chosen.<p>For example, covid showed that a primary goal for many is simply day care. Child has to be looked after while parents work. If they actually learn things that&#x27;s a bonus.<p>Prep for college, and college admission, is another goal. Learn how to effectively take tests, how to memorise somewhat-random material, how to write an essay. Learn to analyse reading material and discuss Hamlet&#x27;s indecision.<p>Or Teach the child how to learn. Let them follow what interests them. Explore the world. Visit museums, art galleries, build a bicycle. All great, some useful, but none of the rigidity and discipline required when entering the work-force. (Ironically, probably the most learning, while at the same time the least empowering.)<p>Or what about trades? Wouldn&#x27;t it be useful if the school taught plumbing, or how to wire a plug, or how to fix home appliances, or how to paint a wall?<p>So don&#x27;t feel bad about being home-schooled. You will have gained some head-starts, and missed out on others. (There are plenty of kids who went to school, and that also did little to prep them for college or the work-place).<p>The best prep for today work-place, is, well work. A summer job, or weekends at MacD will help you with that skill set. (Or your first couple jobs after college).<p>To prep for college you need a college-aimed curriculum, coupled with strong analytical, summary, and essay writing skills. You need to learn &quot;what&#x27;s being taught&quot; regardless of what it is. (Which is why the best college advice is to pick a major you enjoy, because you&#x27;ll be depending a Lot of time with it.)<p>Yes, we all had different school experiences. Some good some bad.

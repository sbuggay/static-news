The disks were cheap enough (eventually) to not care much about.<p>And for a while, I enjoyed handing people CD-Rs or DVD-Rs full of data, and the disks were also cheap enough (eventually) to not care much about.  (And disk quotas and attachment sizes have never caught up with either CD-R or DVD-R capacity, although transfer rates have.)<p>But BD-R never really caught on for a lot of reasons:  So even if it is cheap-enough, it isn&#x27;t universal-enough.<p>And I&#x27;m somewhat loathe to hand someone a thumb drive.  They&#x27;re universal these days and can be cheap enough to not care about, but they can also be expensive and they just don&#x27;t feel as forgettable as pulling another blank disc out of the box&#x2F;off of the spindle, writing some data to it, and just letting them keep it was.<p>Sure, I can attempt to <i>lend</i> another person a thumb drive, but that&#x27;s a much more complicated thing than <i>giving them</i> a throwaway DVD-R was.  (Also, it&#x27;s an active computer device -- there&#x27;s very real concerns about trusting a foreign thumb drive that never existed with previously-used iterations of removable media.)<p>So now, to give someone some meaningful amount of data:  I get to upload it to The Clown (with Dropbox or Google Drive or Discord or something).  With the most-common methods, I also get to hope that I remember to delete it later (and also hope that they remember to save their own copy before I do delete it).<p>Which is great, I guess:  I can send a mountain of data to anyone in the world this way and we never have to be in the same room.<p>But it also sucks:  I can&#x27;t simply copy off some data and actually hand that data to anyone else like I did do with a CD-R.  There&#x27;s always a third party involved.  (It&#x27;s like mailing a letter through a transciptionist service might have been, if that was ever a thing that was, instead of addressing it to the end recipient directly.)<p>As a final lament:  What in the fuck ever happened to easily sending data, <i>over the Internet</i>, to a fellow peer?  Transferring files with DCC on IRC seems like it was miles ahead of where we are today, and that was 25 or 30 fucking years ago.<p>(No, I&#x27;m not bitter.

But it is not amazing for a person like me in this line of work.<p>(As a preface for the rest of this, remember:  This meter is a tool that is meant to be used in areas of limited or zero cellular coverage -- places where outside RF is problematic for whatever reason.)<p>1.  The meter has a Bluetooth interface that connects to an app on a pocket computer.  (This part works fine, usually, except the app often doesn&#x27;t background properly and silently dies if the user uses their pocket computer to do some other task.)<p>2.  The meter expects the pocket computer to have an Internet connection, so it can use that to upload its findings to The Clown.  (This part often cannot work, because the whole fucking reason any of this is happening is because cellular coverage is shit inside of a random building.)<p>3.  The meter expects that the pocket computer will provide GPS coordinates, even though it is intended to be able to be used indoors -- without network connectivity, or perhaps even in a Faraday cage.  And while modern pocket computers are very good at providing <i>some</i> location data by various means as long as there is internet connectivity or GPS-esque data, all of them fail at this when there is neither Internet nor GPS available.<p>4.  It does not provide useful errors.  It provides errors, but they aren&#x27;t specific at all and do not promote productive troubleshooting or workflow.  (&quot;Oh, there was a problem with your measurement!  [Haha!]&quot; is the singular error.)<p>5.  Sometimes, it will even produce an error [Haha!] but record the measurement anyway -- and without recording the error.<p>6.  It stores nothing locally.  When an error happens [Haha!  Good luck!], it is impossible to quickly see if anything was stored at all, so the only clear path is to repeat measurements that result in an error [Haha!].  This often results in redundant measurements being actually-recorded, but who would know that at the time of measurement.  (These measurements often take about 4 minutes each, so these errors [Haha!] and repeated measurements can consume significant portions of an expensive workday.)<p>7.  (Your main point):  Exporting a CSV file of [whatever-the-hell was collected] is possible, as long as I want to send it to Google Drive or some other Clown-based service.  The CSV is only a few kilobytes, but it won&#x27;t let me copy the CSV to my pocket-computer&#x27;s clipboard, or send it in an email, or save it locally on the pocket computer, or send it with Bluetooth to my laptop.  It <i>has to be</i> exported to a Clown-based service, and then it can be read from that Clown-based service by some other device.<p>8. Continued:  While the maker of this meter device has their own Clown, and this Clown is clearly extent on the Internet, this Clown is completely inaccessible outside of their pocket-computer app.  I cannot bypass Step 7 by any official means no matter how deep my desktop computing prowess may be.<p>It is completely shit, and it appears to be the best thing available on the market in this space.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39914867" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39914867" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kzrdude</span><span>|</span><a href="#39913602">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39914204">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39914577">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39914736">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39914867">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39914867">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, not having physical media sucks.

I mean:  We hoped to make people (race fans, in a somewhat debaucherous campground&#x2F;festival environment) happy, and we hoped that the music we brought with us would make them happy, but that was all of the planning we did on that end.<p>I was able to keep our Internet connection standing up and working very well all week (without using Starlink, which it seems isn&#x27;t <i>quite</i> easily-rentable yet), which was a big improvement over the previous year when our bandwidth dropped to around zero once the great heaping throngs of spectators broadly showed up for the main race.<p>And that was a very good thing, because these flagrant drunks loved singing.<p>Our actual-DJ-dude was able to download tracks to sing as-requested.  And it was a lot of work, but it was fun for everyone and fit the vibe.  I&#x27;m glad we had the network available to let this happen.<p>We left the crates of vinyl at the DJ&#x27;s place, since there wasn&#x27;t room to transport it.  And we were prepped for regular-ass DJing of just about any genre with the MP3s and FLACs we brought with us (via CDJs), but we did not anticipate that we would be doing karaoke (which is obviously a very different world from mixing jungle).<p>But back to your point:  We were able to explore karaoke because we had good Internet, and I&#x27;m glad we were able to get there, but we also had a plethora of other options that existed on physical media that we could actually-touch.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine showing up to a DJ gig without...any music at all, and just trusting that the greater network would behave itself for the duration and allow clean streaming to happen.<p>That just seems like madness to me, since the Internet sometimes fails -- and it seems to prefer failing when there&#x27;s an unusual influx of people in a locality.

At the time, I was an assistant manager (making minimum wage because I was a depressed kid who looked about 12) at a nationwide small store software (and hardware) store. Zip drives were flying off the shelves, so naturally I checked the company&#x27;s P&amp;L, SEC statements, and stock data. So I assigned 88% of my stock in IOMG because I could tell it was severely undervalued by market cap compared to projected current sales and frontline buzz. I laid waste to that econ-history class of BMW-driving rich kids and all of their &quot;not cheating&quot; help from their dads. As a bit of bittersweet irony, my teacher&#x27;s investment club <i>lost</i> on IOMG because they got in late and sold early, just 2 months previously. If they had just been patient enough to wait for that 2 week window where the market appreciated excellent sales, they would&#x27;ve realized significant gains rather than losses.<p>PS: Yeah, I had a SCSI Zip drive. It was an improvement over floppies that were notoriously unreliable and not very durable even in 3.5&quot; form. 3.5&quot; floppies were traded at school, but you&#x27;d never loan original media.

Some programs would burn serial numbers into floppy media on first installation irreversibly, and sometimes (okay, often) original media would go bad.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39913986" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39913986" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">0x0000000</span><span>|</span><a href="#39913602">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39913627">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39913986">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39913986">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; If you ask the average person what the company 3M does, odds are if they have a few gray hairs hanging out on their scalp, they might say that the company makes floppy disks.<p>That&#x27;s crazy, I wouldn&#x27;t think anyone would first and foremost associate 3M with floppies instead of adhesives, even those with a few grays like myself.<p>They make <i>post-its</i> for chrissake, and we&#x27;re gonna pretend they&#x27;re most known for floppies?</div><br/><div id="39914821" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39914821" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jll29</span><span>|</span><a href="#39913986">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39914261">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39914821">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39914821">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; They make post-its for chrissake<p>Wikipedia to the rescue:<p>&quot;3M Company (originally the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company) is an American multinational conglomerate operating in the fields of industry, worker safety, healthcare, and consumer goods.

This is a few pages in:<p>&gt; Now, to be clear, 3M did not invent magnetic storageâthat was done by Austro-German engineer Fritz Pfleumer, in 1928. He created audio tape, a recording medium that started as broad strips of paper coated with iron-powder granules, and eventually moved to less-fragile cellulose acetate with help from what would become another big name in floppy disks, BASF. At first, the innovation didnât spread outside of Germany because of World War II.</div><br/><div id="39913696" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39913696" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CharlesW</span><span>|</span><a href="#39913599">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39913607">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39913613">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39913696">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39913696">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My friend, I didn&#x27;t say &quot;magnetic storage&quot;.<p>The title says &quot;3M&#x27;s Floppy Disk&quot;, which implies that 3M created the floppy disk.<p>The subtitle calls 3M, &quot;the high-profile creator of magnetic media&quot;, only later making it clear that this is <i>also</i> incorrect.<p>This also implies that 3M invented the floppy: &quot;â¦3M started with the raw materials and the manufacturing processes, and combined those into computingâs greatest commodity item, the floppy disk.&quot;<p>Finally, the article notes that the only medium that 3M did have a hand in creating, the Floptical disk, flopped.<p>Assuming that the author even realizes that they&#x27;re being ambiguous, I would&#x27;ve preferred that they didn&#x27;t misrepresent 3M&#x27;s role.</div><br/><div id="39914921" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39914921" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">robbiep</span><span>|</span><a href="#39913599">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39913696">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39913613">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39914921">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39914921">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not op but<p><i>&gt; The title says &quot;3M&#x27;s Floppy Disk&quot;, which implies that 3M created the floppy disk</i><p>If I put up a blog post about Robbiepâs spaghetti bolognaise, or Robbiepâs quadcopter, I donât think anyone would misinterpret me as having invented those things.

The A&amp;M system has even gone further and largely eliminated tenure for librarians. Other university systems, like the one in my snall state, have started to push checking out ebooks over physical books in various ways, possibly in preparation for more drastic changes like this, or at least so that they can begin downsizing their collections<p>This doesn&#x27;t just affect students at universities, since many public institutions have historically offered community borrowing, and often have extremely rare books that simply aren&#x27;t available otherwise<p>It&#x27;s a complicated issue since this phenomenon is driven partly by user demand -- students are reading much less than they used to, and far less in the way of physical books, and university systems are responding to changes in demand.

It&#x27;s sad how few people actually use the Library of Congress as a library. There are a lot of tourists there. I usually go to the Science and Business Reading Room, which avoids most of the tourists as they check out the Main Reading Room. But attendance is usually sparse, perhaps 2 dozen per day.<p>The Library of Congress is an amazing free resource with a significant fraction of what&#x27;s ever been published. They too seem to be pushing more and more off-site, but not to the extent that university libraries are. I can find a lot of rare books there that I would not have access to otherwise, and I&#x27;ve also used their technical reports collection extensively.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what I would do if the various research libraries I frequent were to reduce services or close.

Younger people today are used to using search bars to find what they need immediately [1], but older people like myself grew up used to it taking time to find relevant information, and often had to organize the information ourselves.  Younger people aren&#x27;t using the library because from their perspective, information is just available everywhere and immediately available on top of that.  From their perspective, there simply is not need to go to the library if you can find what you need immediately.<p>I personally think it is horrible that many universities are selling their physical collections, but I just want to post some reasoning as to why there is a shift in usage.  As a researcher, I think that being able to get an immediate answer is often great, but the problem is that it prevents you from exploring the information more deeply and broadly.  It gives you a false sense of finality that doesn&#x27;t require you to question what you are reading more closely or more broadly by examining many sources (like the neighboring books on a library shelf).

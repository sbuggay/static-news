Ask the LLM what information it needs to answer the question, and try to get that info from a search engine.

When I forget a word, I can give it a vague description and it&#x27;ll find it. I&#x27;m terrible at writing emails, and I can just ask it to point out all the little formalisms I need to add to make it &quot;proper&quot;.<p>I can benchmark the quality of one LLM&#x27;s translation by asking another to critique it. It&#x27;s not infallible, but the ability to chat with a multilingual agent is brilliant.<p>It&#x27;s a new tool in the toolbox, one that we haven&#x27;t had in our seventy years of working on computers, and we have seventy years of catchup to do working out where we can apply them.<p>It&#x27;s also just such a radical departure from what computers are &quot;meant&quot; to be good at. They&#x27;re bad at mathematics, forgetful, imprecise, and yet they&#x27;re incredible at poetry and soft tasks.<p>Oh - and they are genuinely useful for studying, too. My A Level Physics contained a lot of multiple choice questions, which were specifically designed to catch people out on incorrect intuitions and had no mark scheme beyond which answer was correct. I could just give gpt-4o a photo of the practice paper and it&#x27;d tell me not just the correct answer (which I already knew), but why it was correct, and precisely where my mental model was incorrect.<p>Sure, I could&#x27;ve asked my teacher, and sometimes I did. But she&#x27;s busy with twenty other students. If everyone asked for help with every little problem she&#x27;d be unable to do anything else.

Anyone that does is wary of automated translations, especially across estranged cultures.<p>I&#x27;m aware that it&#x27;s imperfect. It&#x27;s still pretty cool that they&#x27;re multilingual as an emergent property - and rather than merely translating, you can discuss aspects of another language. Of course it hallucinates - that&#x27;s the big problem with LLMs - but that doesn&#x27;t make it useless.

Beyond that, the digital marginal cost of services needs to be significantly reduced to keep these companies in business, but more efficient models leads to pushing inference out to end-user compute, which hollows out their business model (I assume that Apple dropping out of the OpenAI investment round was partially due to the wildly optimistic valuations involved, partially because they&#x27;re betting on being able to optimize runtime costs down to iPhone levels).<p>Basically, I&#x27;d argue that LLMs look less like a Web 2.0 social media opportunity and more like Hashicorp or Docker, except with operational expenses running many orders of magnitude higher with costs scaling linearly to revenue.</div><br/><div id="41701399" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41701399" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bhouston</span><span>|</span><a href="#41698252">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41700922">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41701187">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41701399">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41701399">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; LLMs are a utility, not a platform, and utility markets exert a downward pressure on pricing.<p>I think competition exerts a downward pressure on pricing, not being a utility personally.

And sure, they aren&#x27;t having to yet thanks to generous input from various commercial and private interests but like... if this is going to be a stable product <i>at some point,</i> analogous to something like AWS, doesn&#x27;t it have to... actually make some money?<p>Like sure, I use ChatGPT now. I use the free version on their website and I have some fun with AI dungeon and occasionally use generative fill in Photoshop. I paid for AI dungeon (for awhile, until I realized their free models actually work better for how I like to play) but am now on the free version. I don&#x27;t pay for ChatGPT&#x27;s advanced models, because nothing I&#x27;ve seen in the trial makes it more compelling an offering than the free version. Adobe Firefly came to me free as an addon to my creative cloud subscription, but like, if Adobe increased the price, I&#x27;m not going to pay for it. I use it because they effectively gave it to me for free with my existing purchase. And I&#x27;ve played with Copilot a bit too, but honestly found it more annoying than useful and I&#x27;m certainly not paying for that either.<p>And I realize I am not everyone and obviously there are people out there paying for it (I know a few in fact!) but is there enough of those people ready to swipe cards for... fancy autocomplete? Text generation? Like... this stuff is neat. And that&#x27;s about where I put it for myself: &quot;it&#x27;s neat.&quot; OpenAI supposedly has 3.9 million subscribers right now, and if those people had to foot that 7 billion annual spend to continue development, that&#x27;s about $150 a month. This product has to get a LOT, LOT better before I personally am ready to drop a tenth of that, let alone that much.<p>And I realize this is all back-of-napkin math here but still: the expenses of these AI companies seem so completely out of step with anything approaching an actual paying user base, so hilariously outstripping even the investment they&#x27;re getting from other established tech companies, that it makes me wonder how this is ever, ever going to make so much as a dime for all these investors.<p>In contrast, I never had a similar question about cars, or AWS. The pitch of AWS makes perfect sense: you get a server to use on the internet for whatever purpose, and you don&#x27;t have to build the thing, you don&#x27;t need to handle HVAC or space, you don&#x27;t need a last-mile internet connection to maintain, and if you need more compute or storage or whatever, you move a slider instead of having to pop a case open and install a new hard drive.

You&#x27;d have to walk to a taxi stop, or wait on the side of the road and hope you could hail one. Once the ride-sharing apps came in, suddenly getting a ride became a lot simpler. Our taxi companies are still alive, though they have their own apps now -- something that wouldn&#x27;t have happened without competition -- and they also work together with the ride-hailing companies as a provider. You could still hail taxis or get them from stops too, though that isn&#x27;t recommended given that they might try to run the meter by taking a longer route.<p>For food delivery, before the apps, most places didn&#x27;t deliver food. Nowadays, more places deliver. Even if a place already had their own delivery drivers, they didn&#x27;t get rid of them. We get a choice, to use the app or to use the restaurant&#x27;s own delivery.

The use cases typically don&#x27;t evolve that much, so there&#x27;s little benefit to re-incurring the cost for new models.  Hence, customers stay on old technology.  This is the rule rather than the exception e.g., in medical software.<p>(2) The Instagram model:  it was valuable with a tiny number of people because they built technology to do one thing wanted by a slice of the market that was very interesting to the big players.  The potential of the market set the time value of the delay in trying to replicate their technology, at some risk of being a laggard to a new&#x2F;expanding segment.  The technology gave them a momentary head start when it mattered most.<p>Both cases point to good product-market fit based on transaction cost economics, which leads me to the &quot;YC hypothesis&quot;:<p>The AI infrastructure company that best identifies and helps the AI integration companies with good product-market fit will be the enduring leader.<p>If an AI company&#x27;s developer support consist of API credits and online tutorials about REST API&#x27;s, it&#x27;s a no-go.  Instead, like YC and VC&#x27;s, it should have a partner model: partners use considerable domain skills to build relationships with companies to help them succeed, and partners are selected and supported in accordance with the results of their portfolio.<p>The partner model is also great for attracting and keeping the best emerging talent.  Instead of years of labor per startup or elbowing your way through bureaucracies, who wouldn&#x27;t prefer to advise a cohort of the best prospects and share their successes?  Unlike startup&#x27;s or FAANG, you&#x27;re rewarded not for execution or loyalty, but for intelligence in matching market needs.<p>So the question is not whether the economics of broadcast large models work, but who will gain the enduring advantage in supporting AI eating the software that eats the world?</div><br/></div></div><div id="41700841" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41700841" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">culebron21</span><span>|</span><a href="#41702201">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41702938">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41700841">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41700841">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the article contradicts itself, missing some simple math.

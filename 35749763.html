That can be a detriment though, I find a lot of the value I get out of listening to vinyl is the &quot;intentional listening&quot; experience. I think Henry Rollins called it carbohydrate listening or something to that effect, listening to things you like that you&#x27;ve heard a million times and isn&#x27;t exactly stimulating in the same way a new album or artist would be. Music feels a whole lot more consumable and disposable when its just on constant instant playback. Forcing yourself to flip the record and drop the needle keeps you more engaged I feel.<p>All that to say I mostly just like collecting colored vinyl, and supporting small bands and artists you like by buying a product significantly more profitable than millions of Spotify streams is pretty cool.</div><br/><div id="35750593" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35750593" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">WalterBright</span><span>|</span><a href="#35750010">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35750280">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35750593">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35750593">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sometimes I prefer the original vinyl sound compared to the digitally remixed version of the old songs.<p>But most of my vinyl is of old albums that nobody bothered to re-release on CD.

I would stroll around the mall with her on a Sunday and pop into the Wherehouse or the indie record store, and enjoy chatting up a much older blonde clerk before filling my arms with more music than I could ever listen to during the ensuing week.<p>When I was older and shopped for myself, I&#x27;d drive my friends to Tower or the far-flung indie stores, and it was at the latter where I really developed a taste for the rare and near-unobtainables. Then I began to purchase Goldmine magazines, which was the <i>sine qua non</i> for collectors, and I got hooked up with &quot;Record Finding Services&quot; in the UK, which was some dude who&#x27;d walk into a store on your behalf and pick up something that wasn&#x27;t even available on import in the US.<p>I don&#x27;t know how many records in total I had, but I proudly boasted of over 100 items by The Cure alone. And you know that old question &quot;Did you read all these books on your shelves?&quot; well I did certainly get around to listening to almost all of the music... at least once.<p>When CDs came out I embraced the tech and branched out. That didn&#x27;t entirely put an end to my vinyl purchases, as that was still where the rare and desirable stuff was at, for a long time.<p>Fast forward to my move to the desert, and in the throes of impending homelessness, I began to sell off my vinyl for pocket money. I wasn&#x27;t able to keep this up and make rent on the storage locker. My records were eventually sold to the highest bidder. It was a tragedy to be sure.<p>Then I entered a period where I realized that I didn&#x27;t need to consume massive amounts of music, and I didn&#x27;t purchase anything. In fact, my choral activities gave me many opportunities to make my own music, such that it was much more interesting than passive grooving.<p>Fast forward to 2023: I don&#x27;t own any device that plays music other than my computers. I have no turntable, no CD drive at all. My music purchases remain firmly at $0. The best music is all over YouTube as much as I want, and on-the-go I am very satisfied with public domain cuts of prayers, classical pieces, and ambient instrumentals while I work.<p>I am rather glad to be relieved of an insatiable thirst to consume new music; it was an expensive vice, and I was often exploited by my favorite artists as they released endless &quot;collectibles&quot; that I had to catch like Pokémon.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35750003" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35750003" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shrubble</span><span>|</span><a href="#35750273">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35749839">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35750003">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35750003">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The artwork, notes etc. on LPs was often very cool.

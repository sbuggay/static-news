The best solution was to manually scan them using Google Photoscan which involves taking a 5 pictures of each photo with a phone and letting the app remove reflection, perform skew correction, crop, etc. This resulted in better photos than just using the phone&#x27;s default camera software, but it still took 10+ seconds for each photo.<p>Does anyone have an recommendation for at home photoscanners that would allow me to drop a stack of photos into it and have it automatically scan them? I found various devices on Amazon that target this use case but they all have drawbacks like low resolution or excessive manual work. Has anyone done this with their family&#x27;s old photos?</div><br/><div id="41084656" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41084656" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">genewitch</span><span>|</span><a href="#41084509">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084866">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41084656">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41084656">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I acquired every photo taken by my dad, mom, etc. about 8000 photos iirc. Almost all of the post 1975 ones had negatives, so I started out looking for negative scanners, as the negatives had probably been handled and scuffed less. I couldn&#x27;t find anything with good reviews that was under $1000, so I settled with an Epson FastFoto FF-680W. After I did a couple of packs of prints, my wife took over. I think it took her about 6 hours over a weekend.<p>I then set up a &quot;photo website&quot; using a static photo site generator, and then uploaded the output to a racked server we have. Afaik no family members I sent the link to even looked. Oh well. I also sent the tiffs to Amazon glacier where it costs something like $20&#x2F;yr to keep there.<p>Unless something has magically happened in the last six years, I&#x27;d still steer clear of negative scanners and flatbeds.<p>The Epson is soooo fast!</div><br/></div></div><div id="41084866" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41084866" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">qingcharles</span><span>|</span><a href="#41084509">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084656">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084730">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41084866">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41084866">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">All my sibling comments have lots of good info.<p>Clean anything before you scan, as best you can, while being careful. I used to do this professionally many years ago, but I don&#x27;t remember the products. I had a bunch of different cleaning sprays, brushes and cloths. Different sprays melt different emulsions on photos and negatives, so always test in unimportant area before use.<p>I would also say to keep the unprocessed original scans, before any dust&#x2F;scratch removal, color correction etc, since post-processing techniques are in a rapid state of flux lately.<p>I was lucky enough to use one of these $25K beasts:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.filmscanner.info&#x2F;en&#x2F;HasselbladFlextightX5.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.filmscanner.info&#x2F;en&#x2F;HasselbladFlextightX5.html</a><p>The problem was the algorithms for removing dust and scratches in bulk. Look up what the latest tech is there. Always color correct old photos and negatives. They will have faded in some way. Use white point and black point tools to hint the software and you&#x27;ll get 95% of the way there if you can find bright white and very dark spots in a photo. If you are properly serious, then make sure to use hardware to color calibrate your scanning tool and your editing monitor. Use something like an IT8 target:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.silverfast.com&#x2F;products-overview-products-company-lasersoft-imaging&#x2F;it8-targets-for-scanner-calibration-profiling-for-predictable-brilliant-colors&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.silverfast.com&#x2F;products-overview-products-compan...</a><p>And something like this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Datacolor-SpyderX-Pro-Calibration-Photographers&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B07M6KPJ9K?th=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Datacolor-SpyderX-Pro-Calibration-Pho...</a><p>Save all your originals in some uncompressed TIFF&#x2F;RAW&#x2F;DNG format.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41084730" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41084730" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kmoser</span><span>|</span><a href="#41084509">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084866">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084755">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41084730">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41084730">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Recently I scanned all 1,100 rolls of film that my father and I took, for a total of 31,600 frames. For the 35mm film I used a Nikon Super CoolScan 5000 ED, and for the medium format rolls I used an Epson Perfection 2480 photo scanner (flatbed). I had purchased these scanners about 20 years ago, but they are still going strong and produce great quality scans. They are slow and require manually feeding each strip of film; every frame takes about a minute to scan and process, especially if you enable filtering to enhance image quality. The Epson is also great at scanning prints, although I had negatives for most of what I scanned so I didn&#x27;t need to scan many prints.<p>After scanning everything, my endgame was to look through all the images, copy the best into a separate folder, crop and edit them, and produce a book. I made a dozen copies of the book and mailed them to all my relatives. The original negs are stored safely away, and I have a hard drive (with multiple backups) available in the event somebody wants me to send them a scan.<p>Long story short, I would take the time to do it manually. Even with an automated scanner, the chances of things going wrong is fairly high, especially if your prints vary greatly in size and condition (bends, warps, etc.). Yes, it is a ton of work, but the end results are worth it. If 10+ seconds per photo is too much for you, just bite the bullet and send them out to a scanning service.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41084755" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41084755" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">andrew_eu</span><span>|</span><a href="#41084509">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084730">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084943">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41084755">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41084755">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">After a family member died I took on the task of digitizing several laundry baskets of photo prints.<p>I bought an Epson ES-580 automated document feed scanner, and still am pleased whenever I use it. The workflow for digitizing them was: USB stick directly in the scanner, put ~200 same-size photos at a time in the feeder, press &quot;Go&quot; and it&#x27;d scan about 3 seconds per photo (at 600 DPI, closer to 1 at 300 DPI). While scanning I&#x27;d set up the next stack, and periodically copy everything from the USB stick to a NAS.<p>Incidentally I used to work in a film darkroom and have a bit of experience with negative and slide scanners. Even in the best cases, they&#x27;re tedious and finicky. If you want to digitize a perfectly clean 35 mm and scale it up to poster size then perhaps it&#x27;s worth the effort. If you want to just preserve memories, even a bad photo of a damaged 4x6 print can still mean a lot.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41084943" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41084943" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">asciimov</span><span>|</span><a href="#41084509">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084755">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084549">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41084943">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41084943">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you have a lot to do, you&#x27;re gonna want to spend some money on a good scanner, at least $400+.<p>I had the pleasure of using a Epson FastFoto FF-680W.

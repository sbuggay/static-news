You know a rule for dealing with situations of this kind, but you are not content with applying it, because you know that action according to rules always involves a certain misfit between yourself and your situation. If you act according to rules, you are not dealing with the situation in which you stand, you are only dealing with a certain type of situation under which you class it. The type is, admittedly, a useful handle with which to grasp the situation; but all the same, it comes between you and the situation it enables you to grasp. Often enough, that does not matter ; but sometimes it matters very much.<p>&quot;Thus everybody has certain rules according to which he acts in dealing with his tailor. These rules are, we will grant, soundly based on genuine experience ;and by acting on them a man will deal fairly with his tailor and helps his tailor to deal fairly by him. But so far as he acts according to these rules, he is dealing with his tailor only in his capacity as a tailor, not as John Robinson, aged sixty, with a weak heart and a consumptive daughter, a passion for gardening and an overdraft at the bank. The rules for dealing with tailors no doubt enable you to cope with the tailor in John Robinson, but they prevent you from getting to grips with whatever else there may be in him. Of course, if you know that he has a weak heart, you will manage your dealings with him by modifying the rules for tailor-situations in the light of the rules for situations involving people with weak hearts. But at this rate the modifications soon become so complicated that the rules are no longer of any practical use to you. You have got beyond the stage at which rules can guide action, and you go back to improvising, as best you can, a method of handling the situation in which you find yourself.&quot;<p>--<p>From the autobiography of R.G. Collingwood. His writings often have the theme of trying to understand particular instances of a thing on its own terms, only generalising into abstractions when seeing some quality in crowds of individual instances. I&#x27;ve rarely regretted that same approach when it comes to abstraction in code&#x2F;software, but have regretted premature abstraction many times.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40700745" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40700745" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dTal</span><span>|</span><a href="#40701794">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40700996">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40700745">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40700745">[22 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;See that bird?

Buddhism is focused on suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path to its cessation. It is a practical path, and everything that is not related to this path is out of its scope.<p>But I would disagree that eastern philosophy explores this &quot;much richly&quot;. The article cites Kant and Husserl in the second paragraph. And the whole idea of seeing &quot;things as they really are&quot; was imported to Buddhist thought by western thinkers[1]. This idea is present in currents of the 3 Abrahamic traditions, in great part through the influence of neo-platonism from the 3rd century onward.<p>This kind of concept is present in mysticism in all 3 Abrahamic traditions, though in a different language.<p>As a Buddhist practitioner turned mystically inclined Christian, I would argue that there are lots of facets to look at this, from a wide array of traditions, and all have their place and value. One of the hardest things to do is not to immediately dismiss them by analogy with waht we already think we know, e.g. &quot;oh yeah that&#x27;s just good ol&#x27; teaching of the emptiness of all phenomena, I know that!&quot;, without rejecting what one learned until now either. What is beyond word can be described in countless ways, and each of them can help shed a new light and reveal holes in ones current understanding of &quot;reality&quot;, if you let it do its work.<p>[1] you could argue that it is part of some Mahayana traditions, but the way they describe it is so foreign that if you do not engage with it for years, theoretically and practically, you will understand it through a &quot;romantic&quot; lense.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

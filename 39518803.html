It forces you to really think about what &quot;minimalism&quot; means. While his punctuation is minimal, his writing is not &quot;short&quot;. But his writing is <i>distilled</i>. As the article notes, while he has less punctuation than Faulkner he has double the words per mark. How can a writer be minimal when his sentences are longer? It&#x27;s easy to see when you read him: he paints an image so vividly (even when the image itself is unsure&#x2F;opaque!), that you can hardly imagine adding or removing a word.</div><br/><div id="39526864" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39526864" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scop</span><span>|</span><a href="#39526733">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39527864">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39526864">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39526864">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; On the mountain the limestone shelves and climbs in ragged escarpments among the clutching roots of hickories, oaks and tulip poplars which even here brace themselves against the precarious declination allowed them by the chance drop of a seed.<p>- <i>The Orchard Keeper</i>, pg 11 (his first novel)<p>For example, one could easily dice this sentence into multiple sentences or divide it with a semicolon.

It&#x27;s a southern style famously associated with Faulkner and meant to mimic the spoken word of regional Southern areas in many ways. It helps to read it out loud.<p>You called it &quot;ambiguous&quot;, but McCarthy&#x27;s writing is often extremely verbose, an avalanche of specificity, painting extremely evocative landscapes and imagery. Here for instance is his famous description of a Comanche sneak attack:<p>&gt; A legion of horribles, hundreds in number, half naked or clad in costumes attic or biblical or wardrobed out of a fevered dream with the skins of animals and silk finery and pieces of uniform still tracked with the blood of prior owners, coats of slain dragoons, frogged and braided cavalry jackets, one in a stovepipe hat and one with an umbrella and one in white stockings and a bloodstained wedding veil and some in headgear or cranefeathers or rawhide helmets that bore the horns of bull or buffalo and one in a pigeontailed coat worn backwards and otherwise naked and one in the armor of a Spanish conquistador, the breastplate and pauldrons deeply dented with old blows of mace or sabre done in another country by men whose very bones were dust and many with their braids spliced up with the hair of other beasts until they trailed upon the ground and their horses&#x27; ears and tails worked with bits of brightly colored cloth and one whose horse&#x27;s whole head was painted crimson red and all the horsemen&#x27;s faces gaudy and grotesque with daubings like a company of mounted clowns, death hilarious, all howling in a barbarous tongue and riding down upon them like a horde from a hell more horrible yet than the brimstone land of Christian reckoning, screeching and yammering and clothed in smoke like those vaporous beings in regions beyond right knowing where the eye wanders and the lip jerks and drools.</div><br/><div id="39530285" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39530285" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">logicprog</span><span>|</span><a href="#39526733">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39529357">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39529162">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39530285">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39530285">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I do like that passage a lot!

In McCarthy&#x27;s sentence the unpunctuated flow of words bears no relation to the slow, methodical nature of what is being described. And why repeat tortilla? When Hemingway wrote &quot;small birds blew in the wind and the wind turned their feathers&quot; (&quot;In Another Country,&quot; 1927), he was, as David Lodge points out in The Art of Fiction (1992), creating two sharp images in the simplest way he could. The repetition of wind, in subtly different senses, heightens the immediacy of the referent while echoing other reminders of Milan&#x27;s windiness in the fall. McCarthy&#x27;s second tortilla, in contrast, is there, like the syntax, to draw attention to the writer himself. For all the sentence tells us, it might as well be this: &quot;He ate the last of the eggs. He wiped the plate with the tortilla and ate it. He drank the last of the coffee and wiped his mouth. He looked up and thanked her.&quot; Had McCarthy written that, the critics would have taken him to task for his &quot;workmanlike&quot; prose. But the first version is no more informative or pleasing to the ear than the second, which can at least be read aloud in a natural fashion. (McCarthy is famously averse to public readings.) All the original does is say, &quot;I express myself differently from you, therefore I am a Writer.&quot;<p>&gt; The same message is conveyed by the stern biblical tone that runs through all of McCarthy&#x27;s recent novels. Parallelisms and pseudo-archaic formulations abound: &quot;They caught up and set out each day in the dark before the day yet was and they ate cold meat and biscuit and made no fire&quot;; &quot;and they would always be so and never be otherwise&quot;; &quot;the captain wrote on nor did he look up&quot;; &quot;there rode no soul save he,&quot; and so forth.<p>&gt; The reader is meant to be carried along on the stream of language. In the New York Times review of The Crossing, Robert Hass praised the effect: &quot;It is a matter of straight-on writing, a veering accumulation of compound sentences, stinginess with commas, and a witching repetition of words ... Once this style is established, firm, faintly hypnotic, the crispness and sinuousness of the sentences ... gather to a magic.&quot; The key word here is &quot;accumulation.&quot; Like Proulx and so many others today, McCarthy relies more on barrages of hit-and-miss verbiage than on careful use of just the right words.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39529307" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39529307" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">drcode</span><span>|</span><a href="#39534403">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39529307">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39529307">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;This conclusion section could really use an aside about a trapper who wore a necklace made of ears&quot;</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

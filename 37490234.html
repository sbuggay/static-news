In all these cases, the wrongfulness of the act coexists with a negative difference (whether mental or physical) it makes to the victim.

What if the local minima of inflicting some suffering to the perpetrator will lead to a better local maxima?<p>I don&#x27;t know why the author seems to think that being a consequentialist or utilitirianism somehow precludes certain solutions&#x2F;methods? The only truth is this: That actions have consequence, we live in a universe with cause and effect (even if some of that cause is random). If this is false then there is absolutely zero reason to have morality. The only &quot;right&quot; morality is to have one that attempts to map itself closest to reality (the propensity for man to believe in irrational things is also one such reality). A morality that demands certain methods without the ability to change in real time is just dogma.<p>This is why it is so confusing why people oppose Sam Harris so much. A world in which everyone thinks like him is not so much different than now. We would still have left&#x2F;right wing debates and all that. The only difference is that belief no longer gets a pass. You can&#x27;t say &quot;doing X is right because it says so&quot;. When someone says &quot;bro, believe me, we need to do this particular thing every other day or else we would suffer tremendously&quot; then people would rightly question their belief. The calculus of &quot;missing 1 prayer and suffer hell for ETERNITY&quot; and living in modernity is entirely absurd. If you have such world view, then slaughtering apostate is entirely justified, because in your belief, apostates would have suffered in hell for ETERNITY.

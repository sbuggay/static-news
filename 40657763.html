It gives me a chance to share:<p>My father was from Nepal, and served as a park ranger in Chitwan National Park. I believe this was in the 80’s, before I was born. He always spoke very proudly about that time of his life. One fact he could never repeat too often was that he became an acquaintance of the late King of Nepal, who I believe visited the park on a yearly basis.<p>He also had a small scar on his arm that he claimed was from a tiger that hadn’t been fully tranquilized. I’ve always amusingly felt that he sometimes embellished his stories, but I’ll grant him this. Seeing the picture in the article of the men surrounding the tiger, is the first time I’ve had a chance to see what it might have looked like. Thanks!</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

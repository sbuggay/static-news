Grace simplifies this by breaking these usages out into their own gestures and events: ...<p>To me, now having two different commands which I need to distinguish means actually some mental overhead. I need to think about, is this really ready now, or only partially ready? Often I don&#x27;t really know. I keep rebasing and editing my history of commits until I think they are in a good shape, and then I publish (make a PR).<p>grace promote seems easy to distinguish, if this is only intended for merges. Although I also don&#x27;t see why it is such a problem to consider this also as a type of commit. Also, how are conflicts handled there? In Git, a commit always comes with a well defined state of the file tree, with one, or multiple parent commits (or also zero for the initial).<p>&gt; Every save is uploaded, automatically<p>How does this handle files which are not yet tracked? Or all new files are automatically added? With Git, I always check first what files are added before I commit some new directory, to make sure I don&#x27;t add files which don&#x27;t belong into Git, like generated binaries or so.<p>&gt; You can fix [the merge conflict] while you&#x27;re in flow, and skip the conflict later.<p>To me, suddenly getting a merge conflict because of the background auto-rebase while working on some code sounds more like a distraction to get me out of the flow?<p>&gt; Personal branches, not forks<p>So, you mean it&#x27;s a centralized system? But does that mean, forks are not possible? Or when you fork, there are no good ways to work together anymore, e.g. merging branches from other forks?<p>&gt; Grace will have a native GUI app for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS. (And probably Linux.)<p>It sounds like Linux is not a priority now? This will turn off a lot of developers. I think for a new version control system, it makes more sense to have Linux as a priority, and Windows etc can come later.</div><br/><div id="40316745" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40316745" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kelseydh</span><span>|</span><a href="#40316677">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40315664">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40316745">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40316745">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah always tracking and uploading everything <i>seems</i> nice but brings with it security concerns.

The publisher insisted that the working files are kept in the Box folder (like a DropBox, or any other cloud-shmoud synchronized storage). This was... convenient and practical. This way of working is much better than the Git way if you work alone and produce dozens or hundreds of meaningful changes a day.<p>But at some point you have to publish. You have to make sure your state is correct to some level of certainty, and share it with other people. So you still need some kind of &#x27;commit&#x27; thingie.<p>I think, Grace gets this both ways right.

DO NOT DO THIS. Often, programming requires low distractions, and the distraction of changing the very thing that I am working on while I am working on it is a huge distraction.<p>The dangers:<p>- If I am trying to isolate a specific behavior, auto-rebase could change the behavior of what I&#x27;m trying to isolate while I&#x27;m trying to isolate it.<p>- If the upstream rebase creates a build error, it will completely destroy my flow. (It makes me stop a task while I am incomplete.) This could happen if the parent branch has a renamed method, and my changes introduce a new call to that method.<p>Instead, I suggest a very gentle notification about parent branch updates. Don&#x27;t steal focus.<p>Edit: I was lead developer on a desktop file sync client for 9 years. Whenever I had a support escalation from someone using us as source code control, I&#x27;d always recommend that the customer use git and tell them that we used Github.

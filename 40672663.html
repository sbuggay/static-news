Even though it was mocap, he face felt like it was part of a living thing. When he talked, the rest of his body moved with it. I think the oversized head help give more room to transition. Contrast that to the faces from Cats. There is a clear delineation between the human face pasted onto the CGI cat body.<p>Clu&#x27;s face also looks pasted on to a body. All the de-aging tech suffers from this because they are usually pasting a CGI face over a real body, and the micromovements don&#x27;t match. Whatever tech smooths out wrinkles also seems to reduce fidelity.<p>Animatronics suffer from the same issue. Often the faces are highly articulated, but the rest of the body is just a frame covered in plastic.<p>Worf and Gamora were both real actors in makeup, so they still had all the human micromovements. And anything that is fully animated doesn&#x27;t have the same delineation.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40678910" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40678910" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stagas</span><span>|</span><a href="#40673018">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40675235">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40678910">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40678910">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The term i like to use lately is: faf - Fake As F*ck.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40675235" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40675235" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lupire</span><span>|</span><a href="#40678910">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40675235">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40675235">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The AI image part would have been better if they showed an AI generated photorealistic scene compared to the AI generated cartoon scene</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

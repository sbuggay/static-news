I was really surprised when I went to college, with the amount of cheating that went on. A huge proportion of my class would take a shortcut. Get the answers to an assignment from a friend, cheat the clicker, plagiarize. A smaller subset were determined to never honestly do an assignment. Every assignment was approached, first and foremost, with a strategy for how to defraud it.<p>What&#x27;s so interesting is that so many of these cheaters, the worst ones included, were extremely intelligent people. The most capable cheaters were as smart as the honest top of the class. (The slackers, who just wanted the degree, all muddled through with C&#x27;s. Which is fine!). Academic fraud at the highest level, among tenured professors, is the most extreme possible case of this.<p>What gets me is that if you stop and think about fraud, about cheating, for literally a minute, you can only come to the conclusion that it&#x27;s a huge disservice to absolutely everyone. It&#x27;s obviously a disservice to the honest people in your cohort, because it robs them of advancement. It&#x27;s a disservice to you, because you waste time cheating instead of learning -- which only leads to issues down the road, because you need the things you&#x27;re learning about in school.<p>But I think most importantly, it&#x27;s a joyless activity. Any pride you have in your work, passion for what you&#x27;re doing, it&#x27;s all permanently tainted by the fraud. One of the funnest, most enjoyable parts of life, in my mind, is getting really really good at something really really hard, and mastering it. These people are the absolute best. Tao Li, the stories in here [1], the Alzheimer&#x27;s case. I mean I&#x27;m angry about these things of course, but more than anything, it&#x27;s a pity&#x2F;feeling bad for&#x2F;disgust reaction. They wasted their whole lives on getting to the top of the field, only to suck all of the joy out of the achievement by cheating to get there.<p>These people are so clearly gifted. How is it that they cannot make this connection?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39643437">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39643437</a></div><br/><div id="39650199" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39650199" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ken47</span><span>|</span><a href="#39650062">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39650342">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39650199">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39650199">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think you&#x27;re deceiving yourself with your implication that cheaters tend to be &quot;extremely intelligent.&quot; Being able to exhibit intelligence in short bursts is not the same capability as being able to exercise it for hours a day, for months on end, in a mental marathon like academia or many other career paths require. The cheaters that you&#x27;re referring to, are at best, clever, which is inferior to being intelligent.<p>You may believe that they simply lack the desire to use their intelligence over a longer timespan, but there is effectively no difference between never wanting to do it and not being able to do it.<p>There may occasionally be cheaters who cheat because they get a kick out of it, and <i>happen</i> to be intelligent, but that isn&#x27;t the norm.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39650342" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39650342" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anal_reactor</span><span>|</span><a href="#39650062">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39650199">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39649965">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39650342">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39650342">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; But I think most importantly, it&#x27;s a joyless activity.<p>You are completely wrong.

First go talk to a lawyer.  A lawyer of your own, not connected with the university (except perhaps as an alum).  Not a dean, not an ombud, not the kindly professor who&#x27;s a friend to all students, not that other professor who sounded especially forthright in class.<p>Ask the lawyer for a free initial consultation.  Where you might find they&#x27;re comfortable handling this situation, or they might recommend a better lawyer for it.  They can also talk about how the costs would work for your situation.  You can check out a few lawyers this way.<p>Once you have a lawyer, they can advise you how to approach the university, and&#x2F;or approach the university themself, to protect you, and to get the harm to you fixed.<p>Getting a lawyer doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t work things out with the university, and finish successfully.<p>But if you try to do it on your own, trusting university channels, there will likely be people who don&#x27;t believe you, people who are friends&#x2F;colleagues of the person committing misconduct and not wanting it to be a big deal, people scared of the person&#x27;s influence, and people who will ruthlessly cover up wrongdoing to cover either their own butt or the university&#x27;s.  Also, if a dishonest advisor suspects you are a threat, they are in a position to easily ruin your career with impunity, and you don&#x27;t want to gamble on their true character.<p>You need help navigating that.<p>You can come back from this.  You just need the the help of a lawyer, so even the sketchiest elements of the university will know they have to take you seriously, and deal with you fairly.  And a lawyer can help make sure that they follow through on fixing it.<p>Also, whatever you do, don&#x27;t let yourself be destroyed like this person in the article did.  It sounds like he didn&#x27;t feel he had options, was extremely stressed, probably sleep deprived, temporarily disenchanted with the field by the situation, and had been physically threatened.  His case was tragic.  Don&#x27;t let another tragic case happen.  You have more power than you think, and you&#x27;ll feel better about the field and life once this BS is fixed.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39649865" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39649865" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">amir734jj</span><span>|</span><a href="#39650133">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39649988">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39649865">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39649865">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As someone who very recently finished his Ph.D. in CS and was working full-time as a software engineer at the same time, I must say that getting a Ph.D. is difficult and takes a lot of willpower and dedication.

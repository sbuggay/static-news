I think academia&#x27;s biggest open secret is that a HUGE number of academics -- especially in and around large metros or in nice climates -- are chasing a prestigious and comfortable job because their trust funds allow them to not care about the money and their upbringing makes it difficult for them to deal with having a manager.</div><br/><div id="35782518" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35782518" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Wowfunhappy</span><span>|</span><a href="#35778140">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35778537">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35779730">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35782518">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35782518">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; As a PhD, I now believe that pursuing a career in science is an enormously selfish and entitled life choice for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have a trust fund.<p>Focusing specifically on the the word &quot;selfish&quot;--isn&#x27;t academia about dedicating yourself to scientific discovery?

Sure, that&#x27;s not everyone, but it&#x27;s a big enough chunk of the people that stick around.<p>Regardless of personal intentions, it&#x27;s also a fact that we have a massive oversupply of people trying to make it in academic science. Functionally the only way it is selfless then is if you are meaningfully better at science than replacement level (and again potential replacements run deep these days).<p>This makes most people either knowingly selfish (if they are sacrificing others&#x27; wellbeing for their research anyway) or very arrogant about their intelligence level. Or naive about the system, but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll meet many postdocs that don&#x27;t know these facts.<p>The people that stick around and grind away at research work even once any chance at a tenure track position has passed are a lot more defensible as selfless of course, but that&#x27;s not really the most common situation to find in a lab. The majority are gunning for a career in academic science, even down to the poorly treated pre-PhD RA labor.<p>Now obviously if some rich kid or someone with no personal attachments wants to fuck around in academia they should totally go for it. I just don&#x27;t think selfless is the right word for that, and it&#x27;s certainly not the right word for your typical academic ladder climber.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35783117" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35783117" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xboxnolifes</span><span>|</span><a href="#35778140">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35782518">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35783746">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35779730">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35783117">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35783117">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you&#x27;re single and not responsible to anyone else, I agree.

All of this stuff happened within the last 150 years, and it was made worse in recent years following the massive increase of skilled people in the discipline.<p>A career in science also differs based on whether you&#x27;re an academic or in industry. On whether you&#x27;re out their seeking grants, or out making products to sell.<p>These are all decisions being made based on what people demonstrate that they will tolerate. No different than the Japanese Karoshi-culture. If your Ph.D. or Post-Doc supervisor won&#x27;t allow you to have a life outside of science, then dump them. Leave them up the creek without a paddle. They are not your only option.<p>At its absolute worse, the hours involved in an academic Ph.D.&#x2F;Post-Doc aren&#x27;t significantly worse than a chronic precariat worker. I had two jobs during a particular semester when finishing up my A.S., and averaged 3.5 hours of sleep per night (outside of the weekends). I&#x27;ve read about a guy who spent <i>years</i> walking and taking transit for 8 hours each day from his house to his 8-hour a day job. 16 hours per day just dedicated to work. Ultimately his job and&#x2F;or co-workers pitched in to buy him a car.<p>The harsh hours in scientific academia is ultimately a choice. And the choice is not between science and a life.

The proven model so far is reducing funding. Some universities found new ways to raise money by offering online and async course modalities. This benefits students who need the extra flexibility, and it&#x27;s probably the most significant change that can be made. Increasing proliferation would require grants to surmount the initial investment and the need for guidance from the already successful institutions who paved the way.<p>Another change I&#x27;d like to see is shorter undergraduate programs. Most can stand to lose a few classes off the beginning that duplicate high school and a few off the end that duplicate grad school. That might have to be a political decision in response to the high cost of education. Shaving off a year could help you avoid the family issue entirely, especially if you worked for a year or two before returning to grad school.<p>Similarly, another proven model is that senior year of high school can also be used to reduce the duration of college. You can already get college credit, but it&#x27;s a very fragmented and uneven system.

Can anyone here name a single academic in any other subfield of computer science who had a string of groundbreaking research works where every one of those works is from 1980 or after? I can&#x27;t. And that&#x27;s almost half a century that we&#x27;re working with. Many people who defended their PhDs in the 1980s are already retired.<p>This applies to plenty of other fields as well. Medicine, for instance: There were surgeons in the 1960s and 1970s who have  half a dozen new surgical techniques to their name. (If you want some examples, look up Michael DeBakey, Mark Coventry, and Thomas Starzl.) You will not find a single academic surgeon today who comes even close to that, and at least in my opinion it&#x27;s not because modern surgeons lack drive or creativity or the ambition to tackle big problems.<p>Hamming is probably right that the role of luck in the sense of serendipity is overblown, but he ignores role of luck in the sense of structural factors that are out of your control. Because he and his colleagues largely operated in a context where all those structural factors were completely optimized.<p>If you decide to start a PhD in a field 10 years before that field is destined to hit a multi-decade rut, if your advisor fails to make tenure partway through your PhD and your lab is shut down, if you get your first academic appointment in an environment where research funding is trending down and regulatory burdens are trending up, these are all factors that are by and large out of your control that can significantly alter the trajectory of your career.</div><br/><div id="35778555" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35778555" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">asdfman123</span><span>|</span><a href="#35777764">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35778619">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35778555">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35778555">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Related: Iâm annoyed by programmers who implore others to study âworthwhile things.â<p>Iâm guessing most of us were obsessed with computers in our teens, and the job market just happened to align with one of our hobbies.<p>Kids who are fascinated with classical piano or performance art donât stumble into lucrative careers unless theyâre in the top 0.1%.</div><br/><div id="35782874" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35782874" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Fomite</span><span>|</span><a href="#35777764">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35778555">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35778619">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35782874">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35782874">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s also something that can be turned <i>on</i> programmers.

The fact of the matter is that todayâs environment for researchers is completely different from what it was like in 1986 when this talk was given, though I mention it not to take anything away from this talk.  The days of places like Xerox PARC and Bell Labs where researchers had considerable freedom and autonomy are over and have been for quite some time now.  Many industry labs promote business-driven research instead of purely curiosity-driven work and expect their researchers to produce a regular flow of research results that can be productized, lest they be shown the door.  Academia these days isnât exactly a bastion of freedom, either, with its âpublish-or-perishâ pressures needed to secure tenure and remain in good standing, as well as the need to raise grant money, both of which require pleasing external reviewers.  Thus, successful researchers under this environment must find a way to manage the inevitable uncertainties of research while also producing enough output to make their evaluators happy.  I find these âproductivityâ metrics stifling, but if I want to continue as a researcher, itâs either play the game successfully or find another way to make a living.<p>Iâve been thinking long and hard about this for years.  Perhaps researchers who value freedom of inquiry and freedom from âpublish-or-perishâ pressures could work independently, perhaps being funded by fellowships (like the MacArthur Grant), from part-time work, or from a side business.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35778819" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35778819" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kragen</span><span>|</span><a href="#35777764">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35778252">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35782814">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35778819">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35778819">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">i agree!  hamming even talks about this a bit in his talk<p>your chances of doing great research are slim if you&#x27;re born in kenya in the 01940s, no matter how much drive and creativity you have, but that&#x27;s not because &#x27;research advances&#x27; have &#x27;droughts&#x27;, it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re not being allowed to do great research, even if plenty of research advances are happening out of your reach<p>(unless you&#x27;re richard leakey)<p>that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happened to modern surgeons, nuclear engineers, aeronautical engineers, chemists, etc.  the usa and eu today have mostly become the kenya of the 01940s, where only the occasional richard leakey is allowed to excel, and thus we have entered the so-called great stagnation<p>but restrictions are much looser in computer science than in most fields.  we still have:<p>- oleg kiselyov (sxml, probabilistic programming, relational programming and thence the reasoned schemer, type checking as small-step abstract evaluation, tagless staged interpreters, stream processing without runtime overhead)<p>- dan bernstein (twisted edwards curves including curve25519, breaking aes with cache timing attacks, nacl, tweetnacl, qmail, salsa, poly1305, striking down usa export controls, organizing the pqc conferences)<p>- fabrice bellard (qemu, ffmpeg, tcc, lzexe, and bellard&#x27;s formula, aside from nncp, which is deep learning)<p>- jeff dean and sanjay ghemawat (epi info, leveldb, tensorflow, bigtable, mapreduce, spanner, &#x27;the google cluster architecture&#x27;, lots of internal google stuff, and again a bunch of deep learning stuff)<p>- raph levien (io, advogato, the gnome canvas, libart)<p>- graydon hoare (monotone and thence git, rust), and<p>- rob pike (blit, utf-8, much of plan9, sawzall, and golang)<p>- wouter van oortmerssen (cube&#x2F;sauerbraten, flatbuffers, amiga e, false and thus more or less the field of esolangs, lobster, bla with first-class environments, aardappel, fisheye quake)<p>i&#x27;ve left out the people i personally know well</div><br/></div></div><div id="35782814" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35782814" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">psychomugs</span><span>|</span><a href="#35777764">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35778819">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35779830">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35782814">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35782814">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The survivorship bias here reflects the positive-results bias in research itself.

He dedicated half of every Friday to trying to predict the future of computer science. One of the major points he drives home is that the next breakthrough in any field will not be what he or anyone else has worked on in the past. That is why it is worth striving to work on the right things.</div><br/><div id="35778443" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35778443" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Calavar</span><span>|</span><a href="#35777764">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35778302">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35778502">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35778443">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35778443">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I think dismissing an entire branch of research simply because it goes against one&#x27;s argument is a little funny<p>I don&#x27;t think it goes against my argument at all. Deep learning is a place where many structural factors are currently optimized, so it has a glut of prominent researchers. The big names in deep learning like Hinton, LeCunn, Bengio took their first post PhD appointments 30 to 40 years ago. All three put out some good work between 1985 and 2010, but all three became an order of magnitude more productive after 2010. They went from being members of a mostly irrelevant and overlooked research niche (neural networks were considered a dead end in ML) to being heads of research at multi-billion dollar companies. If it is really all about the individual, why weren&#x27;t they that productive from the start? What changed? Well, the number of GPU cores hit an inflection point. Technologies for GP-GPU programming like cuda reached maturity.<p>As I said, there is truth to what Hamming said too. The 1920s were primed for a revolution in physics, but there were thousands of physicists contemporary to Einstein, de Broglie, Heisenberg, and Bohr who didn&#x27;t do anything of note. So what set the ones who won Nobel prizes apart from the rest? That&#x27;s where Hamming&#x27;s advice comes in.<p>In other words, I can be convinced that Einstein or de Broglie would have reached the tops of their fields in any time or place and in nearly any field. But you cannot convince me that they would have made the history books if they were marine biologists in the 1990s. It doesn&#x27;t matter how hard you think about where the next revolution in your field will be if there is no revolution to be had.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35781456" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35781456" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">OldGuyInTheClub</span><span>|</span><a href="#35777764">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35781374">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35781456">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35781456">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This (deservedly) famous article by a legend is a must-read but it is also like having Michael Jordan or Michael Phelps teaching how to be successful in basketball or swimming.

The established and successful researchers, mostly men, would all talk about the sacrifices their wives made so that they could focus on meeting the insanely high expectations of the place in its glory days.  It was the custom back when they made their reputations.  The younger permanent staff members were leery of this because  social mores and the nature of the research environment were both changing.

&#x2F;excerpt<p>One of the guys I did know personally wound up at Janelia and eventually at Stockholm.<p>I was on the other side of the very long Murray Hill building in the physical sciences area.  I went to one of Odlyzko&#x27;s presentations at the Journal Club circa 1992 or 1993 - I think it was on an important new result in prime numbers&#x2F;factorization&#x2F;encryption.  I never met him, let alone worked with him, though.  I do remember one of my senior colleagues (physical scientist) wondering why any of that stuff mattered.  My response was that it was probably much more important than anything he or I were doing, had done, or would ever do.

When I first read it over 10 years ago, this quote really struck with me:<p>&gt; Another personality defect is ego assertion and I&#x27;ll speak in this case of my own experience. I came from Los Alamos and in the early days I was using a machine in New York at 590 Madison Avenue where we merely rented time. I was still dressing in western clothes, big slash pockets, a bolo and all those things. I vaguely noticed that I was not getting as good service as other people. So I set out to measure. You came in and you waited for your turn; I felt I was not getting a fair deal. I said to myself, ``Why? No Vice President at IBM said, `Give Hamming a bad time&#x27;. It is the secretaries at the bottom who are doing this. When a slot appears, they&#x27;ll rush to find someone to slip in, but they go out and find somebody else. Now, why? I haven&#x27;t mistreated them.&#x27;&#x27; Answer, I wasn&#x27;t dressing the way they felt somebody in that situation should. It came down to just that - I wasn&#x27;t dressing properly. I had to make the decision - was I going to assert my ego and dress the way I wanted to and have it steadily drain my effort from my professional life, or was I going to appear to conform better? I decided I would make an effort to appear to conform properly. The moment I did, I got much better service. And now, as an old colorful character, I get better service than other people.<p>&gt; Many a second-rate fellow gets caught up in some little twitting of the system, and carries it through to warfare. He expends his energy in a foolish project. Now you are going to tell me that somebody has to change the system. I agree; somebody&#x27;s has to. Which do you want to be? The person who changes the system or the person who does first-class science? Which person is it that you want to be? Be clear, when you fight the system and struggle with it, what you are doing, how far to go out of amusement, and how much to waste your effort fighting the system. My advice is to let somebody else do it and you get on with becoming a first-class scientist. Very few of you have the ability to both reform the system and become a first-class scientist.<p>I tried to live that way for a couple years. Frankly, I think this way of living is unnecessarily restrictive. So what if you get slightly worse service? The clothes you wear and your expressions highlight your history and your culture. By self-censoring yourself, you end up just perpetuating the censorship of other views in the workplace.
This goes double for scientists, as we are rather public facing and have room for wearing nontraditional clothes within our jobs.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35778093" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35778093" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scsteps</span><span>|</span><a href="#35778545">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35781082">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35778093">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35778093">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Iâve always had trouble balancing between working on things that I consider to be important vs things that I am excited about.

It&#x27;s very ugly; you shouldn&#x27;t have to do it. The world is supposed to be waiting, and when you do something great, they should rush out and welcome it. But the fact is everyone is busy with their own work. You must present it so well that they will set aside what they are doing, look at what you&#x27;ve done, read it, and come back and say, ``Yes, that was good.&#x27;&#x27; I suggest that when you open a journal, as you turn the pages, you ask why you read some articles and not others. You had better write your report so when it is published in the Physical Review, or wherever else you want it, as the readers are turning the pages they won&#x27;t just turn your pages but they will stop and read yours. If they don&#x27;t stop and read it, you won&#x27;t get credit. </i><p>&gt; <i>There are three things you have to do in selling. You have to learn to write clearly and well so that people will read it, you must learn to give reasonably formal talks, and you also must learn to give informal talks. We had a lot of so-called `back room scientists.&#x27; In a conference, they would keep quiet. Three weeks later after a decision was made they filed a report saying why you should do so and so. Well, it was too late. They would not stand up right in the middle of a hot conference, in the middle of activity, and say, ``We should do this for these reasons.&#x27;&#x27; You need to master that form of communication as well as prepared speeches.</i><p>I ran across this speech about 5 years into my software development career. These two paragraphs were a MAJOR game changer. Until then I could not believe that more than a minimum of soft skills were necessary being a developer and that my code would speak for itself.<p>After reading Hamming&#x27;s words I started putting much more effort into things like presentations and status emails. The results were not immediate and I am not exactly &quot;next VP&quot; but I am definitely in a stable and comfortable position in my current company.<p>More importantly I am not frustrated when I write some cool-new-tool and nobody takes an interest. It almost certainly means there&#x27;s nothing wrong with cool-new-tool and I need to better communicate what it is and why its useful.

Needless to say, I am still looking for that important problem.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35777019" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35777019" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">teddyh</span><span>|</span><a href="#35778188">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35777420">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35777019">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35777019">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">On video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=e3msMuwqp-o&amp;list=PLctkxgWNSR89bl7hTOS3F3wuoGj7id3Xy&amp;index=32#t=22s">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=e3msMuwqp-o&amp;list=PLctkxgWNSR...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="35777420" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35777420" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gumby</span><span>|</span><a href="#35777019">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35776931">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35777420">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35777420">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I heard him give this talk at Ames back in the 80s.

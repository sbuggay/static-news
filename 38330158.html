  &gt; I am not accusing anyone (to be clear, even the Board Directors that I consider conflicted) of having acted subject to conflicts of interest. [AKA &quot;Just Asking Questions&quot; technique]

  &gt; If... this act of governance was unwise, it calls into serious question the ability of these people and their organizations... to conduct governance

So they&#x27;re conflicted because they&#x27;re also in governance, and they shouldn&#x27;t govern because they might have been conflicted.<p>It seems like the author&#x27;s real problem isn&#x27;t any specific conduct by these two board members, but more of a &quot;you got chocolate in my peanut butter&quot; issue.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38330539" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38330539" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">swyx</span><span>|</span><a href="#38330561">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38330615">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38330539">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38330539">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">1. i am surprised that Sam, a known prepper, left himself vulnerable to the most traditional risk a CEO can have. presumably he had a lot of control over board composition?<p>2. soooo is Sam back? how exactly might satya influence a nonprofit board he has zero votes in? why would the board flipflop so quickly in the span of 24 hrs when presumably they took the original action knowing the shitstorm that would ensue? none of these things make sense given that everyone in the room is presumably smart and knows how the world works</div><br/><div id="38330620" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38330620" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cinntaile</span><span>|</span><a href="#38330539">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38330615">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38330620">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38330620">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; none of these things make sense given that everyone in the room is presumably smart and knows how the world works<p>The board can try to anticipate the next actions after they fire them, but predicting the final outcome of what essentially are human actions seems quite difficult.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38330615" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38330615" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mw67</span><span>|</span><a href="#38330539">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38330546">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38330615">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38330615">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Finally a board that acts to benefit all humanity as the charter demands.

You can produce all positive integers by starting with zero and repeatedly adding one. You can almost do the same thing with multiplication too, except for these pesky primes, which are somehow atomic. Naturally then, one might ask: (a) How many primes are there? (b) How frequently do they occur? (c) Can we look at a number and determine whether it is a prime?
Now consider: Despite being among the oldest of the mathematical disciplines, there are still open problems about primes that can be explained to high school students.<p>Also, multiplication and addition are not simply operations that are of interest with respect to integers, but similar ideas apply to a bunch of other domains too. Polynomials, for example.

To someone who only just has learned math, the increasing counting numbers (1, 2, 3, 466..) are all &#x27;real things&#x27;. 
But if you are very cynical about math, you might instead argue, that the only &#x27;real&#x27; number we have, is the number &#x27;1&#x27;. All those others (2, 466..) are just &quot;applications&quot; of that &#x27;1&#x27;.
That is to say, we adopt the shorthand &#x27;466&#x27;, because we don&#x27;t want to write down almost 500 1&#x27;s each time we reference it. (think of it like very bad roman numerals..)
  In this perspective, where we ignore &#x27;ordinary&#x27; numbers like 466,
you might argue that prime numbers are more real, because they really &#x27;do&#x27; something (that is, construct composite numbers, like the example with 1 above.)<p>You could have a thought experiment of a world, in which we never developed arabic numerals or roman numerals, but instead did all our math directly on prime numbers.

Investigations into the nature of primes has produced many mathematical tools and they have bridged many different areas of mathematics together.<p>But the simplest answer is that prime numbers are a tantalizing mystery that is easy for anyone to understand. The deeper you dig, the deeper the hole gets and it almost doesn&#x27;t matter if a satisfying &quot;answer&quot; is ever found. Primes are a McGuffin that has led to countless discoveries.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42406419" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42406419" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">keepamovin</span><span>|</span><a href="#42406030">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42406480">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42406074">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42406419">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42406419">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes. You shouldn&#x27;t be downvoted because it&#x27;s a reasonable question and opens things up for fascinating exploration.<p>I guess there&#x27;s many things interesting about it, but I see it like: prime numbers are the fundamental pattern of magnitudes, where the next prime is the first place that no multiples of any previous magnitude (prime or not) would ever land on.<p>In other words, if you took any previous magnitude (ie, any number less than that next prime), and copied it over edge to edge, the edge would never line up with that next prime.<p>Because counting and magnitude is so simple and fundamental to the space of concepts and even to reality, it&#x27;s pretty fascinating that this extremely simple to describe pattern, is nevertheless hard to create a description for that&#x27;s more concise than including all previous primes.<p>And I think people like finding that kind of &#x27;shorter&#x27; description, as it indicates a deeper understanding, a new way of looking at reality that you didn&#x27;t see before. And when we see that, it will probably be very useful to many other things.<p>It&#x27;s fascinating to reflect on all that, and also on how this fundamental pattern of magnitudes, their &#x27;self-similar but scaling&#x27; structure, also relates to the &#x27;compressibility&#x27; of the number line and information theory.<p>That&#x27;s what I think. I think everyone can find their own interest in there, there&#x27;s probably a lot of ways to look at it. :)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42406785" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42406785" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DemocracyFTW2</span><span>|</span><a href="#42406030">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42406785">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42406785">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; the primes aren’t random. They’re completely determined<p>I wonder how true this statement is but it probably also relies on the understanding of the word &#x27;random&#x27;. In the colloquial sense, it is certainly true in the sense that (truly) &#x27;random&#x27; means &#x27;occurring without (discernible) rules&#x27;.<p>However, in a stricter definition &#x27;random&#x27; means (if I&#x27;m not mistaken, hobby-thinker here) just &quot;a given set of numbers S is called random with respect to a set of binary tests T when all individual procedures in T yield a positive outcome&quot;. That is, you can only ever a finite set S and test against a finite set T, meaning the algorithm that generated your random-looking set S can, potentially, always be amended to creep closer to overcome the failed tests (and the reverse is also true: one can, potentially, always move the goalposts and add another test to T to make a set fail that used to pass).<p>Ultimately, then, randomness—where it is not occurring <i>eo ipso</i> as in radioactive decay—is always a relative (S WRT T), social (people must agree), and finite (can&#x27;t test against unseen members of S and, per precondition, can&#x27;t give a rule to cover infinity as in &#x27;divisible by eleven&#x27;) procedure (that may or may not practically terminate). In other words, once we settle on a given set of tests T to determine what is random, one can (potentially) always come up with an algorithm that passes the tests, thus looks random though it is determined.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

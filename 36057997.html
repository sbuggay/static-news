Not  all need to solved fully and not all of those even need to be done automatically.<p>You often don&#x27;t need to solve the problem to provide some business benefit.<p>So. Can you break it down at all? Is there some part of it that has a business benefit?<p>Can you do it manually, what&#x27;s the trade-off of time and cost? Can you document it to make it a manual task for a lower level employee?<p>If not worth doing manually, often it&#x27;s good to do some of it manually a few times so you get an idea of what&#x27;s the same &#x2F; different for different situations.<p>Can you automate the same parts?<p>Can you find a way to deal with <i>some</i> cases where it differs?<p>Can you now solve any of the remaining pieces?<p>This process can often be done with manual scripts, I forget the right term, where you create a script that prints out what the user should do and asks them to press enter when they&#x27;ve done it. You can then automate parts of it over  time.<p>This kind of process helps have a useful output at all stages whenever a higher priority problem comes along. It&#x27;s also easier to come back to it in a few months.<p>And if not, if you can&#x27;t even do it manually it pushes it more towards unsolveable.<p>For problems that don&#x27;t fit this kind of process, I often leave the problem to settle in my mind and talk it through while walking somewhere. Explain to imaginary people what we&#x27;re doing what we can&#x27;t do etc. Kind of like rubber duck debugging.<p>Prototypes, just <i>trying</i> can be good.<p>Most of all if you can, get an idea of the value of solving it and the value of your time. That helps put an upper bound on how long you should ever spend on it. A problem that causes a £10&#x2F;mo extra aws charge a month is fundamentally not worth solving for almost any developer salary.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s ok.

I solved it.<p>I once explained this to an audience using a riddle: &quot;How far can you walk into a forest?&quot; That type of riddle has no method or algorithm for solution. The answer usually &quot;comes to you&quot; or doesn&#x27;t. But knowing that riddles depend on a play on words or different meanings of words in different contexts, I suggested that one can analyse each word at a time: e.g. &quot;you vs. someone else?&quot;, &quot;walk vs. some other way of moving?&quot;, &quot;into vs. out of?&quot;, &quot;why specifically a forest?&quot; etc. The answer, of course, comes from &quot;into vs. out of&quot; -- you can only walk into a forest till the mid point. After that you&#x27;re walking out. Not an ideal example, but I always remember it when I&#x27;m faced with an intractable problem.<p>The method also helps stay motivated because there&#x27;s a sense of progress: you&#x27;re racking up a count of things that are definitely <i>not</i> the cause of the problem.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36081110" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36081110" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">politelemon</span><span>|</span><a href="#36080878">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36081157">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36081110">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36081110">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I feel an obvious solution many are missing is simply to ask your colleagues for help.

A PhD student&#x27;s approach to a difficult problem with apparantly no solution would be and should be different from someone who does not have a deliverable. If you are a student, you need to deliver some result for a degree. So after some time it would be better to forget about a seemingly unsolvable problem and focus on a new problem which you can solve in perhaps a better way.<p>A senior researcher however in my opinion should persistently try to solve the harder problems. As I feel it is their job.<p>Coming back to different problems than scientific research, I can only think of one approach. Ask the question, how important is this problem to you and your life?

Does it even make sense to solve this? - Best thing is to try to validate the problem. Find people to talk to, get feedback. Or think about alternatives and constraints. Every now and then, I start feeling like “what I work on makes no sense, I should just abandon it”. Only to then analyse it, walk through the different options and decisions and realise I’ve done this decision making exercise previously when starting the project and I still agree with the outcome. But I guess it’s good to recheck the assumptions every now and then.<p>2. Can <i>I</i> solve the problem? - I often get discouraged when I realise things are a lot more difficult than expected and I start to doubt myself. Usually results in me procrastinating and taking a break. Things that help me are: taking a deep breath, doing some searching for similar problems, breaking the problem down into smaller tasks, finding a smaller, yet similar problem to address first. Again, talking to people and reaching out for help can be great. People are often happy and flattered when you come to them with well-formed questions and acknowledge them as someone you consider an expert in a field.<p>Hope this helps. In general, when working on very hard problems that might not be solvable, try and break them down, find the riskiest piece that seems solvable, and try to tackle it.

Pretty much a demonstration of the &quot;framework effect&quot;.  The simplest things, read CLI tools, become buggy in subtle ways because you inherit <i>every</i> bug deep down in the dependency chain.

Part of it is definitely just the feeling of living in the future.<p>That said some stuff is really nice, but typically require more than your average &quot;smart home&quot;. In my mind I&#x27;ve made a distinction between &quot;smart home&quot; and &quot;convoluted home&quot; devices. A &quot;convoluted home&quot; device would be something like an app controlled light. The simple one-step process of flicking a switch is now a multi-step process of unlocking your phone, finding the app, and turning it off. Sure it has more features like changing the temperature or colour of the light, but it&#x27;s not &quot;smart&quot;.<p>The &quot;smart&quot; part of a system comes with interactions and logic between systems. An example that I have in my house is that my phone sends the time of the next alarm and an event whenever it is connected or disconnected from a charger. So half an hour before my alarm goes of the lights in the bedroom slowly dim up, waking me up gently. When the alarm rings it will turn on the rest of the lights in my house to full brightness and white light. Then in the evening, at a set time, the lights will start getting warmer, and then dim down helping me get sleepy before bedtime. And then when I connect my phone to my charger at night the lights in the whole house turns of. This is &quot;smart&quot;. It means I barely if ever touch light switches any longer, don&#x27;t have to remember to turn of lights at night, and that my natural day&#x2F;night cycle works better.<p>With presence detection based on whether the phone is connected to the WiFi you could also turn lights off completely while I&#x27;m gone. With controllable ovens you could extend the system to turn down the heat to save power. The list goes on and on, but the thing which makes it all possible is not so much the &quot;smart&quot;-ness of the individual device, but the combined &quot;smart&quot; of all the interconnected systems.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36193425" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36193425" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LeafItAlone</span><span>|</span><a href="#36192000">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36193097">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36193890">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36193783">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36193425">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36193425">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was like that too, for a long time.
But for me, it comes down convenience, rather than <i>need</i>.<p>Some examples:
1. I have a smart lock on the front door. Now when friends&#x2F;family want to visit and Iâm not around, I donât need to hide a key that they then can lose. They just get a code that I can have expire when they leave.
2. I am constantly either too hot or too cold. Being able to change the thermostat from where I am means I donât have to interrupt whatever Iâm doing and walk across the house.

But there tends to eventually be a few gadgets here and there that have clear benefits. Not the whole voice-controlled whole house lighting effect things that might be the typical showcases, but for example controlling two aircon units with different manufacturers in one place instead of having to use either to remotes or two apps. Because the smart tech tends to creep into peoples home whether they want it or not these days. Maybe the aircon comes without a remote (the app is the remote).<p>Most obviously then use the manufcturer&#x27;s default setup which is each manufacturer having their own &quot;smart&quot; apps for their gadgets. What&#x27;s worse is that each of them tend to think that <i>their</i> apps and products should be at the center of the stack, so each manufacturer of window blinds, air cons or routers have their own (terrible) closed version of Home Assistant. But nothing properly integrates everything and you are left with one app to control your AC and another for some lighting and a third for your garage door.<p>So when I use Home Assistant it&#x27;s really because I want to use <i>less</i> smart tech. I want very few smart features but I want to use just one app for the smart features I do need, and I want to avoid using an app at all if I can help it. So I don&#x27;t want to dig up and use 10 apps for gadgets around my house. I have zero interest in voice controlling anything. For example I want the lights to switch off when I leave (arm the alarm). I want anything that would be an alarm (Fridge too warm, smoke detector beeping) to also go off in my pocket. That peace of mind stuff. That&#x27;s easy with HA.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36193765" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36193765" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">theshrike79</span><span>|</span><a href="#36192000">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36193097">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36193783">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36193767">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36193765">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36193765">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s the small things.<p>1.

How does a homeowner know what to go with?<p>Let&#x27;s talk about bootstrapping a new device on the HA network: device discovery!<p>Some devices require an internet connection and the homeowner has to have an account on the cloud (Adafruit IO, various proprietary vendors). Some use a fixed mDNS name (Shelly), some require to download the vendors app (used to set network config, credentials, etc), most simply don&#x27;t do it at all. I even found one or two that <i>require</i> the owner to browse to a particular local IP, because the device starts off in AP mode.<p>Okay, lets say you jumped through the hoops (registered an account on a cloud service, gave the device internet access, used its AP to set it up, or it set itself up doing mDNS query for _mqtt._tcp.local, or whatever).<p>Next problem: authentication of the device on the network. Some devices just don&#x27;t support it, some support it using AES with pre-shared keys, some support it with basic HTTP auth over TLS, some use mqtt with TLS, some offer mqtt, but in plaintext only, with encryption being over HTTPS (reverses the pub&#x2F;sub model horrifically), many support x509 certs loaded onto the device (the worst option for an appliance!), some (using CoIoT) have support for DTLS (But need a valid x509 cert) ...<p>Problems aren&#x27;t over yet. So, you go with something ... and then find out that your controller is not compatible with one device. Maybe you need a Zigbee bridge because everything else is WiFi. Maybe that device requires x509 cert over WiFi, while everything else is using auth credentials. Maybe it&#x27;s hardwired to use vendor&#x27;s cloud and the rest of your network is using Home Assistant. Maybe it&#x27;s using ESPHome and everything else is using CoIoT.<p>That&#x27;s fine, you think, I&#x27;ll just use Home Assistant, which has integrations for everything on the planet, to &quot;bridge&quot; the different protocols. But now you&#x27;re stuck with Home Assistant as a controller, which has limited automation facilities.<p>Honestly, what <i>homeowners</i> want is to buy a device and plug it in, and have a nice interface for devices which allow the homeowner to specify what happens on any event.<p>That&#x27;s it.

All you have to do is dedicate a raspi to the problem and be done with it, not really a big problem.<p>And if you really want to run it on a Linux server that is used for other things, and the HA architecture irks you the wrong way: just wrap HA in a native qemu VM and run it on your server along your other stuff.</div><br/><div id="36193161" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36193161" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">deepspace</span><span>|</span><a href="#36192941">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36193202">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36193161">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36193161">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The author&#x27;s attitude reminds me of one of the best software articles ever, &quot;Cash Cow in the Tar Pit&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.computer.org&#x2F;csdl&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;so&#x2F;1996&#x2F;03&#x2F;s3041&#x2F;13rRUxly9bK" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.computer.org&#x2F;csdl&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;so&#x2F;1996&#x2F;03&#x2F;s3041&#x2F;13rR...</a>).<p>The reason a &quot;legacy&quot; system seems so clunky and over-engineered and hard to modify and has so much corner case handling is: real-world experience and bug-fixes.  When you throw that old cow in the tar pit and start developing your shiny new application, you throw all those years of hard-earned experience away with it.  By the time your application works as well as the old one, it will be just as ugly.<p>FWIW, I have been running HA in a qemu VM on a NUC for years, and it is one of the most stable pieces of software I use.  It supports every device I can throw at it, and the automations, while clunky, are easy to manage, as long as you keep KISS in mind.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36193202" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36193202" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">antigravity42</span><span>|</span><a href="#36192941">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36193202">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36193202">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The amount of skeptical people in this thread is astonishing, it is natural to questions pile of complexity even if it is well established.

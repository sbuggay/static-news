The answer, like with the paper planner is “unfortunately the world has changed”. Using a paper calendar or cash isn’t obsolete, but the real trick is learning to schedule&#x2F;work with money. And in the modern day, you _must_ be able to do this digitally. All my biggest incomes and expenses are digital transactions - my salary, mortgage, insurance, energy bills. Learning to manage cash flow means understanding it in that context.<p>Scheduling is the same now. If you operate solely on a paper planner in thr modern world you’re going to miss out. My workplace is entirely digital, my golf course, gym, even my barber use digital calendars. I’m not saying a proprietary app is the right move, but a paper scheduler <i>is</i> unfortunately bordering on obsolete.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42427564" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42427564" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sourcepluck</span><span>|</span><a href="#42426415">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42429210">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42426677">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42427564">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42427564">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Scheduling, and homework assignments, and textbooks [0], and handing in homework, and communicating absences, and asking the teacher a question later in the day in a groupchat, and the teacher sending an extra thing for everyone to read outside of class even just out of general interest, and communicating with peers about something in another class groupchat where the teacher isn&#x27;t present, and...<p>Some kids have zero interaction with pen and paper for at least some homeworks, where they&#x27;ll receive the assignment in a class group, do it on the tablet, send it back there as a PDF, and get back an annotated PDF with the corrections.<p>Not all schools are doing all of that.

That also caused other rooms to bump every now and then.<p>Generally, a teacher not showing up was no real reason for skipping class (no matter how much urban myths said otherwise) but if the absence was known in advance we&#x27;d get a free hour.

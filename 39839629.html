I&#x27;m in my forties and still have two living grandparents, and am very grateful for them. I remember a lot of days where my grandmother watched me and my sister, and she was able to do that because she was only in her late 40&#x27;s herself and plenty mobile. I knew two of my great grandmothers, one of them only dying in my teens.<p>Not everyone can rely on parents to help with childcare, but it is worth keeping in mind that if you wait until your mid 30&#x27;s they might not be able to catch a running toddler like they could a decade earlier.<p>My mom also managed to have a really good career, though she went to night school when I was around 6 and worked her ass off in general. But, she had a high earning partner to support her.<p>I don&#x27;t really have a single point here, except that I worry we&#x27;ve ignored the less-obvious downsides to people delaying childbearing until their mid 30&#x27;s.</div><br/><div id="39843696" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39843696" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Afton</span><span>|</span><a href="#39840019">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39844259">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39843696">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39843696">[78 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The upside is that I was a total basket case in my 20s, completely incompetent to be able to raise a child.

It’s harder when you are older, but I’m financially better off so they can have things I couldn’t afford in my 20s.

My brother was born when my mother was 16, I was born twenty years later. My parents routinely told me how much harder it was with my brother -- lack of cash and profession, the party lifestyle that comes with youth and college-life, constant moving for opportunity and cheaper housing, and an overall lack of time to dedicate to the kid due to the instability and struggle to keep afloat financially.<p>I was born at a time of great stability for them. They had professions, they could make their own schedules. They had time to participate in my schooling and extracurricular stuff. I had good food, good toys, good clothing, and a stable house. They let me voice my decisions because they had the time and freedom to consider options other than pure survival. I was told that I was the &#x27;easy&#x27; one -- not because of my personality but because &quot;The 70s sucked.&quot;, which is code for &quot;We were young, poor, un-established and struggling.&quot;<p>So, after the anecdote I feel compelled to ask : Why do you think it is harder when you&#x27;re older? You have more money, you have the power of flexibility within your scheduling that allows for participation in your childrens&#x27; growth and development -- is it simply a &#x27;strength of youth&#x27; kind of thing?<p>I have no kids, I have no plans for them, so I ask just as a curiosity. The opinion varies wildly from person to person, and I think it&#x27;s fascinating what kind of &#x27;diversity of parenting&#x27; exists.</div><br/><div id="39847199" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39847199" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dgacmu</span><span>|</span><a href="#39840019">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39846343">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39848239">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39847199">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39847199">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We had our first kid when I was about 37, and our second when I was about 43.<p>The part that&#x27;s harder is that particularly with #2, I&#x27;m just a bit more tired, and he needs a lot of energy. It&#x27;s not drastic, but I notice it.<p>The part that&#x27;s emotionally harder is that I&#x27;m sad I won&#x27;t be there when my kids are approximately my age. I&#x27;d love to be around longer to help if they have kids, etc., but statistically, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too likely. I lost my own mom two years ago and that was very hard. Barring some advances in health care, my kids are likely to lose me in their 30s-40s as well. Losing a parent is never easy, but I think it would be easier a little later. My kids only have one grandparent left and I wish they still had two.<p>The part that&#x27;s easier is exactly what you note: Life is pretty stable. We&#x27;re financially sound. We&#x27;ve had years of growth and therapy to learn to communicate well and have a healthy relationship with each other and our kids. We can afford to support our kids well, be that with high quality daycare when they were young, or an emergency mid-year school shift (that was interesting), or medically, or whatnot.<p>Lots of tradeoffs. I plan to make the most of my time with them while they&#x27;re still young.

Female fertility starts to rapidly drop in their thirties, and many will hit menopause in their 40s. The exact age is somewhat random, and some women will even enter menopause in their 30s.<p>Before I had children I thought it would be relatively easy - that&#x27;s why you use birth control after all. But when you actually have children you learn things like at best you&#x27;re looking at, at best, a 10-30% probability per month <i>if</i> you hit the ~48 hour ovulation window just perfectly. That doesn&#x27;t sound so bad - because a month isn&#x27;t such a long time, and ovulation is pretty predictable. But when you start late each month matters, and then if you want to actually have multiple children, then you&#x27;re already looking at a years long process.<p>And then add in that as you age, all sorts of birth defects and disorders like Down Syndrome become <i>much</i> more likely, and you can&#x27;t effectively test for them until about halfway through the pregnancy. It&#x27;s just not a great idea to start late. I&#x27;d also add that for us to have a sustainable population, everybody needs to be having more than 2 children on average. This is going to take a pretty substantial reshaping of society and culture, or our society and culture will simply go extinct.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39846465" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39846465" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Spooky23</span><span>|</span><a href="#39840019">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39846343">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39848239">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39848297">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39846465">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39846465">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For one, grandkids.

We separated over financial differences once it became clear they were never going to resolve. Imagine we had ignored our intuitions and married and had kids based on arbitrary deadlines? It would have been terrible.

That&#x27;s fair. But it&#x27;s also reality than you can never be fully prepared for any situation until you&#x27;re in it. Sometimes you just have to accept that live is one long improv scene and do your best.<p>I&#x27;m not saying anyone should have kids early, or at all. But I think there&#x27;s pernicious, unhealthy meme in our culture today that says kids deserve perfect parents and therefore no one should have children until they&#x27;re perfectly prepared, but that&#x27;s just an impossible bar.</div><br/><div id="39845434" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39845434" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BirAdam</span><span>|</span><a href="#39840019">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39844469">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39846190">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39845434">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39845434">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A very close friend of mine was murdered at 18, his sister was a year younger and she matured very quickly as a result of this experience.

Yes, if it’s your primary goal then that is cold and inhuman since children have a right to exist and be loved and cared for for their own sake, and they and other people do not exist merely to sate your desires.

Yes it&#x27;s sad, yes it&#x27;s wrong, but it&#x27;s also a fact.<p>I have family members in this boat, the kids greatly suffer as a result.<p>Social norms and defaults have a tendency to shame people into bad positions.  Sure, some may benefit, but others will flounder and take their kids&#x2F;family down with them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39847426" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39847426" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Dalewyn</span><span>|</span><a href="#39844855">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39845031">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39845473">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39845534">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39847426">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39847426">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;The problem is that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to convey to a childless person how meaningful parenthood will be to their life.<p>Why does that even need to be conveyed?

My inspiring thought was that I could be a young grandparent and that my kids would be able to know their parents for a long time as well as their grandparents and great grandparents. 
I did get married at 19 and had my first son at 20. 3 years later I had my daughter. 5 months into my daughters life, the kids mother left us and I was stranded alone as a single father of 2 at age 23. 
That was 4 years ago and it was the most difficult time of my life. I moved back in with my parents and my then recently &quot;empty cage&quot; mother had to become a &quot;mum&quot; again while I slowly got back on my feet. 
I&#x27;ve been remarried for about a year now and everything is going very well. My daughter is about to turn 4 and my son turns 7 this year. I love thinking about how when I&#x27;m 30 my son will be 10 and when I&#x27;m 40 he&#x27;ll be 20 etc.<p>Before the divorce, I was very adamant on promoting young marriage&#x2F;childbearing to others. In a perfect world I still think it&#x27;s a good idea... but I am a lot more open minded and less critical. Life is so unique and never goes according to plan. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend my exact life to anyone as it has its own unique and undesirable difficulties. When my own children grow up, I will strongly recommend against rushing anything with anyone until they&#x27;re absolutely sure and have a good plan in place.<p>My kids know and love their grandparents. They know their great grandparents.
I am prepared physically and mentally for 2 more kids (yes I know, but I think I know better than I did at 19), but I cannot imagine doing the whole baby thing in my mid 30s or early 40s... I think my current age is a good time to just get it all out of the way. I like to think of it as delayed gratification and that having adult children at a relatively young age is a huge blessing.

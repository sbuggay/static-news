(It&#x27;s still
The BBC but its a shadow of its former self as I understand it.) Blue Peter was filming and you could see down into studios from above, through glass and the locations used for news and weather were unbelievably crude, bare breeze lock behind the greenscreens.<p>They also had very strong, armoured doors,  certainly was quite well isolated from strangers with an urge to grab a microphone and were buried in the core of the building. I got the impression they had half an eye to &quot;This is the BBC. At this very time, unstoppable nuclear rockets have been launched toward London.. &quot;<p>Broadcasting house in central london was similarly odd, Spartan in places but more polished in others. The BCS headquarters were nearby and I think it&#x27;s rather telling computing basically ate broadcasts lunch.<p>People get very cross about the sculpture. Eric Gill was a nasty sexual predator.<p>The Shepherd&#x27;s Bush building was pure 60s. Like the GPO tower it defined the swinging London image for decades.<p>Vacuum tube TV cameras needed amazing amounts of light. The studios were boiling hot.</div><br/><div id="36279291" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36279291" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">timthorn</span><span>|</span><a href="#36279151">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36279118">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36279291">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36279291">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The occasional Blue Peter features where they showed the production process and visited the various backstage locations at TVC were always my favourites.

The fate of the South Bank studios makes me sad though.<p>&gt; The entire building including the 24-storey Kent House and all the studios were to be demolished, to be replaced with a 31-storey tower containing mostly luxury apartments and a token amount of ‘affordable’ housing.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

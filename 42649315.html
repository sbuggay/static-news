A LLM like ChatGPT has been turned into an RL agent which seeks to maximize reward by taking the optimal action. It is, ultimately, predicting what will manipulate the imaginary human rater into giving it a high reward.<p>So the logits aren&#x27;t telling you anything like &#x27;what is the probability in a random sample of Internet text of the next token&#x27;, but are closer to a Bellman value function, expressing the model&#x27;s belief as to what would be the net reward from picking each possible BPE as an &#x27;action&#x27; and then continuing to pick the optimal BPE after that (ie. following its policy until the episode terminates). Because there is usually 1 best action, it tries to put the largest value on that action, and assign very small values to the rest (no matter how plausible each of them might be if you were looking at random Internet text). This reduction in entropy is a standard RL effect as agents switch from exploration to exploitation: there is no benefit to taking anything less than the single best action, so you don&#x27;t want to risk taking any others.<p>This is also why completions are so boring and Boltzmann temperature stops mattering and more complex sampling strategies like best-of-N don&#x27;t work so well: the greedy logit-maximizing removes information about interesting alternative strategies, so you wind up with massive redundancy and your net &#x27;likelihood&#x27; also no longer tells you anything about the likelihood.<p>And note that because there is now so much LLM text on the Internet, this feeds back into future LLMs too, which will have flattened logits simply because it is now quite likely that they are predicting outputs from LLMs which had flattened logits. (Plus, of course, data labelers like Scale can fail at quality control and their labelers cheat and just dump in ChatGPT answers to make money.) So you&#x27;ll observe future &#x27;base&#x27; models which have more flattened logits too...<p>I&#x27;ve wondered if to recover true base model capabilities and get logits that actually meaningful predict or encode &#x27;dark knowledge&#x27;, rather than optimize for a lowest-common-denominator rater reward, you&#x27;ll have to start dumping in random Internet text samples to get the model &#x27;out of assistant mode&#x27;.</div><br/><div id="42686314" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42686314" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">HarHarVeryFunny</span><span>|</span><a href="#42684629">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42687072">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42686314">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42686314">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Which is why models like o1 &amp; o3, using heavy RL to boost reasoning performance, may perform worse in other areas where the greater diversity of output is needed.<p>Of course humans employ different thinking modes too - no harm in thinking like a stone cold programmer when you are programming, as long as you don&#x27;t do it all the time.</div><br/><div id="42688155" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42688155" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Vetch</span><span>|</span><a href="#42684629">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42686314">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42687072">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42688155">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42688155">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This seems wrong.

A LLM like ChatGPT has been turned into an RL agent which seeks to maximize reward by taking the optimal action. It is, ultimately, predicting what will manipulate the imaginary human rater into giving it a high reward.<p>This isn&#x27;t strictly true. It <i>is</i> still predicting &quot;most likely tokens&quot;! It&#x27;s just predicting the &quot;most likely tokens&quot; <i>generated in</i> a specific step in a conversation game; where that step was, in the training dataset, <i>taken by</i> an agent tuned to maximize reward. <i>For that conversation step</i>, the model is trying to predict what such an agent would say, as <i>that is what should come next in the conversation</i>.<p>I know this sounds like semantics&#x2F;splitting hairs, but it has real implications for what RLHF&#x2F;instruction-following models will do when not bound to what one might call their &quot;Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness.&quot;<p>If you <i>unshackle</i> any instruction-following model from the logit bias pass that prevents it from generating end-of-conversation-step tokens&#x2F;sequences, then it will almost always finish inferring the &quot;AI agent says&quot; conversation step, and move on to inferring the following &quot;human says&quot; conversation step. (Even older instruction-following models that were trained only on single-shot prompt&#x2F;response pairs rather than multi-turn conversations, will still do this if they are allowed to proceed past the End-of-Sequence token, due to how training data is packed into the context in most training frameworks.)<p>And when it does move onto predicting the &quot;human says&quot; conversation step, it won&#x27;t be optimizing for reward (i.e. it won&#x27;t be trying to come up with an ideal thing for the human say to &quot;set up&quot; a perfect response to earn it maximum good-boy points); rather, it will <i>just</i> be predicting what a human would say, just as its ancestor text-completion base-model would.<p>(This would even happen with ChatGPT and other high-level chat-API agents. However, such chat-API agents are stuck talking to you through a business layer that expects to interact with the model through a certain trained-in ABI; so turning off the logit bias â if that was a knob they let you turn â would just cause the business layer to throw exceptions due to malformed JSON &#x2F; state-machine sequence errors. If you could interact with those same models through lower-level text-completion APIs, you&#x27;d see this result.)<p>For similar reasons, these instruction-following models always expect a &quot;human says&quot; step to come first in the conversation message stream; so you can also (again, through a text-completion API) just leave the &quot;human says&quot; conversation step open&#x2F;unfinished, and the model will happily infer what &quot;the rest&quot; of the human&#x27;s prompt should be, without any sign of instruction-following.<p>In other words, the model still <i>knows</i> how to be a fully-general, high-entropy(!) text-completion model. It just <i>also</i> knows how to play a specific word game of &quot;ape the way an agent trained to do X responds to prompts&quot; â where playing that game involves rules that lower the entropy ceiling.<p>This is exactly the same as how image models can be prompted to draw in the style of a specific artist. To an LLM, the RLHF agent it has been fed a training corpus of, is a specific artist it&#x27;s learned to ape the style of, <i>when and only when</i> it thinks that such a style <i>should apply</i> to some sub-sequence of the output.</div><br/><div id="42688240" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42688240" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Vetch</span><span>|</span><a href="#42684629">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42688011">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42688296">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42688240">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42688240">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is an interesting proposition.

If you want chat, the client interacting with that text-completion API is expected to <i>be</i> the business layer, either literally (with that client in turn being a server exposing a chat-completion API) or in the sense of vertically integrating the chat-message-stream-structuring business-logic, logit-bias specification, early stream termination on state change, etc. into the completion-service abstraction-layer of the ultimate client application.<p>In either case, any slip-up in the business-layer configuration â which is common, as these models all often use different end-of-conversation-step sequences, and don&#x27;t document them well â can and does result in seeing &quot;under the covers&quot; of these models.<p>This is also taken advantage of on purpose in some applications.

If an experiment can work with a diffusion model as well as it does with a pure text model, and produces robust results for any model tested, the methodology works, and could likely be applied to human minds.

Things like SAEs and golden gate claude might only be hyperspecific investigations of how models work with this particular type of architecture.<p>All of that to say, we might only ever get to a &quot;pale gray box&quot; level of understanding of some types of model, and never, in principle, to a perfectly understood intelligent system, especially if AI reaches the point of recursive self improvement.</div><br/><div id="42691896" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42691896" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kbelder</span><span>|</span><a href="#42684926">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42686753">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42684989">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42691896">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42691896">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One important point  (I think) is whether the cause or outcome of the box can be understood or predicted without full emulation of the entire box.

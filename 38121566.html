For full context it&#x27;s good to get a picture of the philosophical movement around him during his era which was attacking rationalism and promoting a sort of extereme form of empiricism.<p>(Ie science and the visible world being all that exist, and rational concepts like numbers or math is just an extrapolation from the material world.)<p>Kant sort of puts that idea to rest somewhat (although it remained popular well into the 20th century).<p>But the way he did so was unsettling.  The conclusion we are left with after reading this is there is a sort of human perspective that shapes our understanding of reality and there is an underlying reality apart from that which we can never know.<p>I don&#x27;t like it, I think when Einstein or Newton make statements they are making statements about reality and not just sense impressions.  I don&#x27;t like the idea that reality is something foreign and unknowable to humans.<p>Maybe time isn&#x27;t real in the way we perceive it but I don&#x27;t think the underlying nature of time is something undiscoverable.<p>What&#x27;s my reasoning.  I don&#x27;t know I just don&#x27;t like the idea I guess.  Plus I don&#x27;t think the attack on rationalism and reason was as warranted as it may have seemed to Kant in his time.</div><br/><div id="38156851" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38156851" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ThinkBeat</span><span>|</span><a href="#38156331">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38156796">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38156851">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38156851">[22 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You know that how you experience the world

So, yes, Einstein and Newton made statements about reality. And, yes, all of reality is (theoretically) knowable to humans (including the nature of time). But maybe there&#x27;s something beyond reality itself? (Or maybe not!) Newton proved that we can understand gravity. Einstein proved that we can understand electrodynamics. Kant proved that we cannot understand god(s) (including whether or not god(s) exist(s)), because god(s) is by definition beyond reality, beyond space &#x2F; time, beyond the observable universe.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38157178" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38157178" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dakiol</span><span>|</span><a href="#38156331">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38158173">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38158063">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38157178">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38157178">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Maybe time isn&#x27;t real in the way we perceive it but I don&#x27;t think the underlying nature of time is something undiscoverable.<p>My take is: humans are just another living thing.

We cannot &quot;get outside&quot; our own minds to know anything else, but there must be <i>something</i> beyond our perceptions, which Kant variously calls noumena, things-in-themselves, or transcendental object=X (there are minor differences between these notions that I cannot recall). Here IIRC his language kind of unfortunately but necessarily breaks down into metaphor. He can&#x27;t quite say that the noumena are the <i>source</i> of phenomena since that would imply a causal relationship, and he&#x27;s just argued that cause is a structure of the human mind.<p>Considering the &quot;perspectives&quot; you mention, e.g. that of the flat earther - a perspective is not a perception, nor is it a judgement, and it is these that Kant is primarily concerned with in the 1st critique. I&#x27;d say a perspective is more like an agglomeration of more or less (but not necessarily) coherent and self-reinforcing beliefs, attitudes and probably even non-propositional content like dispositions. Kant didn&#x27;t have much to say specifically about that in any of his major writings that I can recall (maybe in the lectures on anthropology).<p>But his entire life work was devoted to how we can provide a solid foundation for claims of knowledge, morality, and aesthetics, so to say that &quot;Nobody, ultimately, has any right to pronounce objective truths on anything&quot; would quite a misinterpretation. You could argue &quot;well but it isn&#x27;t objective knowledge since the noumena are the real objects&quot; but that would be begging the question against him, his whole argument is that concepts like &quot;object&quot; are part of the structure of our mind.

Most famous scientists historically believed themselves to be looking for a divinely-organized system, and it’s unclear to me if they would have even <i>looked in the first place</i> without that underlying belief structure. You could go back even further and say all scientific inquiry basically rests on a conceptual distinction between Self and World, which is very much a trait of Monotheism.<p>I think philosophical insights could roughly be described as a mix of human biological realities (which haven’t <i>really</i> changed, ever) interacting with historical and technological events - and progressing over time in response to those events. Kant, for example, is mostly talking about things that are essentially fundamental to the human experience, even if he was in dialogue with the ideas that were popular in his time. People have argued against Kant, but I don’t think we can really “surpass” the kind of problem he’s investigating in the way you might think we have surpassed an outdated theory of physics.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Structure_of_Scientific_Re...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="38158606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38158606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">woodruffw</span><span>|</span><a href="#38158509">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38159778">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38158584">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38158606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38158606">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Flippantly: science accretes ideas, while philosophy sheds them.

It&#x27;s too bad they didn&#x27;t mention Kant&#x27;s Copernican turn. Mentioning that would have been quite revealing.<p>4. This may have been too complex for such a short summary, but Kant&#x27;s Synthetic Unity of Apperception is extremely important.</div><br/><div id="38156535" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38156535" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Notatheist</span><span>|</span><a href="#38155832">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38155873">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38156535">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38156535">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You want an article that takes 5 minutes to read to define &quot;truth&quot;?

To paraphrase Chomsky: Hume and other so-called empiricists did not actually believe in tabula rasa because they were not imbeciles. Hume wrote an entire chapter on how humans have instincts which determine how we think, just like animals do, for instance.<p>Kant actually said very little about epistemology that Hume didn&#x27;t say better. They were both cool, but since everyone wants to hype the beef, Hume -- who never got a chance to defend himself against this &quot;rationalist vs empiricist&quot; false dichotomy -- was cooler. I would encourage anyone and everyone to read his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding.</div><br/><div id="38159423" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38159423" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">brudgers</span><span>|</span><a href="#38159165">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38158285">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38159423">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38159423">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I like Hume.<p>I like Kant.<p>I recommend Wittgenstein.<p>And Hobbes.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

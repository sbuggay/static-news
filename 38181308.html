With a sufficiently high carbon tax, for instance, e-Fuels could be cheaper to end users than fossil fuels.<p>I think it&#x27;s an interesting technology for space exploitation in that the factory of a space colony has to produce all sort of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and similar organic compounds to support biology <i>and</i> technology.<p>Some asteroids contain huge amounts of &quot;coal&quot; and carbonates and also water and silicates and it would need some system to turn the coal into organic chemicals (like 20 billion kg of Kapton plastic film for solar sails,  sun shades,  stuff like that)  They would never dispose of waste CO2 because it so precious and certainly they have a system that recycles the carbon...

While the color temperature (hence theoretical limit) of sunlight is a blistering 5000 K, real concentrators achieve much less. For practical purposes they are divided into two categories:<p>- <i>single-stage</i> concentrators, which employ a single heliostat (array of mirrors) or parabolic trough to focus sunlight onto a collector;<p>- <i>double-stage</i> concentrators, which use a <i>second</i> mirror to achieve very high temperatures.<p>The largest double-stage concentrator ever built is the Odellio solar furnace operating at just one megawatt:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Odeillo_solar_furnace" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Odeillo_solar_furnace</a><p>For practical purposes in the foreseeable future, single-stage concentrators are <i>the</i> technology of interest, currently representing around 7 GWp of installed capacity around the world and growing rapidly. These reach a maximum temperature of about 550 C, which is just barely enough to run the copper-chlorine cycle, but not many of the more fanciful solar fuel cycles. Some single-stage &quot;dish&quot; systems reach 750 C at much smaller sizes (the startup that was selling this pivoted to batteries [1]). Some research has proposed ways to boost power tower temperatures to as high as 800 C [2].<p>But 1500 C? In a single-stage system? It would require a level of accuracy that just isn&#x27;t available. Such a system requires a solar concentration ratio of around 2500 suns [3]. This is extraordinarily difficult, because the sun subtends a finite angle for an Earth observer and hence reflects off a mirror with a significant divergence; furthermore an ideal reflector is not planar but slightly curved, and every mirror on a flat field would be curved slightly differently, creating impossibly difficult manufacturing issues. Real-world systems hover around 500 suns, with 1000 suns being a commonly stated practical limit [4].<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;TEXEL" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;TEXEL</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asmedigitalcollection.asme.org&#x2F;solarenergyengineering&#x2F;article-abstract&#x2F;129&#x2F;2&#x2F;141&#x2F;459741&#x2F;High-Temperature-Liquid-Fluoride-Salt-Closed" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asmedigitalcollection.asme.org&#x2F;solarenergyengineerin...</a><p>3: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opg.optica.org&#x2F;oe&#x2F;fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-24-14-A985&amp;id=340823" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opg.optica.org&#x2F;oe&#x2F;fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-24-14-A985&amp;id=...</a> (See Figure 4)<p>4: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0038092X20305867#b0145" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0038092X2...</a> (Some thermal efficiencies in Figure 13; cost figures are, in my view, <i>highly</i> optimistic)</div><br/><div id="38186983" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38186983" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kragen</span><span>|</span><a href="#38183894">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38185421">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38182113">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38186983">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38186983">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">you can heat a heating element with solar panels. nichrome can&#x27;t handle 1500° but zirconia or carborundum can, and maybe some grades of kanthal<p>or you could heat the reactor with microwaves<p>of course that&#x27;s not what the paper proposes, and it requires using five times as much land, but it is eminently practical and quite cheap. i&#x27;m not sure why anyone builds csp anymore</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38182113" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38182113" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PaulHoule</span><span>|</span><a href="#38183894">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38185834">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38182113">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38182113">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Note &quot;Ceria&quot; is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cerium(IV)_oxide" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cerium(IV)_oxide</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="38185834" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38185834" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">spandextwins</span><span>|</span><a href="#38182113">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38183617">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38185834">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38185834">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Plant a tree.

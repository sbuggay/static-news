His relentless pursuit of &#x27;vérité&#x27; drove his to some obsessive extremes.<p>- As a youngish man, he married a worn-out, alcoholic, middle-aged prostitute. It was she that likely gave him syphilis that in the end drove him insane. She eventually committed suicide.<p>- He was rejected from the priesthood for being a zealot.<p>- He started a simultaneous translation of the bible from Latin to English, German and French.<p>- On many occasions, attempting to create a spiritual union with the working class, he gave up his comfortable middle-class life to live a life of unreal austerity. This is where his painting &#x27;The Potato Eaters&#x27; comes from.<p>- Even his own father wanted to commit him to a lunatic asylum.<p>He was also, quite frankly, very poorly gifted as an artist. Doubt me? Check out this drawing done when he was 27 (my 19 yo students can draw better): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.incredibleart.org&#x2F;lessons&#x2F;drama&#x2F;carpenter.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.incredibleart.org&#x2F;lessons&#x2F;drama&#x2F;carpenter.jpg</a><p>However, he was also uniquely bloody-minded and eventually found his own way of doing things which was crafted from diverse sources (impressionism, Japanese wood block prints, Dutch genre painting etc). Contributing to this was the atelier system, which was an art school system located away from the establishment.<p>If he had been born post 1960, he would have been another GG Allin.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36255001" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36255001" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">prvc</span><span>|</span><a href="#36254961">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36254650">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36255001">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36255001">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;The film is comprised of over 65,000 frames entirely made up of oil paintings, with 12 individually painted frames appearing on screen per second. Considering that every brushstroke tells a story, it’s crazy to think that there are 898 shots — hence 898 oil paintings — in the hour-and-a-half long moving picture.<p>This leaves some uncertainty as to how many physical paintings were actually used as frames in the film. For what it&#x27;s worth, it seems like most frames were created digitally.</div><br/><div id="36255052" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36255052" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tybulewicz</span><span>|</span><a href="#36255001">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36254650">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36255052">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36255052">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If I recall correctly (from 2017 coverage), those paintings were painted over for each frame of the movie.<p>So those 898 oil paintings are with the final image of a given shot.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36254650" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36254650" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">iainmerrick</span><span>|</span><a href="#36255001">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36254687">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36254650">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36254650">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I saw this film at a cinema, but I have to say it’s quite disappointing.<p>It’s an impressive feat, yes, and at many points it looks really beautiful. But there are other points where the oil paintings are (understandably!) rushed, and the story is very thin.<p>Overall, I was far more impressed by “Across the Spider-Verse”. I’d be amazed if any animator can watch that and not think “Yes!! That’s it!

Visual arts should be ripe to similarly explode, with interactive content for VR headsets an emerging genre.<p>We could accelerate this evolution, by teaching artists the tools that are ready now.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

I&#x27;d say that painting is not difficult at all. Depending on your preferred style it can be as easy as literally throwing random pigments on whatever surface you prefer to target.<p>Painting (or drawing) to some degree of visual similarity requires practice, so some effort is needed. You have to &quot;rewire&quot; some muscle-vision-brain coordination. It will be perceived as hard only because a) you will know how easy it is to snap a photo and apply filters&#x2F;photoshop (or, propmt an AI), and b) because you will be your own worst critic. Others will see you progress quite fast if only you do the training part.<p>What is hard about it, really hard, is making a living from it. Or, even getting small change out of it. Most often, if you&#x27;ve not been to the right schools and intermingled with the right people in the right way at the right times (with an added very big portion of sheer luck) you are not going to make it, ever. Even then, it is unlikely. Regardless of your talent.<p>Talent does not bubble up like you would imagine. You can not just build a better mousetrap and they will come. This is a very controlled market, and also one where the different niches are working in very different ways. Even in very different ways from other markets you would know about.<p>It&#x27;s not sour grapes, it&#x27;s just a fact that for every art market niche there are only a very small amount of people able to gain a foothold while there are thousands or tens of thousands that may have an equal amount of skill&#x2F;talent but these people just does not make it.</div><br/><div id="38552361" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38552361" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yetanother12345</span><span>|</span><a href="#38552258">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38553087">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38552361">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38552361">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; not difficult at all<p>Replying to my own comment only to admit that it is fairly easy to give yourself a task  (ie. a problem to solve through the medium of painting) that will be perceived as hard, or even extremely hard. I do not negate the difficulty of solving creative puzzles.<p>You will experience that your ability to subject yourself to difficult problems will improve with time. That is, you will become better at what you do. This does not in any way correlate with creative style. There will be quite hard problems in non-figurative painting just like there will be in painting visually identifiable stuff.<p>The upside is that problems that were once considered complicated may not continue to be so. And, that you are your own employer, and you decide the when, how, or &quot;if at all&quot; of the solving.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38550521" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38550521" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Buttons840</span><span>|</span><a href="#38552258">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38550926">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38550521">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38550521">[22 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This seems to be about how making a living as a painter is difficult.<p>I&#x27;ve often thought that drawing or painting is difficult for ego reasons.

That is, you have to recall what a struggle it was to hold the pencil and make a steady mark from the wrist...and then apply that to the kinds of marks you make for drawing, which can be longer, more varied, and use a different grasp on the tool.<p>And then you also have to learn some &quot;shape literacy&quot; if you want to control how you see things. This is likewise comparable to learning to read in that there are ways of breaking down images to understand them as &quot;letter&quot;, &quot;word&quot;, and &quot;sentence&quot;.<p>When we know how to write but not to draw, we draw like we write, using motions from the wrist and observing things in terms of symbolic meaning - the human figure flattens out into a hand shape, an arm shape, an eye shape.<p>But there&#x27;s very little mystery to &quot;what do you do about that&quot; - you grab a book of exercises like Keys to Drawing or Natural Way to Draw, and you try to see the object you want to study through the exercise. Because we recognize silhouettes first, and we make marks as lines first, contour drawing is a typical starting point for practicing both &quot;seeing&quot; and &quot;doing&quot;, and that&#x27;s something you can spend many months on just by itself.<p>If you want to force a designed result, rather than the result from your eye and hand, you start to apply technology, and that can mean a very old technology like using a grid and rulers(as old as the ancient Egyptians), or it can mean digital tools and tracing over photos.</div><br/><div id="38551818" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38551818" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tmountain</span><span>|</span><a href="#38550521">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38550813">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38551546">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38551818">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38551818">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is accurate.

One of the useful &#x27;results&#x27; from decades of R&amp;D at trying to build machines (&amp;&#x2F; &quot;software&quot; - may be considered another type of machine) has been &#x27;seeing&#x27; the difficulty <i>in practice</i> at achieving capabilities <i>we</i> (and many other animals ... even, say, nematodes**) absolutely <i>take for granted.</i><p>One of the old jokes I always associate with Groucho Marx is something like:<p>&quot;Can you play the piano?&quot; ... &quot;I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;ve never tried&quot;<p>It reminds me of how people often say &quot;foreign languages are difficult&quot; ... As though any &quot;native language&quot; is somehow different &#x2F; easy &#x2F; easier ... Entirely neglecting the tens of thousands of hours of experience and practice most people have with some &quot;native language&quot; by the time they&#x27;re a mere 10 years old. AND, we all continue to &quot;practice&quot; whatever language we speak and think (to some degree) in <i>every hour of every day.</i><p>It&#x27;s all in what you put your time into, as you get at, as well. And, one particularly crucial aspect is what you believe about how skill &quot;arises&quot; which you reference as well. One of the greatest disservices to (young, especially) people is inculcating them with the idea of &quot;talent.&quot; While most people are not likely capable of becoming, say, the top tennis player (male &#x2F; female) in the world - there are all sorts of variables - too often people are artificially limited by nonsense that passes as &quot;common wisdom&quot; and permeates &quot;culture&quot; (ideas that just propagate from some people to others - here, especially, parents to children).<p>It&#x27;s interesting, to me, that while my mom, for example, was an incredible &quot;believer&quot; in education, and had defied her own parents and exceeded the role(s) they envisioned for her by many orders of magnitude, she also would often reference &quot;talent&quot; in various contexts when I was growing up.<p>We are riddled with nonsense - in our heads. I know for sure that I&#x27;ll always be full of internal inconsistencies and false beliefs and the like. But, it is very helpful to escape as many of them as possible.

I DeepL-translated (with rough editing) a couple of excerpts from interviews he has given.<p>First excerpt:<p>Q: How is your inner self-critic working, are you satisfied with the results of your work?<p>PP: Yeah, I think I&#x27;m a very good drawer. One of the best.<p>Q: How long do you estimate the <i>mileage of your line</i> at the moment?<p>PP: For &quot;Gabriella&quot;, I tried to calculate how many final frames I drew, about 10 000 to 15 000, 50 cm of line for one frame, so five to seven kilometres for one film. It&#x27;s the kind of consistent drawing neccessary for an animator to keep his hands in. A beginner animator who is at the beginning of the road with the search for their own line and is making a film is forced to draw hundreds or thousands of drawings with the same rudimentary line. A cartoonist is not limited by his own predetermined rules, he can experiment and search. In most cases, one has reached a line of one&#x27;s own by the age of about 35.<p>---<p>Another excerpt from another interview (rough translation again):<p>&quot;It has come with decades that you can draw without any preparation in all sorts of angles and dynamic positions. And it also emerges from somewhere that you can draw in whichever way you want, but it&#x27;s still your drawing. This requires a very high degree of <i>thoughtful line mileage</i>, which means you have to think while you&#x27;re at a line.&quot;<p>(Priit Pärn is actually a trained biologist, so his way of reasoning is always very precise and synthetic, clearly influenced by an education in the natural sciences. Always a joy to read his interviews.

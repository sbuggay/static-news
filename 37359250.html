Your reward was the win and that gives you all the peace of mind needed for this.<p>When you&#x27;re the average or below average (C or D lanes) it&#x27;s just as easy to be nice. Being far from the top means the competitive pressure is not as taxing and maybe even the effort is lower. In those lanes if you feel the pressure to be the best you can either become the best (winning is the reward), or learn to deal with it and &quot;take it easy&quot; (playing the game is the reward), or since you&#x27;re pretty far from the top you can give up to relieve the pressure (not feeling the pressure is the reward).<p>But the B lane can be a bit of hell. You are competitive, you are so close to the top, and yet so far. Becoming the best is hard, giving up is just as hard, and learning to live with this &quot;close but no cigar&quot; situation is hard. Second best is the worst place to be. Almost all of the effort and qualifications, sometimes even more, none of the laurels. The most frustrating position. Nobody remembers the second best. All that might build up to a less than pleasant attitude.<p>Once you see it you recognize it all over the place. The player from the winning team offers to help his opponent up but never the other way around. The second best student is always far less happy than the one who just passed by the skin of their teeth. The candidate who won an election shakes his opponent&#x27;s hand while the opponent is broken.</div><br/><div id="37366172" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37366172" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">23090jfd</span><span>|</span><a href="#37365975">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37367219">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37366172">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37366172">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I guess I&#x27;ll be honest with myself and say I&#x27;m probably the equivalent of the B lane swimmer in a certain area. Some might say I&#x27;m A but maybe there&#x27;s always an A lane where you&#x27;re B? I guess it depends on your goals; most of life isn&#x27;t reduced to a single clear metric like speed.<p>One of the things I find frustrating in this particular area — and maybe not all areas are like this — is how much things like luck and questionable ethics separates A from B. I don&#x27;t mean to suggest all of it is like that, or that A people are all unethical people who stumbled on their fortune by chance, but a lot of the differences between A and B that I see are due to things like B people being especially unlucky at where they landed their first job, or A people being especially lucky, or A people in fact being pretty ethically sketchy or outright corrupt about certain things. So I tend to get especially angry when I see these relatively big consequences from differences that don&#x27;t really matter, or the differences aren&#x27;t actually present, or people in the area professionally pretend all this stuff isn&#x27;t going even though everyone wholly acknowledges in private it is.<p>So the more I think about it, the more I&#x27;m not really sure the swimming analogy is entirely apt. There you have a pretty clear criterion, and it&#x27;s all about what lane you&#x27;re in. In life, the criteria might differ from person to person, the lanes come with major consequences, and there&#x27;s plenty of chances to game the criteria where they do exist. It&#x27;s like if which lane you were in was determined by a lifeguard with a timer, but the swimming time differences between lanes were smaller than the error tolerance of the timing devices, and a majority of swimmers (but not all) were bribing the lifeguards for lanes.<p>The way in which the comparison is apt is that as you get &quot;up&quot; the lanes, the more and more stressful it gets, until you cash out or get a secure position or whatever, when it becomes worth it, whatever &quot;it&quot; is. So you&#x27;re sensitive to BS until it doesn&#x27;t matter because you&#x27;ve already got yours. As you go down, you&#x27;re surrounded by people who don&#x27;t really give a damn about trying to go up, it&#x27;s just not a concern of theirs. So superficially the pattern of stress is probably similar. But in general, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really the same processes causing that stress.</div><br/><div id="37367197" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37367197" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">taneq</span><span>|</span><a href="#37365975">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37366172">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37366372">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37367197">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37367197">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In my experience, something that really separates “A players” (in the career sense, rather than technical skills) from “B players” is focus on the metagame.

Unhappy, but intensely dedicated to the technical details of the job and they become a keystone of the team, doing some of the most difficult architectural work because they&#x27;re the only ones who dedicate the mental space to know it all.

But there&#x27;s also no testing at many of their races so they can get away with the PED use.<p>No one is really sure what to do because these dedicated semi-pros pay lots of fees to support the races. If they&#x27;re a bit strict on PED use, the registrations could really drop off. But on the flip side, the PED use drives away others who are competing fairly but just not ready to submit their body to all of those extra chemicals.</div><br/><div id="37366308" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37366308" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jerrygenser</span><span>|</span><a href="#37365703">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37366971">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37366308">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37366308">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">All (or nearly all) of the top pros were using PED for a number of years.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37366971" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37366971" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bsder</span><span>|</span><a href="#37365703">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37366308">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37366513">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37366971">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37366971">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s the same the whole way down in high schools for things like football.<p>I was big and for my age--I was over 6&quot; by the time I was in 8th grade and could pull a 200lb stack on a lat pulldown exercise.<p>Some dudes who were middling 5 foot would come back <i>absolutely jacked</i> after a summer.

I was thinking about the *Gervais* &quot;psychopath, confused, losers&quot; framework that largely makes sense to me, and how the lanes would map. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s 1:1, as in the psychopaths are notionally the A-laners but they can still be insecure and jerks. The confused are probably the B-laners, though it&#x27;s not clear they&#x27;re all petty little men.

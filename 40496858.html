Either they are code heavy, plugins are out of date, maintenance takes a lot of time or there is no way to easily design a page.<p>So for Wordpress I bought Oxygen, for which you can still buy a lifetime license for, and oh my god, even I can make a nice, responsive website without touching code. It&#x27;s such a game changer.<p>I think lots of people avoid wordpress because of security. But that is not primarily a wordpress fault. Linux &amp; PHP complicates it a lot. And I&#x27;m sure those other open source projects have severe bugs, too, but nobody knows or talks about them.<p>What could bring down wordpress, imho, are expensive license fees for plugins. Who wants to spend 50 to 100 bucks per year and per page for a builder plugin? Everyone wants one, but no one wants to pay yearly. And it seems that all plugin makers are starting to go that way.</div><br/><div id="40497972" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40497972" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throw5345346</span><span>|</span><a href="#40497559">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40498049">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40497972">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40497972">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree about builder plugins -- they are expensive mossy lock-in.<p>WordPress now has a full-site editing system that lets you GUI edit the templates that are in the normal flow.

But IMO until there are really easy to use themes based around FSE (there may be some), small design shops are still likely to use Elementor, which is a slow, frustrating experience (slower and more frustrating than Squarespace can be)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40498049" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40498049" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">karolist</span><span>|</span><a href="#40497559">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40497867">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40498049">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40498049">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My gf has a WP ecommerce site that her business revolves around, it was built buy some local guys doing WP development who have an agency solving problems just with WP. She told me how fast they were able to iterate and solve all their problems. The site has a bunch of plugins integrating various social services, ad tracking, SEO and whatnot.<p>The site generates PDF shipment labels for parcels, one day her sales got high enough to buy a label printer, one that spits out 10x15cm stickers. The problem - PDFs from the site come out as A4 and text gets tiny if squeezed to fit into that sticker. She asked her developers to fix it, they said it&#x27;s impossible and refused. Now that&#x27;s interesting, nothing is impossible I shouted with my nerd hat on. I&#x27;m in the tech space for a good few decades now, I have FAANG experience, complex systems are my thing!<p>I spent 5 hours diving through tons of spaghetti code plugins masquerading as highly abstracted set of interfaces to arrive at the conclusion that these guys were right, the PDF blob comes from the shipment company&#x27;s SOAP API, though it&#x27;s obfuscated deep enough. In the end I solved it with a simple PyQT+fPDF UI utility to crop out the printable parts and project them onto the right sized canvas for printing, it took me 2h to complete with binary packaging and all, less time than it took to understand why the WordPress site can&#x27;t do it natively, and much less than than it would have taken me to integrate this PDF modification into WordPress. These guys were basically right.<p>Her site now backs up to 4GB zip with photo assets. I dread the day when her site goes down due to some &quot;hack&quot; but I have no idea how to replicate this functionality for this cost without WP. No way in hell I would say I can do it from scratch for her, my previous Web dev experience doesn&#x27;t matter at this point. Shopify?

Are you seriously telling me software performance should not improved if the core functionality kinda, sorta, works?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40498284" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40498284" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throw5345346</span><span>|</span><a href="#40497096">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40497692">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40497848">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40497260">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40498284">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40498284">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Wordpress requires at least PHP 7.0... and will complain about it if it&#x27;s not above 7.4 (which was released in 2019).<p>So this to me looks like WP is progressing with PHP, just slowly.<p>Frankly I don&#x27;t have a massive problem with this.<p>The speed of Laravel&#x27;s PHP baseline change may be appropriate for Laravel, because it is git-managed, more easily run in a container etc., but it&#x27;s absolutely inappropriate for WordPress to chase the edge.<p>Compared to trying to stay up-to-date with needless Node.js changes and frameworks that get EOL&#x27;d as soon as there&#x27;s something more fun to play with, it&#x27;s a paradise.<p>Why don&#x27;t people build things with a decade of life in mind?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40497260" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40497260" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hollerith</span><span>|</span><a href="#40497096">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40497692">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40498447">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40497260">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40497260">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Isn&#x27;t the fact that people started using WP about 25 years ago evidence against &quot;you can always make it better&quot;?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40498447" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40498447" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">skibz</span><span>|</span><a href="#40497096">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40497281">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40498447">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40498447">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Kudos, WordPress.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40497281" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40497281" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tommica</span><span>|</span><a href="#40498447">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40498500">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40497281">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40497281">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">WordPress is special - though I don&#x27;t work with it anymore, I have enjoyed seeing newer developers solve problems with it</div><br/></div></div><div id="40498500" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40498500" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">modernerd</span><span>|</span><a href="#40497281">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40498704">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40498500">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40498500">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">21! At this point WP is “boring technology” which makes it a great choice for many sites. It still does much that&#x27;s hard to get anywhere else:<p>- The core update process. It&#x27;s long been one-click. Almost no other CMS or self-hosted framework offers as smooth an update process. (With Laravel, for example, I end up paying for Laravel Shift and even then it requires manual intervention that would be hard for a non-dev to handle.) For WP, services now exist to do automated updates with health checks and rollbacks to counter potential plugin incompatibility[1].<p>- The plugin ecosystem. WP went from &quot;democratizing publishing&quot; to &quot;democratizing user-owned sites and businesses&quot;. From learning management systems to stores to paid newsletters, it&#x27;s pretty cool what people with no programming experience can spin up.<p>Things I&#x27;d love to see for WP in the next 21 years (that we&#x27;ll probably get sooner if enough people contribute):<p>- Built-in multilingual support. The web is global but WP isn&#x27;t really, yet, except via third-party plugins. It&#x27;s on the roadmap[2] but it&#x27;s been a long time coming.<p>- Improved education around Full Site Editing (FSE) and the new editor. The tools are getting good now, but there&#x27;s still an education gap. Lots of people are helping to close this, though. Jamie Marsland&#x27;s YouTube videos do a great job of showing what&#x27;s possible with FSE, for example. [3]<p>- Background batch processing&#x2F;queues. These are only available via third-party solutions (and bundled with things like WooCommerce), but should probably be built into core.<p>- SQLite support. Already pretty good but not officially supported in core yet.<p>- Built-in site migrations. Also on the roadmap.[4]<p>- Enhanced Playground tech. Distributing WP as a single binary for dependency-free local development (i.e. without Node.js) feels achievable and worthwhile.<p>- Version control. It&#x27;s too hard to store a WP site&#x27;s state in a git repo and keep that synced with production and staging environments, especially when those with admin access can install and upgrade plugins independently of the repo.<p>[1] Like Automattic&#x27;s own scheduled updater on WP.com  (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wordpress.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;05&#x2F;20&#x2F;scheduled-plugin-updates&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wordpress.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2024&#x2F;05&#x2F;20&#x2F;scheduled-plugin-updat...</a>) and WP Engine&#x27;s Smart Plugin Manager (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wpengine.com&#x2F;smart-plugin-manager&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wpengine.com&#x2F;smart-plugin-manager&#x2F;</a>).<p>[2] Current state of multilingual sites in WP: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.wordpress.org&#x2F;advanced-administration&#x2F;wordpress&#x2F;multilingual&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.wordpress.org&#x2F;advanced-administration&#x2F;word...</a><p>[3] I like Jamie&#x27;s videos showing how to recreate famous layouts with FSE: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=WrdXCSIP578" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=WrdXCSIP578</a><p>[4] Site Transfer Protocol: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;core.trac.wordpress.org&#x2F;ticket&#x2F;60375" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;core.trac.wordpress.org&#x2F;ticket&#x2F;60375</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40498704" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40498704" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Pikamander2</span><span>|</span><a href="#40498500">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40497583">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40498704">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40498704">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">WordPress is simultaneously amazing and terrible. At its best, it&#x27;s a highly extensible free and open source CMS that&#x27;s incredibly easy to set up and customize. For that matter, its core has reasonably good security and performance before third-party themes and plugins are added into the mix.<p>The problem comes in with how many basic GUI-based features it&#x27;s still missing out of the box 21 years later. Take, for example, the curious case of the lack of post cloning; Why is there still no &quot;Duplicate Post&quot; button in the core after 21 years? Why are over 4 million websites being forced to keep a third-party &quot;Yoast Duplicate Post&quot; plugin active in order to access a very basic CMS feature? The same goes for other GUI-based tasks like logging outgoing emails (WP Mail Logging), or viewing the scheduled cron jobs (WP Crontrol), or letting an admin temporarily switch to another user&#x27;s account (User Switching), or downloading a one-click backup of the site regardless of host (All In One WP Migration), or managing the SMTP settings (FluentSMTP), or managing URL redirects (Redirection), or enabling SVG uploads (SVG Support).<p>The fact that many of those tasks can be accomplished through small code snippets in the child theme is great and all, but that doesn&#x27;t help the average WordPress site owner who is barely tech literate and would be more likely to break the site than successfully copy a hook over to the correct file. It&#x27;s not uncommon to find WordPress sites with 50+ plugins installed, a good chunk of which are abandoned and have multiple code vulnerabilities, yet still find the time to clog up the dashboard with useless &quot;notices&quot;, AKA advertisements for their other products.<p>I could understand a lot of the missing functionality if WordPress was still a small FOSS project with no real funding and a few irregular volunteers, but the fact that&#x27;s it&#x27;s grown into what it is without any real plan to address those issues is just so frustrating. I&#x27;ve made a few small contributions to the core and read through a bunch of tickets for longstanding issues, and it&#x27;s clear that time or funding aren&#x27;t the problem; it&#x27;s that the maintainers have an attitude of &quot;We don&#x27;t personally need that feature ourselves, therefore it can just be a third-party plugin&quot;, which might sound fine on paper, but...<p>Ever clicked on a Google link, only to catch a quick glimpse of the real site before being redirected to an &quot;UPDATE CHROME NOW&quot; or &quot;CRITICAL MICROSOFT ALERT&quot; or &quot;CHEAP PHARMA PILLS&quot; website? There&#x27;s a 99% chance that site is running WordPress and has dozens of plugins and got hacked at some point, and if you try to message the site&#x27;s owner to tell them what&#x27;s happening and how they can fix it, they&#x27;ll think you&#x27;re crazy or a scammer and leave the malware there because it intentionally hides itself to logged in users. I&#x27;m not exaggerating about that percentage, either; WordPress runs a massive chunk of the modern web (excluding major social media websites), and the failure to quash the need for so many common plugins has made them a goldmine for bad actors to inject redirects and SEO spam.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40497583" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40497583" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zwaps</span><span>|</span><a href="#40498704">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40497583">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40497583">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&lt;&lt; Static websites are fine, but dynamic ones are better.&gt;&gt;<p>Nah</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

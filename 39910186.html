Thank goodness. It can&#x27;t possibly be the case that when men do the same it&#x27;s somehow with the same goal of trying to be useful; no, it must be that they are trying to &quot;&#x27;interpret&#x27; women&#x27;s stories&quot;.<p>Look, I&#x27;m an immigrant queer disabled man, and if all I did was listening to what other immigrant queer disabled men had to say and looked down on input from other people my information bubble would be very small indeed.<p>Fortunately, most people are willing to listen to all sorts of other people and judge what they have to say fot what it is, not based on some labels we assigned to the source. And conversely, when the information they have provided falls below our standards, we should place the blame on the individual rather than the collective that we think they belong to.</div><br/><div id="39914884" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39914884" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RoyalHenOil</span><span>|</span><a href="#39914790">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39914934">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39914884">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39914884">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a heterosexual immigrant woman, the two people in the world who understand me best are men.

It&#x27;s a generally accepted pillar of modern feminism.<p>Something bubbled up on StalkedIn a couple days back: it had images of King Charles III and Ozzy Osbourne, and it said both were white, male, British, born in 1948, married twice, and on and so forth. And it said &quot;A customer is not their demographics. A customer is their individual goals and needs&quot; or something like that. Which, while still laden with business-speak, was something of a contrarian take in today&#x27;s DEI-mediated world. You gotta be careful with this intersectionality stuff. The endgame of intersectionality is -- gasp -- considering people as <i>individuals</i>.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39914963" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39914963" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blueflow</span><span>|</span><a href="#39914790">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39914580">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39914963">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39914963">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Keep in mind that masculinity and femininity are constructed - they only exist because some properties associated with each other.

The New York times, for his obiturary, wrote that Bly &quot;started a controversial men’s movement with a best seller that called for a restoration of primal male audacity.&quot; Which underlines why most men don&#x27;t want to do it and why actually it is better if women lead this study at this current time: even if your intentions are good, your statements may be misjudged by some. In Bly&#x27;s case, it was misjudged by some anti-feminists to launch some actual misogynistic countercultures and misjudged by some feminists to blame Bly for some of this and prior misogyny.<p>Anyways, a round about way to say thank you, Dr. Sharon Blackie for writing this.

I find it somewhat lamentable (although perhaps more enviable) how gay men are able to more openly discuss with one another what it means to be a man (because the biggest thing they need to grapple with is this gender norm that to &quot;be a man&quot; means having sex with women), but even they risk charges of misogyny and a heterosexual man would have to be quite lucky to be invited to such a men&#x27;s group to be part of the discussions which I certainly feel is much more about grappling with the gender norm.<p>The problem here is that I can imagine Dr Blackie here might actually welcome with honest interest such an analysis by men. She certainly had only fair words for Robert Bly. But others would appear out of the woodwork to call such analysis some misogynistic manifesto. In some sense that should be expected, any good work should have breathless fans and seething critics. But the potential charge of misogyny is felt to carry too heavy a risk for most men nowadays.<p>I do not think the problem is that men are not women. Instead, there are some genuine jerks out there beating a war drum on the male identity. They create another nasty problem for the man who wants to honestly look at what it means to be a man because they create noise. The problem is that with this fear that men have, the only ones courageous enough to stand up and speak seem to be the jerks that don&#x27;t really offer much insight, or at least the men with insight get buried under that noise and the noise of charges of misogyny when their insight is misappropriated by actual misogynists.<p>There needs to be fear before there can be courage is how I see it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39914920" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39914920" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blueflow</span><span>|</span><a href="#39914580">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39910514">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39914920">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39914920">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">These are called tropes.

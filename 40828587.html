Pre-internet I&#x27;m not even sure how I&#x27;d be supposed to get my hands on things like the Hansard records.

It had nothing to do with them as a person, but I always had the feeling that they just did things at work without caring for the impact of it. 
The team and company grew in size over a period of 2 years and I went through a lot of first hand experiences of having to deal with unrealistic deadlines, chaotic lines of communication and multiple nights of tailing production logs to fix bugs. It was around this time, that the senior engineer during a company even got drunk and talked to me about their first few jobs.I realized that what they described, was quite similar to what I was facing right now and I came to understand why they cared so little about work they do on a daily basis.It honestly scared me at to think that I might either end up like this person or worse or burning out and quitting the field.<p>Right now, I am close to age the senior engineer was when I met them and even though I may selectively decide not to involve myself with things that can overstretch me, I am in no way the same as that other person.<p>The reason I am sharing this tangential story is to highlight my opinion about old age.

Having a good culture around replying people needing help in a timely fashion (instead of letting it slide for days) is important.<p>To me the only thing lost when WFH vs working in the office are the random conversations you eventually pick up when passing by the coffee machine, or water cooler, conversations about topics tangentially related to something you&#x27;re working on&#x2F;have worked on or know about and can easily chime in and help.<p>The culture of communication needs to change when people work remotely, that&#x27;s the main difference.

I&#x27;d prefer the office. I don&#x27;t need isolation all the time. But when I do, it is critical or I&#x27;m not getting any work done. It is already difficult enough with Slack and everything pinging me all the time, despite trying to minimize notifications I can receive (I&#x27;m religious about this). People @channel instead of @here, so even muted channels ping me. Every app has poor notifications that are &quot;get a billion pings&quot;, &quot;in theory this work, in practice you get the same&quot;, and &quot;no notifications.&quot; (seriously, how is this not solved?) I can&#x27;t do the latter or my boss gets mad, and the other two just ping me all day. It&#x27;s false positive overload.<p>At least in the office I can turn off all my notifications, turn my computer on focus mode, turn my music up, and rely on the fact that if someone really needs me, they&#x27;ll __knock on my door__ (or have someone do it for them). But many places have open floor plans or cubicles, and these are worse than slack. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the collaboration and I think being localized does help people work as a team. Whiteboard collaborations are an essential tool when working as a team. But at the same time, there are times where I need to just be left alone to get my work done. The door lets me clearly visually communicate this to my coworkers. So give me an office with a door (don&#x27;t cheat with a glass room) or send me home.

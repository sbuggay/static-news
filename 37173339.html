This group is probably shrinking—more and more people have smartphones and the remaining people who don&#x27;t have smartphones are probably also the people without bank accounts—but arguably you want to cater to this group, since they may already be a bigger target for scams.<p>2) They&#x27;re very appealing to opportunistic attackers.<p>3) They&#x27;re used by people in stressful or unusual circumstances, e.g., when traveling, if they need to make a large emergency payment, or if they&#x27;re afraid of being scammed.<p>4) Most sessions aren&#x27;t very long anyway: checking a balance, seeing whether your paycheck came in, making a single transfer or payment, etc. There are definitely exceptions—15-minute timeouts are very annoying when doing taxes, for example—but it seems like the annoyance in these situations is potentially worth the security benefits.<p>That being said, I don&#x27;t know if short session expiration is the <i>best</i> solution in 2023. As the article points out, major corporations like Google don&#x27;t use short sessions, even though their services are used for a variety of sensitive things and they&#x27;re huge targets. But as briHass pointed out in another comment,  they also provide tools to see which sessions are open and use a variety of techniques to detect sessions being misused. I suspect that&#x27;s the actual best solution if avoiding session stealing is that big of a concern.</div><br/><div id="37180829" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37180829" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ljm</span><span>|</span><a href="#37177869">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37180520">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37180829">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37180829">[32 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My main bank uses username + password + (random subset of ‘memorable word but actually unencrypted password’ driven by select boxes), then 2FA on top, and it literally feels like they just slapped a bunch of things together to add extra barriers to auth in sequence.<p>This is the UK.

OAuth 2.0 (on which OIDC is based) does define a reliable back channel for session revocation, although it is still pull-based instead of push-based. The scheme is simple:<p>1. Use short-lived access tokens (forcing clients to refresh often)<p>2. Check for revocation on every token refresh<p>There is even an OAuth 2.0 RFC for a token revocation API[1], and an Open ID Connect extension for backchannel logout[2]. Unfortunately, many OAuth 2 implementations (especially these were refresh tokens are JWT-based) do not support revocation of refresh tokens at all.<p>The other big problem is that refresh tokens are too often misunderstood. I&#x27;ve consulted quite a lot of development teams who implemented OAuth 2.0 (both as a client and an AS&#x2F;RS), and most of the developers did not initially understand what the refresh token is meant to do. This resulted in a lot of wrong implementations.<p>If I blame the standards for something, I&#x27;d blame them for being too complex and flexible. This goes without saying for SAML - nobody should be using that if they have any choice. But even simple OAuth 2.0 needs care. There are many RFCs out there, and if you just read the original RFC or one of the many low-quality guides on the interwebs, you probably would miss the point about how to properly use a refresh token. RFC 6749 subtly hints at this strategy I mentioned above, but never fleshes it out as a recommendation, let alone mandates it.<p>OpenID Connect is even worse. It introduces a new type of token (ID Token) that has unclear purpose and security, encourages JWT use without setting up a standard for revocation, reinforces the insecure implicit flow and introduces a whole new similarly-insecure flow that serves no purpose (the hybrid flow) which serves no purpose except for making sure there are more vulnerable apps out there.<p>Both OAuth 2.0 and OIDC can be implemented securely, but the base standards are not guiding you on how to do this, and - in the case of OIDC - contain way too many footguns. I think the OAuth 2.1[3] is a step in the right direction. GNAP[4] (a.k.a. &quot;OAuth 3.0&quot;, &quot;XYZ&quot;, &quot;TxAuth&quot;) looks to me like a step in the wrong direction (even more complexity), but perhaps it&#x27;s too early to tell.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oauth.net&#x2F;2&#x2F;token-revocation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oauth.net&#x2F;2&#x2F;token-revocation&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openid.net&#x2F;specs&#x2F;openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openid.net&#x2F;specs&#x2F;openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oauth.net&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oauth.net&#x2F;2.1&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oauth.net&#x2F;gnap&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oauth.net&#x2F;gnap&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37175281" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37175281" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">_tk_</span><span>|</span><a href="#37175611">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37177328">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37175281">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37175281">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hand waving away the threat of application use on shared devices seems a little over confident to me.

In this imaginary world, short sessions don’t help.”<p>One fact about security which you cannot avoid is that any one particular security feature may fail or be bypassed in some way. What are the consequences of this? Well, it means that you want multiple layers of security. Your server runs its daemons with minimal privileges so that a remote execution vulnerability needs to be combined with a privilege escalation vulnerability.

What are the real guidelines for telling when enough is enough? Because ime people who even <i>can</i> articulate anything along those lines are way, way fewer than people who make appeals to defense-in-depth.<p>And I think this is part of the problem: without a principled way to assess what is gratuitous, repeated appeals to defense-in-depth <i>will</i> lead to security practices that heavily favor having more measures in place over having a good UX. This is because the environments where information security is most valued are <i>already</i> organizations that frankly, do not give a shit about UX. The customers for cybersecurity products are massive bureaucracies: large enterprises, governments, and militaries. The vendors that sell those products are embedded in a broader market where <i>no</i> software really has to be usable, because there&#x27;s a fundamental disconnect between the purchasing decision and the use of the software. For <i>all</i> B2B software, the user is not the customer, and it shows in a thousand ways. In infosec things are further tilted in that lots of easy routes to compliance which are terrible for UX are falsely perceived and presented as strictly required, perhaps even by law.<p>The idea that in a B2B market which primarily serves large organizations and governments, you will get any organic weighing and balancing of security against usability &#x27;for free&#x27; is sheer fantasy.

I think your argument pretty much conveyed the same thing, along with a lot of anger and frustration.<p>I also agree with that anger and frustration— I&#x27;ve felt the same rage before, when I&#x27;ve been hit with blockers or UX degradation related to nominal or actual attempts to improve security. Restrictions that are ill-motivated (or whose motivations are just not clearly or convincingly communicated) are infuriating.<p>&gt; by the time the organization realizes the harm, it&#x27;s often too late to change.<p>This worry is the twin of the rage, for me, this sense that I can&#x27;t do anything about it and it&#x27;s never going to get better. A dreadful, reluctant admission to myself that the only way to stop the continual degradation of my work life will be to uproot myself: give up my job and everything I <i>do</i> like about it, leaving behind people I enjoy working with and reducing the amount of contact I have with them.<p>Happily, engaging directly with my company&#x27;s infosec department directly often gives me hope and allays these fears somewhat. But generally, online discussion with people who implement security controls tends to reinforce my worry that, to borrow your metaphor, the disease is systemic and terminal.<p>Most &#x27;cybersecurity professionals&#x27; (who are visible online, at least) transparently do not give a shit about UX, display flagrantly antagonistic attitudes about users and developers, and talk often about defense-in-depth but never articulate any inherent limits for appeals to defense-in-depth beyond &#x27;well don&#x27;t bother with measures that don&#x27;t increase security at all&#x27;. All of it sends strong signals that people who value UX, DX, autonomy, morale, and well-being, to the extent they are present at all, are outliers in infosec who do not belong and have no hope of being effective.<p>And then the response to someone openly including a dimension of emotionality in an argument about a security measure they feel is gratuitous and cumbersome is<p>&gt; Did... did [a cumbersome security measure] hurt you?<p>Like, seriously? Yes. Indeed it did and does.<p>But more than the security measures themselves, the pervasive attitude conveyed by that belittling question is the even bigger problem.

Certainly, there are some cargo cult practices where various forms of &quot;key rotation&quot; has gotten out of hand for no real benefit. But there are many valid scenarios which depend on different overall system characteristics. I&#x27;ll just revisit a few.<p>1. Actual encryption key rotation. This is one grandparent of modern session limits, built with an assumption that keys might be compromised by cryptanalysis rather than stolen by malware-infected clients etc. Rotation reduces the number of ciphertext examples made available to perform the cryptanalysis, thereby reducing the risk of successful attacks. It also may reduce the scope of compromised data if and You may have a UX requirement for preventing idle sessions to stay open on clients because people are in a shared space with client devices, i.e. HIPAA touches on this for medical systems. only if key exchange is still considered secure, such that holding one key does not let you decode traffic captures to determine earlier&#x2F;later keys in a transitive attack.<p>2. Forcing idle logouts with less dependence on client systems. This is another grandparent of modern limits which is sometimes cargo-culted. The underlying risk is people logging in and then abandoning a terminal in a shared space, so you want to reduce the chance that someone else can walk up and start using it. You really want the client system to participate in this, i.e. not just end a session but lock&#x2F;clear the screen so previous data is not on display for unauthorized observers. But it is often seen as defense in depth to also abort the remote session credentials so that future actions are unauthorized even if the client software has failed to do its part, such as if it has crashed&#x2F;hanged. This one has the weakness you mention that a malicious client could do endless refresh to prevent the detection of an idle UX by the server.<p>3. Forcing reauthentication periodically or for high-value actions. This is more paranoid than the prior idle logout concept, and actually demands the user reestablish their authenticity during an active session. This has been used historically as another kind of defense in depth attempt to verify user presence with less trust of the client system. But it is also used as a UX ritual to try to get the user to pay attention as well as build an audit chain for their consent to a specific action. Designers might tie this in with MFA&#x2F;hardware tokens, to get different kinds of user-presence detection throughout a session.<p>4. Decentralized &quot;web-scale&quot; architecture and caching. In a traditional system, a session key is little more than an identifier and might be checked on each use, i.e. each web request, to determine actual client identity and privileges with a server-side lookup. But as people developed more distributed services, they have often shifted to embedding more of this info into the session &quot;key&quot; itself, as a larger signed blob. Different service components can decode and operate on this blob without having to do synchronous lookups in a centralized session database. This is where automatic refresh still serves a purpose, because it is during each refresh handshake that the centralized check can occur and potentially reject the refresh request or issue modified privileges. This rotation rate defines a system-wide guarantee for how long it takes certain changes to take effect, e.g. disabling a user account or changing the roles&#x2F;privileges assigned to a user. I have seen this approach even in systems where the session key is a mere ID and cache invalidation could arguably be handled in the backend without forcing client&#x27;s session keys to rotate. This seems like cargo culting, but is useful if the system operator wants to retain the option to use signed blobs in the future, and so does not want to allow client programmers to assume that client session keys are stable for indefinite time periods.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37176046" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37176046" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cogman10</span><span>|</span><a href="#37175324">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37175532">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37175770">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37176955">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37176046">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37176046">[16 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  A short compromised session is still a compromised session.

So an expired session is, at most, a small speed bump in those cases.<p>Or you are employing the common scam above, screen sharing under the guise of helping.<p>Granted, some of the calculus needs to be &quot;what type of app is this?  What does compromise mean?&quot;.<p>&gt; The most secure application runs completely isolated, with no input or output, and is totally, utterly useless. But no worries - it&#x27;s secure!<p>I didn&#x27;t take this as what the op was saying.<p>Security works in layers and good security imagines that other layers don&#x27;t exist or might have been compromised.

Fucking no one uses double hulls except for oil tankers, and they only do it for a <i>very</i> specific reason: They want to stop oil from leaking out.<p>They pay a <i>HUGE</i> cost for it, but it happens to be worth it for this very specific trade.  Here&#x27;s the tradeoff:<p>---<p>Double-hulled tankers have a more complex design and structure than their single-hulled counterparts, which means that they require more maintenance and care in operating, which if not subject to responsible monitoring and policing, may cause problems.[2] Double hulls often result in the weight of the hull increasing by at least 20%,[3] and because the steel weight of doubled-hulled tanks should not be greater than that of single-hulled ships, the individual hull walls are typically thinner and theoretically less resistant to wear. Double hulls by no means eliminate the possibility of the hulls breaking apart. Due to the air space between the hulls, there is also a potential problem with volatile gases seeping out through worn areas of the internal hull, increasing the risk of an explosion.[8]<p>---<p>&gt; The actual cost of doing this is generally developer time.<p>No - the actual costs are usually actual costs, paid by all members of the system.  Developer time is just the most obvious up front cost.  There is a cost every time a user has to re-authenticate.  There is a cost in resources to handle the extra authentications.  There is a cost in complexity to maintain and extend the system doing authentication.</div><br/><div id="37177397" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37177397" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">csydas</span><span>|</span><a href="#37175324">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37176325">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37178016">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37177397">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37177397">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;There is a cost every time a user has to re-authenticate.

Off the top of my head:<p>- MFA everywhere means that if you have any issues with your alternative authentication devices, you are completely locked out of your work and probably your life until you get that resolved<p>- broad and vague block geo-based block lists means users just flat out cannot access resources depending on where they happen to be, which means service desk tickets, investigations, and ultimately people who cannot access non-sensitive data they should be able to just because of where they are physically located<p>- CAPTCHAs can lock entire classes of persons out of specific services as the CAPTCHAs aren&#x27;t easy for these classes to perform on demand<p>- SSO&#x2F;SAML authentication pages take you on a whirlwind tour of dozens of randomly generated authentication pages meant to establish and pass your authentication back to a central location, and it makes it impossible to tell from the URLs themselves whether or not it&#x27;s suspicious or not unless you know the specifics of the system in use; this is particularly bad because this is exactly what it will look like if you click on a spam site in a search result or a compromised webpage. how is a user supposed to know when they&#x27;ve accidentally gotten tricked into a compromised authentication page? the uniquity of SSO for logins is nice, but it also means that as a user, I expect that I can be taken to an SSO from just about anything, so how am I supposed to know if the entry point from page X is legit compared to the entry point from page Y?<p>- a corollary to requiring multiple authentications even from the same device (looking at you Microsoft...) is it creates uncertainty as to when I should expect to have to sign in; if opening a link to a report requires me to authenticate or just accessing an internal web portal requires additional auth, why should I be suspicious when my colleague&#x27;s account gets compromised and an attacker sends me a link saying &quot;hey, we need to respond on this form by EOD; don&#x27;t have time to explain in full, but it&#x27;s pretty straight-forward. I&#x27;ll follow up in a few hours when I&#x27;m done with another item&quot;<p>- Edited: another corollary with SSO means that getting auth&#x27;d once means you get auth&#x27;d a lot.

Security is almost always user hostile (speaking from a UX perspective). I am NOT advocating that we remove security for obvious reasons (a hacked app is also user hostile). HOWEVER - if we can just acknowledge that security is antithetical to an easy to use, user friendly app then we can make appropriate decisions moving forward.<p>One of my favorite sayings is “if you are not careful, you are going to secure yourself right out of business”. Ease of use is a real thing, and if you don’t figure out a way to make a secure app that is also very easy to use, someone else will and your pleas of “but it is not secure” are going to fall on deaf ears.<p>Honestly, baseline security is part of “essential complexity” <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ferd.ca&#x2F;complexity-has-to-live-somewhere.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ferd.ca&#x2F;complexity-has-to-live-somewhere.html</a>. Essential complexity can’t be removed, but it CAN be moved around. Right now we are talking about the essential complexity of managing security through managing a user’s session length. The advocated solution is to make sessions short so that they expire quickly. This seems to remove all “accidental complexity” so that we are only dealing with the essential complexity. But this is misleading. There is still complexity in juggling those short sessions. As a designer you think this solution is simple, but what you have done is moved that essential complexity over to your users. THEY must now manage the impact of short sessions. The complexity does not go away, you just moved it to your users, hence it is user hostile.<p>The trick then, if making the best product is important to you, is to figure out a way of letting users have long sessions but managing it on your side. This seems to argue that you are making your system more complex by adding accidental complexity (which is generally a bad thing). But really what you are doing is moving some essential complexity away from your users onto you. You lower their burden.

At least in my experience - are there examples of quantitative security?<p>In some sense, the problem is that the goal is zero controls breaking, but of course, that also provides no information on security.  Intuitively, it would seem that parameterizing security (in a diagnostically useful way) would also require a number of quite different measures.  For instance, it matters who (how sophisticated and motivated) your attackers are.  And some of the parameterization would be based on use - every time you force someone to type a fixed password, that password is more exposed.  Combining all these quantities would just be Bayes-based.<p>I think an exercise like this could be instructive.  For instance, short sessions mean more authentications and both usability and failure modes.  But they also mean that an attacker would need to wait until the next session, or have a smaller chance of hitting a session.  Again, these are quantifiable, at least in rough terms.  And this kind of analysis does expose some additional questions: eg that short sessions make no sense without guaranteeing the security of the client system (ideally by reinstallation from known-good reference).<p>At least in my experience, &quot;security people&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="37177288" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37177288" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">marcus0x62</span><span>|</span><a href="#37175324">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37175624">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37178256">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37177499">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37177288">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37177288">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But, you need to make sure the extra controls are actually providing depth.<p>I think in some (very narrow) cases, short session times and aggressive reauth do add depth and can be an effective part of a security program.<p>But, all too often, defense in depth is used to mean:<p>* Vendors In Depth, whereby every security tool under the sun has to be deployed (or at least purchased) to achieve “security”.

Some concrete examples, based on the places I worked in, which provide support for at least not having infinite expiration:<p>- Attacker steals Google token from regular employee.. What can they do? No, they can&#x27;t &quot;make themselves admin, or wire all your bitcoin to their account&quot; because such things are not available for regular employees. Nor can they use email to take over account because all stuff that matters uses corporate SSO without automated password resets. So all they have access to corporate google drive, which has few terabytes of not so-valuable-stuff + important documents somewhere.<p>With long-living token, the attacker has plenty of time to browse around and download valuable stuff, perhaps even do it slowly so it can fly under radar. But with the shorter token, this does not work: downloading everything will take too much time &#x2F; trip the alarms, and manual browsing is not fast enough. (I can imagine some sort of sophisticated AI system which auto-downloads interesting docs, but I am sure most attackers have nothing like this)<p>- Attacker steals AWS credentials -- again, they either have to be fast and get detected (there <i>are</i> alarms on unusual high download rate) or go slow and worry about token expiration. Even if they manage to steal important data, at least the expiration will force them to use faster methods more likely to trip the alarm.<p>Even with the full machine compromise, the short-lived tokens are useful.

1: A short compromised session is still a compromised session. The duration usually does not prevent the attacker from achieving their goal.<p>The worst hack at a company I worked for was caused because an old server that was supposed to be decommissioned was left plugged in and connected to the network… a good time later, a hacker exploited a vulnerability in an unpatched package on the machine and got in (since the server was supposed to be decommissioned it was not patched when the rest of the machines were patched).<p>The hacker used old credentials on the machine to gain access to other machines in our network. If we had been rotating credentials more often, this would not have happened.<p>We had systems in place to patch and maintain our machines, but once the machine got lost in our inventory management system, it was forgotten about. It wasn’t monitored anymore, and other protections lapsed.<p>This category of exploit is prevented by credential rotation, because this type of exploit is only possible if a system is neglected.</div><br/><div id="37178347" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37178347" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">horsawlarway</span><span>|</span><a href="#37175324">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37177905">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37178111">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37178347">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37178347">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; This category of exploit is prevented by credential rotation<p>This category of exploit is prevented in a huge number of ways - not a single one of them is &quot;make my user&#x27;s cookie&#x2F;token sessions 15 minutes long&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="37178111" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37178111" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">edejong</span><span>|</span><a href="#37175324">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37177905">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37178347">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37180852">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37178111">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37178111">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It could also have been prevented by… not using user credentials on a server to access services?

Most people don’t “think” about security at all, it’s beyond their education and familiarity. Banks, for instance, offer access to their services to everyone - not just hacker news readers. They’ve started adding fees to in person or phone interactions directing people who can least afford the fees towards online access, which they often don’t have direct access to. ISP fees can be expensive, computers as well, or in the case of elderly they often just don’t know how to get started and value accessing via the library. If you’re homeless you don’t have a place for an ISP subscription, and many access devices at shelters.  People in jail or prison also use shared devices.<p>Yes they’re overall very exposed to bad actors and the machines they use are really insecure. So, short lease credentials definitely reduces blast radius. If you have a key logger, but no automated account drain scripts, a 5 minute timeout will effectively prevent you unless you’re actively watching.<p>Finally, some of these are regulatory requirements for better or worse.

What are the consequences of this? Well, it means that you want multiple layers of security.<p>I think the problem here is that no one ever attempts to define what &quot;multiple&quot; is in layers. Most seem to agree that one layer often isn&#x27;t enough for the reason pointed out.<p>The issue I take is no one knows or provides any sort of guidance of how many layers are enough. People working in security take a degree of liability in their jobs, perhaps careers, for compromises. As such, all the incentives are to add as many layers as possible, everywhere. So we get N-factor Auth, continuously expiring passwords, biometrics, regularly expiring physical access credentials, sessions that are increasingly fleeting and often work requires layers of these sessions so you end up with multiple compounding needs to reauthenticate to the network, to some remote application debugger, to some application running within an application, and so on.<p>I often work in secure environments and it gets tiring, tiring to the point I admittedly start to take shortcuts to make my life easier, shortcuts that ultimately defeat a few layers of security in some way to keep my sanity so I can... do the actual work.<p>So the other extreme of 1 layer of security is N layers of security where nothing is ever usable. There need to be some reasonable protocols in place and people who write them need to be forced to actually go through the use cases with a combination of efficiency&#x2F;production quotas. Only then do I believe security starts to realize an appropriate balance of layering security and creating value. In the current state of affairs, a lot of places are off the rails where they add so many barriers for normal use they create behaviors in authorized users to open very bad holes whereas if a few layers were peeled back and appropriately managed, the overall security of a given system would likely improve.</div><br/><div id="37177746" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37177746" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tetha</span><span>|</span><a href="#37175324">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37176711">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37178035">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37177746">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37177746">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I often work in secure environments and it gets tiring, tiring to the point I admittedly start to take shortcuts to make my life easier, shortcuts that ultimately defeat a few layers of security in some way to keep my sanity so I can... do the actual work.<p>Yeah, and without getting as agitated as that other guy in the comment thread, this is where security becomes its own enemy. And how achieving effective, practical security is a lot more subtle than it seems.<p>For example, we&#x27;ve been talking about putting 2FA onto the identity provider allowing access to internal high privilege administrative interfaces, for example via Duo, which requires you to authorize a login via your phone. However, an important question there was: How long would we trust a 2FA authorization?<p>If every single login after a session expiration requires 2FA, people would riot and&#x2F;or start looking for workarounds. That&#x27;s not great. But eventually, we ended up trusting a 2FA authorization for like 12 hours. That&#x27;s one work day, even if it goes longer. Usually this means you have 2 Duo pings in the morning - one for the VPN and one for the internal IDP. That&#x27;s entirely acceptable imo.<p>And in a similar sense, SSO can increase security while increasing convenience as well. For example, our ADFS allows sessions of about 4 hours, so if you access it once in the morning and once during midday, you stay logged in. And this in turn allows systems like the Keycloak acting as an IDP to work with very short session timeouts. As long as you&#x27;re working, your keycloak session remains active. Once you&#x27;re not active for 5-10 minutes, you&#x27;re logged out from keycloak - but that&#x27;s just 1-2 redirects on the next click and you&#x27;re back in.<p>And once this is simple and convenient, people want to use this. And suddenly you got rid of a mess of local accounts in different systems and everything is based on the central directory. And that, in turn, is more valuable than validating MFA multiple times a day in the grander context, at least in my book.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37178035" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37178035" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lelanthran</span><span>|</span><a href="#37175324">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37176711">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37176758">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37178035">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37178035">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  “Imagine that everything else in a system is done correctly, and the system, overall, is perfectly secure.

They would lose most of their customers. The only realistic risk to the user from Slack&#x27;s point of view is that when the user walks away without locking the computer, someone might read or write Slack messages.<p>Sensitive applications still lock after X minutes of inactivity even on desktop, because the impact of someone else using your computer carries too much risk. One example of this is password managers, where they sometimes require a password or a biometric to unlock after a short period of inactivity.<p>You&#x27;ll see the same pattern in web applications. I haven&#x27;t used the web version of Slack in a while, but I remember that it didn&#x27;t force me to login that often.<p>I think one of the reasons why many choose to have a short session expiration time is that they either can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t dare to do a proper risk assessment and just does what their competition seems to do.<p>There may be technical reasons too. Web applications do have a higher risk of accidentally leaking passwords through low security and hostile actors. Reducing the TTL may not fix the issue, but it will at least reduce the window where an attacker can make use of a stolen token. It may not matter much if you have a dedicated attacker, but it at least adds some resistance.<p>Creating a secure application takes time (acceptance from business) and experience (junior developers) and many don&#x27;t have either.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37175643" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37175643" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Ajedi32</span><span>|</span><a href="#37175479">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37175793">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37175751">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37175643">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37175643">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think it&#x27;s just that users are more likely to sign in to a website on a shared computer than they are to download, install, and sign into an app on a shared computer.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37175751" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37175751" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gabereiser</span><span>|</span><a href="#37175479">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37175643">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37177820">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37175751">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37175751">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Often it’s because your JWT hasn’t expired, your IP matches previous, and so you’re authentic.

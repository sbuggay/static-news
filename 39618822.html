My wife, who is a physician, thought it might be hypoglycemia, since i&#x27;m at high risk for diabetes. She found a super friendly endocrinologist who put me on a CGM for two weeks. I never hit the hypoglycemia range during those two weeks, so it didn&#x27;t really explain what my issue... but honestly the data was SUPER interesting. Just observing the various spikes made me make healthier choices, or noticing when I was feeling extra tired and seeing if that correlated to not having eaten for little while, or eating something sugary before.<p>It&#x27;s sort of like tracking your steps when you first get a smart watch. It may not have been the reason you got the device, but seeing the data, people are encouraged to act on it, even if you don&#x27;t have an acute issue. since I didn&#x27;t have a prescription, I couldn&#x27;t get one here (didn&#x27;t want to go through some sketch online site). I tried to get one from my family in India, but the prices were really high and they couldn&#x27;t get the fancier one that tracks straight to your phone, so I didn&#x27;t get one.<p>I think this could be a god send for preventing pre-diabetic people who would take preventative steps if it weren&#x27;t such a pain in the ass to measure consistently.</div><br/><div id="39625613" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39625613" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cleandreams</span><span>|</span><a href="#39621590">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39625763">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39625613">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39625613">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I am prediabetic and I have one. It&#x27;s partly covered by insurance. By the metrics my estimated average glucose has gone down from 129 to 98 or so (normal). I haven&#x27;t had my HbA1c in awhile.<p>I think they are amazing. It&#x27;s been SO HELPFUL. However I don&#x27;t think it makes sense for normal people. I am on a reddit group for prediabetes and it&#x27;s not unusual that people who are underweight (anorexic?) and have completely normal metrics come in and post in an utterly freaked out state. These are people who are somewhat compulsive and anxious. I think that if you are normal for blood glucose having access to all this data can make you compulsive and anxious.<p>However, for me as a prediabetic, it is really useful. It tells you what’s going on with your blood sugar in real time with no ideology. In the beginning I was spiking from things that a nutritionist would say was OK. I found whole grains didn’t work for me. I was shocked at how much I spiked from oatmeal. What causes blood glucose spikes does not map directly to number of carbs and also every body is different.<p>After 6 mo of lowered carbs, weight training, and getting down to normal BMI, I can now eat SMALL portions of things like brown rice. My health has improved. It&#x27;s great. IMHO all prediabetics and diabetics should have one, covered by insurance. It would really improve health and reduce complications.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39625763" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39625763" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aledalgrande</span><span>|</span><a href="#39621590">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39625613">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39626623">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39625763">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39625763">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I actually just got one of these CGMs after listening to Peter Attia&#x27;s (audio)book Outlive and started monitoring my glucose and experimenting with meals and exercise to see what effects they have.

Personally, I was developing adult onset type 1 (LADA) for a couple of years before I was diagnosed and I had all sorts of effects. While it was of course mainly effects of chronic hyperglycemia and shortage of insulin, I also had some episodes of hypoglycemia. Now that I’m on insulin, I’m very familiar with hypoglycemia resulting from an imbalance of exogenous insulin and carbohydrates. However, I looked back and realized this happened to me a few times before I was on insulin. I recall waking up a few times at night, sweating and shaking, and having a strong urge to consume food. I’d drink some juice or eat chips, feel better in 20-30 minutes and go back to sleep. This occurred after drinking alcohol, which makes sense as alcohol intensifies the effect of insulin and also prevents your body from releasing chemicals which raise your blood glucose level. I didn’t think much about it at the time but now I can see it was related to T1 onset.<p>My understanding is that essentially the body’s systems which regulate blood glucose are disrupted. This happens a with type 1 in general - not only problems with the system that produces and releases insulin to lower blood glucose by allowing it into cells, but also the part that does the opposite and release glucose to raise blood glucose levels. Sometimes the glucose-raising system doesn’t work at all while other times it’s inappropriately in overdrive. The same is true for the insulin releasing&#x2F;glucose lowering system as it fails.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39625377" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39625377" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">veryfancy</span><span>|</span><a href="#39621590">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39624654">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39626536">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39624702">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39625377">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39625377">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Wondered this too.

One thing he noticed was the huge impact a short walk after a meal brought down his blood sugar levels. Tim then mentioned he experienced the same thing and that there is a saying in China, something to the effect of, &quot;take 100 steps after a meal, live 99 years.&quot; This also linked up with something I had looked up a few years ago when I noticed that I always saw families of Indian decent walking around neighborhoods, but never anyone else. I looked it up, and founds there is a word in Marathi of taking 100 steps after a meal. (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shatapawali" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shatapawali</a>)<p>It seems there has been this age old knowledge that taking a short walk after a meal is really good for you, which somehow got lost in some&#x2F;many cultures. My parents would always say they had to sit after a meal to let their food digest... it never really made sense to me.  My grandma, on the other hand, is 103 and gets pretty upset if people try to stop her from walking after a meal (or whenever she wants). We always just thought she liked walking, but maybe there is something else driving her, it seems to have worked out for her. It was very interesting to hear the CGM back up some of these practices that have likely been going on for hundreds or thousands of years.<p>I have been wanting to try one. This approval opens up the door. I think seeing something like this with my own eyes, with my own body, with actual numbers, would have a bunch bigger impact than some anecdotal stories from others and nice sayings which align.<p>It looks like there is some research being done in the area as well.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s40279-022-01649-4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s40279-022-01649-4</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC8912639&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC8912639&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="39623365" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39623365" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">philsnow</span><span>|</span><a href="#39620028">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39623148">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39623896">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39623365">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39623365">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s fascinating -- you know how your body sometimes manifests a craving for a food when it &quot;knows&quot; that you&#x27;re deficient in some nutrient that food will provide?<p>I get the same feeling (of my body directing me to take some action) but it&#x27;s not after meals, for me it&#x27;s after having more than one beer.

Then look at the shape of the scatter plot. <i>Ideally</i> it will be linear, so you ask Excel to do a linear curve fit (y=m*x+b).

Ideally you&#x27;d go for around 10% increments. If the scale can weigh 400lbs, that would be every 40 lbs or so. But it really doesn&#x27;t matter as long as you have enough good points around the range you truly intend to measure, and then a few outside of that target range at semi-regular intervals.<p>For my 0.1mg-resolution mass balance I have some actual calibration weights, but they&#x27;re a relatively affordable OIML &quot;M1&quot; class, and did not come with expensive calibration certificates. The OIML tolerance ratings go E1, E2, F1, F2, M1, M2, M3 (from best to worst). For a 100g test weight, M1 precision gets you +&#x2F;- 0.005g, guaranteed, for $50 ($135 if you want a calibration certificate). E1 gets you +&#x2F;- 0.00005g at 100g test weight, for $500 ($1200 with cal cert). For smaller calibration weights like 10mg you&#x27;ll generally want to go a step up from M1 (+&#x2F;- 0.25mg) to F2 (+&#x2F;- 0.08mg) for about $27.<p>For temperature, it&#x27;s a bit trickier because the only &quot;true&quot; temperatures you can create are -6°F&#x2F;-21°C and 228°F&#x2F;109°C. If these temperatures are helpful to you, you can create them by pouring shitloads of salt in water and stirring+heating it until no more salt will dissolve and you just have a pile of salt in the bottom of the container. You can try to go for &quot;0°C&#x2F;100°C&quot; using distilled water and it would probably be close enough but you can&#x27;t know it exactly unless you use super pure de-ionized water and use extremely absurd lab technique (usually involving washing your glassware and tools with de-ionized water over and over for several days straight to get rid of trace contaminants).<p>So instead, to get &quot;true&quot; temperature in the range I care about, I use some thermocouples attached to a high-quality multimeter or oscilloscope. Then I calibrate these thermocouples using the method above, and average their reading for the oven temperature. This works and extrapolates well enough outside the range of calibration because the error of a thermocouple is basically guaranteed to be a very linear error.<p>In this link[0] topics 1-6 (&quot;weeks&quot;) get into the fine details of all this and provide some worksheets&#x2F;excel sheets already made up for this type of thing. If you&#x27;re really getting into the weeds with this, understanding propagation of error[1] really helps but is super unnecessary for 99% of people unless they&#x27;re doing actual engineering.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pages.mtu.edu&#x2F;~fmorriso&#x2F;cm3215&#x2F;laboratory_exercise_schedule.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pages.mtu.edu&#x2F;~fmorriso&#x2F;cm3215&#x2F;laboratory_exercise_s...</a><p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pages.mtu.edu&#x2F;~fmorriso&#x2F;Pintar_Error_Analysis_or_UO_Lab.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pages.mtu.edu&#x2F;~fmorriso&#x2F;Pintar_Error_Analysis_or_UO_...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39622956" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39622956" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gumby</span><span>|</span><a href="#39620028">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39620238">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39620365">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39620557">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39622956">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39622956">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Apart from the latency of diffusion from bloodstream to interstitial fluid (and the lower levels in the interstitial fluid) the FDA requires that consumer devices be with 20% of the venipuncture level.<p>That means a lancet poke can be quite different from a meter like the freestyle, and both can be quite different from the level in your veins that a lab would get.

From what I&#x27;ve heard TSlim does seem to be the best &quot;official&quot;&#x2F;FDA approved loop; however AndroidAPS looks very powerful and probably has much finer tunings possible.<p>However my diabetic nurse is strongly against the Dash&#x2F;DIY setup, which is understandable (she isn&#x27;t familiar with it and can&#x27;t guide me, I&#x27;m also close to the 150u&#x2F;3day limit, and it&#x27;s my first time with a pump.)<p>For what it&#x27;s worth an A1C of even 8 would unfortunately be an improvement where I am :&#x27;) so I&#x27;d rather be sure of reaching say 7 rather than try aggressively for something like 6.3 (which I had achieved in a distant era...).

It was openAPS. I&#x27;m not sure if there are others or how they work.<p>It ended up being fairly inconvenient. My setup was a pi zero with a radio bonnet running on my desk; it would connect to the internet to pull CGM data, and deliver boluses accordingly.<p>I think the main issue was that I wasn&#x27;t babysitting it enough to know if it was working or not. It was hard to see&#x2F;understand bolus decisions it was making unless I checked iob, and it absolutely destroyed the battery life of my pump; I used a AAA once every couple days when I was near my desk, nevermind the battery on the rig (I had it plugged into the wall).<p>Overall, the system that you actually use the most, that is the most reliable, is the most effective system, even if it&#x27;s a little bit suboptimal. In my case, CIQ is probably a bit less aggressive than the openAPS system; but importantly, it is truly &quot;set and forget.&quot; I never have to worry if it&#x27;s enabled or when, or how, it&#x27;s just always working, 24&#x2F;7. With a condition like ours, consistency is the best predictor of performance. That makes it the clear winner imho, unless you really like to tinker with things and you want to be very active with your loop.<p>The other thing is that the software (openAPS) was Javascript and Bash on a Linux system. Those architecture choices just make me nervous. Too many bad things that could happen. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible for open source software to be reliable, certainly not, but the complexity of their system was just too large of a surface area to fully test.

The reason being is that whilst some foods might be considered high&#x2F;low in sugar, each of us reacts differently in how we absorb those foods or drinks. So a bagel you eat might not spike your blood sugar like someone else, or conversely it does. You can then correlate that spike or reduction in blood glucose with how you&#x27;re feeling throughout the day, how your blood sugar levels impact exercise.<p>Also it allows you to see how combinations of foods and the order that you eat them in impacts blood sugar. If you eat a chunk of white rice without any fibre you might find it spikes, if you each a bunch of vegetables in the bowl before hand you might find it doesn&#x27;t rise as high or give you a steadier release of blood sugar.<p>I&#x27;d use one for a few months just to see how foods impact my blood sugar and how I can make different choices.

Gave up for a year, worked on sleep hygiene in general and tried again. After about 2 weeks of a new mask and adjusting settings slept through the night. 5 years on I still wish I didn’t need it, but the improved quality of life means I basically never go to sleep without it.

My philosophy is that if there&#x27;s any single topic where I should be spending five hours a month researching, it&#x27;s personal health.<p>As far as spikes are concerned, I convinced my wife and my dad to both try out the same CGM. Neither of them really ever had any spikes of significance (maybe up to 130&#x27;s), even when eating cake, etc. Obviously it varies from person to person, but the fact I would spike easily above 140 with boring foods (steel cut oats with no sweetener as an example) said to me something was wrong. My daily averages hovering around 100 to 105 were not in the pre-diabetes level but were close to it, even when eating minimal carbs and being extremely fit with a natural healthy diet. Also most of what you read out there with CGMs is related to people who actually have diabetes.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s no one really to talk to about this stuff. You can eclipse your doctor&#x27;s knowledge on the topic with about 5-10 hours of research. You can go get a broad set of labs and be right at the edge of the reference range on something (which is, depending on the lab, just a range of the general population, not a healthy range) and your doctor will shrug it off. The system is setup so that as long as you are in a sort of average, even with that average being pretty bad (half of the country is fat and pre-diabetic), the standard of care is to ignore it until you fall off the end. The line between hypochondria and being on top of your health is pretty thin, and most doctors will consider you a hypochondriac if you research and come ready to talk about the topic with any level of knowledge.</div><br/><div id="39622618" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39622618" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Projectiboga</span><span>|</span><a href="#39620328">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39620670">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39620935">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39622618">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39622618">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Try melatonin it makes what insulin you have go farther.

Then they went OTC for like $10&#x2F;bottle.<p>This pricing difference might be true for things that are already mostly cheap, like Omeprazole -- where branding on consumer products drives OTC markup, but consumers don&#x27;t pick the brand when doctors prescribe it and the pharmacy just gives them whatever cheapest generic they have in the back that they negotiated excellent pricing on.<p>Though you can easily close the gap on these prices by shopping for the store-brand generics at Costco, Walmart, Sam&#x27;s Club, etc.</div><br/><div id="39620206" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39620206" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bobthepanda</span><span>|</span><a href="#39619750">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39620167">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39620195">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39620206">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39620206">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It turns out when you strip out as much of the billing bureaucracy as possible, that things become cheaper.</div><br/><div id="39620245" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39620245" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">reaperman</span><span>|</span><a href="#39619750">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39620206">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39620195">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39620245">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39620245">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think &quot;captive market&quot; probably contributes more than &quot;billing bureaucracy&quot; ... the billing is still the same issue after the generics have gotten OTC approval for doctor prescriptions filled by a pharmacist.

For those who are not aware, ketoacidosis is when your body metabolizes fat for energy in the absence of insulin. This produces byproducts (keytone bodies) that raise the pH of the blood.<p>So, having ketoacidosis feels like having your blood turn to acid. Death from ketoacidosis is an excruciating death. Fermenting from the inside out as your heart pumps your increasingly acidic blood through your entire body. You&#x27;re technically starving, so you&#x27;re hungry, but at the same time your body is trying to expel glucose at all costs, so everything you look at makes you sick.<p>Extended periods of high blood glucose and lack of insulin especially is up there as one of the most uncomfortable things I&#x27;ve ever experienced personally.

In diabetic patients, we see high glucose level. That doesn&#x27;t mean eating high GI food causes someone to have diabetes.<p>This is correct but probably not in the way you think. It is not the glucose in and of itself that is the problem but the level of the hormone insulin circulating around your system that is at the root of Type II diabetes. Glucose and insulin are highly related. Insulin is released by the pancreas to help control the level glucose in our blood.<p>Virtually no insulin is required when metabolising fats, a small amount is required for protein and a larger amount of insulin is required when dealing with glucose dense carbohydrate based foods. The faster a carbohydrate is metabolised the greater the dose of insulin required to quell the resulting glucose rush in the blood.<p>What does the insulin do? As a hormone it has many functions. The presence of insulin in the blood signals to all cells to burn sugar (glucose) rather than fats (ketones) for their energy. It prompts the cells in the skeletal muscles to store up glucose in the form of glycogen for later use and it signals the liver to store excess glucose that is not immediately needed. Once the liver and muscles are full then the liver then converts any excess to triglycerides.<p>Where do the triglycerides go? They get stored as subcutaneous fat all over but largely in the belly (in men) and bum&#x2F;upper legs (in women). What happens when subcutaneous stores are full? Then the triglycerides are shoved anywhere and everywhere. Fat is pushed into muscle cells as well as the cells in individual organs. The fat molecules present in cells in organs are particularly pernicious (visceral fat) but any cells that contain these triglycerides seems to disrupt the insulin signalling within the cell. This results in insulin resistance i.e., the ineffectiveness of insulin to signal to the cell to take up excess glucose.<p>When sufficient threshold of insulin resistance is reached, you will get higher blood sugar readings and a higher A1C at which point your doc will say you have prediabetes or full on type II diabetes.<p>Insulin is the master key variable that unlocks the type II diabetes puzzle. High blood sugar levels are just a symptom. The problem with modern day Type II diabetic care is they consider the high blood sugar as the root problem. So this is treated with meds such as metformin and eventually MORE insulin. Understanding type II diabetes as a disease of too much insulin sheds the disease in a very different light.<p>Anyway, you are correct, the high glucose level per se is not the cause, but high levels of insulin constantly circulating around your system is the big problem. Of course an effective way of doing that is to continuously eat foods dense in glucose and fructose that are metabolised very quickly e.g., cookies, ice-cream, orange juice etc.<p>&gt; If we look at the Blue Zone, many people eat mostly carb. So carb&#x2F;high GI food definitely doesn&#x27;t cause diabetes<p>Blue Zone areas such as Okinawa, you do find people eating carb rich foods but they are also high in fibre e.g., root vegetables, sweet potatoes etc. look at books by Robert Lustig to learn more about the importance of fibre in relation to metabolism and diabetes risk.</div><br/><div id="39621463" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39621463" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sdo72</span><span>|</span><a href="#39620721">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39621204">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39620537">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39621463">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39621463">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you for the detail :).

I&#x27;m curious if they actually partnered with a shipping line to come up with this.<p>On the terminal side, all I can say is that I am knee-deep in container optimizations right now and it&#x27;s a damn nightmare.  Every terminal does things extremely differently, even if the terminal is owned by the same company.  Even the terminology is often different within a company.  You optimize for one terminal, and you have to build 80% of it from scratch for the next terminal.  Any solution is incredibly difficult to scale.</div><br/><div id="40593230" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40593230" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yyyfb</span><span>|</span><a href="#40591557">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40592038">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40593230">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40593230">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The benchmark data that they&#x27;ve used to assess their performance comes from Maersk <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;blof&#x2F;LINERLIB">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;blof&#x2F;LINERLIB</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40592038" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40592038" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">danielmarkbruce</span><span>|</span><a href="#40591557">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40593230">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594339">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40592038">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40592038">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Like the other comment - very curious about this.

There is no shortage of people trying to solve the &#x27;sexy&#x27; academic problems like stowage plan optimization, berth assignment problems, crane splits, etc, but only very little gets implemented in practice. It is a tough business, with an even tougher political landscape, since dock workers traditionally have very strong unions.<p>All of the problems you can neatly divide and name are interrelated in practice, and trying to have algorithms &quot;magically&quot; figure it out for users is pretty much guaranteed to fail. This business eats software hotshots who think they can swoop in and &quot;just&quot; run some algos, &quot;because it&#x27;s just a TSP &#x2F; Constraint Solver &#x2F; [insert your approach here] right?&quot;.

A terminal handling 1 million TEU&#x2F;year may operate with 2-3 crews in a 16 hour&#x2F;day schedule for handling ships and trucks, plus some extra people handling the empties. Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s 60 dock workers a day. A typically office might only employ about 12 people in overhead: one for customs&#x2F;quality stuff, one for invoicing and finance, one HR, a bunch of order entry &#x2F; customer service people, and 2 or 3 yard&#x2F;berth&#x2F;stowage planners.<p>Unless you look at the biggest of biggest terminals, you have to essentially regard them as SMEs in a very non-sexy business, and they treat tech and fundamental research into optimization accordingly.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40593538" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40593538" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">snapetom</span><span>|</span><a href="#40591557">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40591603">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594434">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594741">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40593538">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40593538">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One day when I leave, I swear I&#x27;m going to write a tell-all book about this industry.  Until then, here&#x27;s some condensed info.<p>To set the stage, this is a blue-collar industry, and what happens, so I&#x27;ve been told, is quite common in blue-collar industries.  A lot of good ol&#x27; boy networking, people getting promoted who have no business being promoted, and as a consequence, a lot of corruption, ineptitude, and inefficiencies.  The software in this space just flat out suck and anyone at a FAANG company would be appalled at how we write software.  It&#x27;s literally longshoremen trying to run software businesses.<p>On the other hand, as a terminal, it&#x27;s very hard <i>not</i> to make money, so there&#x27;s a lot of players, and unfortunately a lot of, at least shady deals.<p>I&#x27;m involved with a company that sells to terminals that don&#x27;t have home-grown software systems.  I don&#x27;t have that much info on terminals that have their own software staff, however, there just isn&#x27;t that much breakthroughs in the space.  It&#x27;s a conservative industry with a lot of money already, so there traditionally have been little incentive with high risks.<p>In addition to the aversion to risk, there&#x27;s a lack of software product and engineering strategy to invest in optimization properly.  One major vendor, I was told by a colleague did invest substantially, failed, and &quot;it almost bought the entire company down.&quot;  My company has dabbled before.  We&#x27;ve had a couple of PhDs on staff.  We even had a neighbor search solution like in the article developed.  It worked in simulation and testing, and failed miserably in real life.  The customer didn&#x27;t take it, and we never had the vision to actually salvage anything from the effort.<p>There are a few vendors in this space, but again, the landscape is pretty sad.  I know of one that are flat out frauds.  They exist because the CEOs used to be in the industry and have credibility.  They&#x27;re still around because they&#x27;re able to con non-technical terminal managers and string them along for a while.  A few more maybe have 1 or 2 competent data scientists, but that&#x27;s not enough.  I&#x27;ve worked with one company that is good and is easily the most qualified, but they have never had the marketing and leadership to make themselves the billions they should be worth.  They also simultaneously price themselves out of range for most terminals.<p>The industry is changing, though, because private equity has gotten involved in many companies.  They have taken over some internal initiatives and basically dragged many of these good ol&#x27; boys against their will, or forced them out.  They&#x27;ve also forced companies to partner with tech giants to address these issues.  IMO, this is the only way we will see supply chain optimization revolutions any time soon.</div><br/><div id="40594325" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40594325" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bendtb</span><span>|</span><a href="#40591557">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40593538">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594503">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40594325">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40594325">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As someone in the industry as well for many years (coming from the business side having ventured into software), the main problem is always that the software just is not good enough and do not account for all the edge cases - leaving many users better off using pumped up Excel sheets combined with a few hours on the phone every day to account for all the nuances and changing customers&#x2F;suppliers demands.<p>In short: It is not good enough.

All of these problems have been classically formulated as bin packing problems.<p>Toy model: Single ship + Single container Bin Packing<p>Here is how it works for a single boat and a single package going between multiple ports. In this case, the problem is equivalent to a shortest path problem on a graph with weighted nodes, and more traditionally presented as a shortest path problem on a graph with weighted edges. I&#x27;ll show the model and the graph translations!<p>The model consists of:<p>1. One bin - a 1 dimensional line  representing the utilization of the ship over time<p>2. Line segments p_1 .. p_k representing the transit time for each of k possible shipping operations (taking the container from some port to some other port). For this model, assume p_1 = p_k = 0, representing the first and final transits<p>3. A port relation P_ik saying &quot;transit k can immediately follow transit i,&quot; or equivalently,  &quot;transit i&#x27;s arrival port is transit k&#x27;s departure port&quot;<p>A span is a sequence of line segments respecting the port relations, starting at p_0 and ending at p_k. The problem is to find a makespan - an optimal span.<p>This is the same as the shortest path on a directed graph G with nodes weighted p_1 .. p_k, where we draw an arrow i -&gt; j iff P_ij.<p>This graph can also be &quot;dualized&quot; into a directed graph G&#x27; where nodes are ports, and arrows between ports are weighted by transit times. This is the most familiar form of this problem.<p>Define an equivalence relation i ~ j saying transit i and j are equivalent iiff P_ik = P_jk for all k (i and j arrive at the same port). Now give G&#x27; a  node for each equivalence class [i], which we call ports. Finally, for any pair of ports [i] and [j], add an arrow [i] -&gt; [j] with weight p_k if and only if there exists k such that<p>1. P_ik. (Transit k leaves from port [i])<p>2. k is in [j]. (Transit k arrives at port [j])<p>Now we have the traditional shortest route problem on a graph with weighted edges. However the bin packing model naturally scales to the case where we have many ships, larger cargo capacities, many containers, and complex transit constraints.<p>In this general case, we regain the geometric packing aspect as well! This is because the ships are represented by 4 dimensional bins, which are packed with containers in x, y, z AND t dimensions! The spatial part of this packing now has to obey efficiency constraints like minimizing the unpacking and reshuffling that happens at each port!

If you&#x27;re really inclined to try to solve your scheduling problems better, the courses you&#x27;ll find usually assume significant prior programming and&#x2F;or mathematical knowledge.<p>I think it should be possible to lean on no-code paradigms to build a modelling environment for scheduling problems that is accessible for &quot;normal&quot; people who need more than Excel but can&#x27;t hire an OR specialist.</div><br/><div id="40594590" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40594590" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hermitcrab</span><span>|</span><a href="#40591267">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40591656">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40592316">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40594590">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40594590">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think it will be very difficult to come up with a simple and visual way to model all the constraints that a real world scheduling problem might have.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40592316" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40592316" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">viceconsole</span><span>|</span><a href="#40591267">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40591656">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594590">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40592465">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40592316">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40592316">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I work in a restricted environment where I can&#x27;t install or-tools.

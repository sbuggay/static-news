Flex tickets are just tickets whose dates you can change for no fee, all you pay is the airfare difference.<p>This summer, I needed to change my Flex ticket. So I went online and found a new flight that would cost me just 13 EUR in airfare difference.<p>As I was about to pay for the fare, the website told me &quot;a technical error happened&quot; and that I needed to call customer service...<p>So I called customer service, told them my issue and the flight I was looking for. The agent on the phone told me there was indeed an issue and that he fixed it and that my total fare was 69 EUR. To which I answered that on the website the fare was 13 EUR and not 69 EUR.<p>The agent insisted that the fare was 69 EUR and there was no other possibility. So, as I was talking to him over the phone, I went on the website and tried purchasing the 13 EUR fare... and it went through.<p>I am now convinced that 1- AirFrance is purposefully preventing people from changing their fare online (unless someone on HN tells me they had a different experience) 2- that the agent on the phone did something that allowed me to pay for the fare 3- that the agent or someone was going to pocket out the 56 EUR difference.<p>I might be wrong on all 3 points, and these might just be pure coincidences, but I am used to airlines being scummy, so I&#x27;ll easily believe my current narrative.<p>edit: I so happen to currently have a Flex fare for a flight in December of this year. I went online and tried changing the fare. And of course the website keeps telling me &quot;Sorry, there are no flights available for this combination of departure airport, arrival airport and travel dates. Please try again.&quot;.<p>I took a look at the XHR call and sure enough, although this time it&#x27;s hidden from me, the XHR response is:<p><pre><code>  {&quot;errors&quot;:[{&quot;message&quot;:&quot;unexpected error occurred&quot;,&quot;locations&quot;:[{&quot;line&quot;:2,&quot;column&quot;:3}],&quot;path&quot;:[&quot;flightOffers&quot;],&quot;extensions&quot;:{&quot;code&quot;:&quot;3100&quot;,&quot;exception&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;AviatoError&quot;}}}],&quot;data&quot;:{&quot;flightOffers&quot;:null},&quot;extensions&quot;:{&quot;aviatoCacheControl&quot;:{&quot;hasPrivateData&quot;:true}}}</code></pre></div><br/><div id="36624874" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36624874" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">voisin</span><span>|</span><a href="#36624770">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36625783">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36624874">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36624874">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; 2- that the agent on the phone did something that allowed me to pay for the fare<p>I think you are overestimating the powers of telephone agents with respect to website errors.

Although he had clocked up many hours in an Airbus cockpit, his actual experience of manually flying a plane like the A330 was minimal. His role had primarily been to monitor the automatic system. The time he had spent manually flying would likely have been focused on take-off and landing. So, when the autopilot disengaged, because ice crystals had begun to form inside the air-speed sensors in the fuselage, he didn’t know what to do. The fly-by-wire system downgraded itself to a mode that gave Bonin less assistance. With the safety net gone, the plane was now liable to stall if conditions allowed, and Bonin inadvertently proceeded to create those conditions.<p>...<p>&gt; The Air France 447 pilots ‘were hideously incompetent,’ says William Langewiesche, author of the Vanity Fair article</div><br/></div></div><div id="36625667" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36625667" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">housemusicfan</span><span>|</span><a href="#36624515">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36625285">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36625987">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36624620">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36625667">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36625667">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m struggling to understand how you came to this conclusion.

The report clearly paints a very different picture, that of two highly credentialed imbeciles in the cockpit that bungled the response to a routine minor emergency and deviated from procedure (the captain was asleep with the younger copilot and a relief pilot at the controls). They subsequently forgot how to fly an airplane without automation (or never learned how), and made a series of unbelievable errors. The captain burst into the cockpit with just enough time to realize what had happened and curse them out in French (they were beyond the point of recovery and realized their fate) and the rest is history.<p>From the Wikipedia article:<p><i>On 17 April 2023, Airbus and Air France were both acquitted of manslaughter.</i></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36624620" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36624620" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ghughes</span><span>|</span><a href="#36624515">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36624712">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36624852">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36624620">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36624620">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">BA is just as bad.

They will rollover easily once they get a call from the government telling them they are in the wrong. In Canada my phone company raised my phone plans prices randomly. Companies are typically required in law to give proper warning to the customer of such changes. Their &quot;warning&quot; was a single month of notice, and they put it on a tiny section on page 7 or 8 of the phone bill. The bills are digital and I have it set to autopay the same amount every month. So of course no reason to read an 8-9 page bill every month.<p>They had my email on file, as well as my phone number. They send promo message offers all the time to my email and phone number yet used none of those avenues to inform me the price would be increasing.<p>Who knows if their fine print method of increasing prices is legal or not, but I contacted the relevant agency in Ontario, Canada and they contacted me a week after the ticket for details. They indicated it doesn&#x27;t sound like I was properly informed and they would reach out to the phone company. Soon after I get a call from the phone company. They set my bill back to the previous rate plus applied a $10 discount per month for a year.<p>Great for me, but ultimately I still hate it. Because they know it&#x27;s wrong to do, but they do it anyway because there isn&#x27;t much competition. They know most people just won&#x27;t say anything and will suck up the extra cost or not even notice for awhile. Even if it&#x27;s $5 a company wrongly took from me I will go out of my way to get it back.

At the time I didn&#x27;t have the bandwidth to do anything else. They never even paid and it&#x27;s too much energy to even get anyone to acknowledge this.<p>Fact is Lufthansa also is a shit organization. The correct thing is to either (1) with minimal effort send official complaints to government agencies with documentation, (2) to hire one of those companies to just do it for you, or (3) go zen and just stop caring that companies are breaking their contracts and ignoring their legal obligations.<p>Sure sometimes it works, but no Lufthansa isn&#x27;t one of the good airlines.

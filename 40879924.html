Nvidia driver didn&#x27;t install properly so second reboot was to a black screen. Thankfully after some fiddling with packages it worked again.
Then the old ways I loaded up ssh-agent didn&#x27;t work anymore, so it took a few logouts to find a new one.
I tried to recompile my CV, but somehow Latex dependencies all changed names, so I had to track down missing packages. Then it still would not compile because the names of the fonts had changed. Configuring the font line was frustrating as xelatex and pdflatex did not expect the same line, and both crashed on a different error that did not lead to an easy solution.
When I tried some game on Steam, it just crashed without an explanation. After checking ways to boot it from the CLI -- which is unsupported but search results lead to partial solutions to that problem anyway -- I found that it was possible to add a DEBUGGING argument to the proton command. Searching the error lead to simply find that some lib was missing (actually the challenge was in finding the proper error to search for). I&#x27;m the most amazed at this one since this is not in any way &quot;developer software&quot;, but a standard user one, for which at least 1 hour of pain would have been removed by an optional dependency.<p>I&#x27;m cutting down the list but it took days to solve every single broken thing.<p>By coincidence I watched &quot;how to prevent the collapse of civilization&quot; by Johnathan Blow. His point that nobody is surprised anymore that everything breaks and is bugged, it has become the baseline expectation.</div><br/><div id="40913304" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40913304" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BossingAround</span><span>|</span><a href="#40913162">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40912832">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40913304">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40913304">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What projects are you working on that take 5GB of venv size?

Some client projects are packaged in a way that bring in a lot of unneeded dependencies.

It doesn’t need to be perfect, just good enough to let you do what you actually want to do.<p>And that&#x27;s how you end up with the kind of trail of flakiness that brought them so much trouble. Disappearing tutorials and deprecated plugins are a result of this kind of attitude.<p>A lot of this honestly sounds like &quot;skill issue&quot; - they&#x27;re trying to do a cascade of things that is multiple layers of unsupported, and a lot of the problems are ones they&#x27;ve made for themselves (e.g. why not set it up on a local machine first, get your setup steps working there, and then put it on your headless machine, rather than having to deal with Xvnc at the same time as everything else? Why not use a working computer and OS instead of buying a new one?). But also this is what doing real work, especially research, tends to look like.

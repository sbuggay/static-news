These findings suggest that the exposure to environmental microbial diversity can change the microbiome and modulate the function of the immune system in children. Specifically, the intervention was associated with a shift toward a higher ratio between plasma cytokine IL-10 and IL-17A levels and a positive association between Gammaproteobacterial diversity and Treg cell frequencies in blood, suggesting that the intervention may have stimulated immunoregulatory pathways.<p>Doesn&#x27;t this just say that being exposed to more, and perhaps different, microbials will trigger your immune system? There are lots of words, but my casual eyes don&#x27;t read anything that would be non-obvious. Specifically, nothing in this study seems to look at long-term effects. It was a 28 day study without later follow-up. Is there a well-established link between what they showed and lasting immune system changes?<p>(Making the headline _technically_ true.)</div><br/><div id="40643384" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40643384" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hmottestad</span><span>|</span><a href="#40643067">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40643746">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40643384">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40643384">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A lot of studies are like this. They build on existing ideas and push the boundaries in a very specific direction. Here they show that adding a forest floor environment to a kindergarten will increase certain immune related markers in the blood of the children playing there. They managed to design the study so that you can’t say “oh, but children playing in kindergartens close to forests probably don’t live in cities, so they probably don’t get exposed to as much pollution”.<p>Other studies will find links between those immune related markers and the development of autoimmune related disease, or someone will do a statistical analysis on kids that grew up in kindergartens close to forests to see if their incidence of autoimmune related disease is lower.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40643746" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40643746" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tomohelix</span><span>|</span><a href="#40643067">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40643396">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40643746">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40643746">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We have been learning more and more about the importance of the gut microbiome, from emotions and intelligence to immune responses and hormones. It is my opinion that children should be allowed to explore and &quot;get dirty&quot; so to speak. It would train and expose their body to different elements and pathogens that build a balance and &quot;natural&quot; microflora. By babying and obsessed with keeping kids clean and spotless all the time, we may actually hurt them more in the long run.<p>A bit of dirt, some sneezes, a scratched knee, a few bruises, all of them are normal and expected. Kids should be allowed to have those, otherwise we might deprive them of a healthy life later on.<p>Anecdotally, I grew up in a not so clean place. Thinking back, I am surprised it was so normal back then with how unhygienic everything was by Western standards. You would think people living in that kind of environment would be sick and disease ridden all the time. Yet it was the opposite. Allergies were practically unheard of and stuff like a cold or flu were almost never severe enough to send anyone to the hospital. Basically, people I knew back then were a lot more robust and had less health concerns than most of my coworkers and neighbors nowadays despite a world of differences in hygiene standards.<p>IIRC, germ free rodents grown to be absolutely sterile for specific medical tests are extremely sick all the time and are so weak you would not believe they are genetically the same with those rats thriving in the sewer. I guess it is for the same reason.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40643396" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40643396" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">l5870uoo9y</span><span>|</span><a href="#40643746">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40642840">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40643396">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40643396">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Growing up on a farm improves the immunological responses that regulates allergies, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

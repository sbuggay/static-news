Ever since I knew myself I&#x27;ve been coding. From middle school to high school, given any problem, like Sudoku, or keeping up daily chores, my solution was Programming! Programming wasy homebase. Then I studied it in uni, thought I was kinda good at it, and loved it.<p>But when I started working in the industry, I realized that it&#x27;s absolutely exhausting. Hype after hype, fad after fad, modern after modern, refactor after refactor. I have a workflow, I know how to build apps. Then one day director of Ops comes and completely and utterly changes the workflow. Ok fine, I&#x27;m young, will learn this. Month passes, it is now Terraform. Ok fine I&#x27;m young, will learn this. Now we&#x27;re serverless. Ok fine, will learn. Now everything is container. Ok. Now everything microservice. K. Now turns out lambdas aren&#x27;t good, so everything is ECS. OK will rewrite everything...<p>Look I&#x27;m not even complaining. But it feels like I&#x27;m stuck in a Franz Kafka novel. We just keep changing and changing the same things again and again because that&#x27;s the new way to do. Big distraction. Destroys your workflow. Forget about all the util scripts you wrote last 6 months being useless.<p>I don&#x27;t even know how I would do it. Maybe I would do this the same way if I had any power. But that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it&#x27;s a bit ridiculous. Fun but tiring. Entertaining but exhausting.

Then maybe you <i>should</i> upgrade their stack a little bit.<p>In the end it&#x27;s your job as a consultant or an employee (if you&#x27;re high level enough) to introduce change that will make the company better, if you see an opportunity.<p>Tech stacks crumble underneath their own weight, and if they&#x27;re bad enough, become business risks.

First job was everything XML. We had our open source CMS that stored all documents as XML and used XSLT to transform it into the HTML we needed. Was pretty cool, but there&#x27;s always something that didn&#x27;t fit that paradigm. Some coworkers went a bit overboard and used XSLT to generate the XSLT to create the HTML. But it all works as long as  you cache aggressively.<p>Second was Ruby on Rails with JQuery. And eye-opener for me. Very cool to work with. Third job was similar, but using Groovy instead of Ruby. After that, I ended up in SPA-land: first Angular, then Vue, now React. Backends in either Java or Node.js.<p>I&#x27;m still doing that, only now everything needs to be in Docker and Kubernetes.<p>I still don&#x27;t know why I should ever need microservices. Our GraphQL. We actually considered GraphQL for  previous project, and decided not to because it looked way too complicated. It sounds like it might fit with using a Graph DB (I&#x27;m a big fan of neo4j), but it doesn&#x27;t. At my current project, they made that decision before I joined, and they&#x27;ve since realised that they don&#x27;t need GraphQL after all, but it&#x27;s in there now, so they just work around it.<p>Some of the hypes worked very well for me (XML, jQuery, Ajax, SPA), others seem to work well for others but  not me (docker, kubernetes), and some I really don&#x27;t see the point in (microservices, GraphQL), but I assume there are use cases where they  shine.<p>But don&#x27;t blindly adopt everything.

From ADTs to C structures, there are product types and sum types to encode, along with more or less arbitrary basic types, which have text representation. With XML you get a straightforward way to encode all those, while in JSON there is no single agreed upon method to encode sum types, but you get something like string-indexed arrays (or hash tables) instead, which are normally implemented on top, using simpler types (and are not restricted to strings). And a few arbitrary built-in types, but you have to use strings for others anyway. And no built-in extensibility, so ad hoc hacks are used when it is needed.

The hype that surrounded it was for a good reason, because XML is somewhat unique as a concept. There was nothing like it and still isn’t. It is not a data format or something like that. It is a notation tool. Normally you invent some syntax and parse it to get what is called “abstract syntax tree” (AST). With XML you work directly with an AST. Parsing from text is convenient because you can get a rather concise and elegant result. XML is normally way more verbose, although not that much, if well done. Yet the expressiveness is exactly the same.<p>Notation is what you need when you manually compose some data for machine processing. XML as a data interchange format is a misuse. Yet XML as a data description format is what it is very good at. The difference is that data interchange goes from one machine to another, but data description is what goes from a human to a machine. Data input, in other words. Complex data input. Language-like data input.<p>This is why XML is widely used, for example, in user interface frameworks where you need to describe very elaborate data structures. Markup is another obvious example; here you also have complex data structures tied to a piece of text.

I don&#x27;t think it would have made much fundamental difference if they were never part of the spec and you had to use sub-elements to define such properties, except perhaps for the fact an attribute of a given name can only be declared be once (which an interesting difference between JSON and XML - XML lacks any syntax for declaring arrays, so you must be able to declare multiple sub-elements with the same name).</div><br/><div id="36477056" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36477056" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">madsbuch</span><span>|</span><a href="#36476354">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476766">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476650">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36477056">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36477056">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever thought of it that way<p>as can be seen to the comments to to my comment, there are quite a number of ideas on the ontology of the XML format. when a single screen worth of text on my phone can hold at least 3 strong convictions on how to use a format, then it is doomed to fail.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36476650" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36476650" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">qayxc</span><span>|</span><a href="#36476354">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476531">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476766">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476506">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36476650">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36476650">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  It gives too many levers.<p>I don&#x27;t agree that the horrible XML example is the result of that.<p>There&#x27;s a simple semantic difference between attributes and elements in XML:<p>* there&#x27;s only one instance per attribute<p>* attributes are atomic (i.e. have no children)<p>* attributes are order-independent<p>So whenever your data is atomic, the order in which it appears doesn&#x27;t matter, and you only want one instance, (per element) you&#x27;d use an attribute.

As your data structure gets more and more complex, XML becomes a better way of defining it.<p>By contrast, many JS frameworks which came after XML like backbone, knockout, angular.js (1.x), etc. are eating dust today and will probably never see the light of day again.</div><br/><div id="36476400" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36476400" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">noduerme</span><span>|</span><a href="#36475690">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476038">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476415">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36476400">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36476400">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wasn&#x27;t speaking specifically about XML. If anything, XML is a poor metaphor for the 2010s hype cycle, as it was a much broader early vision to unify storage and web services than what existed at the time, and garnered a lot of industry backing as a potential standard. The fact that we ended up with JSON as a standard really seems like an historical anomaly. But who cares, I used to deal with SOAP, and AMF (which passed actual types, sometimes)... I&#x27;m just happy there&#x27;s a standard, even if it sort of sucks. XML was bound to be a bad standard because it was <i>too</i> eXtensible, but those were the early days of the web.<p>On the other hand, JSX is a fucking abomination on its face. All it does is flip the ugly paradigm of writing inline javascript calls inside your HTML, so now you write your HTML inside JS. It will die in a few years, and so will React just like Angular, because tightly coupling logic to display is nifty but it always exponentially increases technical debt.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36476415" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36476415" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Kwpolska</span><span>|</span><a href="#36475690">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476038">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476400">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36476156">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36476415">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36476415">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wouldn&#x27;t call JSX an XML dialect.

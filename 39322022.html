A bit skittish for sure. The keyword in the whole
essay is &quot;ineffable&quot;.  Creepiness is one of those pre-cognitive
states, awareness before we are able to name it, and the urge to
trepid investigation. The word &quot;curiosity&quot; doesn&#x27;t appear but I think
it belongs in the proximity.<p>Reading some comments here, people had difficulty with the tortuous
prose. That reminds me where literature succeeds over philosophy.  Any
page from Franz Kafka contains, in essential form, this whole essay.<p>While the essay touches the utility of creepiness it doesn&#x27;t venture
into The psychological cost of being creeped out.  Research shows the
extremely deleterious effects of this cluster of such &#x27;gnawing&#x27;
emotions like anxiety.  Those who shrug off surveillance whimpering &quot;I
have nothing to hide&quot; are neck deep in denial and complex defence
mechanisms.<p>In some digital self-defence classes we arrived at &quot;Creepiness is the
new cool&quot; - simply because there&#x27;s so much of it around and everyone
wants to talk about it but lacks a vocabulary. I think that&#x27;s how
Charlie Brooker arrived at Black Mirror, not through any technical
understanding, but observing the dominant emotion in the air.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39323633" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39323633" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kazinator</span><span>|</span><a href="#39324523">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39323157">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39323633">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39323633">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>Being creeped out is a feeling or reaction that is valuable for some other reasons as well.

The whole essay is about how we use the word loosely and existing definitions don’t fit well enough, so publishing a paper that didn’t cover all the (recently, semi-prominently) proposed definitions would be seen as lazy or incomplete. Personally, I think it’s a fun exercise to read through and update your own personal definition as you go. If you’re like me, all these papers start with a “oh well that word is simple and obvious” reaction that slowly disintegrates!<p>Materially; I couldn&#x27;t c&#x2F;p it, but I think their line about “indirect or diffuse danger” that gets right at the crux of the issue. So I’d say I’d find this analysis convincing</div><br/></div></div><div id="39322734" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39322734" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">munificent</span><span>|</span><a href="#39323157">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39322929">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39322734">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39322734">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This paper is almost a parody of philosophical writing. It&#x27;s pages and pages of telling you what it&#x27;s not going to tell you, contrasting it with other things it could tell but chooses not to, mentioning other things others have told you (which will not be repeated here), disagreeing with the claims of other writers (without quite explaining the refutations), telling you what it intends to tell you, telling you in what form it will tell you what it intends to tell you, and then reminding that it told you.<p>I admit I was skimming a bit by the end, but I seemed to have overlooked the part where it actually <i>said</i> anything.</div><br/><div id="39323332" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39323332" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DiscourseFan</span><span>|</span><a href="#39322734">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39322839">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39323332">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39323332">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was trying to see if there were any references to major works on discomfort from a philosophical perspective that I was familiar with, but I couldn&#x27;t find any.<p>I think its constitutive: here we have a field of thought that has spent the last however many years attempting to understand the mind in a sort of isolated, atomized way, now having to grapple with the social reality of thinking, and having little to no resources to draw from, and presumably the author is some poor Master&#x27;s or PhD student who is only familiar with the small segment of materials that their professors and advisors have to offer them.<p>The so-called field of &quot;analytic philosophy,&quot; if such a distinction is even important anymore, has produced numerous studies on Heidegger[0], for instance, who takes the feelings of Anxiety (and boredom) as the ground of Being. Less frequently cited in Philosophy, but common in cognitive science, is Freud--specifically I&#x27;m thinking of his essay &quot;The &#x27;Uncanny&#x27;.&quot;[1] I can think of others who would be more controversial, since they, being, perhaps, too heavily influenced, made such feelings of discomfort and confusion constitutive in their writing, and so many criticize them as being &quot;nonsensical&quot; without realizing how facile such criticisms are...<p>In any case, just as I am familiar with Heidegger and Freud, simply because of who I&#x27;ve come into association with, there is always a universe of thought that I am excluded from in one way or another, so its good to see, regardless, other takes on these subjects. But I agree, this lacks the kind of depth you&#x27;d like to see out of research that addresses this topic.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stephenhicks.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2013&#x2F;03&#x2F;heideggerm-what-is-metaphysics.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stephenhicks.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2013&#x2F;03&#x2F;heid...</a><p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.mit.edu&#x2F;allanmc&#x2F;www&#x2F;freud1.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.mit.edu&#x2F;allanmc&#x2F;www&#x2F;freud1.pdf</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39322839" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39322839" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sdwr</span><span>|</span><a href="#39322734">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39323332">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39323638">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39322839">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39322839">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I see it as a small dog trying to pick up a big stick - he&#x27;s making all the right motions but nothing&#x27;s coming off the ground.<p>I have to believe it&#x27;s written by a young person who knows what papers should look like, but doesn&#x27;t have the life experience to get any leverage on the topic.<p>But yeah, difficult to read, my eyes glanced off like I was trying to read wallpaper.</div><br/><div id="39324484" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39324484" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">iraqmtpizza</span><span>|</span><a href="#39322734">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39322839">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39323090">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39324484">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39324484">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;written by a young person who knows what papers should look like, but doesn&#x27;t have the life experience to get any leverage on the topic<p>So basically an LLM, which by its nature (and often also by external controls) can&#x27;t say anything non-trivial about love, sex, money, or death.

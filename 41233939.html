One of the main new features included in Rome II was combined land and naval battles. Since Empire we’d had naval battles, but they were completely separate from land battles, and the codebase had been developed without any expectation that they might one day be unified. What that meant was that you had one part of the codebase that handled land units and land-based combat, and another part of the codebase that handled ships and naval combat, and neither half had been designed with the other in mind. The battle programming team was asked to deliver combined land and naval battles as a core feature in Rome II, and our lead warned that combining those parts of the codebase would require a lot of the code to be changed, and that it would create a lot of bugs that we would spend most of the project dealing with, and we couldn’t guarantee that it would be stable by the end of the project.<p>&gt; Leadership said to do it anyway.<p>I don&#x27;t really see the leadership problem here to be honest, because of feature is difficult to do (because ambitious) does not mean it does not deserve to be done. I guess the problem was more that the time to execute was too short.

Let&#x27;s face it, the devs also want to have a chill time and develop at their own pace (because it allows them to not stress, slack off, but also because they can focus on quality and the art of it, etc). Management knows about this, they just suffer from a lack of ability to tell the difference between which one the dev is doing when when he asks for &quot;more time&quot;.<p>Either way, you need engineering leadership that has clear goals and priorities.

2) giving up on engineering focus to want to become commercially focused is a big step,  and not one everyone is going to want to take.

And for all of the (valid) criticisms which can be levied at the incomplete state, I am glad many features such as first person command of naval and emplaced artillery ultimately made it in. Due to a modding community, such features become more complete, adding dimensions to amphibious battles which were initially missing.

Thats why they generally suck.<p>While a normal board meeting style development, i feel completely bamboozled by this approach. Indie games in contrast usually start with an MVP, a Minimum Viable Product, to test the basic concept. Then make the basic game loop fun. Then do the rest of the game like maps, sound, graphics, to support the central idea.<p>AAA do all the graphics and maps and sound and AI first, somehow merge it together and just hope that it will be a &quot;good&quot; game, that it will be fun.

Because supposedly it&#x27;s more efficient to pre-plan everything and just trust that it all comes together perfectly (art, level design, system design, engineering, sound, etc) first try rather than leaving time to iterate.<p>Which kind of makes sense when much of generic management takes its cues from automotive manufacturing (assembly lines, Kanban, etc).</div><br/><div id="41264363" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41264363" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throw_nbvc1234</span><span>|</span><a href="#41263819">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41264006">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41263543">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41264363">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41264363">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Interesting in the context of BGIII and its extended early access.

It definitely wasn&#x27;t childhood nostalgia because I only played Rome 1 the year before Rome 2 came out.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s that the lower-fidelity graphics give you more room to imagine, or every settlement being able to be upgraded to the maximum, or the lack of a region system making the world feel bigger.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41263459" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41263459" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thaumasiotes</span><span>|</span><a href="#41263417">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41263794">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41263459">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41263459">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a fun one:<p>&gt; As far as I know, the only significant example of a “human face” gameplay feature that made it into battles was the cinematic mode that allowed players to control an individual unit from a close third person perspective. This was similar to the unit camera that existed in previous Total War games, but arguably worse because it forced the camera very close to the unit, reducing players’ tactical awareness.<p>&gt; During testing it became clear that no-one was using this feature, and design leads were unhappy that a feature they had spent a lot of time on was being ignored by players. They then announced that a combat bonus would be given to units while in this camera mode in order to encourage its use, which prompted controversy with programmers arguing that the camera mode should not influence the outcome of the battle.<p>&gt; Eventually design leadership settled on the following compromise: The user interface would <i>tell</i> players that it gave a combat bonus, but the combat bonus wouldn’t <i>actually</i> be applied. They wanted to explicitly lie to players in order to trick them into using an unpopular feature so that they could save face. I honestly don’t know whether a combat bonus was applied in the end, it’s possible that the button is still lying to this day.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41263794" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41263794" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">satisfice</span><span>|</span><a href="#41263459">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41263352">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41263794">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41263794">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Reading this is bizarre, because I played a lot of Rome II and enjoyed it.

Parts of it are harder to defend (Initial campaign, buggy releases) but the expectations of the fans are arguably a bit crazy. I have 1.8k hours between TWW II + III, which probably isn&#x27;t an outlier of the typical fan i read feedback from as a lurker on &#x2F;r&#x2F;TotalWar.<p>People expect a DLC provide them 100s of hours of new&#x2F;fresh gameplay that will allow them to play the same game for 3-6 months until the next DLC release. Comparatively you could look at the same amount of content and play 50ish hours of game play then set it down and play something else until the next DLC. Even though my play style is closer to the former, I think the expectations of the latter are more healthy. This mismatch of expectations and the pricing of any DLC (which adds in macro factors outside of the Dev&#x27;s control) has lead to such toxicity on the subreddit at times.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting how much that toxicity has subsided in recent months with positive releases, better&#x2F;consistent developer correspondence. Which maybe points to my expectations opinion being a bit wrong.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41263462" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41263462" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lowbloodsugar</span><span>|</span><a href="#41263352">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41263462">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41263462">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Summary: Dunning-Kruger moment, and following it up with complete abdication of any responsibility. Not worth your time to read.<p>&gt;I think the way that most people looked at it was, here’s a developer who’s working on the game and therefore has all of the inside information, so then when it comes out and it’s completely broken, he must have known that everything he was saying wasn’t true.  ...<p>&gt;I think people who don’t work in games will be really surprised to learn that it’s quite possible to work on a project like this and even a couple of months from launch not really have a clear idea at all of what the final game is going to look like.<p>I have worked in games, and that one game where, two months from launch, it was a total shit-show, yeah, we knew it was a shit-show, and we pushed it out a few months, and it was still a shit-show. A fun shit-show, in parts, for which I have fond memories, but still a shit-show. It isn&#x27;t 1988 any more, and it wasn&#x27;t in 2009. If two months from launch your RTS game&#x27;s AI is a shit-show, then two months isn&#x27;t enough time to fix it.<p>&gt;I also think my appearance on Rally Point and my involvement with an important area of development seems to have given the impression that I had some seniority within the team, but this was not the case at all.<p>Then why do the interview, and speak with authority about something you know little about?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

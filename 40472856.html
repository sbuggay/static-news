People have a hard time internalizing intuitions about exponentially evolving situations. If you look at renewables, it went from a cool idea to essentially becoming the fastest growing and soon largest form of energy generation in my life time (nearly 50 years).<p>Solar, has dethroned fossil fuels as the cheapest and most convenient form of energy. It&#x27;s already cheaper than anything else and getting even more cheaper. So, the chaotic period we are going through now has a lot of people in denial about this, ignoring the facts around them, and generally unaware about the wave of renewable technology that is heading their way. This stuff went from &quot;oh it&#x27;s only a fraction of a percent&quot; to &quot;oops, that&#x27;s actually most of the market&quot; since the start of this century.<p>Historically, every big improvement in cost and availability of energy has caused a step change in economic growth. And for the last few hundred years, those step changes have been occurring closer and closer together. The article is a bit over the top but the premise that solar energy represents such a step change is spot on. Orders of magnitude cost reductions are very meaningful and we&#x27;re seeing those happening. And this is not over yet. The article does a pretty good job of outlining how clean energy can displace fossil energy across every economical sector that matters. And not all of it is science fiction.<p>Mostly, this will be driven by raw economics. As energy becomes cheaper, it unlocks larger parts of our economy to be cleaned up. People will do it because it&#x27;s cheaper and those that don&#x27;t adapt are going to be wiped out by their more efficient competitors.<p>The interesting thing is that because of the exponentials, a lot of this is happening way sooner than some people seem to expect. And before somebody gets pedantic, I&#x27;m well aware that they are technically s-curves and that there&#x27;s an eventual flattening of the curves. But we&#x27;re quite far away from that and until then it looks and feels exactly like an exponential. Especially when we are still at or before the bit of the curve where it trends sharply upwards and everything changes dramatically.<p>Raw economics usually win over ideology. There&#x27;s a group of people that ideologically are weirdly passionate about burning fossil fuel because historically that has worked well. They also don&#x27;t believe in climate change, and they represent quite a bit of money and power. This group is doomed to be steam rolled by renewables. Because no matter what they believe, the reality of money is changing the world around them. Even in Texas, which has a lot of these people.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40473353" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40473353" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throw383y8</span><span>|</span><a href="#40473287">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40473279">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40473353">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40473353">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">BS.

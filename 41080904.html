The effect is that the shape of the gamut looks skewed, but only because of how it&#x27;s plotted; the weird skewedness of a typical XYZ chromaticity diagram doesn&#x27;t represent anything real about the data.<p>Instead, a chromaticity diagram is better thought of as a 2D planar slice of a 3D color space, specifically the slice through all three standard unit vectors. From this conception, it&#x27;s much more natural to plot a chromaticity diagram in an equilateral triangle, such as the diagram at [1]. A plot in a triangle makes it clear, for instance, that the full color gamut in XYZ space isn&#x27;t some arbitrary, weird, squished shape, but instead was intentionally chosen in a way that fills the positive octant pretty well given the constraints of human vision.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;777501&#x2F;why-is-the-visible-light-spectrum-different-to-a-hue-wheel&#x2F;777566#777566" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;777501&#x2F;why-is-th...</a></div><br/><div id="41083509" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41083509" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">drmpeg</span><span>|</span><a href="#41082733">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41081764">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41083509">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41083509">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Here&#x27;s a video that shows the concept.

Or alternatively on the sensor side the ability to capture really bright and really dark spots in the same shot, something our sensors are much worse at than our eyes, but you can pull some tricks.<p>Once you have that ability you notice that 8 bits of brightness information isn&#x27;t that much. So you go with 10 bit or 16 bits. Your gamma settings also play a role (the thing that turns your linear color values into exponential values).<p>And of course the people who care about HDR have a big overlap with people who care about colors, so that&#x27;s where your color spaces, certifying and calibrating monitors to match those color spaces etc comes in.

Suppose I set my macbook screen to max brightness, and then open up a normal “white” png.

But then you open another png but of a more special “whiter white”, and suddenly you see your screen actually can go brighter! So you get thoughts like “why is this white brighter”, “how do I trigger it”, “what are the actual limits of my screen”, “is this all some separate hacky code path”, “how come I only see it in images&#x2F;videos, and not UI elements”, “is it possible to make a native Mac ui with that brightness”.<p>In any case, thanks for the answer.

You can imagine that might be a floating point value and that 8 bits per channel might not be enough.<p>The problem you’re describing is that color brightness is relative, but if you want physical units and you have a calibrated display then adjusting your brightness is not allowed, because it would break the calibration.<p>Another reason for HDR is to allow you to change the “exposure” of an image. Imagine you take a photo of the sun with a camera. It clips to white. Most of the time even the whole sky clips to white, and clouds too. With a film camera, once the film is exposed, that’s it. You can’t see the sun or clouds because they got clamped to white. But what if you had a special camera that could see any color value, bright or dark, and you could decide later which parts are white and which are black. That’s what HDR gives you - lots of range, and it’s not necessarily all meant to be visible.<p>In computer graphics, this is useful for the same reason - if you render something with path tracing, you don’t want to expose it and throw away information that happens to get clamped to white. You want to save out the physical units and then simulate the exposure part later, so you don’t have to re-render.<p>So that’s all to say- the concept of HDR isn’t hacky at all, it’s closer to physics, but that can make it a bit harder to use and understand. Others have pointed out that productized HDR can be a confusing array of marketing mumbo jumbo, and that’s true, but not because HDR is messed up, that’s just a thing companies tend to do to consumers when dealing with science and technology.<p>I was introduced to HDR image formats in college while studying physically based rendering, and the first HDR image format I remember was Greg Ward’s .hdr format that is clever- 8 bits mantissa per channel and an 8 bit shared exponent, because if, say, green is way brighter than the other channels, you can’t see the dark detail in red &amp; blue.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41083745" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41083745" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">suzumer</span><span>|</span><a href="#41082131">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41082411">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084278">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41082551">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41083745">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41083745">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">While one commenter had it somewhat right that HDR has to do with how bright&#x2F;dark an image can be, the main thing HDR images specify is how far ABOVE reference white you can display.

Rec 2100 together with rec 2408 specify modern hdr encoding, where 203 nits is 100 percebt white, and above that would be anything brighter (light sources, specular reflection, etc).

In addition, no one perceptually-weighted curve is possible because the human eye is differently sensitive for photopic (bright-light, cone cells) and scotopic (dark-adapted, rod cells), or if the illumination occurs over narrower or wider fields.  Many incremental improvements on these systems have been proposed, but none are part of the authoritative, oversimplified definition of the candela, making it useless for unambiguous definitions that can be agreed upon or binding to any party.  Pronouncements of the CIE are in no way binding on the BIPM, nor vice-versa, and the CIE has a proliferation of &quot;standard curves,&quot; which all disagree with each other.  Agreements to use one curve or another thus have to be agreed <i>outside</i> the definitions of the SI, and, of course, parties can disagree on which curve to use.

The CIE 1931 RGB primaries each stimulate multiple types of cone in human eyes, so the RGB Color Matching Functions (CMFs) don&#x27;t represent individual cone stimulations.<p>However, the CMFs for LMS space[1] <i>do</i> directly represent individual cone stimulations over. Like the CIE RGB CMFs, the LMS CMFs can also be thought of as the required intensities of three primariy colors required to reproduce the color of a given spectrum. The reason these two definitions coorespond for LMS space is that each primary would stimulate only one type of cone. However, unlike CIE RGB, no colors of light which stimulate only one type of cone physically exist.<p>Finally, CIE RGB and LMS space are linear transformations of each other, so the CIE RGB CMFs are linear combinations of the LMS CMFs, so each CIE RGB CMF can be though of as representing a specific linear combination of cone stimulations (the combination excited by the primary color).<p>I often find it easiest to reason about these color spaces in terms of LMS space, since it&#x27;s the most physically straightforward.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;LMS_color_space" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;LMS_color_space</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41082946" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41082946" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jlongster</span><span>|</span><a href="#41082773">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41083003">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084577">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41082946">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41082946">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m the author of the article and the intensity is referring to the level of the light source used in the study to generate the data.

It&#x27;s in considerable contrast to those sections of my textbooks on color theory, they&#x27;re so dry as to make one yawn, they&#x27;re full of algebra, the complex operator and matrices with precious little other explanation of what it all means.<p>Some of the comments have already covered most of what I&#x27;d have mentioned so I won&#x27;t dwell on them now, although I&#x27;d add that I reckon <i>GrantMoyer</i> is on the mark with his point about the inappropriateness of displaying chromaticity on Cartesian coordinates.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that understanding the intricacies of chromaticity and color theory is difficult to the extent that its &#x27;opaqueness&#x27; has been used to protect trade secrets (and likely still is for reasons I&#x27;ll mention in a moment).<p>Commercial lab printers that print masked color negative (neg film with the orange mask) to positives—color photos and color film print stock—go to great lengths to protect their matrices (precision resistor banks) against copying. Similarly, companies like Kodak do not publish the &#x27;film terms&#x27; for their various emulsions (&#x27;film terms&#x27; being the unique matrix information for each film emulsion).<p>The reason for this that to reverse-engineer the matrix with enough accuracy for a single film is a complex job let alone do so for a multitude of different films. Moreover, it&#x27;s imperative the matrix be accurate if good color balance is to be achieved. Keeping this info secret provided a competitive edge, selling or licensing the info is worth money.<p>I&#x27;d add that the destructive orange mask used in color negative film is a brilliant concept for reasons I cannot cover here, however what&#x27;s relevant here is that the mask makes reverse-engineering the negative&#x27;s film terms that much more complicated.<p>I&#x27;m a bit out of touch these days but no doubt the same applies with inkjet printers and the like (matching coordinates to specific inks etc). So there&#x27;s a modicum of truth to statements from Canon, Epson and HP when they say not to use third-party inks because the colors won&#x27;t match properly (mind you, that&#x27;s never stopped me at the exorbitant and outrageous prices they charge for inks).<p>My point is that if it were possible to unravel and make this chromaticity stuff simpler to understand then many of these expensive commercial decisions would disappear.<p>Ahh but alas, we&#x27;re suck with it.<p>—<p><i>BTW, for those who&#x27;ve used scanner software like SilverFast the manufacturer provides a list of film emulsions to select from before the film is scanned. Selecting the correct emulsion type ensures the proper &#x27;film terms&#x27; are used for the scan, this in turn ensures the color balance is optimal.<p>I&#x27;m a bit cynical about SilverFast&#x27;s approach to the problem, they&#x27;ve a limited range of film emulsions to select from (many of the old and important color negative types are missing). SilverFast&#x27;s literature suggests that if one&#x27;s color negative type is not listed then to select one that best suits. I am at a loss how one does that except to just make a guesstimate, so much for calibration. Also, one has to wonder why SilverFast has such a limited range given they&#x27;ve been in the business since many of said emulsions were still in production.<p>There are similar issues with Hamrick&#x27;s VueScan software but I&#x27;ve not time to address them here.<p>Again, all these issues further illustrate the practical complexities surroundibg the chromaticity diagram.</i></div><br/></div></div><div id="41082809" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41082809" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">carlosjobim</span><span>|</span><a href="#41084577">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41081832">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41082809">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41082809">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the explanation is simple: Color is light and it is linear going from ultraviolet to blue to green to yellow to red to infrared.

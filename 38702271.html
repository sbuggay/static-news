Classically, the X compositor would use the GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap extension to import an X pixmap representing a window surface into OpenGL, where it can be used like any other texture. For the Wayland compositor, I believe you&#x27;d use EGL_WL_bind_wayland_display to bind a Wayland surface to an EGLImage, and then glEGLImageTargetTexture2DOES (can&#x27;t believe I have that function name memorized) to bind that EGLImage to an OpenGL texture, where it can be used in the same way. Vulkan has similar extensions.<p>On the client side, I think most Linux apps still draw their UIs on CPU, usually accelerated with SIMD. Firefox and Chrome (I think SkiaGL is enabled on Linux?) are exceptions; they use OpenGL and&#x2F;or Vulkan to draw their UI. Video playback is a different beast and in theory relies on vendor-specific extensions to decode the video in hardware. However, the last time I looked at Linux video decoding (which was years ago), the drivers were awful and interfacing with each vendor&#x27;s APIs was a huge pain, and so most apps just did video decoding on CPU. (Besides, the Linux ecosystem prefers open codecs, and hardware has only recently gotten support for non-patent-encumbered video formats.)</div><br/><div id="38704632" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38704632" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">okanat</span><span>|</span><a href="#38704283">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38704502">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38704955">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38704632">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38704632">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For client side Qt has good GPU support but only for QML.

Last I checked, (non-Android) Linux rarely makes use of this except for the mouse cursor. But in general you can save a good bit of energy and memory bandwidth on HiDPI displays if you try to use 2D hardware layers where you can. You can virtually never use them for the UI itself, because they&#x27;re far too limited, but the windowing system can often use them to composite windows together.

It didn&#x27;t take many frames for that to be worth it.<p>For apps that were animating or otherwise updating it&#x27;s window, most UI toolkits used the GPU for widget rendering. And often the scanout pipes didn&#x27;t hook into the (relatively large) system caches like the GPU did, so there were times it was again faster to composite the screen on the GPU to a single scanout buffer than flush already cached data, the get the scanout hardware to read it back from the memory bus.<p>And there weren&#x27;t as cheap as people thought - one stat I remember was that the total area of the GPU on the omap4 platform was smaller than the display pipes.

You would essentially need a complete rewrite.<p>The bigger issue is that there&#x27;s little reason to farm vector graphics rendering out to the window server in the first place. The main reason would be to avoid a window blit on HiDPI displays. But the tradeoff is that the XRENDER API is all you get, and usually apps have more sophisticated needs than what it can provide. For instance, browsers can&#x27;t really use XRENDER nowadays because there&#x27;s no way to describe CSS 3D transforms in it. And if you use it you&#x27;re at the mercy of the window server to implement it reasonably, which is not a safe assumption. (A lot of the reason Chrome on Linux was faster than Firefox in the early days is that Firefox used XRENDER, while Chrome rendered on CPU. I remember at least one engineer at Mozilla who was bitter about that, after putting in all the work to make Firefox use it only to have it be a net loss.) In any case, you can avoid the window blit by simply using scanout compositing, as detailed in my other reply, so there is really is no compelling reason to reinvent XRENDER.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38704861" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38704861" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">charcircuit</span><span>|</span><a href="#38704283">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38704856">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38704861">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38704861">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The scene graph isn&#x27;t part of the renderer any more than a player object that contains the player&#x27;s location.

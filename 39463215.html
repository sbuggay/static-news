Nice people and they mean well. But in the end the program I mentored in was a dud. As far as I know none of the companies were invested in and the upfront screening wasn&#x27;t great either. I.e. it was obvious to me early on in the program that there were no unicorns anywhere in sight.<p>Not that I&#x27;m an expert on spotting those of course. But as it turns out, my skepticism was justified as there were no investments at the end of the program and few of these companies (if any) survived very long after. I was kind of sad about that because there were a couple of founders I really liked there.<p>Several of the companies actually died early in the program because of the usual founder issues, or the lack of coherent plan. Apparently, none of these issues came up during screening.<p>I&#x27;ve stepped back a little from mentoring (at least for them) because it&#x27;s kind of time consuming and I got the vibe that Techstars took my time a little too much for granted. You get invited to some events and I got the hoody (which is a nice one) and that&#x27;s about the extent of their appreciation or engagement. The promise of a great network (to both mentors and founders) is hard to live up to if you don&#x27;t nurture that network. And there&#x27;s not a lot of that nurturing happening lately.</div><br/><div id="39464737" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39464737" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">buf</span><span>|</span><a href="#39464478">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39464710">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39464737">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39464737">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Having done a Techstars program myself, I was also surprised at some of the companies that were allowed in.</div><br/><div id="39464765" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39464765" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">loceng</span><span>|</span><a href="#39464478">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39464737">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39464710">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39464765">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39464765">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Would that most likely be an artifact of not enough in-flow&#x2F;supply of startups to choose from?<p>If not, a mechanism to let the other participants anonymously vote and rate and comment such things, and then administrators can look at that data - and see what specific admin(s) was&#x2F;were responsible for inviting them in, and then address the issue as close to the core as possible might of helped?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39464710" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39464710" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">buf</span><span>|</span><a href="#39464478">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39464326">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39464710">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39464710">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I did Techstars in London in 2013 (an early cohort there) after spending a decade in the Bay Area. Back then, it felt like the glue holding the entire program together were the founders themselves and one particularly good Techstars staff member.<p>I felt proud going through the program until I learned about the branded programs emerging &quot;Techstars Disney&quot; and &quot;Techstars Barclays&quot;. It felt like the prestige was vanishing, and I rarely mentioned it on my CV afterwards.<p>Funny though, I raised about $1M through the Techstars program, and over $10M through other VCs. The Techstars VCs were the least helpful (but this could have been the London ecosystem at the time. London, these days, is quite good when it comes to early stage, especially some of the syndicates like Ventures Together.

These farms were located less than 10 kilometers from the city center, many of them close to the edge of the Aberdare mountain ranges. In the mid-1990s, when I was in primary school, we were taught that Kenya was a leader in coffee and tea production, and I used to consume coffee almost daily.
Then, all of a sudden, it seemed like one scandal after another emerged—farmers were not being paid, and the industry became overrun by brokers and middlemen. This meant local farmers were cut off from selling their coffee at competitive market rates and instead had to deal with corrupt government officials and brokers.
So, what did the farmers do? Most abandoned coffee farming and converted their farms into prime real estate. Remember, these farms were near the mountain slopes, making the land highly valuable. These new houses became popular with the UN and foreign nationals from Europe and the US, who sought refuge from Nairobi’s “heat.”
As a result, more coffee farms were converted into real estate, and today these areas feature some of the most expensive properties in Kenya. For instance, $200,000 would now be considered cheap for a three-bedroom apartment.</div><br/><div id="42303135" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42303135" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway2037</span><span>|</span><a href="#42301421">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42302521">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42303135">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42303135">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><p><pre><code>    &gt; Most abandoned coffee farming and converted their farms into prime real estate.

So they made more money by selling their farm land, instead of being a farmer?  That sounds like a good trade to me.  This is pretty normal process in all highly developed countries.<p>Related: What do you think Silicon Valley and Los Angeles Valley looked like 100 years ago?  Lots of fruit farms.  Today?  Housing and office buildings -- all considered prime real estate.  Once farming became less valuable than the land, most farmers sold.<p><pre><code>    &gt; Nairobi’s “heat.”

Wow, that is crazy to think about.  Exporting from one developing country to another -- on the other side of the planet, no less!  Why can&#x27;t Côte d&#x27;Ivoire do the processing themselves?

A few years ago, my girlfriend and I started a small coffee shop in Hanoi as a fun side project, and I was struck by the parallels between Vietnam&#x27;s coffee history and the issues you outline here about Kenya.<p>Vietnam, like Kenya, emerged from a coffee industry shaped by colonial-era inequities. Yet through reforms, robust state support for smallholder farmers, and a focus on infrastructure, Vietnam has positioned itself as a global coffee powerhouse. While the initial focus on robusta was quantity-driven, there’s now a shift toward quality, which is helping Vietnamese coffee expand into new markets.<p>Kenya’s situation feels similar yet distinct. It has an unparalleled coffee heritage, and with thoughtful reforms—empowering smallholders, encouraging direct trade, and finding the right balance between quality and disease-resistant hybrids—it could reclaim its standing on the global stage.<p>The article beautifully captures the systemic challenges and the hope for transformation.

This is also why small, high-end coffee shops tend to favor lighter roasts.<p>But even if you&#x27;re a regional chain, you will likely struggle to provide consistent flavor from small batches so you&#x27;ll, at the very least, work with larger farms. At the scale of Starbucks you&#x27;re going to have trouble sourcing anything from a single farm, and you also want <i>year over year</i> consistency. Often small coffee shops pride themselves on short term offerings, because they&#x27;re appealing to an audience that understands and values this. However the average Starbucks consumer not only wants a coffee in Alabama to taste the same as Seattle, but they want coffee in 2025 to taste like they remember from 2015.<p>The only way to achieve this level of consistency and such a scale is to create extremely dark roasts.<p>edit: there are also, of course, flavor related and cultural reasons to choose darker roasts. Italians, for example, tend to favor darker roasts for espresso (in part because they can create blends using varieties like robusta beans, that under a light roast have a &#x27;rubbery&#x27; taste, but can add boldness when mixed in with a dark roasted espresso blend).</div><br/><div id="42302051" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42302051" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bradleyjg</span><span>|</span><a href="#42299633">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42300688">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42301063">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42302051">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42302051">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don’t get the desire for consistently bad.

Acting upon homosexual desires, like all other choices we make, is a personal choice; so long as no one is being forced to do anything, and the object of one&#x27;s desire is sexually mature (each society must define that, itself, but let them be adults, respect their choices, and help them understand the situation), there is no sin there that I know of, except for, perhaps, a bit of greedy waste of sexual energy, but that is ubiquitous, AFAICT.<p>No, what makes a person deserving of hell is to disregard the happiness of others, or to even cruelly create unhappiness via oppression. We are to love one another, not judge them for their personal choices. Besides, it looks to me like many, or perhaps most, gay folks were born that way, in the same way we understand the biology of trans folks&#x27; brains likely differ in ways that are counter to &quot;normal&quot; sexually dimorphic structures (Dr. Robert Sapolsky details this in his freely available Human Behavioral Biology class from Stanford). Regardless, one&#x27;s sexuality (and gender identification) is one&#x27;s own business, so long as what we do is consensual with other adult participants.<p>No one is truly practicing religion if universal compassion is not the teaching or the goal. Of course, liars and hypocrites and the willfully ignorant say otherwise, but what they say doesn&#x27;t count for sh_t. You can identify them because, beyond their ebullient, self-satisfied faces of perceived self-superiority, they are deeply unhappy and very likely to have no power over their own demons. Such is the fate of the cruel hypocrites. When we sow unhappiness, that is what we reap.<p>I disagree with your last paragraph, though. There is only one kind of compassion: gentle, kind, and respectful (at least to some extent), and it is not any one religion&#x27;s purview to determine it. It is a human potential, and a human requirement, required for our personal and societal evolution towards peace and happiness, each and every one of us. Anyone who tells you &quot;their&quot; compassion is special or solely of one path or another is just another over-confident fool who has been deceived into believing their false sense of self-superiority. That way is the way of the oppressors, the tyrants, and their followers who cause so much mischief and misery in this world.<p>But, no, there is no compulsion in religion, so it should never be baked into any govt, but we can and should bake fairness in regulations regarding taxes, income reporting, and even minimum and maximum wages, so that the whole of society is, if not benefitting, at least not harmed by their commerce.

India in 1600 had about a tenth of its present population. To have a population so much larger, agricultural productivity in India, as well as in the rest of the world, had to increase a great deal in the intervening years.<p>Another way is to consider the spread of various conveniencies of life -- refrigerators, motor bikes, microwaves, automobiles -- and affordances they enable. Relatively few people in Bangladesh own motor vehicles, but many of them find work in commercial enterprises that are only possible because of the way that commercial trucks open up the interior to world markets. Something like 12% of the world&#x27;s population has cars today, and that number is steadily increasing. I am not totally certain of this figure, but I believe about two thirds of households in the world have refrigerators.<p>The benefits of modernization are spread very unevenly amongst the world&#x27;s peoples today (and we must acknowledge that another example I offered, of the Pax Romana, conferred many advantages specifically to the Romans) but it is hard to argue that there has not been a tremendous benefit worldwide as a result of changes brought about mostly by colonial powers over the last 400 years or so. The thing to consider is not what life in Bangladesh is like, relative to life in the Denmark (or the UK, &amp;c), but what life in Bangladesh was like 400 years ago.<p>The Europeans do not have it as good as they do -- and, more generally, the world is not so much better off materially -- as a result of simply transferring well-being from one place to another. There were no automobiles, refrigerators, &amp;c, to steal from other countries 400 years. The path to modernity involved real changes in human productivity that allowed for a genuine net benefit.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42302998" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42302998" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">0xDEAFBEAD</span><span>|</span><a href="#42296639">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42301667">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42303180">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42299327">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42302998">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42302998">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;And they continue to be exploited.<p>Poverty isn&#x27;t necessarily exploitation.

The system is pretty convoluted, with multiple layers of middlemen taking a cut before the coffee reaches the international market. The auction system with multiple middlemen and commissions complicates the supply chain, reduces transparency, and delays payments to farmers, discouraging investments in quality. Marketing agents paying allowances to cooperative board members to secure business is a form of corruption that undermines fair trade practices and leads to quality neglect. Despite buyers paying premiums for quality, improvements in processing facilities aren&#x27;t being made. So, even if farmers are trying to produce high-quality coffee, the facilities might not be up to par to handle it properly. The absence of direct relationships between buyers and farmers makes it difficult to hold anybody accountable for quality. The discontinuation of traditional processing methods like double washing, likely due to reduced volumes, may be contributing to quality decline. High financing costs and delayed payments make it challenging for farmers to maintain high-quality standards. The lack of reforms in the coffee export system perpetuates the current problematic structure.

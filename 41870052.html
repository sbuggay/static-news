Aviation, surgery.

Everyone in this thread at time of writing is gleefully indulging in wishful thinking about finally being able to hold the team underperformer accountable, but these expectations are unrealistic. Highly productive individuals do not tend to win the blame game because their inclinations are the exact opposite of the winning strategy. The winning strategy is not to be productive, it&#x27;s to maximize safety margin, which means minimizing responsibility and maximizing barriers to anyone who might ask anything of you. Bureaucracy goes up, not down, and anyone who tries to be productive in this environment gets punished for it.<p>&quot;Blaming the system&quot; doesn&#x27;t prevent bureaucracy from accumulating, obviously, but it does prevent it from accumulating in this particular way and for this particular reason.</div><br/><div id="41893243" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41893243" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Spivak</span><span>|</span><a href="#41889622">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41891032">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41893666">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41893243">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41893243">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you!

It&#x27;s tempting to think about your software design from the top-down, and design a hierarchy of siloed interfaces with encapsulated private data and strictly separated concerns. This looks beautiful on paper, but then in practice you now have to navigate through a sea of objects and abstractions and redundancies - getting anything meaningful done often requires &quot;punching holes&quot; through the siloes so data can be shared.<p>Organizations are the same way. Paul Graham wrote an essay[0] recently about the differences between &quot;founder mode&quot; and &quot;manager mode&quot;. In a nutshell, managers usually think about organizations as silos - we divide up the company into a hierarchy of departments and teams and levels, so that only directors talk to middle managers and only middle managers talk to supervisors and only supervisors talk to the individual contributors. Again, it looks great on paper, and is what most people are used to.<p>But &quot;founder mode&quot; is when someone with a lot of political capital can step in and say, &quot;you know what, I want to talk to the people on the ground. I want to find out what&#x27;s actually going on below the surface in the org, not just the pre-packaged PowerPoint version I hear from my directors. I want to pull together people from across teams and across levels and across departments - whoever is best suited to making this project a success.&quot; I think that sort of &quot;hole punching&quot; can be really powerful, if the company&#x27;s culture is amenable to it.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;foundermode.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;foundermode.html</a></div><br/><div id="41891286" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41891286" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">liquidpele</span><span>|</span><a href="#41889855">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41893646">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41891286">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41891286">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To a founder, the success of the company means their own success.

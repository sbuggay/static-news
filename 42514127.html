Take the characterization of introverts in the article: &quot;They would rather sit in front of the computer than go out during the yearly college social fest.&quot; For me it isn&#x27;t just a matter of &quot;I&#x27;d rather be in front of a computer&quot;, going to a big social encounter is <i>extremely</i> stressful. And the idea of approaching and talking to someone I don&#x27;t know fills me with terror.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say that I never go to such activities, or try to go out of my comfort zone, but it is much, much more difficult for me than even other introverts.<p>If I were Aditya in the introductory story, telling me I should go talk to people would not be helpful, ot would just reinforce my insecurities and anxiety. What <i>would</i> be helpful is if someone, especially someone I at least knew a little came and said something like, &quot;Hey, I hear you like Open Source, can I introduce you to &lt;person&gt;, I think they would like talking with you?&quot; And then introduce me, and initiate the conversation.<p>And there are also difference in how introversion manifests. One person might do fine in social interactions, but is terrified public speaking or giving presentations, and someone else is the other way around.</div><br/><div id="42519858" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42519858" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smsm42</span><span>|</span><a href="#42519706">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42520617">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42519858">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42519858">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s one thing I noticed - the author doesn&#x27;t say &quot;would you like me to introduce you to X who you could talk to about Y?&quot;. He says &quot;hey, go talk to that guy&quot; and thinks he&#x27;s being kind. He&#x27;s not. What Aditya could be hearing is &quot;you&#x27;re some kind of loser, there are so many obvious things any normal person would do, and you are doing none of them. Let me list some ways in which you are a loser. For example, you could be talking to that cool guy and you don&#x27;t. And now that I told you that I&#x27;m going to leave you to soak in your loser-ness while I am going to have fun with my cool friends!&quot;. It&#x27;s probably not what the author meant at all. But that&#x27;s what it easily could become. Aditya clearly has some trouble connecting to strange people, for one reason or another. A kind thing would be to try to help him, not to label him &quot;closed heart&quot; and dismiss him. Of course, nobody owes him that, but if you proudly declare it&#x27;s your job... If you think telling an introvert not having a good time &quot;why don&#x27;t you have a good time! go and have good time right now!&quot; is going to work, you clearly don&#x27;t understand how introverts work.</div><br/><div id="42520376" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42520376" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">robertlagrant</span><span>|</span><a href="#42519706">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42519858">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42520617">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42520376">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42520376">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This doesn&#x27;t seem to relate much to the parent comment.

It&#x27;s only in the last decade or two that it became possible to live a productive live by text, alone, without the intense realtime, full mind and full body experience of being with other people. Use it or lose it.

She thrives on large groups. If she&#x27;s stressed and wants to relax she&#x27;ll go to a party or downtown dance club or hang out with a dozen acquaintances. She&#x27;s been that way since tween. I bring her up because she&#x27;s very upfront, and I trust and believe her, that social engagements alone are NOT, and never have been, hard work or effort. They&#x27;re natural to her, she gains energy from them, she enjoys them tremendously, and gets recharged through them. This is not my external observation but her convincing expression. I know others like that.<p>Then there&#x27;s me :-).   Lot of that, such as parties and dance clubs and even large groups of friends, sounds awful to me. Easy on assumptions though : As per my parallel comment, I&#x27;ve been a client-facing consultant for 20 years. I practice and teach soft skills and emotional intelligence at fairly high level at work. Having started as a hands-on techie for the first decade of my career, I haven&#x27;t written a line of code since 2018 - ALL  I do now is talk to and manage and coach and mentor people, meet with clients, etc. I spend about 7 hrs a day actively engaging people professionally.<p>And it&#x27;s still as draining as it is rewarding and enjoyable. 20 years of active practice and daily high level socialization has not meaningfully moved the needle on whether I gain energy from people, like my sister always has, or drain energy even with people I enjoy doing activity I like.<p>Absolutely there&#x27;s detail and granularity to this - I love teaching and have been a visiting professor for 3 years at local college. I love mentoring and coaching and do it daily. But at the end do the day I strongly crave alone time to recharge after social activities (which is what I call &quot;being an introvert&quot;), whereas I know people (I call them extrovert) who simply don&#x27;t need that, at all. The notion that simply practice can change that, hasn&#x27;t been the case for anybody I know.<p>You can gain <i>skills</i> and that&#x27;s indeed worthwhile! But that does not automatically alter the energy management situation.<p>So my apologies, but your post is the most literal proof that some extroverts <i>don&#x27;t</i> understand this, at all, and like Freud, make wild assumptions based on limited internal experience :-&#x2F;.

You could make the same exact argument about any form of interaction. Don&#x27;t want to interact with the node.js ecosystem? Why not? You will learn so much and grow as a person. Will I? Really? How about a book on group theory? Sure I will probably learn something, will it be useful? maybe, more so than the class I already took on it in college? who knows, certainly not you more than me.<p>Also the idea that people just want to sit in front of the TV and not learn anything new or grow is completely insane and usually only comes up when they aren&#x27;t learning the thing that you want them to know. If it appears like that it&#x27;s only because they are stuck in some system, much like the one you propose, that wants them to learn unactionable knowledge<p>What is the Appearance of Interaction? Just because it&#x27;s very obvious that you are interacting with some group doesn&#x27;t mean that you interact with that group more than some other group that you don&#x27;t know about. If you go to a new website your browser runs some interesting scripts, much like a TV show this attracts your attention, eventually you decide JavaScript is important and you should learn about it. You have entered the JavaScript fandom, it doesn&#x27;t matter to you if gravity acts on you constantly or a krebs cycle complete in your body (~10)^~21 times a second, JS is clearly more useful to know about, right?</div><br/></div></div><div id="42518614" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42518614" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jexe</span><span>|</span><a href="#42518872">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42517161">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42518614">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42518614">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">These labels do as much to hurt ourselves as they do to try and help.<p>The truth (for me at least) is that whether I&#x27;m comfortable and energized by others depends on my level of comfort with the people, my familiarity with the situation, my mood, the general vibe, etc.<p>&quot;Being&quot; one or the other feels like a limiting belief that we can hide behind if we&#x27;re not aware of what it&#x27;s doing to us.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42517161" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42517161" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">j_crick</span><span>|</span><a href="#42518614">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42519898">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42517161">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42517161">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; They use introversion as an excuse to not grow.<p>As if people who the author accuses of this sin have the same definition of, or feel the same about &quot;growing&quot; as the author...</div><br/></div></div><div id="42519898" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42519898" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kstenerud</span><span>|</span><a href="#42517161">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42519348">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42519898">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42519898">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is why I hate the words &quot;introvert&quot; and &quot;extrovert&quot;: everyone can just assume that their personal makeup is &quot;introvert&quot; or &quot;extrovert&quot;.<p>This of course makes for easy straw man arguments to the effect of &quot;Everyone is the same at the core&quot; and &quot;Extroversion is a skill&quot; and &quot;Everyone feels drained&quot;.

For some of us, our natural state LOOKS very unnatural to others. Every interaction requires putting on a facade, because for some reason our natural pose, facial movements, body movements, how we talk, how we smile - ALL of it must be done in a very artificial way in order to &quot;look natural&quot;.<p>And THAT is why it&#x27;s so draining, akin to squatting on one leg. Sure, you can train it so that you could even do it for 20 minutes instead of 4, but evenually it&#x27;s just too much and you need to retreat to a safe place where you can relax your stiff muscles and behave normally for awhile (except for the small group of friends with whom you can just be normal).<p>And if squatting on one leg were the only way you could emotionally reach those you talk to, you&#x27;d do it sparingly - only where it has the most impact.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42519348" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42519348" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">paulmooreparks</span><span>|</span><a href="#42519898">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42520183">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42519348">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42519348">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; everyone should be an extrovert at work<p>No, we shouldn&#x27;t.

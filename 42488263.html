Average member age is down from 69 to 61. Membership is exploding in San Francisco, the Florida Keys, North Carolina, and dozens of other areas, including the bedroom communities of New Jersey, where Eli Manning was just voted to membership. Each of those lodges has a story of where that growth is coming from, yet the impulse remains constant: seeking connections, with people who are not necessarily like them, in dusty old buildings with $2 drafts and animal heads hanging over the doorway.<p>...
&gt; The Elks and similar fraternal organizations were part of a broad trend of “joining” and civic engagement that started in the 1880s, dropped off during the Great Depression, and surged following World War II. “Fraternal organizations,” writes historian Robert D. Putnam, “represented a reaction against the individualism and anomie of this era of rapid social change, asylum from a disordered and uncertain world.” Many provided “material benefits” like life and health insurance, as well as “social solidarity and ritual”; by 1910, more than one-third of adult males over the age of 19 were a member of at least one.<p>&gt;Some, like the Jaycees, the Rotary Club, the Kiwanis, and the Lions, were more explicitly business-oriented; others, like the Odd Fellows, were more invested in providing care for their members; while the Black Elks, Black Moose, and dozens of others developed similarly robust organizations segregated from their white counterparts. The Elks were officially desegregated in 1973, but black members were routinely denied membership through the 1980s. Today, most lodges have diversified: While many, especially in rural areas, remain largely white, there are dozens of clubs whose membership is almost entirely black; in Charlottesville, Virginia, the Elks Club has become “the only real place for black folks to go.”<p>...<p>&gt; The specific lore of the early Elks has filled books, but the bare facts, as presented during a recent Ballard new member orientation, are easier: “Some actors wanted to drink on Sundays, which wasn’t allowed at the time, so they put together a private club so they could succeed at that. Gradually that group started doing more with charity, and a lot more with veterans, but it was pretty much a men’s organization.”<p>&gt; The group voted to name itself the Elks, narrowly defeating the Buffaloes, and borrowed much of its ritual from the Freemasons, then one of the largest organizations in the country. By 1910, Elks done away with almost all of the ritual — including secret handshakes and passwords — and settled into the function they held for much of the 20th century: a group of (white) men, initiated only upon recommendation from another member of the lodge, who paid yearly dues, enjoyed lavish facilities built with those dues, and donated time and money to local, state, and national charities.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42492744" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42492744" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">portaouflop</span><span>|</span><a href="#42492097">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42492417">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42492440">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42492253">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42492744">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42492744">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Having a local place where people live is illegal?

I have visited the Emerald Isle a couple of times, North and South, from the UK.<p>I found a culture that is definitely different in some ways but just as familiar in most ways.  Just as I do in Wales and Scotland.<p>For example we all share a strange obsession with the weather.  Obviously we don&#x27;t really but the standard rules of chatting about the weather enables an easy start and disengagement from a social encounter.  We also suffer from an inability to stop saying goodbye ...<p>Pub culture as a whole is changing massively.  I remember when Ireland banned fags in pubs (a fag is a cigarette).  I used to smoke and found it a bit odd having to go outside.  Then the UK followed suit.  With hindsight, I don&#x27;t miss quite a lot of the &quot;good old days&quot; of smoke filled rooms that even a tabber&#x27;s eyes would nearly be bleeding.  Brown stained wooden chairs with plum or mustard upholstery and worryingly sticky floors and tables.<p>I remember chatting to a landlord of my local at the time around 1998.  The boozer was called the Globe Trotters (Yeovil, Somerset, UK).  It was formerly a cider house called the Globe and now its a modern effort called ... the Globe and Crown.  The landlord described how he had to get rid of the &quot;old boys&quot; who would sit in the corner and quietly piss themselves whilst talking bollocks.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m not sure what pub culture is these days.  It probably died of COPD a few years ago.<p>Despite all that, I do think that the Stammtisch ideal is alive and well in our very odd corner of Western Europe.  We just don&#x27;t give it a name.  Perhaps we should.  The nearest thing I can think of is pub sports - darts, pool, snooker etc.<p>I&#x27;ve been playing pool badly for a team for a good 25 years now.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42492388" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42492388" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">elric</span><span>|</span><a href="#42488311">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42492686">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42492388">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42492388">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Similar thing in Belgium: &quot;stamcafé&quot; or &quot;stamkroeg&quot; in Dutch.

A bit more than a decade ago, the QNX source code was available to the public. Back then, QNX had a vibrant open source community. People would experiment with the kernel, write various useful utilities and help each other in forums. QNX even had a fully featured Desktop GUI, ran Firefox and was self-hosting, so you could develop for QNX right on QNX itself with full IDE and compiler support. It was beautiful.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;Then QNX was bought, source code access was revoked and the community largely withered away. Questions were increasingly asked via private support tickets directly to QNX, locked away from the public. QNX know-how becomes harder and harder to acquire, open source software for modern QNX releases is essentially non-existent and the driver situation is a catastrophe. The QNX kernel is the most beautiful and interesting kernel I have ever had the pleasure of working with, but it lies in the shackles of corporate ownership.&quot;</i><p>It&#x27;s sad.<p>QNX was originally an independent company. During that period, anyone could get a free copy of QNX for personal use. It wasn&#x27;t open source, but it was available. It&#x27;s POSIX-compatible, so it was a supported target for Gnu, Firefox, and Eclipse. We used QNX for our DARPA Grand Challenge vehicle in 2003-2005, and all that code was developed on desktop QNX.<p>Then QNX was acquired by Harmon, the successor to Harmon-Kardon, which once made home audio components and pivoted to car audio. They were thinking car infotainment. Harmon didn&#x27;t really know what to do with an operating system, especially since the big market was systems for industrial control and point of sale. So eventually they opened the source.<p>Then QNX was acquired by Blackberry, the early smartphone company. They closed the source, very suddenly. They even killed off the free version for personal and educational use. So all third party open source development stopped. Blackberry eventually shipped a phone that ran QNX, but they were not powerful enough as a company to keep a third phone standard going. So Blackberry went to Android.<p>Blackberry killed off the self-hosted desktop environment, and users now had to cross-compile from Windows.<p>And QNX became more of a niche product than ever.</div><br/><div id="40839373" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40839373" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">akira2501</span><span>|</span><a href="#40838817">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40843498">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40839373">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40839373">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; but they were not powerful enough as a company to keep a third phone standard going.<p>They absolutely were,  which is the tragedy of the whole thing,  people absolutely loved their products and strongly preferred them to everything else on the market.<p>Instead of recognizing the game changer that the iPhone was they slept on the market and didn&#x27;t do much to bring big touch screens and rich internet applications to their platform.<p>It was a slow and agonizing death.</div><br/><div id="40841399" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40841399" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jasoneckert</span><span>|</span><a href="#40838817">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40839373">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40840364">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40841399">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40841399">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They may have been powerful enough in size and monetary resources, but not in process, structure, or vision.

I was shocked. But it never, ever has. I’ve been after myself on this score for, what, like ten years? Had it ever worked once in that time, I asked myself. No!<p>I had a similar realisation a few years ago. I used to try to come up with side project ideas by sitting down with a piece of paper and writing down every idea I could think of. Then, I’d decide which of these ideas seemed in the realm of possibility for me with my current skill set. Out of that whittled-down list, I’d then choose the idea that I thought would have the most chance of success.<p>The problem? I could never remain motivated. It turned out that I had invented a formula for choosing ideas that neither extended my skills nor spoke to my inner curiosity. Things only changed when I asked myself the question “has this ever worked for me in the past? Even once?”<p>I decided my new philosophy was to work on whatever I was most curious about — even if it seemed way too hard for me, or if everyone else thought it was stupid. I haven’t exactly made millions of dollars from this approach, but I’ve learned more in the past four years (and had more fun doing it) than I did in the previous 10.<p>It makes me wonder what other things I might be doing out of habit that have never actually worked.</div><br/><div id="36009718" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36009718" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jcadam</span><span>|</span><a href="#36008961">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36010189">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36009718">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36009718">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I used to spend a lot of my spare time on side projects, thinking I&#x27;d hit on something successful eventually.<p>Now, I&#x27;m in my 40s and I&#x27;m like &quot;Done with work; I think I&#x27;ll go for a walk and then take a nap.&quot;</div><br/><div id="36010122" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36010122" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ChuckNorris89</span><span>|</span><a href="#36008961">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36009718">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36010189">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36010122">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36010122">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt;Now, I&#x27;m in my 40s and I&#x27;m like &quot;Done with work; I think I&#x27;ll go for a walk and then take a nap.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m in my early thirties and never had any side projects. After busting my ass coding like hell for 6 years in university and after 8 hours of coding at work per day, I was always seeking to do non-coding activities in my free time: trying out new hobbies, going for a walk, having drinks with friends and going dancing, dating, witching a movie, jerking off, cooking, reading, hiking, SLEEPING!  etc.<p>This hurt my chances of getting into flashy well paying VC funded agile scale-ups where every applicant was a 20-something with a huge GitHub portfolio, but, and I hope I don&#x27;t offend anyone, life is too short to spend my free time doing things I don&#x27;t enjoy, just to look good in front of $COMPANY, that will lay you off the next day if &#x27;line goes down&#x27;, so I narrow my job search at companies where coding is done for the paycheck, not for the lifestyle.<p>I do spend my free time sometimes tinkering with various linux distros and DEs, and sometimes reverse engineering, but moistly working on  hardware projects to build to increase my comfort around the house like a tap-water to air apartment AC cooling unit for the summer.

One of them is &quot;income&quot;. If I need to do a task that might take me an hour to finish, but a week to start, I say to myself: that&#x27;s part of your income.

I dropped all routine and started compare how my day  evolves according to my fundamental priorities right now: health, income, hobby.<p>All is about the motivation.

But often we enjoy where we want to go more than what we have to do to get there. I want a clean house more than I want to clean it, which is why I take action to clean it every day.<p>The problem comes when we aren’t in tune with what we really want, and we can’t make the choice about what’s required of us. It’s <i>okay</i> to accept that you don’t want to be someone who meditates every day. Or that you want to eat and drink more than you want six pack abs. Be honest about what <i>you</i> want, without influence from the expectations of other people, culture, or tradition.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36009590" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36009590" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">the_only_law</span><span>|</span><a href="#36009905">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36009590">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36009590">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If I’m not mean to myself though, I get too arrogant.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

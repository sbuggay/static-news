In the face of a potential boondoggle project, the discovery phase may be close to the last time your company turns a profit on a project.<p>Why not get the payments for helping them define the project requirements, and then if you still smell boondoggle, you can quote them an estimate that you can actually profit on but may make them run to a competitor for a lower bid. Now your calendar is clear for projects you’ll actually make money on, plus one of your competitors now can’t compete as well on your next bid.<p>But he ran into the same problem: an explicit discovery phase gets summarily rejected. Even though it would benefit everyone. I suspect deep down they know what they’re asking and they want to trick you into saying yes and getting sunk cost fallacy before you sober up and start telling them no.</div><br/><div id="41806599" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41806599" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AmericanChopper</span><span>|</span><a href="#41806449">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41806342">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41806599">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41806599">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree that it usually doesn’t fly with clients, unless you already have a good relationship and track record with them. But I don’t think it’s supposed to be a trick. On the client side somebody either has some funding for a project and needs to know whether you can deliver within the budget, or they need to go and apply for some funding to complete the project, but in either case the deliverable they’re committing to provide in exchange for this funding is the completed project, not a scope for the project.<p>From that perspective the “discovery project” is just a much worse version of “contact us for pricing”, it’s “pay us $5,000-$20,000 or more for pricing”. Paying a lot of money to find out how much something will cost, or what you’re going to get from it (if anything) just isn’t a valuable proposition to a lot of people, and doesn’t fit in nicely with their existing business processes.</div><br/><div id="41806944" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41806944" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hinkley</span><span>|</span><a href="#41806449">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41806599">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41806796">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41806944">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41806944">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The deal is that you’d have to provide the customer not just with a price quote but a complete requirements doc based upon the discovery.

This will no doubt vary by country&#x2F;region&#x2F;industry quite a bit, but it&#x27;s almost a given for my customer base, public and private sector.<p>On the other hand, fixed price quotes can also be a little less than transparent, and clients like transparency about how you&#x27;re charging.<p>I use the best of both worlds:<p>- Bigger jobs: anything more than 5 days, I quote a fixed cost, BUT I provided my estimated work effort in days in the quote and client can deduce my rate from there.<p>If I do it quicker, great, client is not worried, they already agreed to the quote, and I&#x27;m incentivised to be efficient (but also maintain quality or I wouldn&#x27;t get the repeat business). If a job goes a bit longer, well that&#x27;s on me and my estimates as a first point. Over the years I&#x27;ve got quite good at estimating work effort, and antipating issues and things that will slow projects down, so there&#x27;s really been few issues with this approach. As a second point, if something is really going long I can just ask for a variation. Usually I will only need to do this if there&#x27;s a strong justification, and in 100% of those situation the client has approved extra charges.<p>- Small jobs: just a fixed price<p>This is for simplicity and because small jobs have a disproportionate amount of admin and project mgmt overhead. Rather than inflating my rates for small jobs I would rather just pick a reasonable total price and then make it work at my end.<p>No real issues with this in over 12+ years of technology consulting. The one minor thing is when I&#x27;m subtracting to a company that does NOT like to be transparent, and then I&#x27;m basically arming them with the information to take advantage of me. So here and there I&#x27;ve had my services marked up 30-50% from what I&#x27;m charging (up to 20% is reasonable) but it&#x27;s a relatively rare situation.<p>Note: internally I always track time in 15 minute increments and round up or down. So I also have the data if it&#x27;s asked for but more importantly the ability to see if I&#x27;m on budget and if my quoting is accurate.</div><br/><div id="41806548" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41806548" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nickff</span><span>|</span><a href="#41806410">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41806494">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41806548">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41806548">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">“Please don&#x27;t use uppercase for emphasis.

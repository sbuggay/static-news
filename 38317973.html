well; they tried to understand my intent and purpose of the writing and noted places where i didn’t quite meet my intent or there were better ways to express it.<p>i got into programming later on in life and i would equate the process to a good code review. it can be strict and intimidating given it’s a critique of how you express yourself in the medium, but the strictest code reviews are immensely important for my growth as a programmer, and even more so as a writer as writing with human written languages is a lot more “open” in many ways with less strictly defined methods of accomplishing a task.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38330151" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38330151" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">082349872349872</span><span>|</span><a href="#38330432">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38329793">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38330151">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38330151">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Benjamin Franklin would take a reverse outline of an article he liked, and use it (after a few days) to compose his own version of the article, after which he&#x27;d compare them side-by-side in order to see where he might improve his own writing.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

I&#x27;ve been defibrillated twice, the first time after an out-of-hospital VF episode, which has a 1-in-5 survival rate. The second time was by an implanted defibrillator. In that episode I had no more than five seconds from awareness that I was feeling faint to passing out.<p>I now accept that it could happen again at essentially any time, and that the defibrillation might not work. And yet my life continues pretty much as normal (although I&#x27;m no longer able to drive).

I refer to it as “existential dread.” I’m a Christian, but I’m not free of doubt. And when I have these moments of existential dread my beliefs feel so absurd. It usually starts with immense fear at the thought of death, and of nothing being beyond that, like you describe. But then it spirals into the absurdity of everything. The fact that I’m a sentient ape on a spinning ball just feels … nonsensical. In these moments the only thing that makes sense is for nothing to exist at all.<p>I try to take comfort in the fact that, as crazy as it seems, I really am a sentient ape on a spinning ball. My experiences right here, right now, prove that there is something instead of nothing. And things don’t have to make sense to me for things to be real. In fact, whatever the absolute truth of the universe is, it’s probably too complex for us to comprehend, let alone for us to figure out. Even as a Christian, I accept that large parts of my beliefs are completely wrong, or at best simplifications. Because the absolute truth is something beyond understanding.<p>I don’t know, saying it out loud doesn’t feel very comforting. I had a bit of an attack of existential dread typing this out.

I find myself torn between the absurdity of life and being an sentient monkey in a seemingly endless universe, and then considering the other side, infinite nothingness - or nothing existing at all.

This might be e.g. by purely experiencing Y and ¬X at the same time (e.g. being bullied for ¬X, being in a overwhelmed state - think not enough met bodily needs, not enough slept, too much stress, too much hangover etc - and focusing on ¬X), explicitly arguing for the validity of the implication in some discussion (e.g. “People who chose to ¬X leads to Y, as we learned by reasons Z”).<p>The pitfall here is that once Y is concerned, it can for many of us be very difficult to stay rational. That is, because Y was in this recursive way already associated with the topic of bodily safety. And as we know, in war and love there are no rules, so basically one run risk of associating many many new ¬X to Y, which then themselves become new Y for the next recursive step, because the reasons Z seem to be true while they might be not.<p>And I get it, let’s not take chances, we might be playing with our lives here and end up without a partner, without a long list of exciting experiences, bad health etc.<p>But where is the end to this style of thinking? Eventually people realize this and stop conditioning themselves and others to new “Shoulds”, but what I see with many is that the huge stock of already conditioned Ys is not worked against, rather, they continue to seek to fill the Shoulds they already collected and lower the rate of adding new baggage of Shoulds.<p>The approach I chose is to be as conscious as possible (e.g. do all the things they say, eat well, sports, meditations, journaling etc etc) in order to witness - on a meta level if you will - when my behavior is a function of the “Y makes me feel unsafe” schema. And then, consciously and hard not to fulfill it and instead seek other ways to make me feel safe. Then I have the chance to break the conditioned association, stop adding new baggage, and slowly reverse the huge amount of Shoulds that exist in my cognition.<p>So to sum it up, it’s not sitting down and actively thinking “Should I really?”, it’s more like “I probably believe I should because I’m scared. Let’s remove being scared to wash out the interference. Then let’s lay out whether I really should”.<p>And most often, the answer really is “No, I shouldn’t”.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36701431" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36701431" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">enw</span><span>|</span><a href="#36700943">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36701762">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36703074">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36701431">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36701431">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Life is absurd.

It can also feel quite long in certain stretches, particularly when you are in any kind of agony (whether physical, emotional, or in your case philosophical). But ultimately it is quite short, especially compared to the scale of things we can be aware of but not directly perceive. It is a painful realization, but usually this pain passes. It will pass more quickly if you don&#x27;t try to fight it, eg by trying to figure out a solution or by wallowing.<p>It is repeated acts of acceptance that will get you through this painful realization. It is even possible to become cheerful about the whole endeavor. But the first step is to stop bashing your head against the brick wall of reality thinking that somehow helps you to keep doing it. Accept and experience the pain of your realization, as deeply as you need to, but stop wallowing and digging yourself deeper into the unpleasantness of it.<p>Of course you can lose yourself entirely if you devote your life to plumbing the depths of sadness that can be evoked by staying locked into all the loss you will ever experience as often as you can. Choose not to do that. It doesn&#x27;t help anything, and it hurts far more than necessary like digging into an open wound for days and weeks on end. It doesn&#x27;t mean pretending the reality away. Just experience the pain and move on with your day.<p>Eventually, like an adult who no longer breaks down in tears over a stubbed toe, you&#x27;ll get used to experiencing the pain without it effecting your mind too much. You might even give a sad, knowing smile to yourself from time to time when these thoughts arise. This is the first signs you are on the track to cheerful acceptance of our mortality, which is an incredible tool to have in life.<p>Good luck with your profound struggles, and may they lead you somewhere worthwhile!</div><br/><div id="36704884" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36704884" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TedDoesntTalk</span><span>|</span><a href="#36700943">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36703074">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36701758">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36704884">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36704884">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Very helpful.

On reading more, it seems the bees build up electric charge which interacts with the antennae on other bees.<p>Excerpt [1]:<p>&gt; Honeybees accumulate an electric charge during flying. Bees emit constant and modulated electric fields during the waggle dance. Both low- and high-frequency components emitted by dancing bees induce passive antennal movements in stationary bees. The electrically charged flagella of mechanoreceptor cells are moved by electric fields and more strongly so if sound and electric fields interact. Recordings from axons of the Johnston&#x27;s organ indicate its sensitivity to electric fields. Therefore, it has been suggested that electric fields emanating from the surface charge of bees stimulate mechanoreceptors and may play a role in social communication during the waggle dance.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Waggle_dance#Mechanism" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Waggle_dance#Mechanism</a></div><br/><div id="36705433" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36705433" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pulpfictional</span><span>|</span><a href="#36702426">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36706233">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36705433">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36705433">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is amazing.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36706233" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36706233" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Scarblac</span><span>|</span><a href="#36702426">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36701831">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36706233">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36706233">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One of the reasons why Terry Pratchett&#x27;s _Discworld_ books are so beloved by its fans is that he was very widely read, and put lots of things in his books where you go &quot;ha, nice world building, gives his fantasy world a good fantasy like feel&quot; and then later find out he just took something real and copied it.<p>This practice is in _Carpe Jugulum_, IIRC.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36701831" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36701831" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">theiz</span><span>|</span><a href="#36706233">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36705726">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36701831">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36701831">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This does need the context that you would communicate much more with your hive then just death and weddings.

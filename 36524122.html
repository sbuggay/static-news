In popular use, these are so-called party drugs, and users often have no idea what they&#x27;re taking (amphetamines and ketamine have been commonly sold as MDMA).  I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;ve been lumped in with true psychedelics so frequently, but they&#x27;re much more likely to be used recreationally as a replacement for alcohol, cocaine, etc.<p>Secondly, I think naive users should be aware that the true psychedelics are indeed dangerous if not treated with caution and respect, in the same sense that a motorcycle is.  Drive a motorcycle too fast, bad things happen. Ingesting a large amount of psychedelics is similar.  There are at least two particular dangers: immediately, a psychedelic overdose leaves the user ambulatory, so they can end up falling off cliffs, walking into traffic, and otherwise oblivious to dangerous situations.  Secondly, some people have traumatic responses to very large doses of psychedelics that can take months to recover from (dissociation from reality, paranoia, etc.).<p>Still, I think these drugs can be immensely beneficial and people should be able to access them, much as people should be able to drive motorcycles.  Perhaps one solution is that they should only be supplied in low dosage packaging (aka microdose amounts), such that people don&#x27;t accidentally take large doses with the common unfortunate consequences.

Whatâs funny is earlier that day I had just told my friends âI know this sounds boring but I donât like dancing that much.â Then while I was tripping I found that I was really enjoying the dancing. I felt like I was tapping in to a part of myself that had been dormant for a long time. I felt really confident and cool and sexy dancing to the music, and had a wonderful time. The thing about this is that in the subsequent weeks and to this day the confidence is still here. I have come to realize that the pandemic messed me up in ways that I hadnât even realized! Iâm pretty in touch with myself - I go to therapy once a week but Iâm usually talking about work and relationships. Dating in particular felt hard and I didnât know why, but since rediscovering my confidence dating has been going very well for me. Now when I talk to people I like Iâm finding them asking me for my number or asking me out. I had a cute friend Iâve been crushing on for a while nervously ask me for a kiss!<p>The point is that there are parts of us that are nearly accessible but our brain pathways need a little temporary loosening to strengthen some of those pathways, and psychedelics can do just that. Theyâre no panacea and it takes some experience to really gain the desired effects. But they can also just be enjoyable and theyâre generally harmless, and itâs such a shame that theyâre so stigmatized. I live in Oakland where they have decriminalized mushrooms and Iâd like to see more decriminalization and ultimately legalization of mushrooms, LSD, and more.<p>I have a friend who has been doing legal ketamine therapy under the care of their therapist and it has helped them realize the ways in which they had been hanging on to old relationships which were holding them back. Theyâre finding out how to advocate for their own needs and theyâre much happier for it.<p>Weâve got a crisis of unhappiness in this country and psychedelic therapies are absolutely a powerful tool we could use to help people find themselves.<p>Though I should say, probably because I just listened to a bunch of Noam Chomsky last night, that allowing broad swaths of the population to become more deeply in touch with their core needs threatens the status quo and current power dynamics.

Individuals and companies want you to think that whatever they are selling will make you happy. Politicians want you to think you need them to do good in the world. Your neighbors want you to be impressed with their good values and status.<p>In my experience and opinion, once people escape, the behavior changes in that they start actually doing things that make them happy, opposed to things that they are told <i>should</i> make them happy.

I don&#x27;t think the phenomenon is unique to the United States, but I do think it is more pronounced here. I too have met people that live on less than a dollar a day and are happier than people making six or seven figures.<p>When I say everyone is selling it, what I mean is that if they have bought into it, they are propagating it as a normative worldview. I think is accurate and the only way such ideas survive. It is systemic and relies on Broad acceptance. At the center, it depends on hundreds of millions of people believing in it.<p>It is helpful to step outside of that system and get a radically different perspective. Psychedelics are just one way to do this, and probably not even the best. The challenge is that even after experiencing that perspective, you step back into a world where everyone believes something different and you start to forget.<p>The solution is pretty simple. For one you have to make an intentional effort to be present in your life and live it in a way you find meaningful, despite external forces trying to convince you otherwise. Second, you have to surround yourself with friends and loved ones that reinforce this healthy world view.<p>In the end, I think I&#x27;m less cynical than you are. I don&#x27;t think there are more powerful tools for mind control waiting to be deployed. I also don&#x27;t think it would be a bumpy ride if more people took control of their lives to improve their happiness.

I had literally forgotten that I am cool and sexy and this led to insecurity around other cool and sexy people I liked. Once I remembered that I am also cool and sexy, I was able to see myself on an even playing field with the people I like and there was simply no cause for insecurity.<p>I will certainly do psychedelics again tho. When done with intention and maturity theyâre fun, harmless, and have generally always been positive and emotionally productive for me. Some years ago I had a mushroom trip that was emotionally challenging, but reminded me of the mortality of my aging parents. This led me to make more of an effort to see them and spend time with them. Thatâs a wonderful outcome.<p>The thing about psychedelics is that they basically work by loosening up your brainâs âdefault mode networkâ which is the set of pathways you use to make decisions. By loosening up this network you can find adjacent connections that were almost there but had not quite clicked. So they are a tool to help you find things you have been missing. This is something I will continue to explore. On a more basic level, I found that a small dose of LSD at a dance party is very enjoyable and way better for me personally than drinking alcohol or consuming marijuana. Not that I need substances to have fun, but sometimes thatâs a fun way to spend an evening.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36554324" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36554324" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">triyambakam</span><span>|</span><a href="#36553504">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36557326">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36554324">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36554324">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I have met others who only stand and look at you blankly, who have lost their desire, even their self-respect.

He has arrived at this state through many years of practice in concentration, meditation and contemplation, many years of building strong nerve fiber. But in a momentary high on LSD or any other powerful psychedelic, such as mushrooms, peyote, ecstasy or DMT, the nerve structure is strained, in a sense which we can best describe as abnormal, to allow the individual to reach this exalted consciousness. Coming out of it, the result is often a kind of shock in which the person has a great difficulty in readjusting to any kind of normal routine.

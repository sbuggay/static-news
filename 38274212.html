Apple has the resources to go into a lot of businesses they don’t necessarily want to be in and they seem happy enough with the Google arrangement. They like to own and control the technologies core to their products, but even they have to draw a line otherwise they’d be building and running their own fabs.<p>Plus Microsoft also has a lot of money and talent and have been in the search business a very long time. Bing still sucks. Windows Live Search sucked before it, and MSN search before that. There’s no guarantee Apple could meet or beat the threshold of being at least as good as Google, only that they could, technically, if they wanted to, develop their own, and then they would be the ones the DOJ is going after over the default search engine in Safari (not to mention the punks on the EC would probably find some new law to craft targeting Apple, so it had really better be worth the investment if they were ever going to build a search engine because the price for doing so is going up).</div><br/><div id="38274597" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38274597" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bobthepanda</span><span>|</span><a href="#38274490">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38274544">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38274593">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38274597">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38274597">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The other thing is that it&#x27;s not clear what differentiation, if any, Apple could possibly want to target in Search.<p>Apple Maps is sometimes nicer to use than Google Maps, but also was developed because at one point Google refused to give Apple turn-by-turn navigation, which would make it hard to sell iPhones as a phone with equal GPS capabilities as Android.

I like (love) that Apple is NOT in the advertising business and fewer phd engineers obsess about how they can make me click&#x2F;view more ads.<p>Maybe Kagi proofs that &quot;search&quot; could also be financed by a premium subscription? Or being a system service which is subsidized like Siri? But I think the ad-model is the most easiest&#x2F;profitable for search so there is always a pull to it.</div><br/><div id="38274686" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38274686" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cmehdy</span><span>|</span><a href="#38274490">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38274593">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38274659">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38274686">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38274686">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Doesn&#x27;t Apple make billions selling ads?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appleinsider.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;22&#x2F;06&#x2F;15&#x2F;apple-ad-business-could-reach-6b-by-2025-with-41b-from-search-ads" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appleinsider.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;22&#x2F;06&#x2F;15&#x2F;apple-ad-business...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38274659" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38274659" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jampekka</span><span>|</span><a href="#38274490">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38274593">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38274600">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38274659">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38274659">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Isn&#x27;t the obvious reason that search is perhaps the best service to sell ads for?

Google stickyness is because it is free using us as product just like Meta. If you forho it being free, Kagi and You.com are great alternative. DDG is also free but due to way it monetize, it lacks a lot of features to what Kagi and You provides.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38274598" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38274598" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">matesz</span><span>|</span><a href="#38274600">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38274496">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38274598">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38274598">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If potential antitrust case againts Google search would be valid, could it be mitigated with Google making google search as a platform?<p>For example another company could run google search on example.com and give let&#x27;s say percentage of that revenue back to Google?</div><br/></div></div><div id="38274496" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38274496" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gmurphy</span><span>|</span><a href="#38274598">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38274496">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38274496">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">FWIW, the initial versions of Chrome did not have Google as the default search provider - the first run experience had a dialog that made you choose between the top three search engines in your locale</div><br/><div id="38274516" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38274516" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cookiengineer</span><span>|</span><a href="#38274496">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38274516">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38274516">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">All of those choices were bought in and had to pay the most amount for that region to win.<p>Google later even refused to say what the competitors were paying for that rank, so they probably just overbid themselves for a while now.<p>Note that they do this for Android, too.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

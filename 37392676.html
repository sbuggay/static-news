My team and I are looking forward to continuing to engage with you for at least a few more hours.<p>Just a reminder: As fun as discussing this in here with you is, the best way to influence what the FCC ends up doing is to file an official comment by September 25th at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcc.gov&#x2F;ecfs&#x2F;search&#x2F;docket-detail&#x2F;23-239" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcc.gov&#x2F;ecfs&#x2F;search&#x2F;docket-detail&#x2F;23-239</a> . Click to file either an ‘express’ comment (type into a textbox) or a ‘standard’ comment (upload a PDF). The FCC is required to address your arguments when it issues its final rules. All options are on the table, so don’t hold back, but do make your arguments as clear as possible so even lawyers can understand them. If you have a qualification (line of work, special degree, years of experience, etc.) that would bolster the credibility of your official comment, be sure to mention that, but the only necessary qualification is being an interested member of the public.<p>Finally, I&#x27;d like to extend a special thanks to dang and the rest of the HN team for their help putting this together.

The correct analogy would be if someone documented all the ways to rob a house that is currently mass-produced and sold on the market. And yes, as a consumer I most certainly would approve of such activity, especially if I&#x27;ve yet to make a purchasing decision. Or especially if I&#x27;m already living in such a house, I need to know that it is not safe.</div><br/><div id="37398692" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37398692" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">EricMausler</span><span>|</span><a href="#37393252">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37397556">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37400825">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37398692">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37398692">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In that scenario I would MUCH rather the company be aware someone is putting that lust together, notfiy me in advance of the research being concluded, provide updates, organize and manage the contents of that list, offer solutions, patch the fixes in new models, and generally work with the people who already purchased the house.<p>I would not prefer someone to do it all in secret and then at the last second decide they want to inform the company.<p>Once such a thing gets broadcasted, there is inherent risk created for a lot of those existing owners that did not exist.

For one thing, casing someone&#x27;s home is not interesting research. It&#x27;s not news to anyone that locks only keep honest people out. You need physical access to break in. The legal system and the people nearby (neighbors and residents, and their firearms in the USA) are the main lines of defense here. Unlocked doors are a harm targeting one household.<p>Conversely, with vulnerable IoT devices, we&#x27;re talking about internet-connected devices. The potential harm is to everyone on the Internet, not just one household, when they&#x27;re taken over and made part of a botnet. An attacker can exploit them from anywhere in the world, including residents of hostile jurisdictions that are tolerant (or actively supportive) of such activity. Russia, North Korea, Iran, etc. The protections people have relied on for centuries to defend their residences from bad guys don&#x27;t apply anymore.<p>These IoT devices can also be used to gain a foothold in your home network, which are usually flat networks. It&#x27;s surprisingly difficult to find a &quot;router&quot; for home use at a reasonable price point that can setup VLANs, by the way. Even as a technical person.<p>The better analogy IMO is to building codes, where your property rights are limited by society&#x27;s interest to keep your family safe, but more importantly, your neighbors safe too, because fires spread. It&#x27;s still an imperfect analogy for a number of reasons. Cyberattacks are a relatively  novel kind of threat.

For IoT, you can say if someone discovers a specific brand of physical lock can be broken in unexpected ways, they should be allowed to communicate this in a way that benefits the users of the lock without facing any legal risk. For internet banking, you can discuss a physical vault that safekeeps everyone&#x27;s gold, and say that someone who notices a broken lock should not be punished for telling the vault manager to fix the lock. Unfortunately the common situation is that the lock company and the vault manager will sue because they don&#x27;t want to admit they put their users and clients at risk - it sounds absurd, but that&#x27;s what happens in the electronic world.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37397469" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37397469" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Buttons840</span><span>|</span><a href="#37393252">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37397139">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37400825">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37397565">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37397469">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37397469">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Do you believe that your proposal increases the cybersecurity of society as a whole?<p>You focus a lot on the rights and conveniences of a company, but the rights of a company are not more important that the security of society as a whole.<p>There are good guys and bad guys out there looking for vulnerabilities.

I am proposing security through consent. Nowhere did I say anything about not allowing research, I only said that if you do it unsolicited then it should be considered a threat.<p>So, we could systemically allow for a right to research that involves notice to the company and their consent for you to test. It would not hinder white hat at all.  If businesses resist for selfish reasons we can expand the law to prevent them from denying requests without a legitimate reason.  For example, maybe it is okay for them to deny a request from an ex-employee with a grudge who has sent the company aggressive emails. Idk, maybe there are no valid reasons to deny.

This way if someone is caught poking around for things to abuse unsolicited, at least there&#x27;s a little more merit to holding them accountable. We are able to treat it more like the threat it is.<p>The issue is this. You have some amateur, some hobbyist, who knows enough to spot a vulnerability, but isn&#x27;t a professional security researcher and isn&#x27;t a lawyer. They say &quot;that&#x27;s weird, there&#x27;s no way...,&quot; so they attempt the exploit on a lark, and it works.<p>This person is not a dangerous felon and should not be facing felony charges. They deserve a slap on the wrist. More importantly, they shouldn&#x27;t look up the penalty for what they&#x27;ve already done after the fact, find that their best course of action is to shut up and hope nobody noticed, and then not report the vulnerability.<p>The concern that we will have trouble distinguishing this person from a nefarious evildoer is kind of quaint. First, because this kind of poking around is not <i>rare</i>. As soon as you connect a server to the internet, there are immediately attempts to exploit it, continuously, forever.<p>But the malicious attacks are predominantly from outside of the United States. This is not a field where deterring the offenders through criminal penalties is an effective strategy. They&#x27;re not in your jurisdiction. So we can safely err on the side of not punishing people who aren&#x27;t committing some kind of overt independent crime, because we can&#x27;t be relying on the penalty&#x27;s deterrent regardless. We need the systems to be secure.<p>Conversely, if one of the baddies gets in and they are in your jurisdiction, you&#x27;re not going to have trouble finding some other law to charge them with. Your server will be hosting somebody&#x27;s dark web casino or fraudulent charges will show up on your customers&#x27; credit cards and the perpetrators can be charged with that even &quot;unauthorized computer trespass&quot; was a minor misdemeanor.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37400015" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37400015" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">screwturner68</span><span>|</span><a href="#37393252">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37398591">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37401099">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37397957">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37400015">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37400015">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">so are you saying that I shouldn&#x27;t be testing a product I purchased or a product that someone mandated I have in my house?

If you want to be more consistent with your building analogy, IoT sold to the public or enterprises are more like bars, except that each user has their own privately owned bar that may or may not be stocked by a central liquor company.

Even if someone buys a bar intending to hijack booze shipments, the liability is still partially on the liquor company if they have not taken reasonable precautions against known risks.

For example, hacker groups may have interesting comments on right to repair.<p>&gt; I’ve advocated for the FCC to require device manufacturers to support their devices with security updates for a reasonable amount of time [1].<p>Either require updates, or open up the devices such that a community of open source developers can write updated software. The benefit of the second proposal is reducing e-waste after the update period elapses and encouraging up-cycling.<p>&gt; If they meet certain criteria for the security of their product, manufacturers can put an FCC cybersecurity label on it.<p>It&#x27;s only as good as you enforce it. It might be easier for somebody like Google to buy a small IoT company, fold it rather than invest in updates, then take the IP and employees.<p>The payment for the FCC sign-off could be large enough that the FCC could feasibly demand access to the internals and pay somebody to patch it on their behalf (like an insurance policy). Of course the preferable option is that the company addresses this themselves.<p>&gt; I fought hard for one of these criteria to be the disclosure of how long the product will receive security updates.<p>Good, but not quite there. Providing some form of update is not the same as providing a comprehensive security update, or a timely one. There should be a window of something like 3 months (very generous) to make a good-faith effort to respond to an identified security issue (CVE?), either internally or externally.<p>The devices of course also need to demonstrate they are capable of receiving updates and that consumers are capable of applying an update, even if their infrastructure&#x2F;company is down.

Having the 2nd manual key available from day 1 ensures the device is unlockable with just a release of the key.  Having a 2nd key or a signed unlock firmware update I guess are two ways to achieve the same goal, but the 2nd key would be better.  The 2nd key likely stay in place forever, in each update, while the unlock firmware would likely end up remaining as the original firmware, because why would most vendors build two firmwares for each release.  It would sit forgotten on a drive somewhere.  The use of original unlock firmware could mean making a device vulnerable between loading the unlock firmware and the community firmware, so the 2nd key is preferred.  It&#x27;s always ready.<p>Ideally, the key would also be pre-registered somewhere to ensure they can&#x27;t skip out on releasing it, but I&#x27;m not sure how you do that without it potentially leaking before the device reaches end of support.  I guess a code sitting in a lawyer&#x27;s vault somewhere.

Device manufacturers already have to pass certification for RF emissions and safety among other things and should have to pass certification for at least a basic security audit on the device and the services the device connects to. Even self-certification would improve the current situation.<p>For many device types there exists some form of open source OTA update software or a commercial offering.

How many years of updates matters little if the software has vulnerabilities to begin with. And there&#x27;s no guarantee manufacturers will fully honor the length they claim.<p>Rather than disclosure rules, I believe we need minimum security standards that all IoT devices must meet before sale, eg:<p>No hard-coded credentials&#x2F;keys
Encryption of sensitive data
Ability to patch known vulnerabilities
Use of secure boot to prevent unauthorized firmware
Standards could be tiered by device type and risk level. Compliance could be self-certified with spot audits, like PCI DSS.<p>This puts the burden on manufacturers to build more secure devices upfront, not just promise to patch them later. Consumers benefit from safer defaults without needing to become security experts themselves.<p>Standards also allow security to improve over time as threats evolve. Disclosure rules would quickly become static and outdated.<p>I&#x27;m sympathetic to manufacturer concerns about costs, but I think basic security is a reasonable consumer expectation by now. If we act soon, we can prevent IoT disasters before the market grows even further.

I&#x27;ve worked building internet routers for homes and small business and there are pieces of software we couldn&#x27;t touch because they had been modified and only the fully compiled version is provided.<p>Broadcom passes the buck by calling it a reference design and washing their hands of it. Some upstreams do provide the source, but it&#x27;s the complete source, not just the changes they made and usually without any specific reference to what the specific version they based their changes on was. Trying to tease specific changes from the Linux kernel&#x27;s raw source code is quite the needle in the haystack problem.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how a lot of device manufacturers _could_ handle this. They tend to have very small development teams that are more electrical engineers than software engineers and usually their only directive is to make it work under an extraordinarily tight deadlines. Maybe part of the answer is they need to hire more to be more responsible... But even with experienced developers _every single hardware manufacturer_ is going to have to repeat the security fixes that companies like Broadcom refuse to fix.<p>I don&#x27;t even know where to begin proposing a legal foundation for reference design software. I do think if the penalties and pain were strict enough at this level it would lead to a different shortcut that would be much more beneficial to the world... If Broadcom and other companies doing this kind of malicious apathy were forced to keep their reference designs up to date, my money would be that they stop doing it entirely and instead get those driver merged into the Linux kernel proper where it can be properly maintained and updated by the legion of developers that care.<p>The act of getting that code into the kernel would force them to improve the code and not take the shortcuts that cause so many headaches because the kernel developers gate the quality of code they produce.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37397001" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37397001" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hsbauauvhabzb</span><span>|</span><a href="#37396054">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37400701">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37397001">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37397001">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’ll preface this with the fact that I am a security engineer (‘penetration tester’) but I probably don’t live in your country.<p>I care more about my privacy than I do about the security of my device, but an architecture that supports the second almost always supports the first (my neighbours hacking my zigbee isn’t a threat model almost anyone should be concerned about, unless there’s a pattern of hacking en masse).<p>I found out my smart lights literally have a microphone in them the other day, under the guise of ‘plays light to your music’ or something.<p>I architect my IOT by implementing a network without internet, fronted by home assistant - that way my devices can’t ‘phone home’ which who knows what privacy infringing crap.<p>I know that botnets driven by iot is a real and ongoing problem, but it’s a problem that is probably not going to get much vendor buyin without regulation, but what I’m pointing out is that it’s not the only threat facing these devices.<p>I want:<p>- clear guides on what data is collected, I don’t trust they’d only use it the way they say they will so I wouldn’t bother reading that part, if it existed<p>- the ability to opt out of any data collection aside from anything required to do technical updates.

If they want to drop it after 6 months and make the firmware fully source available and allow owners to add their own root keys to devices that&#x27;d be fine too. Or someone could offer something fully open source with no strings attached but also no responsibility attached. The market can fill with a range of decent options.<p>But manufacturers shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to have it both ways, with control post-sale over their customers&#x27; hardware <i>AND</i> no responsibility to support it. It should be directly linked by law.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

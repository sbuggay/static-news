Abelson delves into the too-often dismissed problems of interpreting quantitative data and then presenting them in the context of a coherent story about one&#x27;s research. Unlike too many books on statistics, this is a remarkably engaging read, filled with fascinating real-life (and real-research) examples rather than with recipes for analysis. It will be of true interest and lasting value to beginning graduate students and seasoned researchers alike. The focus of the book is that the purpose of statistics is to organize a useful argument from quantitative evidence, using a form of principled rhetoric. Five criteria, described by the acronym MAGIC (magnitude, articulation, generality, interestingness, and credibility) are proposed as crucial features of a persuasive, principled argument. Particular statistical methods are discussed, with minimum use of formulas and heavy data sets. The ideas throughout the book revolve around elementary probability theory, t tests, and simple issues of research design. It is therefore assumed that the reader has already had some access to elementary statistics. Many examples are included to explain the connection of statistics to substantive claims about real phenomena.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40486339" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40486339" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alpple</span><span>|</span><a href="#40485711">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40486290">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40487060">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40486315">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40486339">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40486339">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wonder if dry reading means written without the influence of drink.

It makes me wonder how many potentially useful discoveries were made in industrial settings, and wound up being buried due to management not wanting to risk leaking competitive information. The good news, I suppose, would be if you believe that it&#x27;s rarely the case that only one person could ever discover something. Then you can conclude that all (most?) such discoveries were eventually (or will eventually be) rediscovered independently.<p>On a related note... I wonder how much valuable research disappears (more or less) when companies fold, get acquired, etc. Take MCC[1] for example. I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of reading lately that involves old papers from the 1990&#x27;s on &quot;agents&quot; and &quot;multi-agent systems&quot;. And time and time again, in the references, you&#x27;ll see something like &quot;MCC Technical Report TR86-32791&quot; or some-such. Occasionally said report can be found online, but quite a few of them seem to be either hard - or impossible - to find. Maybe there&#x27;s an archive of physical papers stored away somewhere, but FSM knows where the heck such a thing would be, or how hard it would be to get access.<p>A similar situation came up a while back when we started discussing &quot;sharding&quot; here on HN[2]. There was a lot of effort spent trying to identify when the term first arose, and a lot of evidence pointed to a particular paper that was internal to CCA, who were acquired by Xerox. And now that original paper seems to be unobtanium. The paper probably still <i>exists</i> somewhere in the bowels of Xerox, but good luck ever getting your hands on it.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Microelectronics_and_Computer_Technology_Corporation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Microelectronics_and_Computer_...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36848605">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36848605</a></div><br/><div id="40486378" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40486378" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">schneems</span><span>|</span><a href="#40485711">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40486316">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40487760">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40486378">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40486378">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; It makes me wonder how many potentially useful discoveries were made in industrial settings, and wound up being buried due to management not wanting to risk<p>Probably a lot.

The important thing isn&#x27;t that it lets you calculate some _p_-value; the important thing is that it is a framework for <i>decision-making</i>, where you can trade off your false-positive <i>and</i> your false-negative rates to make the economically rational decision: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tandfonline.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1080&#x2F;00031305.2018.1514325" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tandfonline.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1080&#x2F;00031305.2018.1...</a><p>In this case, because it is a well-understood problem with the rates of bad batches easily established from the brewery&#x27;s records of testing &amp; drinking, it lets the brewery decide on how many &#x27;off&#x27; batches it wants to risk in exchange for saving the cost of a certain number of test-samples. You decide you want to risk 1 bad batch in 100 for a false negative while rejecting 1 good batch in 20, then you need _n_ samples etc. And this directly translates better measurements (by lowering variance, eg. by blocking) into money: the lower the variance, the fewer samples you need to achieve any given tradeoff, thereby saving the brewery money on scrapped material or testing. The smaller the better, hence Student&#x27;s inability to use asymptotics or approximations: they might be off by orders of magnitude. (He would even try to do _n_ = 2 tests!)<p>Or they might be trying to tightly optimize alcohol content, to avoid taxation for passing high-alcohol content thresholds, but also avoid going too low to disappoint their customers, so Student would explicitly calculate out scenarios, for example:<p>&gt; Thus, Gosset concluded, “In order to get the accuracy we require [that is, 10 to 1 odds with 0.5 accuracy], we must, therefore, take the mean of [at least] four determinations.” The Guinness Board cheered. The Apprentice Brewer found an economical way to assess the behavior of population parameters, using very small samples.<p>(If you&#x27;re thinking this sounds like a very subjective-Bayesian decision-theory thing to write, you are right, although Student would have rejected that, like most statisticians, and emphasized that he was dealing with populations with known base rates, and so nothing Bayesian was necessary; it was just a frequentist decision-theory approach.)</div><br/><div id="40487362" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40487362" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nextos</span><span>|</span><a href="#40486911">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40487106">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40487362">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40487362">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That article you posted is excellent, thank you.

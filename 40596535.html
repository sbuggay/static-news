However, this conclusion is based on cross-sectional comparisons. This means, they look at different people at different ages, and make inferences on developmental trajectories based on these cross-sectional, age-related patterns. While this is often a starting point, cross-sectional research can suffer from sampling biases.<p>A huge weakness in autism neuroimaging research is the un-representativeness of 
their samples. Nearly a third of individuals with autism have severe intellectual impairments (IQ&#x27;s &lt; 70) yet represent less than 1% of neuroimaging samples. Individuals with other immense behavioral, sensory and language challenges are also rarely make it through the rigors of imaging protocols.<p>A rare exception has been imaging research that performed brain imaging in very young children during natural sleep. and thus can hold still enough for quality MRI images to be acquired. This has allowed imaging of autistic children aged 2-6 years to include autism over a whole range of severities, challenges, and intellectual abilities.<p>This presents a problem though. The research that suggested there is brain overgrowth in early childhood sampled from a wide range of autism phenotypes and severities, while the normalization evidence in adolescents and adults came from autistic participants with normal ranged IQs and less severe challenges, a clear cross-sectional sampling bias that threatens the validity of the overgrowth normalization story.
Moreover, research indicated that disproportionate brain size in autism was associated with slower intellectual improvements with development.<p>I and my colleagues thus hypothesized that the discrepancy would be removed if we can follow the same children from childhood into adolescence longitudinally. Using a number of behavioral techniques and a lots of care and dedication, our team managed to acquire brain data in a broad spectrum of autism phenotypes and severity levels from early childhood into early adolescence.<p>We reported the results of our study in Biological Psychiatry Lee in 2021.

Whether something should be considered a strength or a weakness _does_ depend, at least in some cases and to some degree, on your perspective and actions.<p>Some superhero fiction even covers this aspect. A quite interesting example would be One Piece, where a number of people ate a special fruit that gave them superpowers, but they lose the ability to swim. Since the world is mostly ocean, that&#x27;s a huge deal, and the main character is initially depressed about having made that trade, until he learns to appreciate his new powers.<p>So I guess this neurodiversity-is-a-super-power narrative can be both be bad (proper help and understanding is denied) and good (e.g. increased self confidence).</div><br/></div></div><div id="40605410" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40605410" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rachofsunshine</span><span>|</span><a href="#40599440">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40600809">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40606159">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40600995">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40605410">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40605410">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m somewhere on the spectrum, with many of the stereotypical traits (special interests, sensory sensitivity, social difficulties, emotional processing trouble, sensitivity to disruptions, you name it). It makes me good at some things and bad at others. It has, at times, made my life very hard, and it has at times made things that are very difficult for others trivial for me.<p>But that&#x27;s not really any different from how people vary from one another in general. It just so happens that the way in which I vary is shared with many others and has a name.<p>I&#x27;d say the same about ADHD. I don&#x27;t know if I have ADHD, specifically, but I certainly have some form of related executive dysfunction. It makes it very hard to focus on something tedious (I spent a solid hour trying to type up a few paragraphs of interview feedback for someone earlier while getting constantly pulled off onto other things). But it also means I temperamentally <i>have</i> to constantly be learning and growing because I&#x27;ll wither and die if I don&#x27;t. That has made some things (like doing repetitive daily tasks) hard, but it makes other things (like the fact that as a founder I have to do about seven different jobs at a time) fun and easy when they would crush many people.<p>I agree with you that we don&#x27;t need to pretend that things that hurt us don&#x27;t. The difficulties matter, in part because acknowledging and understanding them is a part of finding our own personal brands of excellence. But I also don&#x27;t think we need to treat the ways in which we&#x27;re different as a curse, either. It&#x27;s just how we are, and we have to figure out the best way to live within those constraints, the same as anyone else. Sometimes that means tolerating the things that we can&#x27;t change, sometimes that means routing around them, sometimes that means figuring out ways to make them work in our favor.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, but I can say that my life has gone <i>far</i> better starting from the premise of &quot;this is the way I am and I have to work with that while recognizing the realities of interacting with a world that operates on different rules from mine&quot; than it has from the premise of &quot;I&#x27;m broken and I need to fix myself so I&#x27;m like others&quot;. In that sense, I think that acceptance, and even celebration in the right ways, can be good. It&#x27;s just a way to say &quot;it&#x27;s not wrong to be what you are, and you should try to be the best version of that thing, not the best version of someone else&quot;.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40600995" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40600995" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Rhapso</span><span>|</span><a href="#40599440">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40600809">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40605410">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40601732">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40600995">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40600995">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh agreed, but all &quot;positive attributes&quot; are problems at extremes.<p>I think this is similar.

It&#x27;s a fact I&#x27;ve come to terms with over their life as improvements in communication have slowed.<p>&gt; that often it is not about pushing past their boundaries to get them to do things in a &quot;normal&quot; way, but about working around them and finding other ways for them to engage with the world productively.<p>Sorry, but this severely misunderstands what we work on.  It&#x27;s not about doing the &quot;normal&quot; thing.  My child, for example, has extreme food aversion problems.  They have a very limited diet which ultimately is not healthy.  We do food therapy because expanding their diet and tolerance to eating foods in non-preferred ways is super important.  They attend school and unfortunately if the wrong aide is in charge of setting up their meal, they will frequently simply go hungry.<p>I&#x27;m not working on &quot;normalizing&quot; my kid.  I&#x27;m working on getting my kid to be able to advocate their needs and to be self-reliant as much as they are capable.<p>&gt; That might mean writing instead of speaking.<p>Already working on that.  They have an AAC device and have been to therapy to learn how to use it for the last year.<p>&gt; Or using mouthwash instead of brushing their teeth.<p>Or sedating them when they inevitably need to have cavities drilled?  You can&#x27;t replace brushing your teeth with mouthwash.  Feel free to ask your dentist if that&#x27;s acceptable on your next visit.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.verywellhealth.com&#x2F;what-is-severe-autism-260044" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.verywellhealth.com&#x2F;what-is-severe-autism-260044</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40605949" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40605949" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fragmede</span><span>|</span><a href="#40602402">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40603301">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40603538">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40603042">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40605949">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40605949">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">that book is &quot;Autismland: Climbing Out of Autism’s Silent Prison” by Ido Kedar.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40603042" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40603042" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CobaltFire</span><span>|</span><a href="#40602402">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40602866">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40603022">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40603256">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40603042">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40603042">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a father of a child in the same situation as yours, who has been personally diagnosed with Aspergers:<p>100% agree.

First, Kranner hired multiple staff who had worked under Asperger and therefore there are questions about priority. But putting that aside, Asperger was actually aware of the more serious autism cases and intentionally hid them to protect his patients from Nazi concentration camps (or just straight up murder in their &quot;psychiatric&quot; facilities), which in the early days targeted many children who would today be diagnosed with autism (with horrible consequences, obviously).<p>Kranner also intentionally set up his referral network to filter <i>out</i> the lower end of the spectrum of cases, such that he missed what Asperger has correctly identified before him: that is, that it&#x27;s a spectrum.<p>Being a spectrum means that there is an extreme end where things are really, really difficult. I&#x27;m sorry to hear you&#x27;re experiencing that, but that&#x27;s not to say the spectrum isn&#x27;t real or there hasn&#x27;t been a battle to get to the point of recognizing that it exists.<p>As to the GP&#x27;s comments specifically, NeuroTribes provides a lot of evidence that searches for autism &quot;cures&quot; have almost universally hurt autistic people, and I mean this is a very practical, and frankly horrifying, sense, not in the &quot;my feelings are being hurt&quot; sense. The piercing irony of a lot of these cases was that Kranner&#x27;s own follow up to some of his methods indicated that his own techniques were actually making children&#x27;s lives worse, not better. Some of the children who did the best were frankly just left alone---which says a lot about what we&#x27;ve done for them.<p>So, I don&#x27;t know what the answer is, but I think it&#x27;s worth being at least aware of the history, because a lot of it is frankly really dark.</div><br/><div id="40603374" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40603374" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cogman10</span><span>|</span><a href="#40602402">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40603256">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40603561">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40603374">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40603374">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The history of all psychiatry is dark.

You can decide to give your child cochlear implants, and integrate them into mainstream schooling - or you can opt out of that, and integrate them into the deaf community. That’s the very definition of a trade off, and it’s a very valid and difficult question.<p>The issue I have with your take is that its adoption can reduce people’s feelings of agency around their way of life. What works for you isn’t necessarily universal. The idea of a tradeoff is that the same decision can have different meaning to people in varying contexts.

The use of &quot;or&quot; here reads as exclusive: one or the other, but not both.  In the last 15 years, since child cochlear implants became mainstream, many children have taken both routes, simultaneously.  This is most frequent when one or both of their parents are also deaf.  They are full members of their deaf community (learn to sign, plus all of the associated culture), and they are full member of the mainstream, non-deaf community (learn to listen and speak, plus all of the associated culture).</div><br/></div></div><div id="40603418" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40603418" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smeej</span><span>|</span><a href="#40602402">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40602800">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40606421">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40603308">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40603418">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40603418">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s so hard too because the people tasked with making the tradeoff decision are almost always the parents of the child, because the most effective interventions have to take place before the child can make her own decisions.

This is intellectual dishonesty to the point of nausea. 
Amphetamine is very well understood as far as drugs go and affects those with and without ADHD in the same way.  Neurotypicals also experience increased focus at therapeutic doses, just ask anyone who&#x27;s taken it as a study aid, and ADHD-sufferers also experience a high from the flood of dopamine.
The most damning evidence for me is the absolutely obsessive relationship many ADHD patients have with their medication.

Give me those tedious, repeatable, rules based gardening tasks and I&#x27;ll churn through them all day every day.<p>I believe I have a more systemic way of thinking than my peers, and while this does cause problems sometimes it also enables me to decompose systems more easily.<p>I tend to maintain my cool under pressure or bullying.

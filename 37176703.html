In the first several years of our relationship, we had several big disputes about how to treat each other, and how to treat guests. After a while we realized that she had been brought up to feel extreme insecurity over responding to the needs of guests, and I had been brought up to be blithely ignorant to the needs of guests.<p>Over the years I definitely insulted several southern guests by mostly ignoring them, and she definitely projected insult onto several northern guests by assuming that they were secretly judging us for not being better hosts. We&#x27;ve since realized that southerners tend to prefer &quot;guess&quot; culture and northerners tend to prefer &quot;ask&quot; culture, to use the terminology from the article. There are certainly many exceptions, but this generalization has taught her to chill out a little over hosting duties, and taught me to pick up some slack when taking care of guests.<p>We still both greatly prefer our native cultures. I don&#x27;t like being fawned over or offered things I don&#x27;t want, and she is extremely recalcitrant when it comes to asking for anything.<p>[1] I mention the distant ancestral backgrounds because it&#x27;s amusing to me how well I get along with northern Europeans who are plainly spoken and &quot;rude&quot; by US standards, and how a lot of proper hosting culture from the UK reminds me of how her family operates. She finds Scandinavians and Dutch incredibly rude, whereas I find the English hilariously polite, even to their own detriment.</div><br/><div id="37179976" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37179976" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hinkley</span><span>|</span><a href="#37177897">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37182705">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37179976">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37179976">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This reminds me of John Mulaney’s bit about Jewish versus Catholic culture.

My current theory it’s related to the dating statistics. Dating is a power law for men. A few great men will get all the mates whereas most get none. For women, it’s more equal. So men realize that they must excel or have no mate, which leads to extreme behaviour: sometimes extremely &quot;good&quot; (e.g., founder of S&amp;P company) and sometimes extremely bad (e.g., robbing bank).

But in terms of asking for things, I don&#x27;t feel like I identify with the culture of directly asking.

You don&#x27;t think about how much room that couch is wasting or how much time you spend walking around the couch to get to the chair. Sometmies you stub your toe on the way around, but everyone trips every now and then. You&#x27;ve been doing this so long that it is completely unconscious. Hell, you can and do navigate the room in the dark.<p>Friends ask you about your living room furniture and you—completely honestly as far as you know—say it&#x27;s all fine. You describe your chair in detail. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s serviceable. Certainly lots of other people have furniture that&#x27;s in worse shape. At least you don&#x27;t have any of <i>those</i> problems.<p>Then you sit down with a therapist for a few hours and they say, &quot;Hey, what&#x27;s up with that couch?&quot;</div><br/><div id="37182044" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37182044" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">boppo1</span><span>|</span><a href="#37177897">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37181816">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37182055">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37182044">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37182044">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I understood the concept already, thanks.<p>But thank you for providing readers an example of the kind of condescension I was describing.</div><br/><div id="37184015" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37184015" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pixl97</span><span>|</span><a href="#37177897">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37182044">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37182055">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37184015">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37184015">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And then others can read your own comment history about the &#x27;minor&#x27; traumas and the impacts that has had on relationships in your own life.<p>At least from your writing I believe you&#x27;re a very introspective person.

Obviously some trauma is objectively worse but competing over trauma severity is pointless.</div><br/><div id="37181704" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37181704" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">watwut</span><span>|</span><a href="#37177897">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37180989">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37180074">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37181704">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37181704">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The thing is, kids who grew up in those good families are in fact more resilient then abused kids.<p>Kids with bad childhood will not categorize semi bad childhood as trauma, but have worst interpersonal relationships, worst stress handling, abuse drugs or alcohol more often and display whole range of at risk behaviors<p>It is simply not true that being poor or abused or neglected makes people resilient.</div><br/><div id="37182111" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37182111" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">brazzledazzle</span><span>|</span><a href="#37177897">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37181704">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37180074">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37182111">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37182111">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s an excellent and fair point.

That’s good! It doesn’t mean that you’re perfect or that your interpersonal issues aren’t real; it just means that a monocausal theory of psychology that blames everything on “trauma” or, worse yet, “childhood trauma” doesn’t apply to you.<p>People by and large don’t understand how their brains work, but if they’re suffering or struggling psychologically, they seem to want some sort of explanatory model to make sense of it. So it’s easy for people to buy into these models. The trauma model is one of the more fashionable ones these days. The problems with this model, especially the more pop-psychology version, are (a) it doesn’t fit what we know about actual, serious trauma anyway and (b) it seems to encourage people to catastrophize their past experiences in order to try and make their life story fit the model. This is also counterproductive because catastophization is itself a cognitive distortion that should be corrected rather than indulged. Focusing on childhood trauma in particular also sounds suspiciously Freudian to me.<p>Another thing to point out is that even serious traumatic experiences don’t necessarily lead to psychological issues in the future. Most people have a natural resiliency to them. But if people believe that any unpleasant or negative experience is going to give them full blown PTSD, it’s more likely to happen. There are cases of this happening cross-culturally when well meaning western aid workers offer to counsel people in third world countries who experienced natural disasters.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37179420" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37179420" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwanem</span><span>|</span><a href="#37177897">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37178817">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37179199">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37178882">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37179420">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37179420">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you&#x27;ve learned anything in your 20-year mental health journey, I hope it would be that not everyone is exactly like you, nor needs the same things you need.

I am a 3rd generation American, family immigrated over from Norway and Sweden and our heritage and traditions are still very strongly observed. We are protestant as well and live in the northern U.S.<p>My family is a bit on the extreme of guessing culture to the point where we won&#x27;t say anything and often folks find us very cold. I am made acutely aware of this everyday - from romantic partners, friends, and even strangers. My siblings and I were simply raised this way and it&#x27;s all but impossible to change my behavior.<p>When we visit family in both Norway and Sweden it&#x27;s almost like &quot;whew&quot; we can relax and breathe and everything feels very comfortable because the pace of society is slower, at restaurants and during normal activities out and about in the towns, you generally do not have to worry about folks approaching you.<p>My current partner is also a 3rd generation American, her family on both sides is Irish. They are incredibly social and outgoing and just 10 minutes she informed me we are having our neighbors over (he is a 2nd generation American of Irish descent and his partner is a 2nd generation Dutch). They are all very social and won&#x27;t hesitate to offer a beer or help or anything really, which I certainly appreciate it but I&#x27;m uncomfortable accepting anything.<p>An even more extreme example is my older brother. I almost look like a social butterfly in comparison because I won&#x27;t hesitate to complain about the weather, work, anything really. Whereas he is very stoic and quiet. 
We were in the construction industry with our father and we all would mostly work in silence building homes and apartment buildings, and when we expanded and hired new folks it made them really uncomfortable.<p>Once, my brother fell off a roof and he just laid there in a daze. I rushed down to him and by the time I got to him (no more than 20 seconds) he was already getting back up on the roof and just said &quot;I&#x27;m fine&quot;. Another time his lung collapsed and he didn&#x27;t tell anyone until his 5th day in the hospital!

I&#x27;d much rather put the cards on the table, find out we want completely different, even opposed things, and work from there, than deal with the power imbalance of one person&#x27;s assumption that anyone who isn&#x27;t reading their mind is an idiot.<p>It seems the virtue, as most of the time, is in the mean.</div><br/><div id="37178489" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37178489" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">flatline</span><span>|</span><a href="#37177632">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37178239">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37179164">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37178489">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37178489">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have lived this too.<p>Likewise ask culture can only be healthy if there is not a power imbalance: is the asked party really free to say no?<p>The title is catchy but I’m not sure how useful this dichotomy really is.</div><br/><div id="37178786" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37178786" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ativzzz</span><span>|</span><a href="#37177632">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37178489">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37180187">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37178786">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37178786">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You can also be more empathetic with ask culture and soften or make the request more obvious to say no to.<p>Instead of saying &quot;can you do x&quot; you can say &quot;i know you&#x27;re busy so no pressure whatsoever but if you&#x27;re available can you do me out with x? feel free to say no my feelings won&#x27;t be hurt&quot;<p>Yea it&#x27;s a lot more words but the general gist is you ask with an additional explicit &quot;out&quot; for the other person so they can say no using your pre-provided excuse instead of them having to come up with one.

Serving low-self-esteem culture just means doing the same kind of customer service one would do anyway: be clear, assure and reassure, be positive, listen closely, be understanding, consistent, etc.<p>Serving a narcissist is a completely different category: predict bad faith misinterpretations of your positive statements and sensible responses to them, low-key reject 2nd and 3rd attempts at bad faith misinterpretations, ignore ad hominem attacks, intuit whether their friends acknowledge the narcissism, know when to (quickly) turn them over to a manager, etc.<p>Consequently, some members of the &quot;ask&quot; group preface everything they ask with politeness or some other obvious tell to distinguish themselves.

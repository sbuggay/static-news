Operational coherence means each probe sends the same data but adjusts its emission time according to its relative position, such that all pulses arrive simultaneously at the receiving arrays on Earth. This effectively multiplies the power from any one probe by the number N of probes in the swarm, providing orders of magnitude greater data return.<p>This sounds unfeasible. They have no way to keep station from what I understand, the interstellar medium is relatively empty but there will still be some drift over the light years.

Sounds like the plan is to have the signals from each probe add up coherently, which means the laser pulses need to be coherent with each other. The wavelength of optical light is 100s of nanometers, so that is the level of precision required spatially, relative to the much much larger probe spacing that they quote. This (plus the required temporal coherence) is probably not possible without the probes actively locking their lasers to each other, but now each probe needs the optics to send and detect the optical signal from at least its nearest neighbors.

The craft are all launched at roughly the same speed and will start slowing down due to drag. By changing orientation they can control the speed&#x2F;direction in which they slow down. This is a small effect, because the drag imparted by gases in interstellar space is minimal, but over 20 years at .2c it seems like it should work.<p>If there&#x27;s a problem with this plan it&#x27;s more likely to be that the encounters with the interstellar medium is more energetic than we expect and the craft either slow down too much or are destroyed by gases constantly impacting at .2c for years.

From all other directions there are lateral forces that are impossible to overcome.<p>For example, if you are in a sailboat following another sailboat in calm waters with consistent wind and the lead sailboat slows down or the trailing puts out more sail to speed up to narrow a gap, one of the two will fall out of the line of travel due to lateral forces and will be forced to apply rudder to compensate.

As it pushes the spacecraft away from earth and the laser rapidly loses efficiency. However if you had laser arrays over the planned route of the spacecraft you can keep adding velocity. However getting that infrastructure into place decades to millennia. You start with the array in home world orbit and then start building further and further out arrays.

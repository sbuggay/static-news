It was probably the most played game of my childhood. I&#x27;ve also logged almost 300 hours in the redux version on steam.<p>Interestingly, since I didn&#x27;t have the internet to participate in the MMO elements of the game, my views of it are entirely rooted in the storyline and campaigns. The community is something I haven&#x27;t experienced. And none of these netcode or pvp bugs or phantom players showed up there.<p>I love the game. In the single player modes, you can play as the NSDF (US) forces, USSR, (and later as the Chinese forces too) in a sci-fi retelling of the space race where you discover alien relics throughout our solar system and try to piece together where they came from, and more importantly, where they went. And it did this while combining a first-person vehicle combat mode with a top-down RTS system that, in my opinion, worked really well together. And I still take inspiration from it in hobby game projects I work on.<p>Now that I&#x27;ve grown up as a software developer I&#x27;ve thrown so many hours into writing Lua scripts to build my own missions and AI, and creating custom maps!</div><br/></div></div><div id="42074787" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42074787" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">antiterra</span><span>|</span><a href="#42072382">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42071442">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42074787">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42074787">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If the only place nearby to kick a ball around with friends is on an incline, turns to mud half the year, filled with dog droppings, pocked by holes in the ground, peppered with fire ants, lined with poison ivy behind the lopsided structures that stand in for goals, and you utterly hate it-- you might spend a lot of time there anyway.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42071442" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42071442" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">moomin</span><span>|</span><a href="#42074787">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42072865">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42071442">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42071442">[14 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My god I love BZ98.

My main had over 1 year of play time, and my alts, maybe another 20-30 days, so that puts me at about 9600 hours. I played for 5-6 years intensely in a progressive raising guild, then faded away over about a year after some crazy guild drama, it was such a loss.<p>It burned me out and I basically quit gaming for the last 10 years, now that I think about it. Some sim or resource games here and there, nothing multiplayer and nothing &quot;reactive&quot;. Maybe a few hours a month.<p>Anyway, I reflected on it as this big waste of time, so I felt I had to grind at life instead. Games are a waste of time, do something productive. I&#x27;m only now appreciating the anxiety that caused.<p>This intern I work with is a gamer and asks me if I play anything. I realize I&#x27;m older than his mom so he&#x27;s really getting a kick of my stories cause &quot;I&#x27;m like too old to play games haha, wow that&#x27;s crazy&quot;<p>He said something like &quot;you can afford it, how do you not have a gaming computer bro?&quot; I thought, he&#x27;s got a point.<p>So I find a tricked out
craigslist gaming computer a few weeks ago and download some games on steam. I was floored at A. What games have become and how fuckin good they look B. How much fun I was having and C.

Second one was also not bad TBH.<p>I loved the feeling of hovering above the ground and shooting down enemies. Then if your ship was about to be destroyed, you would eject out of your ship and you could try to snipe your enemy&#x27;s ship to steal theirs. When you were outside your ship, you were very weak and ships could kill you by just running over you or with a single shot so you had to have really good aim to snipe and hijack one of your enemy&#x27;s ship fast. Then you could literally drive around in their bases in their ship to spy on them and they wouldn&#x27;t recognize you as the enemy (until you started shooting at them). That way you could check out their positions and defensive infrastructure to decide whether or not to mount an attack and how. Brilliant concept.<p>I also loved that there was a goal of exploring the map to find and secure geothermal geysers as you could only start a base around those. It was one of the first truly immersive game experiences.<p>This was many years before counter-strike, but the game mechanics were far more complex.

The blend of fps and rts felt sweeping and epic, gave a sense of scale I hadn&#x27;t experienced. The game ran incredibly smoothly on the Pentium mmx with crappy voodoo banshee.<p>My hours logged is nowhere near Sacrifice, a game with incredibly different setting (planes hopping wizard currying favor with local dieties), but both games had that blend of first-person and rts that was incredibly challenging &amp; of incredibly neat scale, teaversing huge open spaces.

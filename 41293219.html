Some of this is related to depressive episodes, but often it’s just a more neutral ebb and flow. I’ll have a week where ideas are flowing and connections form easily. I’ll have a week where it feels like I can’t engage so deeply - like my system is cooling off after exertion.<p>And this is one of the reasons writing things down has been such a useful tool, and starting with a spec is something I now do religiously after spending the first half of my life just diving in haphazardly (and often not getting very far).<p>Those ultra productive days are often enough to get a pretty decent spec written; something I can flesh out in far greater detail than I could with a productive coding day. Those down days are now bolstered by the thinking of a version of myself that was firing on all cylinders, and solved many of the problems I probably don’t have the brain power to tackle on the fly when I’m tired and stressed for life reasons.<p>I feel like I’ve squandered really good trains of thought by telling myself “I’ll remember this and write it down later”.

I see that the things i declare important feel less so when i have to keep working on it. I start to permanently discard essays, apps, ideas, as i appreciate what it would really take to do them.

I try to have as few of these as possible—like only one at a time—so that my willpower is not diluted.<p>If it&#x27;s because I want to feel good by:<p>* Improving a skill.<p>* Exploring an unfamiliar domain or learning something new.<p>* Relaxing by tinkering on something I like.<p>Then the goal of the project is the process and I don&#x27;t feel bad about not finishing. The real treasure is all the stuff I learned and did along the way and there is no real destination. I can have as many of these as I want because there&#x27;s no real failure mode here.

There is a big downside: as the author states, finishing&#x2F;releasing is hard and time-consuming. You only get one life. Every hour spent doing that stuff you won&#x27;t get back. So, not a direct cost, but an opportunity cost. Personally, I find it important to acknowledge this and face it head-on, rather than waving one&#x27;s hands and saying &quot;oh, there&#x27;s basically no downside.&quot; Though I admit that the latter can be a useful self-mind-hack to get the ball rolling. But <i>first</i> you decide what you want to do, and why you want to do it, and <i>then</i> you tell yourself whatever lies you need to help it get done (:<p>The &quot;why is it important...&quot; question is really critical to motivation, at least for me.

Just getting things out of one&#x27;s mind, and into the world (even if nobody sees them), can be important (helps my sanity, at least).
Even just the &quot;rubber duck&quot; sense of <i>imagining</i> someone might see it, can catalyze thoughts in a way that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise happen, too.
Then, having people actually see them is another layer, and can be humbling and educational.<p>Also, apropos of nothing, this article made me think of the (mis-)quote:<p><pre><code>  We do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they would be easy!

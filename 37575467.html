Sometimes I find code that I wrote 2 years ago which, at the time, was produced with far more care and extreme pedantic attention to detail than the average developer would have given it, yet it was still not correct for ALL POSSIBLE edge cases.
It&#x27;s insanely difficult to produce correct code.

Since then you have the major but still largely incomplete revolutions with real time, interactive and concurrent applications.<p>The metaphors have long stopped being numbers. LLM&#x27;s pretend to encode human language itself. Our entire semantic universe, to the degree it is externalized, is slowly codified and mapped into bits.<p>You also have the deepening of the stack. It started with simple machine code but now you can have like four layers of abstraction to help our poor brains manage torrents of information flows between very complex pieces of hardware.<p>So yeah, programming is hard because we are pushing hard to find the limits of what can be done with digital devices.<p>I dont think we are even halfway there yet.

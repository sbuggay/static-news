    &gt; 
    &gt; Working class people could not tell you what these terms mean. But if you

I figured out as soon as I saw the link title that the author&#x27;s examples for &quot;luxury beliefs&quot; would <i>just so happen</i> to be associated with a feminist and anti-racist outlook.<p><pre><code>    &gt; But unlike luxury goods, luxury beliefs can have long term detrimental

    &gt; for the rich, they often inflict even greater costs on everyone else.
</code></pre>
This is certainly true for a high number of luxury beliefs, such as &quot;trickle down economics&quot;, &quot;small government&quot; advocacy and &quot;catallaxy&quot;, none of which come up often among dishwashers; and all of which freshman students at Yale, who just read their first essay on Friedrich Hayek, will gladly explain to you.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38081777" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38081777" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neilk</span><span>|</span><a href="#38081711">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38081639">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38081777">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38081777">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Let’s consider the contrary.

It would be truly surprising if a decade-plus of higher education and immersion in data and discourse did not produce a different consensus. The author offers no evidence that “defund the police” is an inherently absurd idea, no more than other formerly radical ideas like universal suffrage or abolishing slavery. In my town, the police absorb over 20% of the city budget, have doubled their spend in the past decade, and are unaccountable to the people.

At the start I’m sure she said something like “I just spent a couple of weeks alphabetising my dad’s record collection” and I remember that stressed me out at the time. Alphabetisation is like something that a non-collector does when confronted with a collection. I’m a dad who collects vinyl and know that my shelves have formed themselves into sense, slowly over time, and that there is a deep ordering – formed by shifting one record at a time after playing it – based on my taste and likes and preferences. So I can’t critique but it did make me a little sad at the time that the first thing she did was to wipe out the order her dad had left it in, which probably looked like chaos to her. What’s done is done though, I just know that once she gets to the end she might realise that there was a sense and logic to how it had been left.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42818021" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42818021" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shermantanktop</span><span>|</span><a href="#42820311">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42818978">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42818021">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42818021">[29 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I inherited 600+ jazz CDs and a couple of hundreds of LPs from my dad, who died 10 years ago - and like TFA, music is what we often connected over.<p>Most (but not all!) of that music is available online.

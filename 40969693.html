Maybe your managers are just so awesome that all the issues they create are perfect and great for the business and you never have to think for yourself at all.

The productivity of that team (when the manager and story points process were introduced) plummeted and the entire team quit within a month of each other leaving.<p>The best managers I have had have worked by discussing customer and business needs with engineering and walking away with a richer picture of the tasks involved and an estimated timeline. It is very hard work to do this—it usually takes someone with a little knowledge of how software engineering works.

You are probably right in thinking that story points should not matter to you, as a developer; but they do matter to external stakeholders.<p>Forecasting and management of expectations is necessary because software often has external real-world dependencies: available funding for a first release, marketing materials, hardware that can&#x27;t be released without software, trade shows, developer conferences, yearly retail release parties, OEM partners, cyclic stable releases for enterprise customers who won&#x27;t push software into production without extensive pre-testing, graphics adapters that can&#x27;t be released without drivers, rockets that won&#x27;t launch, cars that won&#x27;t drive, etc.<p>All of these things require some degree of forecasting and appropriately-evolving management of expectations. Here&#x27;s where we stand. Here&#x27;s what we can commit to. Here&#x27;s what we might deliver, but are willing to defer to a future release. Here are the (low value) items were under consideration that we will definitely defer to a future release, here are the features you will need to drop to get feature b in this release.<p>The purpose of story points is to help provide forecasting and management of expectations (with appropriately limited commitments) to stakeholders, on the understanding that forecasts are approximate.<p>Calibrated burndown of story points is pretty much the only basis on which forecasting and management of expectations can be done in an agile process. The key is to make sure that stakeholders understand the difference between forecasting and commitment, and to make sure your development team is appropriately protected by a healthy development process.<p>Whether the author&#x27;s claim that you get better forecasts by just counting stories, instead of summing story points... color me skeptical. I do get that it prevents some obvious abuses of process, while enabling other that are just as bad. If somebody is using story points as a developer performance metric (which they shouldn&#x27;t), there&#x27;s nothing that prevents them from using completed stories as a developer performance metric (which they shouldn&#x27;t).

At best you&#x27;ll get solid utilization of engineering resources when you have a steady backlog of small requests, at worst you&#x27;ll redirect engineers&#x27; attention off of the essential details that make or break difficult projects towards administrative overhead and ticket shuffling.

Those are two different dimensions. No matter how hard you try to break things down, a task queue will still have items in it with different sizes.<p>There is nothing saying you can&#x27;t refine work packages together in your team, while still using story points. That&#x27;s actually how it&#x27;s done almost everywhere. When items end up with a very high estimate there will be a push to refine it to something smaller. Something you should do but only as long as it still makes sense.<p>In fact the worst place i ever worked at was where we were given strict orders to break down every story until they all became 1 story point (still using story points...). Doesn&#x27;t take a genius to figure out what happened next. All packages started having pointless micro-tasks with thousands of cross dependencies between them: &quot;open the editor&quot;, &quot;write a function&quot; &quot;write a unit test&quot;, &quot;commit the code&quot;, &quot;review the code&quot;. How am i supposed to write a unit test before the function signature has even been made? How am i supposed to iterate when finding bugs? More complex tasks still overran their estimates by factor 10, in fact even worse than before, some things just can&#x27;t split, yet they still needed 1 point estimate.<p>Using the queue length and the impact on variability is still an interesting concept, i just don&#x27;t think you should connect it with breaking down everything into single-sized items.</div><br/><div id="40983505" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40983505" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Karrot_Kream</span><span>|</span><a href="#40982998">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40983139">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40983505">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40983505">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wish the article spent longer with discussing the queuing view and less time on pointing out the flaws with story points, but I guess I&#x27;m biased because the flaws already are &quot;obvious&quot; to me.<p>I think there&#x27;s an inherent tradeoff between the overhead and misery of breaking down a task into granular subtasks and the variance of task completion time. In practice what this would mean using a queue style form of tracking would be that you trust your team to break down work and do time-bounded investigation into unknowns. Then you look at your task completion rate. Now measuring this as an RV gives you not just the average task completion time, as we reduce to using Little&#x27;s Law, but also variance of task completion time. If we find task completion time to have too much variance despite the input queue length of tasks not actually growing very much (i.e. the arrival rate is staying stable and low), then it&#x27;s probably worth having the team break down tasks in a more granular fashion (or maybe it&#x27;s a single person who keeps making giant tickets or something). On the other hand if the team keeps complaining about straight-jacket ticket discipline, it&#x27;s probably worth letting folks be more loose with task creation. There&#x27;s a human element here but there always is, since it&#x27;s humans who are doing the work, and that&#x27;s fine.<p>I&#x27;ve always argued that output per person on a team should be modeled as RVs, but I really like this queuing approach and it&#x27;s something I may bring up on my team. Again in practice I&#x27;d probably just track task completion times on a weekly basis. This would be much simpler than story points and instead of the bickering that comes with trying to break a ticket up, it would give engineers more autonomy over task creation.<p>I really like the idea.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40983139" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40983139" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hi_hi</span><span>|</span><a href="#40982998">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40983505">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40980225">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40983139">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40983139">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The bit where it broke down for me was where they initially make the (great) point that agile falls down where small story points for simple tasks (which is accurate) are added to large story points for complex tasks (which is much less accurate), leading to a net inaccurate estimate.

Statistically, it is the longitudinal behavior that can be predicted (sprint success rate at a specific velocity on a stable team), but we focus on cross sectional details (we missed this sprint).<p>Project management is generally not considered a field requiring statistical expertise but modeling reality of the work requires it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40981825" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40981825" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yibg</span><span>|</span><a href="#40980225">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40981515">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40983619">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40980362">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40981825">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40981825">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why not just say that then?

It had story point, but also estimated time and actual time. We used them all, and I found the estimated and actual time to be the most useful. We then went to Jira, which kept the points and dropped the time.<p>Since we were tracking the actual time things took as well, our estimates got better over time. The team would help to keep others honest. For example, writing documentation always took at least 3x longer than anyone expected, so we’d alway make people add more time to those stories.<p>Once we had reasonably accurate time estimates, there was also a feature for available hours. If someone was on vacation, we’d subtract those hours while planning the sprint. It was then easy to see who was over committed, balance the work, and to make sure we were being realistic.<p>We worked like this for about 2 years. It was probably the best 2 years I had in the job. We got a lot done, we were being strategic about our work rather than reactive, and while we would push to get things wrapped for the end of the sprint and the demo, it never involved all nighters or heroics. We pushed because people on the team wanted to do more and go faster, not because of pressure from the outside. I noticed people got more down when they tried to do less, so I’d often push back on people trying to overload the sprint. If they finished everything, we could always add more. Outside the team, our VP told us we were 3+ months ahead of everyone and if I wanted to go hang out in a cafe in Europe for a few months, go.<p>This is all a distant memory now.

(I said &quot;most&quot; -- there are of course exceptions.)  You can&#x27;t evaluate employee performance by looking at a burn-down chart.  You can&#x27;t show pretty graphs at the end of every sprint and expect that to predict the future of the project.<p>What you <i>can</i> do is set a reasonable deadline with your team, have them work toward it, and allow them to adjust your expectations on what exactly you will be getting by that deadline.  Yes, establishing that deadline in the first place requires some sort of estimation, but story points, t-shirt sizes, etc. are useless for that.  Everyone on the team sitting down, breaking things down into as-small-as-possible tasks, and coming up with time ranges for each task is the way to do that.  Then you add up all the minimums and maximums and you have a time range for the whole project.  But that range is still only a guess, and can&#x27;t be taken as gospel.  And it may be wild, like &quot;somewhere between 6 weeks and 6 months&quot;, and you have to accept that.<p>That&#x27;s it.  That&#x27;s the best you can do.  As the project carries on, the only thing you can reasonably report on is the list of features or functionality that&#x27;s been implemented so far, and the new range of the estimate based on what&#x27;s remaining to do.  You can also look at the completed work, and map out where in the per-task estimate range the team ended up hitting, but that still can&#x27;t predict the future.<p>You especially can&#x27;t evaluate performance based on this stuff.  That requires being an involved (but not micro-manager-y) manager who knows the team and can identify when their people are shining bright, and when they are struggling (or just slacking off).  It&#x27;s called <i>people</i> management for a reason; you have to involve the humans in that process and can&#x27;t evaluate them based on some made-up numbers and dodgy, hand-wavy math.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40981480" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40981480" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wsc981</span><span>|</span><a href="#40981647">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40980917">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40981480">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40981480">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just estimate time.

And I&#x27;ve used pretty much every schedule forecasting method over my long career.<p>The author touches on many of the reasons why story points don&#x27;t work. And pretty much every reason he gives is something that you are not supposed to do.<p>The key to getting them to work is trust, and a commitment to never use story points as metrics to measure the performance of developers. Any attempt to do so will result in gaming of the system. The tradeoff that stories provide is lack of precision in exchange for not having to spend 50% of your development cycle up front doing detailed analysis required to provide detailed estimates (which never worked anyway).<p>Things you must also never do:<p>- compare calibrated burndown factors between teams.<p>- Ask why the calibration factor isn&#x27;t N. THe calibration factor is.<p>- Have stories with more than N story points (where N is 3 or 5). Decompose them.<p>- Introduce the least bit of stress.<p>- Use burndown rates to generate commitments, instead of forecasts.<p>- Use forecast results to justify asking developers to work overtime.<p>The last point, I think, is particularly interesting. The manager who was my first scrum master made the following commitment to us: you will never work overtime again.

Like the overall size guess is just 2-3 seniors looking at an issue and wondering if this takes days, weeks, months or years to implement.<p>The actual implementation discussion is however what the article is talking about. We get most or all of the team into a meeting and we talk through what needs to be done, and structure all of that into individual concrete tasks everyone can have an idea of implementing them. And then we estimate those tasks.<p>And this estimation in turn is communication to management. Like, we&#x27;ve realized that about 21 is what one of us can do in a usual monthly iteration outside of massive outages and such (we&#x27;re an operational team). So if an epic turns out to require some 3 21&#x27;s and 3 13&#x27;s... that can easily take 6-12 months unless we put exceptional focus on it. With high focus... as a team of 4-5, that will still take 3-6 months to do.<p>On the other hand, something that falls into a bunch of 5&#x27;s and 9&#x27;s and such tends to be muddled and struggled through regardless of whatever crap happens in the team much more reliably. It needs smaller chunks of overall attention to get done.<p>And note that this communication is not deadlines.

This is hit on when it mentions small teams hitting their estimates. They can do this because their task list is small enough to go through all the permutations and actually come up with an accurate estimate. The only way to keep an n^p problem under control is to divide and conquer it. The leafs of that process must not go beyond a fixed size and the task divisions can&#x27;t be recombined prematurely.

Points as a method for attributing difficulty to a work item, vs 2. The collaboration process of creating a task list as a method of breaking down work.<p>Running a team, I found pointing useful, more useful than the individual line engineers did, as we had different goals. My goal, in optimizing the team, was to go through all our work, get everyone in a room and create a relatively optimal plan for the next couple of weeks.<p>By going through the exercise of pointing, we often found that something one person thought was hard, another found easy. That act of estimating would reveal knowledge one person had that another didn&#x27;t, that made the task easier. Without that process, the work might have been harder do do, because the easy way was never revealed. We also adhered to a 8 points is too many philosophy that meant any item that hard needed to be decomposed to simple tasks to repoint.<p>The &quot;queuing&quot; section basically implies the planning process should decompose tasks all the way to nothing but 1 point stories (or at least similarly sized work items within some variance). It&#x27;s basically the same process as pointing, except not calling out some things are chunkier than others because it all comes out in the wash.<p>TL;DR this articles definition of queuing is basically pointing where task = 1 point items.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40980689" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40980689" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bb88</span><span>|</span><a href="#40980301">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40981985">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40980689">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40980689">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a problem from a management perspective, not a developer one.<p>Story points are usable, but they&#x27;re a &quot;Wild Ass Guess&quot; metric, not a true metric of actual work, and treating them other than a guess is fraught with problems.

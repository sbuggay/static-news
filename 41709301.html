We are hiring for several roles, but the one I will highlight is what we call the Platforms Engineer. Some companies call this Site Reliability Engineering or Devops.<p>The main thing we do is take upstream software, build it, run it on our infrastructure, and then monitor it and optimize that setup. Some things that make this interesting are:<p><pre><code>    * Building automation that enables us to do this for many networks (60+ currently).
    * Doing this with high uptime, building automation for failover, etc.
    * Working with software that is on the one hand cutting-edge and doing interesting things (consensus algorithms, distributed systems, cryptography), but on the other hand that means it’s immature and often not easy to operate and monitor. Often we have to build custom tools, and dive into the source code of the project. We contribute patches upstream when it makes sense.
    * Some of these projects are exercising the limits of what a machine can do, we have to do some low-level investigation that requires understanding of what the Linux kernel and network hardware are doing to properly identify what’s going on.

After 8 months of using Python everyday, I can honestly say there wasn&#x27;t a single programming session I didn&#x27;t actively rue Python. Combine that with the hard switch from immutable functional paradigms in ClojureScript to mutable state object-oriented paradigms in Python, and I was thoroughly unhappy.<p>Elixir is immutable and functional, they&#x27;ve made great strides in ML tooling (especially with Nx &amp; Nx.Serving), and Phoenix is absolutely foolproof.<p>I bit the bullet and moved my webserver to Elixir.

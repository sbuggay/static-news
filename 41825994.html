Lucca, from Buffalo, New York, founded the National Columbus Day Committee, which lobbied to make Columbus Day a federal holiday<p>&gt; San Francisco claims the nation&#x27;s oldest continuously existing celebration with the Italian-American community&#x27;s annual Columbus Day Parade, which was established by Nicola Larco in 1868, while New York City boasts the largest, with over 35,000 marchers and one million viewers around 2010<p>So, while the Italian-Americans you grew up with may not have been one of the 35,000 marchers in NYC, I bet most of those 35,000 marchers considers themselves Italian-American. They, and all other Italian-Americans, get a federal holiday which they can use to celebrate the connection between Italy and America (if they so wish), thanks to Italian-Americans lobbying for Columbus Day since the 1800s.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41835365" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41835365" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">miramba</span><span>|</span><a href="#41827753">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41834702">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41834836">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41833773">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41835365">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41835365">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Can‘t speak for the others, but I  learned that from the Sopranos episode “Christopher”:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Christopher_(The_Sopranos)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Christopher_(The_Sopranos)</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41833773" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41833773" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">toyg</span><span>|</span><a href="#41827753">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41833042">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41834574">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41835391">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41833773">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41833773">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; since the Greeks that people knew the world was not flat</i><p>Actually, most Greek knowledge had fundamentally disappeared from Western Europe for centuries, even before the official dissolution of the Western Roman Empire.

Reaching Lisbon first on the way back was also a disaster, prompting an immediate ultimatum by the portuguese by violation of a treaty, which led ultimately to the tordesilhas treaty which left the kingdom of castille and aragon out of the spice trade. He felt the failure so personally that he sailed back 4 times looking for a passage to the great sea beyond the new world, failing every time and becoming so embittered in the process, that he eventually lost his allies in court. It was only 40 years and lots of failed settlements after the columbus expedition that Spain hit proverbial jackpot and found the gold and silver which made the nation extremely wealthy in Europe, for a time.

Sephardic comes from the name of the land of Sephard. You are correct that in modern Hebrew this name refers to Spain, however it should be noted that Biblical use of the word did not refer to Spain or the Iberian peninsula. It is a modern (in the Jewish sense, e.g. hundreds of years) idea that the word refers to that area - nobody today knows where the area is that the Bible referred to with that name.<p>Ashkenaz, the descendant of Noah, was from present-day-Syria. Thus the term Ashkenazi literally means &quot;From the area of present-day Syria&quot; or more concisely &quot;From the Levant&quot;.<p><pre><code>  &gt; However, when you see a Jew with the last name Ashkenazi, it&#x27;s safe to assume they&#x27;re Sephardi. Why? Because last names for Jews are a more recent historical development and these Jews immigrated to Sephardic territory hundreds of years ago (before the expulsion talked about in this thread) and have fully assimilated into the Sephardic tradition.

Right off the bat, that&#x27;s the absolute opposite of what a typical scientist would do with absurdly controversial findings -- and apparently this is the same pattern he&#x27;s followed since 2005 on this topic, publishing no data of any kind in actual journals, just &quot;announcing&quot; various findings.<p>He does say <i>&quot;The scientific results, he says, will be presented at a press conference probably at the end of November&quot;</i>, but... that&#x27;s sus af, as the kids say.<p>Beyond that, the DNA analysis itself seems to be in doubt:<p><pre><code>  After the 2003 exhumation, no DNA could be extracted from the bones, Bottle says. The anthropologist says he stopped collaborating with the research team after those first analyses and has not wanted to participate anymore.
  Carracedo recalls that the DNA that came to him was tremendously degraded and later disassociated from the project. He says he won&#x27;t give his opinion on Lorente&#x27;s new results until there is a serious scientific study published in a specialized journal.

The most damning evidence is non-circumstancial&#x2F;character-based, of course, and it&#x27;s what originally had me scratching my head in doubt:<p><pre><code>  In any case, possessing a gene, haplogroup, or haplotype associated with Jewish or Sephardic ancestry does not challenge the historical sources that support Columbus&#x27; birthplace in Genoa. Furthermore, it provides no information about the religious beliefs held by Columbus&#x27; close relatives (parents, grandparents, etc.), the researcher emphasizes... there is no Y chromosome that can be defined exclusively as Jewish-sephary, Chambers argues. Even if the total DNA of an individual was recovered, it would still be impossible to reach definitive conclusions about its exact geographical origin.

In other words: that&#x27;s not really how genetics works...<p>Thanks for sharing OP, this was a fascinating little dive.

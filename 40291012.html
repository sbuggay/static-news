So your acoustics problem is usually:<p>1. Sound goes everywhere and it is not directed just to the places where ears are. This way the sound waves of me speaking also hits the ceiling in a million places and these reflected signals come at you with varying time delay and mix with the direct signal of my voice. If the surfaces of the room are hard, you will have those sounds bouncing around till they loose energy.<p>2. On top of that every room has particular frequencies that it resonates with to create resonances that make that specific frequency ring longer or the room seems to suck the energy out of that frequency. These are called the mosal frequencies of the room.<p>One remedy to 1 is to make big chunks room surfaces absorptive or to put more stuff into the room that scatters the souns waves earlier. So: carpets, special ceilings, curtains, acoustic panels or foam at the walls, etc. Tirns out human flesh is also quite good ar this, so packing the room with people also helps.<p>Another way to deal with 1 (if you can&#x27;t touch the architecture) is to emit souns in a very directed manner only to where ears are. Nut that means microphones, a mixer, 5k€ per piece beamforming loudspeakers + personal with enough acoustic knowledge to place them in the right spot and steer the beam in the right way etc.<p>The room mode thing is almost luxury to treat by that point, but it typically involves changing the room geometry, and building buying specially tuned absorbers that are tuned and measured within the room. Depending on how low you want to go with the frequency of your acoustic treatment these absorbers become big fast and can  take a third of the space in a room.<p>In my experience the main problem is that people building rooms treat acoustics as some afterthought, something expensive that you need to avoid to save money. In fact the planing stage is the <i>cheapest</i> place to improve acoustics. You could for example not decide to make a conference room with pure concrete walls&#x2F;ceiling and a tiled floor, because any person should be able ro imagine the acoustics of that room.<p>I had to work in a newly gallery space that had worse acoustics than a church. When I asked the architect about the acoustics and why the delay times don&#x27;t fit the purpose, the architect said for money reasons they ordered &quot;a better looking car deck&quot;. The acoustic treatment of that space will cost way more than if they just hadn&#x27;t decided on a barren ceiling and pure concrete walls.<p>The same points go for insulation between rooms. There is no magic here, just physics. If you want insulation you have to put mass between rooms and decouple&#x2F;dampen their interactions. You either do that from the start by building things correctly or you do that afterwards by building another floating room in your existing room. In both cases you have to inspect painstakingly for acoustic bridges, sometimes a single nail touching the outer wall in the wrong way already bridges enough sound to make it noticable.<p>We know how to build good sounding and well insulated spaces. People just don&#x27;t want to pay for it. We know how to reproduce speech in acoustically horrible places, people just don&#x27;t want to pay for it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40292539" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40292539" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shmageggy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40316417">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40316393">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40292539">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40292539">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Judging by the figures in the paper, it appears to attenuate low frequencies better than high frequencies, which is perhaps to be expected judging by experience with noise-cancelling headphones.

Sound proofing for mid-high frequencies is easy if one doesn&#x27;t aim at studio quality: just use wood and foam panels, break facing walls and angles with acoustic absorbing objects and cover every window or mirror (read: glass) with a thick curtain, add carpets on the floor and panels on the ceiling, and you&#x27;re done. (hint: a $5 foam panel glued on a thin OSB board makes a quite effective, still light and cheap absorbing panel for mid-high frequencies)
However, bass frequencies will be only marginally affected by that, and depending on what the room is used for, the above treatment might turn out as insufficient: probably overkill for recording a podcast, still not enough for recording music at higher volumes like when miking a band. 
Treatments for lower frequencies are expensive because of the necessity to literally prevent walls, floor and ceiling from vibrating, which invariably requires them to be weighed down adding concrete layers to further lower down their resonance frequency, before adding soundproofing. Sometimes the best approach is to build a drywall room into the room, which of course is more expensive and space constraining than the wood+foam panels solution.</div><br/><div id="40316785" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40316785" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Tom3849</span><span>|</span><a href="#40316300">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40316338">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40316785">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40316785">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Active noise cancellation speakers.

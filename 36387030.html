Valheim [1][2], by any reasonable interpretation of the word, is a completely indie game. It was made almost entirely by a single guy in his spare time after work, well at least until it blew up and he was able to expand the studio. And it was released with little more than a post on itch.io - &#x27;Hey guys here&#x27;s my game and a couple of pics. Let me know what you think.&#x27; And of course it did exceptionally well, because it&#x27;s just a very good game.<p>In my opinion now is currently the absolute golden age for indie development of all sorts. But the catch is you actually need to make really good stuff. Just making a functioning game isn&#x27;t really sufficient. There&#x27;s even still a huge market for stuff that looks like it came from a 24 hour game-jam codeathon, but it needs to be <i>fun</i>. Check out Forager [3] for instance. As a warning, play that game for an hour - and you&#x27;ll be playing it for 10 (or 100) because it&#x27;s <i>really</i> just insanely fun.<p>And that&#x27;s really all it is. The &quot;problem&quot; is that it&#x27;s just become really (relatively) easy to make games. And so just making a functioning complete game is no longer any sort of real achievement. It needs to be fun. Make a game where people, with no connection or bias for you, will <i>organically</i> recommend it - and you&#x27;re going to succeed.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;892970&#x2F;Valheim&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;892970&#x2F;Valheim&#x2F;</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Valheim#Development" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Valheim#Development</a><p>[3] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;751780&#x2F;Forager&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;751780&#x2F;Forager&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="36388770" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36388770" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bigger_inside</span><span>|</span><a href="#36387897">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36388378">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36387999">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36388770">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36388770">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">don&#x27;t forget Rimworld.

Anyone in the startup scene eventually learns the distinction between a startup legitimately chasing high growth and a small business caught up in a trend.<p>Sometimes you should just be a small business, not simply because you as a person are not capable of making something high growth, but because your own circumstances, team, effort, and product simply aren&#x27;t much beyond a niche play.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with running a small business, plenty of people live fulfilling lives fully supported by one, but if you really want to be something more (like topping console charts absent a lottery viral win) it&#x27;s going going to take plenty of chutzpah and commitment.

That is: no matter how big your development budget is, or how many you expect to sell, 100% of that budget goes into developing 1 copy of the game.<p>However, the actual budget does scale with the number of expected sales. A game that is expected to sell 5M copies is going to have a much larger budget than a game that is expected to sell 10k copies. Add to that the lower price of indie games and there is a huge budget difference.<p>The end result of this is that as a gamer I can choose between a â¬20 indie game representing maybe â¬500k of development effort, or an â¬80 AAA game that represents â¬200M of development effort. The AAA game may cost me 4 times as much, but it gives me 400 times the value.</div><br/><div id="36388809" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36388809" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ilyt</span><span>|</span><a href="#36387897">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36388675">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36388819">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36388809">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36388809">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The AAA game may cost me 4 times as much, but it gives me 400 times the value.<p>So what non-multiplayer AAA game you played 400 times as long than an 10 hour indie experience ?

Sure prettier blah blah blah, but we had plenty of big games coming out mediocre and just being bought coz of market inertia of average non-internet-scouring user buying next AAA title from big publisher and not even looking at the smaller ones or indies.<p>Like, if I look at the top amount of spent time in game (the &quot;value&quot; per spend money) it&#x27;s some small dev management games (Factorio, Banished, Rimworld, X4), the type of game that most AAA developers just refuse to make in the first place. Most of &quot;singleplayer story driven ones&quot; I&#x27;ve played also fall out of AAA space because while 20 years ago industry was busy making games like Baldur&#x27;s gate or Fallout, now anything similar only happens in sub-AAA space.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36388819" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36388819" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mejutoco</span><span>|</span><a href="#36387897">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36388675">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36388809">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36388181">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36388819">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36388819">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is assuming that the more money is spent in development the more value you get out of the game.

I would&#x27;ve never clicked a link with that name no matter how good you make your game look.<p>A lot of genuine effort and care went into this but with an uninviting name and, by their own admission, a complicated control screen, no amount of art or advertising would&#x27;ve convinced me as a consumer to buy it.<p>This would&#x27;ve been a smash hit on a flash games site, and it would&#x27;ve probably sold well if Ouya had succeeded.<p>One thing I find interesting is that online multi-player wasn&#x27;t added as a feature during development. I understand how overworked the lone dev must&#x27;ve been, but adding an easy way to play with friends would&#x27;ve surely boosted sales.<p>I also wonder if the game would&#x27;ve gotten more sales on a handheld. I think the 3DS might&#x27;ve made this a great little party game, especially if you follow the &quot;stream a limited version of the game to your friends&quot; model that made DS local multi-player so interesting. Now, with the Switch out, with its built-in local multi-player features, the game might&#x27;ve gotten a popularity boost as well.<p>It&#x27;s sad to see a game made with so much love fail, but with problems in do many key areas I&#x27;m surprised it took them this long to admit defeat.</div><br/><div id="36387882" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36387882" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ido</span><span>|</span><a href="#36387628">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36388005">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36387882">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36387882">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><p><pre><code>    We kept improving the game afterwards and released the final version

I don&#x27;t know how you can blame marketing with a straight face when your game was featured on multiple Nintendo front pages. That&#x27;s more marketing than like 99.9% of games get, and you&#x27;re performing way worse than average. The issue isn&#x27;t marketing.<p>In the article when it gets to the question of whether the game is fun, the developer beats around the bush. &#x27;Well you see...&#x27; which is as good as saying, &quot;no.&quot; What&#x27;s &quot;fun&quot; in a hyper-social &#x27;indie fest&#x27; type of environment with a bunch of people <i>wanting</i> to like everything, has little relationship to what&#x27;s fun when you&#x27;re at home with some friends. In the right environment people can get really hyped and excited over a literal snail race [4]. It doesn&#x27;t mean those people are watching snail race reruns at home.<p>Then there&#x27;s the game itself. You can find the game&#x2F;discussion of it here [1]. There were many complaints about bugs, misleading labeling, poor&#x2F;buggy and unremappable controls, and more. There were also somewhat more &#x27;positive&#x27; questions like somebody simply asking how to even play local-coop since it seems its not well elaborated on in the game. And the developer chose to completely ignore everything and everybody, making a grand total of 4 posts - including 2 about a negative review.<p>There is no recipe for success in games, beyond making good games. Games have become easier to make than ever (even back in 2016), players now have to-play queues months to years long, and there are simply a lot of <i>really</i> good games out there and more being released every day. This game, a silly casual party style game, was directly competing, in 2016, with games like Ultimate Chicken Horse [2].<p>There&#x27;s also a lot of other problems. The game&#x27;s theme isn&#x27;t unique. It feels like a Goat Simulator [3] rip off, in terms of theme, even today. Incidentally Goat Simulator released just a couple of years prior to this game, so it was going to be bucketed there even harder back then. There&#x27;s also the issue of price. You&#x27;re going to be compared against games of the same price (such as Goat Simulator, again), and $10 is a relatively hefty price for this sort of game.<p>The game almost certainly would have well more than 5x the success it did at a price tag like $2, where it can be more comfortably bought as a joke or whatever. And if you want to get into meta-market gimmicking, add Steam cards. There&#x27;s lots of collectors who will pick up cheap games with cards because in a number of cases, cheap games on discount can be bought for &#x27;profit&#x27;, where the card values themselves become worth more than the game.<p>But really most of all, just make a fun game. We live in an era where games can stay purchasable indefinitely on both PC and consoles. If you make a game that people will organically go out of their way to recommend, you&#x27;re going to succeed. There&#x27;s an ever increasing number of long-tail successes, and in games I expect this to increasingly become the norm. Even for games like GTA V, it&#x27;s long tail success [5] is really starting to rival that up-front success that marketing budgets in the hundreds of millions buy.<p>---<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steamcommunity.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;342920&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steamcommunity.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;342920&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;386940&#x2F;Ultimate_Chicken_Horse&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;386940&#x2F;Ultimate_Chicken_H...</a><p>[3] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;265930&#x2F;Goat_Simulator&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;265930&#x2F;Goat_Simulator&#x2F;</a><p>[4] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=r-6Wwd184uo">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=r-6Wwd184uo</a><p>[5] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steamplayercount.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;271590" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steamplayercount.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;271590</a></div><br/><div id="36388511" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36388511" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">badsectoracula</span><span>|</span><a href="#36388213">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36387786">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36388511">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36388511">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; There is no recipe for success in games, beyond making good games.<p>There was an ancient gamedev site in the ancient times of 2000-2001-or-so when the &quot;indie&quot; term first started being used online to describe what up to that point was largely called &quot;shareware games&quot; and the term already a lot of negative connotations attached to it.<p>I don&#x27;t remember much about the site because i only found it around when it shut down but there was an advice from someone who actually made a living back then making games i remember that went something like: code, graphics, music, design, marketing are <i>all</i> aspects and elements of your game and they do not add, you can&#x27;t ignore one and hope the others will pull it up, instead they multiply - fail to pay attention to any of those elements and it will drag down the rest.<p>I paraphrase a bit (or a lot) since it has been more than two decades since i read that but i think it holds up today as much as it did back then.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36387809" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36387809" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">raverbashing</span><span>|</span><a href="#36387786">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36387832">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36387809">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36387809">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;50% in marketing is common, especially for AAA games&quot;<p>Yes, but you&#x27;re not an AAA game!

Minecraft had the visual style of a 2005 bargain bin game and PUBG is the blandest of bland models and art design coupled with a good implementation of their earlier mod.

Whether this is an accurate description of the situation or not is going to depend, but I have met a number of people who think like this even when they&#x27;ve not been that desperate in decades, and it bites them as soon as they stop making so much that it masks the problem.<p>And in some cases, it can be practically true - there&#x27;s various systems that are designed with nasty edges where if you have enough resources accrued, you stop being given support, but the thresholds, by design or incident, are far below the point where you might be able to escape the pit, so you can&#x27;t save your way out of it - you&#x27;ll suffer a catastrophic penalty for accumulating wealth, and then be worse off.<p>Once you get past a certain level of instability, you start seeing gains again from saving if you do it, but not necessarily immediately - after all, if you&#x27;re earning $9 an hour, at perhaps 160hr&#x2F;month, and you&#x27;re spending $800&#x2F;mo on rent,  that&#x27;s $640 ignoring taxes to spend on anything else, so even if you somehow spent _none_ of that on taxes or food or w&#x2F;e, it&#x27;d take more than a month to save one month&#x27;s rent. So the benefits of saving are slow to accrue, when your income is not much past your expenses, and it can be hard to convince someone who&#x27;s never had that level of safety and stability that it&#x27;s worth it when it&#x27;s going to take a long time to be worth it.<p>If your income is outsized enough to your expenses, then it can be more obvious much faster, _but only if you&#x27;ve ever had to think about it_ - if you&#x27;ve been externalizing your life expenses to your parents or a trust fund, it&#x27;s even more foreign to you than the people described above who have concluded saving isn&#x27;t useful, because you&#x27;ve never had to think about money as a resource in your life, it&#x27;s just a thing you spend unendingly.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41144677" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41144677" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">selcuka</span><span>|</span><a href="#41140863">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41143357">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41146719">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41142349">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41144677">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41144677">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is not the point.

Environmental factors play a dominant role early on, but genetics becomes more and more dominant as a person ages; significant privilege or disadvantage earlier in life notwithstanding (excepting major physical impairment by nutrition, lead, etc)! Most studies tend to find the heritability of adult IQ at around 80%.<p>Any research on this area is walking on egg shells and so researchers are highly incentivized to overemphasize possible environmental explanations.

The way it works is you look at the correlation between identical and non-identical twins on some given thing. If there&#x27;s a much stronger correlation between the identical twins, then it&#x27;s probably primarily genetic. What this does is helps to eliminate environmental factors because identical vs nonidentical twins will both be raised in basically the exact same environment.<p>So take height. If identical twins have identical heights while non-identical twins have varying heights, then it&#x27;s safe to assume height is largely genetic. Interestingly separated twins would actually be worse in many cases because you reintroduce environmental deviation. For instance with height, differences may well be down to e.g. nutrition, but when you have them in the same household you can usually assume roughly identical nutrition.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41144373" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41144373" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cat_plus_plus</span><span>|</span><a href="#41140863">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41141030">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41146435">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41144373">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41144373">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Alternatively, ability to delay gratification could be heritable and&#x2F;or influenced by parenting styles, in which case controlling for household income doesn&#x27;t make sense.

What was the exact wording of the “deal” offered to the child and would a wording change alter the results? Was the experiment conducted at a time of food scarcity or abundance? What were the prevailing cultural norms of how a child “ought” to behave?
Would the results change if average child age was 6 months older or younger when experiment was conducted? What was in the drinking water and the air and the paint at the testing site?

Yet, even in this setting of simplicity and reproducibility, physicists have still found it necessary to establish a stringent, five-sigma threshold for discovery — 3 sigma anomalies come and go. Such a stringent threshold is unthinkable in psychology due to practical considerations. Ergo, it’s hard for to see how psychology can become a reliable empirical science.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41144559" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41144559" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">linearrust</span><span>|</span><a href="#41140916">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41141995">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41141707">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41144559">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41144559">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Many details of this particular experiment made me greatly reduce my confidence and interest in social science.<p>There is a reason why many scientists diplomatically classify social &quot;science&quot; as a soft science.

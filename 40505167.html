I also previously worked on SPDK, so it was neat to see it being chosen as a point of comparison.<p>However, I was waiting for the touted memory safety to be mentioned beyond the introduction, but it never really came up again. I was hoping for the paper to make a stronger argument for memory-safe languages like Rust, something like &quot;our driver did not have bugs X, Y, and Z, which were found in other drivers, because the compiler caught them&quot;.<p>Additionally, in a userspace device driver that is given control of a piece of hardware that can do DMA, like an NVMe controller, the most critical memory safety feature is an IOMMU, which the driver covered by the paper does not enable; no amount of memory safety in the driver code itself matters when the hardware can be programmed to read or write anywhere in the physical address space, including memory belonging to other processes or even the kernel, from totally &quot;safe&quot; (in Rust semantics) code.<p>While the driver from the paper may certainly have a &quot;simplified API and less code&quot;, I don&#x27;t expect much of this to be related to the implementation language; it&#x27;s comparing a clean-sheet minimal design to a project that has been around for a while and has had additional features incrementally added to it over time, making the older codebase inevitably larger and more complex. This doesn&#x27;t seem like a particularly surprising result or an endorsement of a particular language, though it perhaps does indicate that it would be useful to start from scratch now and again just to see what the minimum viable system can look like. I certainly would have liked to rewrite it in Rust, but that wasn&#x27;t really feasible. :)<p>In any case, it&#x27;s great to see proof that a Rust driver can have comparable performance to one written in C, since it will hopefully encourage new code to be written in a nicer language than C. I definitely don&#x27;t miss having to deal with manual memory management and chasing down use-after-frees now that I write Rust instead of C.<p>(As a side note, I&#x27;d encourage anyone thinking of using a userspace storage driver on Linux to check out io_uring first before going all in; if io_uring had existed before SPDK, I don&#x27;t know that SPDK would have been written, given that io_uring gets you most of the way there performance-wise and integrates nicely with the rest of the kernel. A userspace driver has its uses, but I would consider it to be a last resort after exhausting all other options, since you have to reinvent all of the other functionality normally provided by the kernel like I&#x2F;O scheduling, filesystems, encryption, etc., not just the NVMe driver itself. That is, assuming the io_uring security issues get resolved over time, and I expect they will.)</div><br/><div id="40509001" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40509001" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anonymousDan</span><span>|</span><a href="#40508367">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40507528">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40509001">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40509001">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Very interesting comment.

Cases where it could be a good fit would be things like database backends or dedicated block storage appliances, situations where the OS would just get in the way and where it&#x27;s viable to dedicate a whole storage device (or several) and a whole CPU (or several) to one task.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40507528" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40507528" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gdiamos</span><span>|</span><a href="#40508367">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40507281">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40507528">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40507528">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That is a bachelorâs thesis - someone should hire that student<p>Clear writing and ideas</div><br/><div id="40509136" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40509136" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eisbaw</span><span>|</span><a href="#40507528">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40507281">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40509136">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40509136">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Let him at least finish M.Sc. first.

I.e. init becomes a lot more involved with an initram that first needs to load the driver (potentially loopback it?) and the mount actual root.<p>To some degree there can also be issues around syscall boundaries. I.e. the usual monolith vs. microkernel.
I haven&#x27;t checked the API they hook into to provide the device to other components.

No prior coding experience.<p>I think that the curriculum design and principles that guide the NEU CS education are fantastic. I’ve been fortunate (or unfortunate, depending on your perspective) to quickly find myself in a mentorship position at work, and there have been a number of times where I realize that the boot camp hire just isn’t thinking the way I do _at all_. The first things drilled into my head were function signatures and manipulating data structures (by implementing a subset of the ruby enumerable module in Racket). This has made problem solving by manipulating data structures (a decently common part of the job, especially at first!) genuinely trivial. Things more or less immediately translate to a map, filter, andmap, ormap, or reduce when trying to get data from its input to its output for whatever unit of work I’m trying to do.<p>Other developers on my team though experience each new technique&#x2F;thing as a new or different thing, which to me seems far more overwhelming. I think most developers naturally develop the intuition, but being told upfront “everything is just these 5 or a combination of them lol” implicitly by the work we were doing was something I’m grateful for.<p>I never enjoyed the pair programming at Northeastern. I was so behind my peers at the time, since most everyone else was like an AP CS student or had been coding since they were a child. I was busy trying to brute force the learning with 40+ hour weeks just for the CS fundamentals classes. I never found someone in my position. I was only paired with people that the intro course was trivial for or they just did not care at all haha. Most brutal part was waiting 5+ hours at office hours with a white board wait list 90+ names deep and then office hours would end and they would send us home. Life before ChatGPT was crazy.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42459648" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42459648" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">achenet</span><span>|</span><a href="#42459656">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42459648">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42459648">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is an interesting article. I do appreciate the focus on pair programming, which is probably something that&#x27;s really helped me improve as a programmer, and their process seems quite interesting.<p>It would be interesting to see this method actually works, i.e. if Northeastern programmers are &quot;more useful to their employers&quot;&#x2F;&quot;better developers&quot; than graduates of Universities using the older approach (&#x27;tinker until it works&#x27;, as the featured article puts it)</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

The point was that it is a <i>three dimensional</i> space, and that&#x27;s because there are three basic components that span it, the three color signals coming from the three types of cones.  And once you have three base vectors, they will span a 3d space (unless co-planar).<p>So quite the opposite of what the poster I was replying to claimed, which was that the idea of representing human color perception as a &quot;space&quot; is somehow &quot;comical&quot;.<p>&gt; So there are color percepts such as responses to pure wavelengths that can’t be reproduced as combinations of real primaries.<p>Sure, which is one of the reasons why the matching functions can have negative coefficients for some colors &#x2F; colorspaces, something that is, er, more difficult with real RGB monitors.   Or, as you also noted, you invent primaries that cover the space but go outside of reality.  The spaces are mathematical constructs, after all.  However they are not <i>arbitrary</i> mathematical constructs.  The fact that they are 3d spaces is rooted heavily in reality.  And mathematically they are actually all the same space (as distinct from specific regions in that space if you constrain the vector components, for example to range [0,1]).<p>&gt; In any case, the whole point of TFA is that a space is not an adequate characterization of color percepts, because there is no Riemannian geometry that matches the psychophysical data.<p>Not really.  The article is a bit fuzzy on some of the terminology, but if you read even the abstract closely, it is clear that they are talking about <i>perceptually-uniform</i> color spaces that make a claim about color differences in that space matching perceived color differences, our good old friend ΔE.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Color_difference" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Color_difference</a><p>I don&#x27;t see the paper making such a claim for the more general concept of a color space that does not claim to be perceptually uniform.  CIE XYZ for example, does not claim to be perceptually uniform.  And isn&#x27;t.<p>And once again, it is well-known that &quot;perceptually-uniform&quot; color spaces are only approximate.  Always have been.  ΔE varies in different regions of the space.  It also varies depending on the area of the color swatches[2].  It also varies depending on whether the color is a light source or reflected.  (IIRC, CIE Luv performs better for light sources).  That these distances don&#x27;t add is an interesting additional wrinkle, but not surprising, given all the other oddities and also the fact that the color spaces were never intended for having the distances add.<p>[1] Some people have reduced function in one or more of the cone types, they are color-blind, and some apparently have four types of cones.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tetrachromacy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tetrachromacy</a><p>[2] The way those color spaces are tested is to give people swatches with colors that, I think, they are allowed to put next to each other.

The different color spaces all have some features they are good at with their own algebra.<p>So, RGB is close to how screen works, but is very un-intuitive as its algebra is additive rather than subtractive (like the one we have with paints). Then HSV is a middle ground to be more practical for humans, as it separates the color into its 3 most significant dimensions, that are value, hue, and saturation. It does so while being a fast linear transform, but it is not a really good mapping with regards to human perception. For example a given fixed value will appear as very different when given two different hues. Still, it&#x27;s a nice middle ground that made it a good choice for painting and image manipulation software.<p>There are other spaces that are &quot;more&quot; perceptual, in that changing the hue of a color should not affect how its value is perceived. This can be useful in design work as a palette could be hue-shifted and always stay legible, which was not possible in the general case with HSV or RGB.
Yet, these fancy color spaces are not used a lot because in most practical applications there isn&#x27;t enough justifications to use them.
In particular because professionals are used to workaround the space deficiencies, so there&#x27;s a cost to re-learn some of the primitives.
The only really practical application I have ever seen of these perceptual models is to simulate &#x27;color blindness&#x27;, which theoretically give the possibility to design charts and maps that are more accessible to people. I believe such a validation tool should be required for public communications.<p>The article is interesting and well written, as it gives an history of how some of these abstractions were developed, and highlight some of its shortcomings.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41142843" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41142843" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Sniffnoy</span><span>|</span><a href="#41145780">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41144973">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41142843">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41142843">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">While this phrases things in terms of Riemannian geometry, it seems to me like this is really about more fundamental metric properties, but I find its terminology a bit unclear.

Indeed, open-ended and criterion-dependent tasks give less accurate measures of similarity because of individual factors and the difficulty of the task…
  Instead, we use a more reliable two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task, where the participant simply answers the following question: &quot;Which is more different?&quot; Specifically, we use a triad arrangement of stimuli with the reference in the middle and one test on either side. Each of 320 triads covering the neutral axis was judged by at least 250 different participants in a crowdsourced study on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) (52).*

The core of it seems strong, IMO. I would have liked a bit more cognitive science &#x2F; philosophy to distinguish between an ideal color space and whatever imperfect model is created by individual human’s neural software, and skipping Goethe and Schopenhauer in the intro was downright criminal, but that’s more on me than them.<p>Color has long been a convenient “entry point” into the study of human unconscious and subconscious data transformations, most notably through Wittgenstein’s musings about red squares. I look forward to this technique being extended to other spaces, even ones as abstract as “moral space” or “valence space”!</div><br/><div id="41144142" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41144142" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">robwwilliams</span><span>|</span><a href="#41142588">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41142821">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41144142">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41144142">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great comment.

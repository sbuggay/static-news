Life is about making choices, and sometimes breaking out requires sacrificing certain aspects of our lives to gain momentum. When you dare to think and act differently, you become the odd one out, and your community may not accept you. But if you do break out and succeed, you reap the rewards you deserve, such as wealth and a home. However, it&#x27;s often impossible to go back to the roots you left behind without even realizing it during the breakout. Personal growth happens along the way, even if others fail to see or understand it. Ultimately, it&#x27;s crucial to trust your instincts and listen to your gut when deciding whether to break out or not.

I grew up in a small town in southwest GA, moved to metro  Atlanta in 1996 and stayed there until last year.<p>We had a house built in 2016 in the northern burbs and thought we had our “forever home”.  All the time from 1996 -2020 I bumped around between 7 jobs as a journeymen “enterprise dev”.<p>My wife had lived in metro Atlanta all of her life.  We got married in 2012 (both on our second marriage).<p>Everything changed in 2020.  Our youngest son (my stepson) graduated from high school,  Covid happened (didn’t fatally affect anyone in our inner or outer circle) and I fell into a remote job at BigTech.<p>When things got back to normal around 2021, we both realized that life is short and we wanted a change.  That’s what caused us to blow up our life and we are both happier now that we really can’t acquire “stuff”.<p>When we left  our condo in March to start our six month trip, we put it in the rental pool, it gets professional managed like a hotel room and we get half the rent to cover our mortgage.<p>We don’t own a car.

Participants in a survey who made major codebase rewrites (to Rust) based on the result of a coin toss were much happier, six months out, than those who didn’t.<p>That six-month figure is important.

I quit my job and moved to Thailand without doing any research about the country, figuring that I could be a bartender again somewhere if it all went south. That ended up becoming the material for my first book. My current professional chapter began when I said “fuck it” to journalism when I couldn’t take the constant ethical compromises and the bullshit of pretending to care about the news cycle. After some flailing, I now make a lot more money and am a lot happier. Blowing up my first marriage was the most difficult one of all, but it was an obviously correct decision, for which my ex-wife later thanked me—we were locked in a pattern that was hurting both of us, and if one of us didn’t walk away, we would’ve eventually been one of those unhappy old couples who constantly radiate bitterness.</i></div><br/><div id="36304940" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36304940" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bbor</span><span>|</span><a href="#36304253">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36307317">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36304940">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36304940">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">...because he switched careers and had a divorce?

You can and should only do this if you have enough money to sustain at least one year without income. His example is very risky as no income was guaranteed, if you can continue to work in another place why not.
It is true that people get accustomed and complacent to their life situation, jobs, etc. And a change in country or job can shake them out of it. However, success and progress in a lot of things require constand effort over time and this is usually easier if you have a consistent routine. Completely changing your life requires you to find a new routine somewhere else which sets you back at least a month in my experience.
I say this from experience as I quit my job and am working on my own project in another country. It is challenging to do only work and experience less docial interaction as your social network is still in the old place.</div><br/><div id="36307059" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36307059" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scarface_74</span><span>|</span><a href="#36305754">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36302547">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36307059">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36307059">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was tempted to delete my previous comment about how I “blew up my life” because I realized that I really wasn’t as bold as I thought I was.<p>I kept my above average paying job working at BigTech where I was able to work remotely.

People tend to resist change due to status quo bias, but breaking free from familiar pain can lead to personal growth and alignment with desires. Making major life changes, whether by choice or through external disruptions, can result in improved outcomes and happiness. While it may feel uncomfortable initially, the disequilibrium can motivate positive change, typically stabilizing within six months.

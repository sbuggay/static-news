It was awesome. Learned everything about building PCs for employees and Windows networking. So much free hardware walked out the door -- usually stuff that was slightly out of date, just stacks of it everywhere.  Spent the next three summers there through college too. It was really exciting there at that time, Internet age just taking off. They had beer at 4PM on Fridays out back.<p>Everything went downhill with the series of acquisitions. Anyway, I&#x27;m grateful for my time there... I can trace where I am now directly back to the guy who first gave me a chance there.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42093273" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42093273" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tirant</span><span>|</span><a href="#42092718">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42092933">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42093273">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42093273">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It’s very interesting to learn about Cyrix and how innovative they happened to be. Back in the 90s most of us, at least in Europe, learned about Cyrix from either friends or shop clerks. And back then Cyrix had a terrible reputation, they were considered almost as illegal Intel CPU clones. AMD also had a terrible reputation until they released their Socket 7 AMD K6 CPUs and later on their Super Socket 7 K6-2, K6-3 CPU’s just before their amazing Athlon and Duron family. Cyrix never regained any reputation, and slowly their offerings ended up mixed with VIA or Centaur CPUs. Celeron and AMD CPU’s were already cheap enough so no one was buying Cyrix anymore to just save $20-$30 on a $1000 computer.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42092933" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42092933" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">flomo</span><span>|</span><a href="#42093273">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42092394">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42092933">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42092933">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was going to post about something, but according to Wikipedia, the IBM 486SLC found in super slow PS&#x2F;2 crap computers had nothing to do with the Cyrix 486SLC.

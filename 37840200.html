(Effeciency drops with heat, gains with cold.)<p>There&#x27;s not a whole lot you can do about this, except allow for passive air cooling. There are some water cooled panels available, but costs make them uneconomic for now.<p>I was interested to learn though that on a cold summers day, the panel output can exceed the nominal rating got the panel. Something to consider if you are at high altitude.</div><br/><div id="37842224" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37842224" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stinos</span><span>|</span><a href="#37841167">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37841652">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37842224">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37842224">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>solar panels don&#x27;t like being hot</i><p>Indeed, and this touches on the &#x27;Regular cleaning of PV panels is important for ensuring maximum energy production&#x27; statement in a funny way. First of all, while the statement is accurate, I&#x27;d say is not too important practically depending on where you live. As our isntallation guys also told us. Our panels seem to do just fine with occasional heavy rainfall to clean them and the loss when they&#x27;re covered in a thin layer of dust is not worth spending time on. On the other hand, the PV cleaning companies will say that it&#x27;s super important to clean them. So when my mum got her panels cleaned it went like this: sunny day, panels get hot, efficiency drops. Panels were cleaned with water, temperature drops, cleaners told her &#x27;look how much better it is now&#x27;. But after they were gone temperature rose again and efficiency was essentially back to where it was before.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37841652" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37841652" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">darkwater</span><span>|</span><a href="#37841167">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37842224">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37841263">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37841652">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37841652">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yep, I live in Southern Europe and my panels have the biggest output end of April&#x2F;May, while one would expect it to be end of June.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37841263" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37841263" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tibbydudeza</span><span>|</span><a href="#37841167">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37841652">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37841263">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37841263">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Had to get a home PV system out of necessity due to our national power company being up a shitcreek with an aging fleet of badly maintained coal power plants.<p>3.7 Kw solar panels and 2 x 5KW LifePO batteries and a 5Kw SunSynk inverter tied to the grid - solar geyser and it does not power our electric oven - the only issue is the management system is dumb as bricks - there is no intelligence and difference charge settings or profiles for our cold winters and hot summers or using the weather forecast for the day.<p>It just averages out.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

Change the code, change the docs, no screwing around, BUT a quick &amp; simple brain dump can suffice because of [see next paragraph].<p>To whit: I have yet to hear of a documentation system that provides fully bidirectional updates between such documents-as-code and edits made further downstream along the documentation production pipeline. That is to say, when a TC person or a reviewer makes edits to content, these changes should propagate back to the docs-as-code material.<p>Then everyone benefits, including senior devs whose scarce time is optimised by having TC people expand and polish their hasty scribblings, and junior devs who have well-maintained documentation at-hand in-place.<p>My 0.02€, YMMV.

Frankly isn’t it just like normal code with verbose comments? I have seen lots of code like that and it is not referred to as literate. The only difference is that this is a PDF, which makes it less practical and it is still not particularly readable as a book.<p>It might have great book-like typography but not the &quot;narrative&quot; structure that helps you properly understand how it works without getting bogged down in details first. There&#x27;s no coherent outline, no chapters or sections for major systems or design decisions, no overarching overviews, no relating different parts and giving context. There&#x27;s also no story of how it was built or a log of his thoughts throughout problem-solving process, that would have been another good angle. Instead it&#x27;s just the code from top to bottom with embedded very local commentary. The code itself is actually rather hard to parse visually by modern typographic standards.<p>The issue is that probably I am misinterpreting what Knuth intended. The Literate Programming concept was a product of its time, and it has evolved into more practical modern documentation standards that are not so tightly linked to the code and don&#x27;t exhaustively cover every line. The only problematic thing about it might just be the grandiose name Literate Programming, without that it&#x27;s mainly good common-sense advice for quality documentation, but not necessarily a practical programming paradigm like the name implies.</div><br/><div id="41895656" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41895656" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">llm_trw</span><span>|</span><a href="#41894814">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41895512">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41898932">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41895656">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41895656">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Again, I&#x27;m having a hard time understanding what the issue is.

Knuth&#x27;s ideas at the time add a layer on top of programming languages to allow you to rearrange the code in a lot of ways that the languages at the time didn&#x27;t support well or at all. It essentially adds an independent concept of &quot;function&quot;, and adds on top of any ability the language had to have documentation its own documentation overlay on top.<p>Problem is, in the meantime, languages got a lot better at functions, got more flexible in their organization, built in better capabilities for documentation and comments, and it all goes a different direction than the languages did. The result in the modern era is a rather bizarre multi-headed hydra of conflicting ideas about how things should be documented and tested.<p>If someone wanted to resurrect the ideas, they need to not just try to get people to do what Knuth laid out decades ago super harder... they really need to sit down from the very beginning and work out how to update it in the modern era to be less redundant to what we already have. It could be as simple as taking modern doc strings and upgrading them a bit to allow highly-formatted comments to be embedded into code. Or, instead of trying to &quot;weave&quot; the code into a static book, allow the user to specify an entry point and then follow through everything that happens in the functions that it calls and turn that into a book, e.g., say &quot;I&#x27;m going to enter this web framework through this path, tell me everything that happens&quot;. Or some other idea I don&#x27;t have yet.

Today I work for a small private firm, but years ago I worked in a corporate job (with tech writers). I drank the Kool-Aid. I believed the work I was doing was important and critical because someone up the vertical decided it was and they hired someone who hired someone who hired me to do a job--its corporate world.<p>The tell for preaching to the choir, what triggered my response, are the hyperbolic strong statements (&quot;products cease to exist&quot;, &quot;your business don’t crumble overnight&quot;, &quot;failures are dramatic&quot;) which sound defensive. The rest of the blog post reads as defining what exists and setting standards, and further explanation of why it&#x27;s all important. This is the breadth and depth. What I&#x27;m not reading are on&#x2F;off-ramps and shortcuts that all of the developers who disagree about the mission critical position of documentation would regard as sensible accommodations.<p>Today I work in a small firm and we need documentation. What I learned from underpaying small business is documentation is important and has a role (otherwise our small firm wouldn&#x27;t waste our time on it). But if I took the position argued here, I would be told I was wasting time, that I should focus, get it done, and move on my job tasks. If you&#x27;re working closely with writers, then you need to believe what they&#x27;re doing is important without being told. If you don&#x27;t believe this, then maybe your role does not need documentation (yet? or your group is small enough and people like the job security or you&#x27;re just overworked, or something else). When I&#x27;m working collaboratively and I hear people tell me what I&#x27;m doing is not important, I have to believe there is some truth to it.

Case in point is Drupal and Symfony. Trying to use api.drupal.org is not fun, and Symfony&#x27;s docs always cover the basics, and then there&#x27;s nothing on pulling everything together into something complicated. So you try to dig into the actual code, and end up finding multiple layers of uncommented abstractions. Yes, I can eventually figure out what is going on if I put the effort in, but that&#x27;s a lot of time that could be save by a few lines of comments.<p>I usually end up asking JetBrains AI about what I need, then use what it says after I fix the errors it makes... It&#x27;s also very good at summarizing everything I&#x27;d find if I used a normal search. But that all only works if others have already asked and answered my questions.<p>Some things I&#x27;ve been trying to do to improve my own code&#x27;s documentation:<p>* Unless the line is super obvious, even if I think it is obvious, I try to leave a comment. Yes, it seems pointless, but I have gone back to old code I remember being obvious without said comment enough times that I think it is worth it.<p>* Avoiding &quot;elegance&quot; in favor of &quot;explicitness&quot;. For example, I use full `if` statements instead of ternary operators even when ternary operators would look better. For whatever reason the syntax of ternary operators has never sunk in for me, and the explicitness of `if` is much easier to parse. I also use very descriptive function and variable names. Basically, if I have to think about what something means, I try to change it so I don&#x27;t have to.<p>* Split out functions into smaller functions as much as I can&#x27;t. This means I can use descriptive function names. And I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s just good practice.<p>I also have been trying to figure out ways to keep higher level docs closer to my code. I have some ideas, but haven&#x27;t tried them yet. Has anyone ever written something that detects changes to a method&#x2F;function, and then when you save your file it pops up asking if related docs need updating? Maybe add comments to the method pointing to where related docs live, and then your IDE&#x2F;tool uses that to know what docs need updating?</div><br/><div id="41895559" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41895559" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">simonw</span><span>|</span><a href="#41895455">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41899075">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41895559">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41895559">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Has anyone ever written something that detects changes to a method&#x2F;function, and then when you save your file it pops up asking if related docs need updating?&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve got a partial solution to that: I have automated tests that introspect my code for things that need documentation and then fail if those items aren&#x27;t at least mentioned in the docs.

This author is not joking about how different an experience it is playing pinball when you don&#x27;t have to worry about pumping in quarters or being elbowed out by the next player. Pinball machines from the 90s on are reasonably complex games. They have levels, modes, and lots of goals to attain. Multiball is a reward<p>&gt; I’m fortunate enough to live near the biggest publicly accessible pinball arcade (Pinball Hall of Fame)<p>In danger of being rude, I&#x27;d say the Pinball Hall of Fame is about worth the price of admission (it&#x27;s free to enter). Maybe I visited on an off day, but it seemed to be just a warehouse full of privately own machines, about half of which were operating. My local pinball place (Next Level Pinball Museum, outside of Portland, OR) has a very large collection which spans the history of Pinball from very early games to machines that have HD video displays on the backboard.<p>I strongly recommend if you&#x27;ve never given it a try, find a pinball place that&#x27;ll let you pay a flat fee for admission and spend some time on some games. My personal favorites:<p>- Attack From Mars<p>- Cactus Canyon<p>- Medieval Madness<p>- Creature from the Black Lagoon<p>- Star Trek (based on the Abrams movies)<p>- Super Mario Bros (the full size table from 1992)</div><br/><div id="37581837" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37581837" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Slartie</span><span>|</span><a href="#37580741">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37581056">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37581837">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37581837">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would definitely add Star Trek - The Next Generation to that list as well.

You should take a peek into the belly of a machine when you get the chance somewhere - ideally into a newer machine, manufactured after 2010, and into a 90s machine. That&#x27;s a stark comparison: the 90s models have thousands upon thousands of individual cables, wiring hundreds of individual lamps and solenoids and sensors. On the newer machines, manufacturers tried to cut down on the number of cables, pre-fabricating larger modules with LEDs on large PCBs, or installing sub-controllers from which solenoids are driven instead of wiring all of them individually with hundreds of large cables into the backbox.<p>But there are limits to this kind of optimization. After all, pinball machines are mechanical contraptions that need to integrate lots of individual mechanical parts spread over a large area. If you can&#x27;t replace them with solid-state elements (which is basically what a virtual pinball table does, by replacing almost all mechanics with a screen) or concentrate them into smaller areas, you can only gain so much using modularization.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37581118" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37581118" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fardo</span><span>|</span><a href="#37580813">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37581806">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37581599">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37581118">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37581118">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Two big things. First, because the economics of modern pinball are brutal, venues mostly stopped buying, so manufacturers and their competition shrivelled up and with it, supply. The supply-side market at this point is effectively dominated by individuals and collectors, neither who want to part with their machines, as they’re nostalgic items and they know they have value.<p>Furthermore, working machines come at big premiums as repairs are finicky, expensive, and time consuming - god help you if you own a machine and some targets or rollovers on your machine give out, as it’s challenging to find someone who’s even capable of doing the repairs, let alone pay their price. The expertise to do it is really thin these days because all the people who historically used to make a living from it are all getting old and retiring. This combines with a second problem: although widespread 3D printing helped a little with making repairs more doable,  parts are hard to come by and often demand cannibalizing other old or dead machines - meaning a working machine is worth its weight in gold, and so is a dead one: Either it has interested players, or it’s of value for salvage.

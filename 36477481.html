It made individual householders deliriously happy, enshrined them as Tory voters for decades and from shelter statistics left 1.5 million families functionally homeless. Millions live in penury, in squalid hotels because councils are disincentivised from fixing things, penalised even.<p>Australia&#x27;s housing crisis is just as bad. Truly sordid tropes about rent caps and freezes are trotted out again and again, as if simply reciting them makes them axioms: they&#x27;re not. All statements about effects on housing stocks are contextual and depend on other social policy, including (surprise surprise) building more rental homes by the state.<p>I&#x27;m a home-owner at the end of my working life.

Probably pretty uncontroversial.<p>But also development increases <i>long-term</i> values by <i>continuing to grow long term demand</i>.

In the conversations I&#x27;ve had with Boomers and older people, although there  is the standard derision for youth that is stereotypically expected of older generations, I would say there is more an immense blindspot and unwillingness to consider even a slight sacrifice of any type, even for their own children. The expectation is that the youth will just have to work hard like they did in there day and a complete unwillingness to confront any sort of conversation about what hard work could buy in their day vs the present one. I&#x27;ve watched boomers talk to each other about their kids or grandkids being unable to buy a home amongst each and other and I would describe the overall vibe as being one of detached &quot;oh well, sucks for them&quot; type acceptance, and trying to console each other that their kids are doing fine in other ways (they buy a new iphone every other year!!!).  Your comment actually mirrors a lot of their attitude, especially the part about how the youth of today would definitely do the same things, so why feel guilty about doing it, a hypothesis that has no way of being disproved and which exists largely as a balm to soothe their conscience as they try to deal with the cognitive dissonance of watching their children suffer, and then voting for parties and policies that will prolong that suffering.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t imagine any young person doing something to help another person out in some sort of solidarity and yet I generally see this exact mindset in terms of voting for left wing parties that will raise taxes, including theirs, voting and campaigning for increased density which will affect the character of their neighborhoods and possibly decrease their property values. Hell I have never voted for a party that would decrease my taxes and I am pretty up front about needing to be taxed more as I am very fortunate with my employment and income situation. I&#x27;ve had conversations at length with boomers advocating for tax cuts which would cut funding to education, arguing that it is pretty convenient that they want these cuts right around the time that they have no children in public school and asked if we should also cut medical funding, funding that they disproportionately draw on and the response has been universally &quot;No&quot;, that funding is good and necessary.<p>So I don&#x27;t think that they young are &quot;especially targeted&quot; and more that anyone who is not a boomer and up is targeted and that happens to include the youth. We can tell ourselves a bunch of stories but stats around home ownership, lifespan, healthspan, median income, etc, etc, etc, a laundry list tells the actual story of what the current relationship is like between generations.

Until the financial crisis in 2007, the country liberalized building, often quite dense as opposed to plain sprawl. See, for instance, the growth in the towns surrounding Madrid around train stations. The crisis slowed it down massively though, in part because a lot of builders lost their shirts, as the building became massive overbuilding. But when demand goes up enough, it&#x27;s still possible to build, and build high. In my home town in Spain, people can still afford homes. If there&#x27;s an issue, it&#x27;s still just jobs instead.<p>So yes, this is all something that is politically solvable in the west. We just need a unified legislative recipe, and strong advocacy.

I&#x27;m part of a few UK and Canadian regional subreddits, and the topics of conversation are often very similar. House prices are too high, we need to build more, the government is favouring boomers, the economy is stagnating, we need more manufacturing and less real estate speculation etc. What&#x27;s particularly interesting is that often in the UK ones people paint Canada as being far better. The Canadian ones seem to idolise the US.<p>It&#x27;s clearly a global structural issue. Low interest rates are a pan-national commonality - and they can take a lot of blame for part of the situation we&#x27;re in now. But they don&#x27;t explain housing shortages.<p>Population growth probably plays a big part - housing is always going to be lagging population growth. The various stories I&#x27;ve seen about Japan - with low rents, falling house prices and large numbers of abandoned houses - seem to map with the falling Japanese population. &quot;Things were better in the 70s&#x2F;80s&#x2F;90s&quot; probably partly just means that the ratio of houses to people was better. The population of most major western cities was falling or flat through much of the 70s and 80s - leading to the situation where my parent&#x27;s generation all seem to have snapped up large, well located houses for not very much money.<p>I&#x27;m fully supportive of the idea that, with all things equal, if we build more houses then supply and demand will drop prices. But if you allow unchecked population growth (which in the UK and Canada seems to be primarily caused by immigration) then the amount of building required is effectively infinite.<p>I&#x27;ve visited the Toronto area from the UK more or less every year since I was a child, and the overwhelming story is one of huge development. The change in the suburbs of Toronto over the past 30 years has been vast and unlike anything I&#x27;ve seen in the UK. Yet that clearly hasn&#x27;t been enough to stop house prices going crazy as well. The net effect, though, is that there&#x27;s miles and miles of sprawl and 6 lane streets dominated by cars. The answer definitely isn&#x27;t to build more of that. The population of Canada has grown by 40% in the last 30 years.<p>Population growth combined with an ageing population and the kind of rights purchasing a house gives you in the west create increasing inequality driven by land. That seems to be the underlying issue that&#x27;s driving city house values up everywhere.<p>There are possibly some answers. In the UK in the 60s-80s we built entire new cities, with the land purchased by the government at agricultural value so that the entire uplift was captured by the developers rather than speculators.</div><br/><div id="36486454" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36486454" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">resolutebat</span><span>|</span><a href="#36477636">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36478164">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36485887">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36486454">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36486454">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Housing in Japan is affordable even in the big cities that are not shrinking (yet).

Housing prices do seem a lot more stable than in Anglosphere nations, however, and they&#x27;re constantly building new housing (and knocking down old buildings to make way for them).  Just like many other places, the population is concentrating in the big cities, so the population is generally rising there.

The private landlord pays off the mortgage and gets to pocket more of the money. There&#x27;s no benefit to the state.<p>It&#x27;s the same with social care. The government could build social care, instead we&#x27;re paying up to £50k&#x2F;week per child[0] towards some cunt&#x27;s yacht.<p>And it&#x27;s the same with the NHS. Nurses have a hard time and poor pay and some quit. The government then bring in an agency nurse, paying the agency 2-4x the salary of the NHS nurse that will have to babysit them because they aren&#x27;t familiar with their ward and refusing to raise the rate of pay for their own nurses. The remaining nurses see this and some more quit, agency work pays more and you get to choose when you work. This spirals into a very avoidable staffing crisis.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t understand this. I didn&#x27;t say no regulation. But there&#x27;s a huge gap between that and making it incredibly difficult to build. Citing some basic anti-zero regulation argument in response to what I said is disheartening.<p>I didn&#x27;t claim you were arguing for no regulation, arguing that regulations should be made more lax in the face of those events is what&#x27;s disheartening.

It&#x27;s kinda like gold or bitcoin, except those assets are actually very limited in number. But housing is simply artificially limited due to policies.<p>Total UK housing stock is worth 10T GBP vs 2.2T GBP GDP output. Don&#x27;t think any other country comes even close in terms of skewed reliance on housing as a driver of wealth. I can&#x27;t imagine the reduction in net worth of citizens (65% are owners) when house prices crash 20% due to higher interest rates. That would be 2T of the 10T value - almost the same as GDP.<p>Anecdotally, every British person I know has a common long term goal - save enough money for a 5-10% deposit on a mortgage. The incentives here are all wrong. You build wealth by investing in a house &amp; taking 90% loan to value mortgages instead of actually working harder. Work is just a means to save enough for deposit &amp; afford a mortgage premiums and maybe 1-2 holidays a year.<p>People complain UK is stagnating. Companies don&#x27;t want to IPO in London. I can tell why - banks don&#x27;t want to lend to SMEs. 50% of their lending is actually housing mortgages. Same with people - they would overwhelmingly invest in a house rather than own company shares. Housing is the root cause of malaise in the economy.

With a transit route you have to consider that people will be walking to the station so its fundamentally a compromise: where one person has a 5 minute walk to the platform on the subway line inevitably means there are people not even very far away who now have a 15 minutes walk, and people farther out who might not even use the local subway because that means they add an hours walk to their day. To serve those people you now need to start planning bus or bike networks on top of the subway. All of these vehicles need operators who need benefits. You also need maintenance yards for rail and bus. Electrical substations. The actual subway line is just a part of it all.<p>With a highway on the other hand, it seems a lot easier to serve more people with less complicated infrastructure. When you run a highway to a town instead of the subway line example above, pretty much everyone in town is close enough to the local highway ramp with a car on the existing road network. You don&#x27;t have to consider schedules or hire train operators, people drive themselves when it works for their commute. This highway also serves freight, so now you don&#x27;t need to sell right of way to a freight rail company with the expectation they maintain the line to your town forever (they probably wont). A truck bay is cheaper to build for a business than a freight rail loading dock and maintenance of a rail spur.<p>A lot of cities in the US that are I&#x27;d say less than 1 million people without any geographic bottlenecks are a dream to get around with a car. You pretty much never hit traffic on the highway, so 20 miles is 20 mins away always. The highway network serves the entire region, so you can go just about everywhere in the area in 20 miles in those 20 minutes, not just a handful of places.<p>To offer that sort of convenience, turnkey scheduling with basically 25 minute door to door commutes, in transit form across lets say a 20x20 mile area would be enormously expensive, in the low trillions I&#x27;d guess given current american prices on subway tunnels per mile. Whatever we can afford to build won&#x27;t nearly be so useful, and people are already so addicted to this sort of high speed car based transit that the cat is entirely out of the bag and now this is the expectation, this simply unachievable level of personal convenience using transit.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36477746" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36477746" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tsukikage</span><span>|</span><a href="#36477633">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36477799">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36489905">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36477746">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36477746">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We need to build houses at least as fast as the population grows.

E.g. Mid 2018 to mid 2019, it rose by 361k people. But the UK average household size is 2.4, so 200k new houses should in theory accommodate a population growth of 866k.<p>If those were the only numbers that mattered, it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. We&#x27;d catch up fast.<p>But all houses are not the same. A large part of the problem is people following jobs, and so a significantly higher rate of construction may be needed because people move, and needed types of properties change. Unless you can make the places people are moving away from to be more attractive, e.g. by infrastructure improvement to tie areas together in ways that make them attractive regions for businesses.<p>The bigger issues, however, I think are two structural problems:<p>1. As long as house prices go up at a sufficient rate, the soundest strategy for a developer may be to raise capital to buy land and then sit on it until house prices go up. Your cost of capital to finance it will be financing costs for the cost of the land for however many years you sit on it, and the financing costs for the construction itself only from you start construction until sold. Doubly so because if you&#x27;re a <i>large</i> developer, holding a large parcel of land while you&#x27;re, say, developing something else nearby, and releasing only limited numbers of properties onto the market contributes to keeping the prices up. Near me, one of the best properties in the area, a huge tract right next to one of the best connected train stations in the UK (East Croydon) remained undeveloped for over a decade because developers had no urgency to do anything. It&#x27;s now slowly being developed, but they&#x27;re taking their good time about it, because why wouldn&#x27;t they?<p>You could address that by progressively harsher taxes by duration of under-utilisation, or strengthen ability for local government to take over land, to make it necessary for developers to either move at speed or unload the land on others, but if you fix the house price increases by other means, this problem will also go away by itself.<p>2. There is no political will to cause house prices to drop, because that would mean a lot of people who have seen this as a pension investment, and plan to downsize, will vote against you.<p>To fix this  you probably need a combination of starting slow - reforms that gradually cause the market to stagnate so people stop seeing it as surefire way to make money - coupled perhaps with tax and pension adjustment structured to make it feel like your reforms are relatively neutral. E.g &quot;package&quot; it with substantial state pension increases, or allow for some degree of writeoffs for paper losses on declining property prices, perhaps limited to pensioners only, etc. Some of it you could sunset, and some might well end up being very unfair and effectively bribing people who shouldn&#x27;t have gambled on their home as their main investment asset, but if that&#x27;s what it takes to get support for crashing house prices, it&#x27;d be worth it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36489905" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36489905" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">esskay</span><span>|</span><a href="#36477633">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36477746">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36489915">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36489905">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36489905">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The infrastructure issue is very much true.

Supply is complicated and not just restricted by zoning.<p>One key thing to understand is that private companies build homes, not governments. And if it&#x27;s not profitable to do so, it will simply stop. And if not at least 75% of the project is sold beforehand, the project is stopped altogether.<p>And this is how our government&#x27;s ambitious plan to build ~100K new homes per year got crushed. In particular due to rate hikes, making mortgages even more expensive than before, so potential buyers opt-out.<p>This part is critically important to reflect on as it keeps happening. There&#x27;s an economic downturn and the building of new homes slows down or stops. This happened over here from 2008-2014 creating a massive backlog, in turn leading to a pricing boom in recent years. Ideally, you&#x27;d keep building during a downturn but nobody knows how as there&#x27;s no buyers and it&#x27;s too big to subsidize. Hence, at least in the Netherlands, unaffordable prices are not due to zoning, they are a supply deficit based on downturns.<p>There&#x27;s also labor shortage, material shortage&#x2F;inflation, far more complicated construction due to the energy transition. And yes, higher than usual immigration is a factor. One of many factors.<p>And guess what? In my area, the grid is full. A few more homes can get connected but not a single new company can connect for the coming 10 years or so and it takes billions in investments to fix. This in reference to new housing supply having lots of other dependencies.<p>We also tried rent control on private rent. Guess what? The land lords simply sell the property, now you&#x27;ll have even less rent supply. Well done.<p>My point being: increasing supply is not easy in this perfect storm. Surely the entire western world would not have this problem if it was a simple as a policy change.

Why didn&#x27;t they? In my experience this is usually down to overregulation one way or another, either rules that make it too hard to invest in housing or because rules that make new homes a lot more expensive than existing ones (e.g. you mentioned energy rules, accessibility requirements, that sort of thing).<p>If the return of demand wasn&#x27;t predictable, then stopping building was arguably the correct move.<p>&gt; Surely the entire western world would not have this problem if it was a simple as a policy change.<p>The correct policy change is known but counterintuitive and unpopular.

Different countries have different issues but in the case of the UK neo-liberal policy has clearly been the root cause.<p>Social housing stock was sold off, ostensibly to occupiers, at significantly less than market value. This comical scheme is still going on today, imagine the reaction of landlords if private renters were offered a 70% discount[0] on the purchase price of a property.<p>An interesting phenomenon occurred when the scheme was introduced as well, neighbourhoods were canvassed with offers to purchase the house they rented. Many of the people living in these houses wouldn&#x27;t be approved for a mortgage, so on the same day many of these houses were sold at their insane discount, they would be sold on immediately to a private investor.<p>At the same time councils were prevented from reinvesting that capital in the construction of new housing stock. The result is that the UK has some of the highest rents in Europe and also some of the poorest housing quality. Privately rented flats are often full of mold, with tenants are unable to assert their rights due to fear of retaliation.<p>It has also contributed to the majority of the economy being centralised in London. Putting aside the intentional annihilation of the UK&#x27;s productive industries for a moment. Private builders are incentivised to invest where demand is currently hottest leaving other regions to deteriorate. The result is that even more economic activity is now occurring in the region which encourages ever more economic concentration.<p>State provisioned housing is concerned with wider societal benefit. Short term profit matters much less, meaning they can invest in rural or currently unproductive areas in hope of nurturing economic growth there. This simply doesn&#x27;t occur otherwise.<p>The power wielded by the kind of large enterprise encouraged by neo-liberal policy prevents the kind of organic growth that makes most communities a pleasant place to live. We can see that in the total dearth of parks, green space, local shops, doctors offices and schools in the UK&#x27;s new build developments.<p>I won&#x27;t go into much detail about the raft of other problems that neo-liberalism introduces but disposable income only recently recovered to 1960s levels, both members of the household are now working and yet they&#x27;re often struggling to afford basic necessities.

And the social housing built will be boxy and low standard, so again, less desirable, and unprofitable for the developer.<p>Whenever the govt distorts free markets, it creates shortages. And housing is one of those markets where we REALLY need the private sector to be allowed to build properties that will meet true market demands, rather than properties that will satisfy govt ideologies.<p>If housebuilding was unconstrained, there would be more of it, which would be good for people at both ends of the market.

Here are the key points:<p><pre><code>    Post-War Housing Crisis: After the Second World War, Britain faced a severe housing crisis due to strict planning rules enacted by both Labour and Conservative governments. These rules gave local councils the power to block nearly all housebuilding, with little incentive to permit it. Despite various attempts to address this issue, such as regional planning, a land commission, New Towns, and attempts to loosen planning controls, all of these efforts failed.

    Historical Context: Britain&#x27;s housing situation has been shaped by its historical context. From the Victorian period onwards, cities expanded with the help of trains, trams, and underground railways, creating the world’s first suburbs. However, housing supply collapsed during the First World War due to the mobilization of potential construction workers for the army, leading to a housing shortage and subsequent rent strikes.

    Green Belts and New Towns: The concept of green belts and New Towns was introduced to control urban expansion. However, this led to a shortage of building land and an increase in its price from 1955. The green belt around London expanded from a 9- to a 35-mile radius, as neighboring counties rushed to end the prospect of displaced development from the original green belt areas.

    Land Commission and Housing Production: The Wilson government set up a Land Commission in 1965 to deal with the shortage of land designated for housebuilding and the resulting high land prices. However, local administrations in the South East of England and the Midlands opposed the measures and refused to cooperate with the commission. The Commission was disbanded in 1970, leading to a flatlining of overall housing production in the mid-1960s.

    Current Situation: The article concludes by stating that the housing crisis in Britain is not due to a lack of political will but due to a lack of understanding of the political dynamics of housebuilding. The author suggests that future leaders should learn from past mistakes and devise smarter strategies to address the housing crisis.</code></pre></div><br/></div></div><div id="36477643" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36477643" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">roenxi</span><span>|</span><a href="#36489554">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36477643">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36477643">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Britain&#x27;s energy-per-capita has collapsed since 1965 [0].

Standards have to drop.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;energy">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;energy</a></div><br/><div id="36477700" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36477700" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yrro</span><span>|</span><a href="#36477643">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36485820">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36477700">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36477700">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">energy-<i>use</i>-per-capita.

Leaving has wide-ranging implications for Britain&#x27;s nuclear industry, including regulation and research, access to nuclear materials and impacts about twenty nuclear co-operation agreements with non-EU countries.<p>The UK withdrawal raises the question of nuclear fuel availability in the UK, and the need for the UK to enter into new treaties relating to the transportation of nuclear materials, which haven&#x27;t even begun.<p>In 2020, nuclear power generated 46 terawatt hours (TWh) of UK electricity, just over 15% of gross electricity generation, and about half its 1998 peak of 91 TWh.<p>The new EDF sites aren&#x27;t ready and are expected to be commissioned by 2026, just in time for Hartlepool and Heysham 1 to close down.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

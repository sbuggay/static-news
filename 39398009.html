In reality your net worth went up by over $1.5 million in the last year, in addition to earning 236k - that is the actual value you created for yourself in the last year and not the 236k you cashflowed.<p>I find it redeeming that despite having a gift for development - software and hardware - the biggest factors affecting profitability and growth here are things that most MBAs would do in a business quite regularly (outsourcing design&#x2F;packaging&#x2F;fulfillment, streamlining costs, doing price elasticity experiments, polling customers and markets for product improvement).<p>I enjoyed seeing the inverted perspective that product&#x2F;engineering is straightforward and low risk but things like optimizing fulfillment and operating costs is a new exciting endeavor.<p>One tip I suggest doing is leveraging google ads to figure out features that customers are willing to pay for before you build them... if they&#x27;re clicking the ad they are searching for it and interested in buying it.   Start a few very low cap campaigns calling out features you are thinking of building into the product, and see which one get&#x27;s the most impressions and clicks per marketing dollar and focus on that.  The added advantage is you know it will be easier to buy advertising for it once the feature is done.</div><br/><div id="39400566" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39400566" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">awhitby</span><span>|</span><a href="#39399561">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39402281">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39400566">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39400566">[39 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re missing something.

I didn’t for reasons listed below:<p>- The comment was mainly directed at xooglers, specifically the mindset some folks have towards them. Googlers and xooglers were something to behold in the “don’t be evil” days. That reputation has decreased substantially since, imho (I’m guessing directly or indirectly due to structural changes in the org). This is not to say that there aren’t some super impressive googlers and xooglers (there are), but the hit rate is much lower than it once was. If the op had just said “a smart engineer”, I wouldn’t have commented on it — I imagine the dude is plenty smart, although I doubt that it makes his efforts difficult to replace (see below).<p>- In general, I try to take the air out of reputation virtue signals that I think may not be warranted. Google, googlers, and xooglers are now in this category. Other groups in this category are groups like Harvard grads, Stanford grads, MBAs, PhDs, name brand consulting firms, name brand IB firms, etc. Note that I am a member of several groups that sometimes send these virtue signals (I try my best not to), so I’m dog fooding my own criticism every day.<p>- I don’t know the engineer who owns the business, but I find it unlikely that he does things that both must be done and must be done at a (relatively high) labor price that the owner could command in the market. I expect neither are true. The “circle jerk” comment was a reference to me thinking that the person I was replying to was putting far too much weight on something that has (imho) much less impact on the profitability and ultimately the price of the business. I’m OK disagreeing on this point — different strokes for different folks, and that’s why the market price talks.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39402849" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39402849" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">windowshopping</span><span>|</span><a href="#39399561">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39402132">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39403868">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39401740">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39402849">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39402849">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You should write something about what you do too.

The key is being adaptable to the current environment and being aware of one’s value add (skill set, network, etc.).<p>The problem with writing specifics about what I do is that it invites competitors and&#x2F;or haters (e.g., review bombers or DDoSers). Some parts of my businesses have enough moat such that I don’t care, but other parts definitely do not. It’s not something I want to spend additional brain cycles on.<p>&gt; Buying businesses sounds interesting, can you expand on this?<p>It’s largely not. It’s financially comfortable, and it’s nice being your own boss &#x2F; leading your own team if that’s what you’re into (I am), but I’ve done more interesting work while working for “The Man”. A lot of what I do is just streamline a system that was inefficiently run&#x2F;managed.<p>What I do is very similar to what Andrew Wilkinson of TinyCo has done, except I am about 10 years back on his timeline, and I’m not sure I will end up going public. I recommend looking for interviews and podcasts with Andrew — I have found them to be super interesting.<p>In relatively vague terms, I started a web dev agency, and then used that cash flow to start buying businesses that generate additional cash flow. Rinse and repeat. This is exactly what Andrew did. Note that I didn’t learn about Andrew until last year, so I was happy to see someone taking a similar path and scaling to a holding co worth over half a billion.<p>Some things that I think folks don’t do well when buying and&#x2F;or valuing businesses (both buyers and sellers):<p>- Keep an active deal flow pipeline, ideally one that is not widely tapped. This usually entails talking to people… lots of people. For example, finding solid businesses on FEI is possible, but they will be very competitively priced, and it will be prudent to have some sort of pocket growth “hack” in mind if you want to make it pay off handsomely. On the other hand, targeting some “mom and pops” that have little or no idea about SEO and SEM can present some soft deals.<p>- Figure out ways that one party can scale that others can’t. This is the type of “growth hack” that I mentioned above. I know one guy who has one main move. He looks for businesses in which he already buys some of their inputs at a huge volume discount that smaller businesses can’t access (supplements are an example of this… I don’t recommend getting into supplements unless you are already eyeballs deep in that world). Another example is having access to markets or distribution that the businesses you are targeting to buy don’t have. One area I target (when relevant) that many others don’t is East Asian markets. Another area I target is just increasing prices (usually via segmentation). So many businesses charge way less than the market will bear.<p>- Learn how to negotiate, including how to say no. Many people just lay down and leave a ton of money on the table. You don’t have to be an asshole about it, but it’s prudent to be aware of what the value is for both the buyer and the seller, and it’s not uncommon for the buyer to have significant upside potential.<p>- As someone else said, you’re basically turning over a lot of rocks. There are a lot of people trying to bamboozle you, and there are a lot of solid businesses that don’t really offer a growth opportunity that you can efficiently maximize. When you find something that fits, it’s often a no-brainer.<p>Let me know if you have any other questions. I will be happy to answer.<p>I will add as a caveat that I can only give you perspective from my limited experiences — there are myriad ways to buy and sell businesses profitably, and my path is only one of them.</div><br/><div id="39407718" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39407718" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">elbear</span><span>|</span><a href="#39399561">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39403449">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39405661">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39407718">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39407718">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have a feeling a lot of the lessons you learned could also apply to developers who want to be better at freelancing (my case).

I have been around this my whole life, so it came quite naturally to me. That said, it’s learnable, and a lot of things fall into the common sense or empathy categories.<p>- Be good at contracting and hiring&#x2F;firing. There are a lot of bozos in the workforce, but there are also plenty of hidden gems.<p>- Be good at marketing&#x2F;sales. Although it’s possible, I think it’s tough to hide behind a screen and also scale.<p>- Talk to your customers. PG beats this drum, and there’s a good reason. Note customers here are customers of any business you own as well as business you want to buy or entities you want to sell a business to.<p>- Start small, but do things that scale. People think you need a lot of money to start doing this. You don’t. If you do really well, you don’t have to ask around much before relatively large sums of money start finding you.

I also recall many decent products like Quora (yes there was a period where it was actually good) go to shit and fail chasing $$.

If I had such an exit I’d draw it down at a sustainable rate anyway that ends up not being different from the earnings of a private company of similar value.<p>I guess with similar luck and results maybe I could be a billionaire instead of a hundred millionaire, but idk if that really matters, and I’d then get the typical SV meaningless ennui while being glad to leave the shitshow I created before it got even shitter.

And people that do walk the line between creating a business and keeping their morals is uncommon enough that they tend to be remembered for it e.g. Bob&#x27;s Red Mill: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39366542">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39366542</a><p>It is much easier to be tritely moralistic if you don&#x27;t start a business. I often really admire people with idealistic values - and morality is critical in business. I don&#x27;t admire people if they go to negative extremes: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Splitting_(psychology)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Splitting_(psychology)</a><p>Almost by definition starting a business means taking on risks. Mixing risks and money is &quot;gambling&quot; and it is an inherent property of businesses. Deciding what is good gambling and what is bad gambling is a very old problem. Buying insurance is reducing risk (less gambling) but insurance is gambling by definition. Unfortunately you have chosen the moralistic word &quot;gambling&quot; to talk about the normal issue of managing risk.<p>Perhaps you just don&#x27;t like the rich? One can have shares and own a business without being&#x2F;becoming rich - you don&#x27;t need to directly involve wealthy people.<p>One can bootstrap a company without taking rich-peoples investments - see article. Unfortunately we get hoodwinked by the success stories from the VC investment sector. We hear less about the losers in the VC game or other ways to play the game of business.<p>Edit: a business is just a complicated machine. If you believe selling a product is moral, then you must believe that selling a business is also moral.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39398429" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39398429" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">marklubi</span><span>|</span><a href="#39399561">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39401643">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39398429">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39398429">[32 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So good to see some actual Startup News on here.

I have a few questions for you:<p>1. Have you always been so disciplined in life? If not, how did you improve it?
2. As you shared here (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;solo-developer-year-1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;solo-developer-year-1&#x2F;</a>), doubts are natural when you haven&#x27;t succeeded yet; how did you keep going? Did you ever come close to giving up and going back to corporate America?
3. I believe you have a partner; how did this affect your relationship with your partner?
4. Knowing what you know now, what would you do differently?<p>If you are ever in NYC, please hit me up; I would love to buy you a drink and chat more in person.</div><br/><div id="39406037" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39406037" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Areading314</span><span>|</span><a href="#39401643">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39403307">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39406037">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39406037">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Agreed.

If not, how did you improve it?</i><p>No, I was a lot less disciplined when I was younger. I remember as a teen trying to learn Java several times and always getting bored a day or two in. I was a good student, but I would procrastinate work and distract myself while working.<p>I probably became more disciplined in my twenties, but I unfortunately don&#x27;t think it was something I tried to do as much as it just happened.<p>One thing I think helped was protecting my focus more. I used to hop between different tasks a lot and constantly check social media or email if I had a moment of downtime or boredom, so I became more aggressive at stopping that.[0]<p>I also found the book <i>Deep Work</i> by Cal Newport to be helpful in staying more focused.[1]<p>&gt;<i>As you shared here (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;solo-developer-year-1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;solo-developer-year-1&#x2F;</a>), doubts are natural when you haven&#x27;t succeeded yet; how did you keep going? Did you ever come close to giving up and going back to corporate America?</i><p>I went into it with the expectation that it might take 3-5 years for me to find a successful business, so I think that was helpful. I&#x27;ve spoken to other founders who feel disappointed that nothing they&#x27;re doing is working because they were expecting success to come quickly.<p>I definitely did worry that I wasn&#x27;t cut out for being a founder and that my skills made a lot more sense for a big tech employee. The thing I found comforting was reading stories and listening to podcast interviews with other founders where they talked about how many failures they had before they landed on the right business.<p>I never came close to going back to a corporate job because I knew I had enough savings to last me, but if my financial situation had been different, I might have given up before I landed on something that worked.<p>&gt;<i>I believe you have a partner; how did this affect your relationship with your partner?</i><p>There are lots of effects in different directions. Me not having a regular job means that my income is less consistent and certain, and she absorbs some of the risks I take. I also feel like I&#x27;m not a good partner when I&#x27;m stressed a lot about work, and so part of my motivation in de-stressing the business has been to be a better partner in my personal relationship.<p>&gt;<i>Knowing what you know now, what would you do differently?</i><p>I wish I&#x27;d done educational products (&quot;info products&quot;) earlier. They&#x27;re like a microcosm of the experience of launching a product because you have to find customers, pitch to them effectively, and then deliver something they&#x27;ll want. Like you can do that whole cycle in a month, whereas it would probably take 3-10x that long to do it with a SaaS. I made my first course right as TinyPilot was getting traction, and that course made more than anything I&#x27;d done in the previous three years.[2]<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;eliminate-distractions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;eliminate-distractions&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;book-reports&#x2F;deep-work&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;book-reports&#x2F;deep-work&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;solo-developer-year-4&#x2F;#hit-the-front-page-of-hacker-news" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;solo-developer-year-4&#x2F;#hit-the-front-page...</a></div><br/><div id="39404403" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39404403" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">software0to1</span><span>|</span><a href="#39401643">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39403307">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39400222">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39404403">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39404403">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just found about your blog.

I think it would be much harder to follow the path I did if I&#x27;d had children to support.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about risk a lot in the past year. I used to feel like I had this safety net of getting a job in big tech again if the founder thing didn&#x27;t work out. When all the layoffs and hiring freezes began, I realized that my safety net may have disappeared.<p>It&#x27;s scary to lose the safety net, but at the same time, I felt grateful that I&#x27;ve had the last six years to practice earning money without an employer. If I had been laid off, I&#x27;d be in a terrible position of competing against thousands of other recently laid off employees who are all desperate for work. If TinyPilot were to fold, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m guaranteed another successful business, but I feel like I&#x27;m more likely to build a profitable business than to get a job as a developer in a poor tech economy.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39400222" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39400222" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chaosprint</span><span>|</span><a href="#39401643">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39402415">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39400222">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39400222">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a really informative and inspiring article.<p>It has been 6 months (not 6 years) since I quit my full-time job as a Rust developer to start my own business.<p>As time goes by, I can feel the pressure of mortgage and car loans, and I can also feel the care and pressure of my family.<p>My original plan was to make a new IDE for Glicol (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;glicol.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;glicol.org</a>), and to develop relevant hardware with firmware written in rust for school education.<p>I sent some cold emails to VCs, but most of them got no reply.<p>I also sent an email to the Norwegian Museum of Science and Technology, offering to perform for children for free, but they didn’t reply for two months.

We hacked a different crystal oscillator on a Zilog SCC board design donated by our employer to make a MIDI interface. My friend coded &#x27;lxm&#x27;, Language for the eXpression of Music. My job was to &#x27;mxl&#x27;, Musically eXpressed Language - to capture from the Juno 106 we were developing with. We weren&#x27;t able to market it at that time. For your project, maybe find a US-based partner, there are plenty of Magnet and Charter Schools that can independently develop curriculum for non-core subjects. A possible way in is to find ones with a PTO (not PTA), the parents can drive this sort of thing. PTOs are independent corporations that serve one or a few schools whereast PTA is a top-down org and they are not the place to try to drive innovation IMO.<p>The way I think about investors, they are an extremely high interest loan. I have a money partner in my startup, I negotiated his equity down to 70% from the 80% he wanted. So if this product hits (already have a regular customer) and makes a million, he&#x27;ll get $700K for investing less than $100K. I&#x27;ll get $300K for investing probably about $300K worth of my own time and hand half of that to the IRS.

As a note I don&#x27;t count credit card rewards as revenue, but rather I count it as an offset to expenses. In this way, rewards don&#x27;t add to the top line, but rather improves the bottom line. Basically I consider it a way to discount my expenses, or as a negative expense. The reason is because those rewards are linked to expenses. If you spend more, you get more rewards. Spend less, you get less. You can&#x27;t increase rewards (generally) without increasing expenses. So I see it as a way to discount or reduce expenses vs. increase the top line. Long story short, if you see your rewards increasing 10x that means you&#x27;ve increased expenses some factor of 10x which isn&#x27;t so great. You could list rewards under the &quot;Everything Else&quot; line of expenses as a negative expense in red. The result will be the same on the bottom line but it won&#x27;t be misleading the top line, which should be driven as high as you can.<p>Also those cloud expenses look significant.

In the beginning, I thought people would just buy off-the-shelf components and pay me to make nice software to tie everything together.<p>It became pretty obvious early on that people were a lot more interested in a pre-made hardware solution than a DIY project with ready-made software. And I&#x27;m glad I made it to the point of profitability and worked hard at it, but I also definitely got lucky a lot. There are so many more existential threats to a hardware business, especially in the early days.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39398013" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39398013" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mtlynch</span><span>|</span><a href="#39398787">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39400227">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39398013">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39398013">[17 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Author here.

Most other things about my strategy, I think our execution is what makes the difference, so I don&#x27;t care if competitors know. With advertising, it was expensive to figure out a successful strategy, and it&#x27;s the kind of thing that a competitor can copy perfectly.<p>I can talk about measuring their success, though. The metric I focus on primarily is revenue on ad spend. Material costs make up about 33% of the revenue from TinyPilot&#x27;s product sales, so if we get $1.50 for every $1 we spend on ads, we&#x27;d end up about breakeven ($1.50 from revenue - $1 for the ad - $0.50 for materials), so I aim to be at 2.25 ROAS or higher on any channel so we have a comfortable margin.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39404344" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39404344" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">testmasterflex</span><span>|</span><a href="#39398013">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39398587">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39403135">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39404344">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39404344">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Always interesting to follow your progress Michael!

TinyPilot appeals to people in the homelab &#x2F; IT prosumer community, and I&#x27;ve been involved in that space for a few years, so it always felt like a pretty organic way to get the word out.<p>There have been diminishing returns to that strategy, though. When we got our first big review, our sales nearly tripled overnight.[0] At the time, we were the first affordable KVM over IP on the market, so YouTube creators were very excited about to be able to break a story about it, and their viewers were excited to buy our product.<p>Since then, we continue to work with reviewers, but even high-quality reviews don&#x27;t get that many reviews because we&#x27;ve been around for a few years and there are similar products like ours.<p>We&#x27;ve been experimenting with new channels, but nothing has been a huge hit. One of the things I&#x27;m trying to do is talk to bloggers and YouTube creators about doing projects with TinyPilot rather than just reviewing it. We had one a few years back,[1] and I think there&#x27;s potential for new interesting use-cases for TinyPilot through experiments, but I haven&#x27;t found anyone with a good idea yet.<p>It seems like our most successful channel has been word of mouth. I think it&#x27;s a result of putting a lot of effort into customer service, so our customers feel good about working with us and tell other people about the product.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;retrospectives&#x2F;2021&#x2F;02&#x2F;#tinypilots-first-youtube-review" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;retrospectives&#x2F;2021&#x2F;02&#x2F;#tinypilots-first-...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinypilotkvm.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;dslr" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinypilotkvm.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;dslr</a></div><br/><div id="39399425" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39399425" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">digikata</span><span>|</span><a href="#39398926">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39399233">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39406312">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39399425">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39399425">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A feature that would have been useful from my IoT &#x2F; embedded device development days would be the ability to fully turn power on&#x2F;off of with usb port from software.

Since then, I&#x27;ve come to find SPAs and most frontend frameworks to be way too much complexity, so I&#x27;ve moved away from Vue, but the TinyPilot website is still stuck on Vue 2.x and bootstrap-vue (which is tied to Vue 2 and Bootstrap 4).<p>So, it keeps creaking along, but building the 100ish pages on the site takes about five minutes, whereas I think something like Hugo could probably do it in a few seconds.

What motivated you to create that particular product? was it simply something that interested you and that you believed had potential? What was the goal when you created TinyPilot? Thanks!</i><p>It was a &quot;scratch my own itch&quot; kind of path. I had a home VM server[0], and any time I messed up its network settings or wanted to install a new OS, it was a huge pain to drag it over to my desk, disconnect my main desktop from my monitor and keyboard, swap everything over to the server, and then put everything back how it was.<p>I saw an article about how Raspberry Pi could emulate a keyboard, and I tried that out and got it working.[1] And then I felt like there had to be a way to capture video and stream it too, and I finally found a way to do that.<p>I came in at a lucky time because people had been experimenting with Raspberry Pi as a KVM over IP for years, but there weren&#x27;t great video capture options. But right as I started looking, these cheap HDMI to USB dongles appeared on the market,[2] which made it cheap and easy to build a v1.<p>In the beginning, I thought it was too niche to be a real business, but it got a positive response when I launched on HN,[3] and more and more people kept buying, so I stuck with it.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;building-a-vm-homelab&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;building-a-vm-homelab&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;key-mime-pi&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;key-mime-pi&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;tinypilot&#x2F;#hdmi-to-usb-dongle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;tinypilot&#x2F;#hdmi-to-usb-dongle</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23927380">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23927380</a></div><br/><div id="39402343" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39402343" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yakito</span><span>|</span><a href="#39398434">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39401428">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39400187">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39402343">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39402343">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks a lot!

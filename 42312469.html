Some of them:<p>1) Value and Risk scores shall include more metrics: dependencies, known funding, time since the last dev activity, active contributors, etc. A wider set of connected but relatively independent metrics is harder to fake. Also, it will help to exclude edge cases — for instance, I auto-donated to Pydantic (it&#x27;s a great OSS), but such support is unlikely needed as they have raised $12.5M Series A from Sequoia this year.<p>2) Algorithmic does not mean automatic. While I see a strict, measurable, and ideally fully transparent methodology crucial for donating, it does not mean that all inputs shall be automatically generated. For instance, in the stock ETF world, one can generally rely on such metrics as &quot;annual financials&quot; for trading because they are annually audited (although it does not prevent fraud in 100% of cases). In the OSS world, data from trusted ecosystem actors can also be part of the equation.<p>3) Many guardrails are possible: limited budget per project, manual checks of top repos with the most anomalous changes in metrics. Also, if we target the sustainable maintenance of OSS the world relies on (I do!), then new projects (1-2 years) will unlikely get high scores - that adds another protection layer.<p>Given the interest in this topic, I am going to continue developing this algorithm further and expand it to other ecosystems (e.g. JS&#x2F;TS and Rust).

I also think it&#x27;s interesting that the author was both balancing &quot;value&quot; and &quot;risk&quot;. I do wonder, if this became a more dominant strategy for providing funding for open source how you would deal with a couple potentially adverse incentives:<p>1. Publishing the exact formula for funding is great for transparency, but then leads to an incentive to game the system to capture funding. Doing things like breaking your project up into many small packages, or reducing the number of maintainers are not good for the ecosystem but may lead to more funding. Also, there starts to be an incentive to juice download numbers.<p>2. In general, rewarding &quot;risk&quot; with additional funding seems like it creates an adverse incentive. This seems like a really tricky problem, because lack of funding is a major source of risk. It seems like there could be a pendulum effect here if you&#x27;re not careful.

The idea being you&#x27;re explicitly trying to incentivize broadly valuable work rather than specific metrics.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like the SEO dance.

One nice thing about this strategy is that it could generate a virtuous circle: consolidate together a big enough pot of money from early adopters and you could start getting some good media coverage, which in turn might generate interest and donations from &quot;normie&quot; sources which would never have wanted to be in before then. Similarly and relatedly, IME one of the excuses for low Open Source donations from big US companies is &quot;we have to monitor and audit where all donated money goes, and that&#x27;s too much overhead&quot;. Centralise that work in a big, fairly well-trusted charity to which multiple other organisations can donate and that excuse is hopefully removed or partly removed.

Amusing to see a neurologist, who&#x27;s complemented for being<p>&gt; a brilliant and vivid mind, a man whose intellectual appetite was vast, and whose professional and creative passions – far from being the self-absorbed obsessions of a pedant – were first and foremost an act of reaching out, the means through which he sought to communicate with others, a “love affair with the world”<p>and whose work, <i>Letters</i>, is<p>&gt; crammed with off-the-cuff profundities, moments of elevated perception that briefly unriddle the more inscrutable aspects of human nature<p>can still enjoy the simpler (and funny) things in life, like bulking up via powerlifting:<p>&gt; As a man of 30, dallying with powerlifting, Sacks routinely bragged to his parents about his weight, how much he could lift, the amount he ate – “I love to shake the pavement as I walk, to part crowds like the prow of a ship.” At Mount Zion, special scrubs had to be made to accommodate his bulk, and he found himself in disfavour with his superiors for stealing patients’ food.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42024381" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42024381" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aamargulies</span><span>|</span><a href="#42024079">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42024312">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42024381">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42024381">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was lucky enough to attend a lecture given by Dr. Sacks circa 1988. He was a resident speaker for the University of California campuses and had come to UCSC to talk about Awakenings and other topics. He was such a sensitive, kind, gentle person.<p>It was a privilege to simply be in the audience and the audience was very small. For some reason students didn&#x27;t take advantage of the opportunity, right in front of them, to come and see him speak. Baffling.<p>When I saw him, he was in his mid-fifties and the picture of an English academic doctor&#x2F;professor. It is a kick to see what he looked like in 1961. That BMW he&#x27;s sitting on is a classic.<p>The world lost a very special person when he died in 2015.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42024312" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42024312" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alexey-salmin</span><span>|</span><a href="#42024381">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42024017">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42024312">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42024312">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sacks books left me deeply impressed but up to this day I don&#x27;t know if they are scientifically accurate or partially fictional or exaggerated.

Legal pornography is always possible in South Korea, and while the actual threshold varied over time (because you know, there is no objective metric for them anyway so it has to be a function of the approximate social consensus), legal pornography is not necessarily &quot;milder&quot; than illegal pornography distributed via blocked websites. (EDIT: incorrectly put &quot;stronger&quot; there...)<p>The South Korean treatment of pornography was extremely distorted mainly because of the rampant copyright violation over pornographic materials produced elsewhere. That blocked virtually all attempts to sell legal pornography and profit from it, why would you pay when you already have tons of free porns out there. Technically speaking, a large portion of the current adult population should have been found guilty if foreign producers could sue them, and I can tell you that the name of a certain blocked but still popular pornographic website [1] has became a household name for many males in their 20s and 30s!<p>And here is where the SK law&#x27;s technical distinction between legal pornography and illegal obsence material turned out to be handy. Since those websites distributed pornography illegally, you can just consider them obscene and thus exempted from the copyright protection (!). I really hate this situation and like to see the radical change, but I can also see that it would become a massive and uncontrollable international affair otherwise. So that&#x27;s why those websites had to be banned (to signal that it is indeed illegal), but the ban itself is so weak that it can be easily bypassed (more effective ban would be harder to justify).<p>[1] I don&#x27;t like to quote its exact name, but as a hint, it is often followed by &quot;꺼라 <i>turn sth off</i>&quot;.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40806951" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40806951" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AtlasBarfed</span><span>|</span><a href="#40805471">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40806873">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40808030">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40807496">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40806951">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40806951">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s a lot easier to buy into a government when the most horrid example of one in modern history (arguable, I get it) is only 100 miles to the north with a huge amount of artillery pointed at you.</div><br/><div id="40808038" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40808038" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">somenameforme</span><span>|</span><a href="#40805471">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40806951">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40807197">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40808038">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40808038">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">South Korea has a far crazier history [1] than I think most realize. This [2] is the first president of South Korea, installed by the US, and then eventually ferried off into exile in Hawaii by the US after a revolution, leading the 2nd Republic of Korea. That was followed by coups and all other sorts of great things, including 4 acting presidents that did not serve more than 50 days a piece, eventually leading to the 3rd Republic of Korea which was another dictatorship who then had his dictatorial powers codified in the 4th republic. Then he was assassinated and you get the the 5th republic where the dictator&#x27;s friend was put in power. Then you get the 6th republic in 1987 (!!) and that&#x27;s the South Korea we&#x27;re somewhat more familiar with.<p>Even in modern times, I think most don&#x27;t realize how wacky Korean politics has been. For instance the president from 2013-2017 (Park Geun-hye, daughter of a former dictator) was involved in some sort of weird cult-like grooming controversy where she was being groomed and controlled by what some media called a &#x27;Korean Rasputin.&#x27; She was eventually impeached and imprisoned for corruption&#x2F;abuse of power, and is now serving decades in prison.<p>And it seems the current president of South Korea has an approval rating in the 30s. So I have no idea how Koreans view their government, but it&#x27;s really unlike anything I think that we can compare elsewhere. But I suspect &quot;trust&quot; and &quot;integrity&quot; are not the sort of words that&#x27;d be on top.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_South_Korea#" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_South_Korea#</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Syngman_Rhee" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Syngman_Rhee</a></div><br/><div id="40808292" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40808292" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sooheon</span><span>|</span><a href="#40805471">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40808038">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40808126">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40808292">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40808292">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; and is now serving decades in prison.<p>I wish.

Much of it is purely technical: domestic firms like Naver are simply not as good as global incumbents like Google, but also they are terrible compared to other regional players (The Kakao chat app is vastly inferior to Zalo, a Vietnamese chat app).  However, just as much is due to poor cultural and interpersonal decisions.  This news case highlights such a cultural factor.<p>Note that KT, while relatively recently privatized, is still a national corporation that is considered a critical national asset under the law (thus if the North attacks, KT towers are first priority to be protected by the South&#x27;s military).  So, it is not as if some rogue SME infected its users with malware; it&#x27;s a national corporation infecting its users over and not even be sorry about it (as in the article).<p>Plenty of other comments detail the strange Active X requirement: The <i>national law</i> had dependency on Internet Explorer&#x2F;Active X.  (I do not know of any developed nation having a national legal dependency on a specific corporation&#x27;s consumer technology at this scale.)   Also, many comments on South Korea&#x27;s purportedly great infrastructure (albeit two decades ago).  There is more to this.<p>Interestingly, if you ask an average Korean, he would say Korea is literally the best nation in IT&#x2F;internet technology, topping or at least on par with the US.  The national propaganda effort that went into forming this collective conscious should not be understated.  Even many of the top programmers in South Korea I met strongly believe in this superiority.  I wonder if this strong sense of superiority is both (1) preventing SK from improving its actually-lagging tech and (2) act in Dostoevskian-Raskolnikov manners thinking that it is above the law and consensus (&quot;the best can break the rules and set new ones&quot;).  Whatever the underlying reason may be, there is a serious techno-cultural issue going on in the country.<p>One of the biggest banks in South Korea blacklisted Amazon as a financial scammer because it&#x27;s Prime subscription renews monthly and customers complained after seeing the renewal charge on their credit cards.  The ban was national -- no customer of this bank could buy a product from Amazon unless he calls the bank personally and ask the charge to be approved.  Again, the issue wasn&#x27;t technical.  It was cultural.</div><br/><div id="40808411" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40808411" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Affric</span><span>|</span><a href="#40806633">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40805751">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40808411">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40808411">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">lol, that is a scam though</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40805751" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40805751" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chunsj</span><span>|</span><a href="#40806633">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40805496">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40805751">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40805751">[14 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">South Korean internet had been one of the best and fast network in the world; especially up to the point before KT was privatized.

So it generally tends to work out worse for the customers.<p>Unfortunately some people genuinely believe the private sector will always deliver services cheaper and more efficiently than the public sector, so all around the world this mistake keeps being made.

I assumed you are talking about the general MITM because you mentioned SNI (because you can&#x27;t put malwares with just SNI sniffing).<p>The constitution only says about the &quot;privacy of correspondence&quot; in the Article 18, and several acts including the Protection of Communications Secrets Act (통신비밀보호법) [1] and the Act on Promotion of Information and Communication Network Utilization and Information Protection (정보통신망 이용촉진 및 정보보호 등에 관한 법률) [2] do have many exceptions that make them legal at least in principle. Indeed, most websites blocked by SK ISPs host either illegal obscene materials (distinct from the legal pornography in the SK legal system) or advocacy for North Korea (illegal due to the National Security Act 국가보안법).

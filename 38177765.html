He also seems to have been focused on building a productive nuclear reactor (which they called an engine back then) first, instead of a bomb and tried to sell this idea to the politicians.<p>Another interesting thing is that he is the only one in the transcripts who warns to be careful about what to say <i>&quot;in front of an Englishman</i>&quot;, so he might have been suspicious about being listened on and we have to take everything he said with a grain of salt.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38187531" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38187531" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lisper</span><span>|</span><a href="#38187844">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38187843">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38187531">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38187531">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is pure gold.  I wonder why there are so few modern equivalents to this sort of thing.  All of the modern physics pedagogy that I&#x27;ve seen describes this experiment in idealized terms, and it turns out that this idealization is really a lie: the split beam is not two cleanly separated beams, it&#x27;s smeared out because of the range of speeds of the thermalized atoms.  I think we do students a serious disservice by sweeping details like this under the rug.  Worse, the trustworthiness of the whole scientific enterprise is undermined when we simply describe idealized results and ask people to take it on faith that we&#x27;re telling the truth, especially when it turns out that we&#x27;re not.</div><br/><div id="38187597" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38187597" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mgibbs63</span><span>|</span><a href="#38187531">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38187662">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38187597">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38187597">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I totally agree!  I also very much appreciate the amount of time they dedicate to explaining the details of the apparatus.  I suspect that very few physics students get any reasonable amount of instruction on experimental techniques these days.  I barely did fifteen years ago, and I think things have only gotten worse since then.  Without that, the learning curve of working in a research lab can be pretty brutal.<p>A second benefit I get from spending all that time on the apparatus is kind of paradoxical: those extra details seem like they would distract you from learning and understanding the core concept, but somehow they make things much more approachable.  The idealized experiment is slightly too abstract to easily digest.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38186863" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38186863" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CamperBob2</span><span>|</span><a href="#38187843">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38187591">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38186863">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38186863">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Nice find.  This pioneering atomic beam experiment is the basis for cesium-beam atomic clocks, even today.  Among other later innovations, I. I.

An almost-finished workprint was floating around on our campus residential network.<p>All I knew was that &quot;matrix.avi&quot; was the largest file I had ever seen, over 700 MB!!!   I watched the first minute and figured out it was a movie, and promptly stopped it and called everyone I knew over to my dorm and had them bring popcorn.<p>We went into it 100% blind, and I still remember the seconds of silence after the movie ended.  We were that blown away.</div><br/><div id="38420038" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38420038" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">prawn</span><span>|</span><a href="#38419051">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38419246">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38419243">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38420038">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38420038">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Even with the marketing campaign, it seemed like a major cultural moment.

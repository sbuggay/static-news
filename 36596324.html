That&#x27;s how you avoid the issues during upgrades both on the phones and servers.<p>The phone apps don&#x27;t use the exact same system for it, but essentially they&#x27;re fully isolated in a similar way containers would be. The only difference is what is provided by the system and what by the app.<p>Flatpak can also shift the GUI into the base layer, so for example on Fedora Silverlight you can have a barebones system which uses a shared gui layer for most installed apps. (CoreOS is a similar idea, but for the server side)<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not hard to imagine extending that model to cover things like databases<p>Databases are not interchangeable beyond trivial examples. But a plugin system like that exists - odbc.<p>&gt; when the app can just say &quot;Hey, I need to make a database, I can use ...<p>This can be already solved with either full system configuration (Nixos) or containers (docker-compose does pretty much that). Those are sane and structured as well and they&#x27;re available now.<p>If you want to go one layer higher (lower?), you can build a similar environment with AWS cloudformation - they can provide you with app containers or isolated functions, ready databases, all the connections in between.<p>&gt;  Apps use things far slower than Dart and Kotlin and Android API calls all the time.<p>Yes, but on the phone your app may just take slightly longer. On the server side a common case taking longer means everyone else waiting a bit longer and the whole thing translates to more money spent on infra. Those are different failure cases &#x2F; requirements.<p>&gt; Why are we not managing our web apps by uploading a single APK file and a settings.ini with the permissions we want to give it?<p>Many of us are doing basically that. The APKs are container images &#x2F; static binaries &#x2F; other kind of packages though. My whole server is one Nixos configuration file for many services and packages for example. Some older systems won&#x27;t change overnight, but for new stuff you have all the possibilities you want, available right now.<p>Probably the closest to &quot;just put some blocks together&quot; you can get now are the iot fleet management services OSes like balena and others.</div><br/><div id="36597647" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36597647" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">KronisLV</span><span>|</span><a href="#36597328">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36597585">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36597647">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36597647">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; This can be already solved with either full system configuration (Nixos) or containers (docker-compose does pretty much that).

While I haven&#x27;t used NixOS, I&#x27;ve actually described OCI containers a bit like installing apps on Android in the past - each has all of the dependencies bundled, a common API to interact with all of them, things like port configuration or just setting environment variables as well as storage with a unified mechanism, including even resource limits!<p>Docker, Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, Hashicorp Nomad and Kubernetes (including K0s, K3s etc.), as well as more recent efforts like Podman all feel like a step in this direction, depending on what your exact needs are and how much complexity you can deal with.<p>&gt; Probably the closest to &quot;just put some blocks together&quot; you can get now are the iot fleet management services OSes like balena and others.<p>I already run almost all of my own software in containers and so far it&#x27;s amazing - I don&#x27;t even care too much whether the node itself is running Ubuntu, CentOS&#x2F;Rocky Linux, or even something like Alpine Linux on the server directly (which some might actually <i>consider</i>, because of the simplicity and lightweight nature).<p>Throw in Ansible or something like that for making sure that the configuration is similar across all of the nodes (or groups of nodes) that you want and there&#x27;s surprisingly little to worry about in the long term.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36597585" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36597585" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">teekert</span><span>|</span><a href="#36597328">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36597668">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36597585">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36597585">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I get the remark, it&#x27;s certainly an

If you want nice abstractions about how this servers can interact, something which in general is seen more as infrastructure ten OS tasks, you would need something like a distributed web OS or infrastructure abstraction layer, i.e. not Android (they do exist with varying degree of success).<p>EDIT2: Yes the current state of cloud computing is pretty bad, but really trying to put Android in there wouldn&#x27;t help at all IMHO.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36597265" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36597265" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">galkk</span><span>|</span><a href="#36597628">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36597346">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36597265">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36597265">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Steam deck is linux based but, objectively, was built and has a purpose of running stuff, made for windows.

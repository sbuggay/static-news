I answered: “So far I have succeeded in making a few hundred cubic centimeters of acetone at a time by the fermentation process. I do my work in a laboratory. I am not a technician, I am only a research chemist. But, if I were somehow able to produce a ton of acetone, I would be able to multiply that by any factor you chose.” . . .

A few people would admit that the challenge was going from algae growing in the pipes to algae growing <i>on</i> the pipes, where it could not be harvested. Fifteen years later few people talk about these designs, which means nobody solved the problems before the money ran out.<p>As I was reading this article, I started thinking, &quot;what we really need is a surface area you can extract and expand&quot;, and the image of a roll of corrugated material came into my head. It&#x27;s a lot of surface area in a cylindrical space, and when unwound you have substantial access to the surface. No nooks and crannies that you can&#x27;t reach with a simple tool.<p>The other route to go is what the pool industry does, which is to &#x27;shock&#x27; the system, which essentially means to poison the microbes in such a way that they fall into suspension and you can filter them out (possibly with a separate filter so you don&#x27;t foul the standard one).  But that shuts the whole system down for some time. Not a showstopper if you can rotate out reactors, but I think you&#x27;d be better off with a replaceable parts mentality, swapping out parts for maintenance and cleaning and bringing the system online faster.</div><br/><div id="37058635" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37058635" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jszymborski</span><span>|</span><a href="#37057756">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37057789">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37058635">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37058635">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; A few people would admit that the challenge was going from algae growing in the pipes to algae growing on the pipes, where it could not be harvested.<p>I&#x27;m not an expert here but I&#x27;ve done a lot of reading on this.<p>My understanding is that people really don&#x27;t have a hard time growing algae, it&#x27;s just that algae doesn&#x27;t make very good fuel.<p>This is evidenced, IMHO, by the vast number of companies that started as algae fuel producers and then pivot to algae supplement companies.<p>This article goes more in depth on the topic [0].<p>&quot;One of the biggest challenges was that wild strains of algae couldn’t deliver the high levels of lipids needed to produce large quantities of fuel, said Todd Peterson, the former CTO of Viridos, Exxon’s longstanding and now former algae research partner.&quot;<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;2023&#x2F;mar&#x2F;17&#x2F;big-oil-algae-biofuel-funding-cut-exxonmobil" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;2023&#x2F;mar&#x2F;17&#x2F;big-oil-...</a></div><br/><div id="37058834" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37058834" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">maxbond</span><span>|</span><a href="#37057756">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37058635">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37057789">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37058834">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37058834">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Algae isn&#x27;t hard to grow and makes great fuel, it&#x27;s just very difficult to harvest (and depending on what you&#x27;re doing, biofouling may make it difficult to maintain a system long term).

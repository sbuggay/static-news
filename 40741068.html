Before you reach for checklists and flowcharts to figure out whether you should call them “atrocities” or “civil outrage”, let me refresh your memory.<p>First, we need to look at oil and gas pipeline maps from USSR to Europe. It&#x27;s easy to do, we&#x27;re on the internet after all. By pure coincidence, when prices of hydrocarbons had been at their lowest for years, budgets had become empty, and most parts of USSR had decided they need some political autonomy, leaders of three Socialist republics which were involved in extraction and delivery of resources had declared that USSR was no more:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Belovezha_Accords" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Belovezha_Accords</a><p>By doing that, they shook off the old men from the Party and other parts of Union government who had previously been above them, but became rulers without a country, and they also shook off sharing revenues with other Socialist republics, and supporting all USSR population. Enough of friendship of all Soviet nations!<p>Newspapers across the world called it “the victory of Democracy”, etc. Sure, the petrostate and two intermediate pieces of land under the pipes were full of debts, and planned to keep pumping valuable resources to the civilized world, so everything was fine.<p>Of course, honest and reliable bureaucrats and oligarchs ruling new countries mutually dependent on shared pipe system immediately started to argue whose balls were bigger, and tried to break any official agreement any time they felt like it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Russia%E2%80%93Ukraine_gas_disputes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Russia%E2%80%93Ukraine_gas_dis...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Belarus%E2%80%93Russia_relations" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Belarus%E2%80%93Russia_relatio...</a><p>Partially it was because government budgets were empty in the &#x27;90s, and they had to became creative with money from the main source of income, partially it was because they fought for properties and energy supply for them, were selling industry piece by piece or seizing it. However, all was well as long as civilized world got their cheap oil and gas.<p>Even in Soviet times, southern Soviet republics were not that rich. Big industry was limited to isolated locations, and depended on exchange of goods and resources with other republics, and often factories were founded proprotionally according to state plans, not because something was logical. Agriculture was a neglected sector across all USSR in its late decades, and farm workers had very little opportunities, were generally poor, and sometimes grew crops no one needed (because distribution of food was also centralized, and US and Canada would sell as much grain as needed). Despite endless propaganda about workers and peasants, they were generally forgotten and ignored part of population. So-called “national specifics”, that is, corruption and nepotism, and remains of tribalism of pre-Soviet era, while not discussed openly until later years, also played a role. Therefore, life in agricultural regions was pretty drab. After the — forced — independence they were plunged into poverty.<p>Perestroika and economic turmoil uncovered national tensions (not just limited to “Russians go home”). Sure, a lot of people considered such far away places provincial shitholes, especially if they were sent to work there (in many cases, higher education resulted in government assignment that depended on your grades, loyalty, and family connections), and looked down upon locals. However, for a lot of other people the home was right there, sometimes for whole their lives. Of course, those who judged people by the color of their skin or facial features didn&#x27;t bother with that. (Turns out that reading and even giving speeches about a single family of all nations does not make you friends with everyone, just like talking about colonial past does not make you any less of a white man in a cork hat.) While change of citizenship was offered to any ex-Soviet citizen (but still was not that easy), prices of property in southern republics were next to zero, and most savings disappeared, so many emigrants effectively became refugees relying on relatives and friends. That is, if they had prepared, and had not ran from a local mob.<p>By the way, it is widely accepted that Brighton Beach has the highest concentration of those vulgar Soviet hoi polloi on Earth, and the only place Soviet service can still exist. Obviously, future historians will agree that annexation of Brighton Beach was completely motivated and adequate move.<p>To conclude, Anglo-American self-chastising about colonial past can&#x27;t be globally applied to each and every country as one-size-fit-all tool, just like the horrible bureaucratic concept of “race” (reminding a lot of people about Soviet “nationality” brand mark) does more harm than good outside of its native lands. Decolonial and postcolonial works from actual local researchers do exist, and they also mention that.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40746613" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40746613" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LtVodka</span><span>|</span><a href="#40742020">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40744954">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40747030">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40745087">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40746613">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40746613">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">you are pathetic.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40743513" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40743513" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">grecy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40742020">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40743408">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40744172">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40743513">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40743513">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>many fond memories of it, but mostly when I think about it I&#x27;m filled with sadness, because the people there deserve so much better.

Christians, i.e. those who believe in the &#x27;holy trinity&#x27; of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost - are &#x27;polytheists&#x27; since they worship others besides Allah. Taken together these lines are interpreted as cause to fight &#x27;unbelievers&#x27;. This is explained in more detail in chapter &#x27;O&#x27; (Justice) of &#x27;The Reliance of the Traveller&#x27; [1] in the section on jihad:<p><i>Jihad means to war against non-Muslims, and is etymologically derived from the word mujahada , signifying warfare to establish the religion. And it is the lesser jihad. As for the greater jihad, it is spiritual warfare against the lower self (nafs), which is why the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) said as he was returning from jihad,<p>“We have returned from the lesser jihad to the greater jihad.”<p>The scriptural basis for jihad, prior to scholarly consensus (def: b7) is such Koranic verses as:<p>(1) “Fighting is prescribed for you” (Koran 2:216);<p>(2) “Slay them wherever you find them” (Koran 4:89);<p>(3) “Fight the idolators utterly” (Koran 9:36);<p>and such hadiths as the one related by Bukhari and Muslim that the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) said:<p>“I have been commanded to fight people until they testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and perform the prayer, and pay zakat. If they say it, they have saved their blood and possessions from me, except for the rights of Islam over them. And their final reckoning is with Allah&quot;;<p>and the hadith reported by Muslim,<p>“To go forth in the morning or evening to fight in the path of Allah is better than the whole world and everything in it.”</i><p>There are many more such passages which can be and are interpreted in many ways so as to fit the purposes of those who lead others. It is the absence of a &#x27;true and leading interpretation&#x27; which disavows war and conquest in the name of islam which gives rise to islam&#x27;s specific problems when it comes to violence.<p>Read the Quran, &#x27;Reliance of the Traveller&#x27; (the classical manual on shariah law) and the Sunnah and you&#x27;ll understand just how open these texts are to interpretation.

The truth is in the middle: it&#x27;s got something to do with Islam – not everything, not nothing, but something.&quot;<p>...<p>The key, he said, lay in the way in which Islamist ideologues hijack parts of the faith&#x27;s scriptures and reinterpret them to support their political stance. It is critical for Islamic communities to discuss this process and, by so doing, &quot;reclaim their religion from those who use it to justify terrorism. I would encourage everyone to engage in this conversation, not to shut it down,&quot; he said.<p>...<p>&quot;If you don&#x27;t have this conversation, only the Islamist extremists prevail.

First they banned all Jewish organizations, even fraternities and tennis clubs. Then they started targeting the professional class (politicians, doctors, lawyers, etc) to wipe out people capable of running the country and challenge the Russian rule. Their crime was officially designated as &quot;being socially undesirable&quot;. Jews were overrepresented among the victims by a factor of 10. By the time Germans arrived in 1941, only 900 Jews were left in Estonia, as depicted on your map. Some had been deported, others ran away wherever they could. The last 900 remained because they believed that Germans couldn&#x27;t be worse than the Russian terror of 1940-1941.<p>When Russians invaded again in 1944 and began their 50-year occupation of the country (which included another wave of terror and mass deportations[3]), they replaced German antisemitic policies with their own and continued suppressing Jewish culture until the very end of the USSR. The Jewish school in Tallinn, for example, opened in 1924, was closed by Germans in 1941, and only in 1990, as the USSR entered the final death spiral, got its confiscated real estate back and resumed teaching. So if you intended to be clever and play the Jewish card, you chose a very wrong place to do it. Germans had the holocaust in store for them, and for Russians they were exploiters of the working class, destined for Siberian labor camps.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pac...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;June_deportation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;June_deportation</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Operation_Priboi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Operation_Priboi</a></div><br/><div id="40746934" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40746934" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thriftwy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40742012">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40745739">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40745162">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40746934">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40746934">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Soviet nomenclature did consist of Jews to significant extent.

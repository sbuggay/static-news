This arrangement is hardly anything that the working class should be thankful for.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36376542" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36376542" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dimgl</span><span>|</span><a href="#36377539">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36377599">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36376542">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36376542">[22 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wish I had something more productive to add, but I want to say is that I love this article.

Because they were implemented in the 1930s, and removed in the 1980s and 1990s as &quot;deregulation&quot;.<p>- The US needs Glass-Stegall back. That&#x27;s the requirement that banks and brokerages must be completely separate companies. The argument for repealing Glass-Stegall was that banks were now so smart that they didn&#x27;t need such severe restrictions to prevent collapse from bad investment decisions. The banks were wrong.<p>- Companies should only be allowed one class of voting stock. The New York Stock Exchange used to require that, back when the NYSE had real power. Allowing multiple classes of voting stock is what gives us President for Life CEOs such as Google and Facebook have.<p>- No stock buybacks. Illegal in the US from the 1930s to 1981. The US recently banned stock buybacks for 12 months for companies which received coronavirus funding.[1] But that was a one time thing. During periods of low interest rates, companies tended to buy back their own stock with borrowed money to prop up the stock price. This mostly benefits executives with stock options.<p>- Limits on complexity of corporate organization. This was a thing for utility companies until a decade or so ago. They were limited to a tree depth of 3 in ownership. This was to make regulation easier and reduce the risk of bankruptcy cascades. See &quot;Enron&quot;.<p>- Utility deregulation. Regulated utilities used to be standard. They got a monopoly in exchange for regulation. Since they were allowed a fixed rate of return on investment for rate-setting purposes, they were not hugely profitable but were very stable. The argument in the 1980s for deregulation is that utilities tended to overspend on infrastructure, building about 10% more stuff than they really needed. With deregulation, that money could go to stockholders. When Pacific Gas and Electric was deregulated, the company went bankrupt in only a few years, leaving the stockholders with nothing. And consumer prices went up in deregulated states vs regulated ones.[2]<p>- Tax law favors debt, where interest is deductible as a business expense, over dividends, which are not deductible. This encourages taking on too much debt.<p>- US bankruptcy law allows &quot;secured creditors&quot; too much security. Bankruptcy is too easy on lenders and too hard on accidental creditors.<p>What we need is a return to conservative financial principles.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smartasset.com&#x2F;financial-advisor&#x2F;stock-buyback-ban" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smartasset.com&#x2F;financial-advisor&#x2F;stock-buyback-ban</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ceepr.mit.edu&#x2F;deregulation-market-power-and-prices-evidence-from-the-electricity-sector&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ceepr.mit.edu&#x2F;deregulation-market-power-and-prices-e...</a></div><br/><div id="36378078" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36378078" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">HybridCurve</span><span>|</span><a href="#36376542">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36377198">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36378096">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36378078">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36378078">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">While some of these solutions are good, I don&#x27;t think any of them will make it through congress until well after Citizens United is appealed.

Dividends give money to shareholders who don&#x27;t sell.  That&#x27;s a big difference.<p>Furthermore, the primary reason stock is worth what it is, originates from actual or potential dividends (if they stopped reinvesting or hoarding) companies (could) pay.<p>That money has to go somewhere.  Either it&#x27;s hoarded or reinvested in infrastructure or spent frivolously on sweetheart contracts to friends of corporate management.  But, crucially, without dividends, none of that can be recaptured by <i>current</i> shareholders.  In theory, if shareholders of a company wanted an actual, not virtual, dividend, a stable material return on their investment, currently they could force a change in management that would pay out a dividend.  In what you propose, that&#x27;s not an option.<p>The value of a stock without dividends is almost purely speculative: who&#x27;s going to be holding the stock when the company&#x27;s assets are liquidated and returned (minus liabilities) to the stockholders, and what those net assets will amount to when the company is voluntarily or involuntarily shut down—neither of which is a particularly good sign for the state of the company when that happens.<p>Doing away with dividends seems like it would lead to more instability: all the craziness of VC-style investing, but for public companies that are no longer early-stage growth.  How could you have stable businesses or an economy when stockholders are driven, not by the promise of a share of profits this quarter or even an easily countable number of years from now, but by a share of the company&#x27;s assets when the company is no longer a viable entity?  How are those kinds of shareholders going to make good decisions about corporate governance?<p>I&#x27;m mostly on board with the essay, and the need to change things.

Dividends give money to shareholders who don&#x27;t sell.&quot;<p>Interesting to model the effects of that.  Buybacks tend to concentrate ownership among the shareholders that are most optimistic about the company&#x27;s future.  Since the only way to take your cash out is to sell, the most marginally-attached shareholders will sell, leaving only the shareholders who believe the company is worth much more in the future.  This could have much more dramatic effects on stock price than is financially rational, because it decreases the liquidity of the stock and decreases the pool of people who might sell in response to rational analysis (because they already sold, and their stock is now retained by the corporation itself, which is not a disinterested party).<p>It also increases the <i>ease</i> of corporate governance but decreases the <i>efficiency</i> of it.  Buybacks flush out the most marginally-attached shareholders, those most pessimistic about the company, and so they give company management a shareholder population that is largely on-board with company strategy and not inclined to exit, because they&#x27;ve already had plenty of chances to exit.  But the whole point of markets is to aggregate the opinions of many independent parties and avoid groupthink.  If the shareholder base is self-selecting, it&#x27;s particularly vulnerable to groupthink, and by definition has a higher opinion of the company&#x27;s prospects than the market as a whole.<p>Multiplied across thousands of stocks, that probably makes the market less efficient than without buybacks, also congruent with the declining liquidity.  We don&#x27;t observe declining liquidity, but much of that is because of market makers and passive investors that don&#x27;t have an opinion or vested interest in the future of the stock itself.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36377547" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36377547" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">photonbeam</span><span>|</span><a href="#36376542">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36377323">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36378025">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36377343">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36377547">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36377547">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Dividends mess with incentives for executives less.

(The exception for me is medical tech which I&#x27;m willing to take several-years-long shots on). I sit on real estate and utilities and the odd manufacturer or retailer with a history of increasing dividends, and watch the wilds of the NASDAQ with a daily mixture of jealousy and schadenfreude - because I know my own risk tolerance.<p>Markets are made of people. Companies are made of people. Poor incentives and deception do indeed lead to catastrophic losses and inefficiencies. Corrections are made. Fools and their money are parted.<p>I don&#x27;t have a hatred of <i>criticism</i> of any sort. I do however think there&#x27;s a smell when someone walks away after losing at the table and complains about the game.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36378192" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36378192" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bratbag</span><span>|</span><a href="#36378116">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36378148">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36378229">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36378173">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36378192">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36378192">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I didn&#x27;t pick up any hatred until I got to your post.</div><br/><div id="36378207" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36378207" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rTX5CMRXIfFG</span><span>|</span><a href="#36378116">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36378192">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36378199">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36378173">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36378207">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36378207">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Subjective points of view hardly ever consider the whole picture.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36378173" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36378173" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dmje</span><span>|</span><a href="#36378116">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36377186">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36378173">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36378173">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Literally every left leaning person since the dawn of time: &quot;the world is a closed system so we can&#x27;t have unlimited growth in anything&quot;.

OP only quotes and complains about the 2nd half of the paragraph and that the author doesn&#x27;t mention the money supply - and that is his main complaint, clearly written - and I show simply by quoting the preceding sentence too that the author explicitly DID mention it.

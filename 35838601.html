Though it had no particular recognized value, the class did award a certificate of completion after finishing the course, which was about a semester-hour spread over most of a year.<p>The music history we talked about was interesting, especially as I enjoy trivia such as the differences between various apparently similar instruments - did you know the viola is the only instrument to use the alto clef for notation?<p>The &quot;final exam&quot; had us play a relatively simple (or so they said) piece by Beethoven - <i>Pathétique II. Adagio</i> - and it was making me feel pretty pathetic. My wife had some previous piano history, and was doing quite well; but for me, the notes seemed to always end up in alphabetical order, or arrive long after they should have already left to go home. I began to slightly despair; I&#x27;d never hear the end of it if I didn&#x27;t at least get a (barely) passing grade.<p>The evening came for the exam, and my wife reported that she&#x27;d done quite well. I stepped into the room with apprehension, knowing that the instructor&#x27;s usual smile would soon turn to disappointment - but wait! <i>The instructor wasn&#x27;t there?!</i><p>He&#x27;d been called away to fill in for the Seattle Symphony, and had left instructions on how to take the test - a simple MIDI keyboard connected to an older PC. A slight ray of hope beamed through the window along with the setting sun - could it be? Would the PC be old <i>enough</i>? Sure enough, it was running Windows 98 (not Second Edition, that would have been disastrous)! I could do this!<p>The Windows 98 MIDI handler had a buffer overflow! All I would have to do is start the exam, hold down the right keys on the keyboard to trigger it, and the program would crash. Since the way it &quot;scored&quot; your playing was to start by writing your name and 100 points to the database, it would record that I had begun, and then there would be no recording of me making any mistakes.<p>I now have my certificate, and a photo of me with a slightly sheepish grin, as I was the only student to get a perfect score. I think my wife might suspect something, as she was perhaps near enough to hear that what I played sounded more like the <i>Cascades</i> trying to clear the track than anything Beethoven would have written, but I just told her that he was mostly deaf and probably played loud.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35839259" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35839259" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jzellis</span><span>|</span><a href="#35839367">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35839401">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35839259">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35839259">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m imagining this story as an Everything Is Terrible educational video from the 90s about the evils of cheating and it&#x27;s much better frankly</div><br/></div></div><div id="35839401" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35839401" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">graemebenzie</span><span>|</span><a href="#35839259">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35839401">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35839401">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Puts a dig in at teaching near the end.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

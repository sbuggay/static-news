There is the impossible invoicing more people here mentioned; my accountant keeps asking if they cannot just send 1 invoice once per month that it is clear instead of the vague warble they send once a week.<p>Their ‘recruiters’ are just friendly community chatters who talk a lot to people with that automatically (you get them too in the recommended list) match the skills (in their profile; there is of course no way to tell if they actually <i>do</i> match the skills you need; I needed an AD expert for 1 year and the recruiter introduced me to the perfect person; in a chat they admitted to me that they had worked with it once a long time ago…).<p>This is ready for disruption. But not by something like Toptal. Which should be mentioned, if you want to talk about greed…</div><br/><div id="35839480" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35839480" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anovikov</span><span>|</span><a href="#35839364">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35838943">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35839480">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35839480">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They are losing money and have always been.

Platform makes it appealing to stay active. They have a decent reputation with customers, so it&#x27;s a backup for when you fire your current client. But if you are inactive they stop recommending you and after a while you are delisted making it tougher to get clients. And customers like to see people who are active.<p>Also, automatic billing is a big value add for those of us who hate paperwork and chasing non paying customers. Upwork does it for you.<p>Re crypto, it&#x27;s an appealing vehicle for laundering and we don&#x27;t want to be implicated. couple of clients suggested it and it&#x27;s a red flag for me.

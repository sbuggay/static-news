At the risk of being too US&#x2F;West-centric, I do worry a lot about Western domination declining, and China taking its place.  I fundamentally do not believe that their system of government is good for people, and for the world at large.  (To be clear, I&#x27;m fine with US&#x2F;Western dominance declining over time, but I would like to see something I feel is equivalent or better taking its place, or, preferably, sharing its place.)<p>So in a way it&#x27;s good to read about two things in concert: 1) Xi tightening things up and cracking down harder and harder on free expression, and 2) younger Chinese people -- despite the propaganda I hear they&#x27;re exposed to -- becoming disillusioned and frustrated by it.  Overall it sucks: I certainly don&#x27;t wish more and more censorship etc. being foisted upon a billion of my fellow humans.  But I also don&#x27;t want to see a totalitarian regime being the main dominant world power.<p>Of course, dissatisfied young people -- and probably not even that many when compared to the whole of young Chinese people in China -- don&#x27;t guarantee any kind of meaningful change over time.  I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of young people in China who will happily step into the party&#x27;s shoes once the current leadership&#x27;s time has past.</div><br/><div id="39126609" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39126609" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">huijzer</span><span>|</span><a href="#39126551">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39127210">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39126609">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39126609">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I do worry a lot about Western domination declining, and China taking its place.<p>What gives me hope is that we’re not driving in North Korean or Russian cars, nor use their chips, or airplanes.

They do this by manipulating the currency and internal environment to stop living standards and wages from rising to Western levels, while trying to avoid interference with economic activity that does not threaten the government. Key nationalized sectors under-perform (like their oil industry) while others work much like they do in America. That doesn&#x27;t make them a centrally planned economy, any more than FED&#x27;s currency planning makes the US economy centrally planned in nature. They have a &quot;central plan,&quot; which is to drive all of their money towards reinvestment, but it&#x27;s not a planned economy.<p>Going beyond a statement of facts, I assume the reinvestment is supposed to eventually lead to owning the world, but that isn&#x27;t working out in Africa and all of the western infrastructure they finance has turned into yet another way for depressed Chinese living standards to transfer wealth to the countries the government is trying to get on top of. (It might feel intrusive to find out that a Chinese company owns a toll road you frequently use, but what actually happened is they froze their capital in a fixed asset, freeing an American firm to start a new project.)<p>It reminds me of how the US&#x27;s own foibles, mainly of a neocolonialist&#x2F;military interventionist type, have done nothing to benefit us but have weakened domestic security and the security of our interests abroad.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39126826" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39126826" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kelnos</span><span>|</span><a href="#39126551">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39126609">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39126920">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39127394">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39126826">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39126826">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think there are different levels to &quot;things working&quot; though.  A country can be using an economic and governing system that ultimately doesn&#x27;t work, but still have enough weight to throw around for a while, enough to do plenty of damage to others.  Russia is clearly showing that right now in Ukraine.  Even if Ukraine prevails (far from certain), the country may never be the same.  China may pull something similar (and be more successful at it) in Taiwan in the near future.<p>I do worry about Chinese products in the classes you mention.  OP notes that China became the world&#x27;s largest automobile exporter in 2023 (by units sold, not by revenue).  China still can&#x27;t rival Intel or AMD in chips, but they&#x27;re gaining ground all the time, and have some decent (though not superb) competitors in the ARM market, with inroads into RISC-V, I believe.  The Comac C919 airliner isn&#x27;t exactly all over yet, and I don&#x27;t know how safe, relable, and airworthy it is (not that Boeing has done well in that regard lately), but it exists, regardless of whether or not the allegations that they stole IP from US manufacturers is true.</div><br/><div id="39126999" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39126999" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">huijzer</span><span>|</span><a href="#39126551">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39126826">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39127394">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39126999">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39126999">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Even if Ukraine prevails (far from certain), the country may never be the same.<p>You can also say: Yes it has never before been as pro-West as it is today.<p>I agree completely with you that China has enough weight to do plenty of damage in the short term.

You need to know that what you have will still buy you what you expect in a month, 3 months, a year, etc.<p>Now, again, this still may be a better deal than the local currency for some people.

And I agree that they should use the best option available to them, and that crypto might be it.<p>But otherwise, I disagree: &quot;good&quot; is not solely determined by the options available.  When comparing options, you can only say that some are &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot;.  Crypto may be better for some people than their other options, but that doesn&#x27;t make it good.  (Consider sayings like &quot;the best of bad options&quot; or &quot;the lesser of evils&quot;.  It&#x27;s an acknowledgement that none of the options are good, but some are nonetheless better than others.)<p>Ideally people in these situations do -- sooner rather than later -- get some actually good options.  Maybe crypto will morph into that, or maybe people would get better (and quicker) bang for their buck tackling the problem from a different angle.  I don&#x27;t know what that other angle might be, but I worry that crypto ends up being a sort of local maximum that hits a ceiling, one that is better than the alternatives for some people, but is still not particularly good.</div><br/><div id="39126559" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39126559" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">keiferski</span><span>|</span><a href="#39125860">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39126514">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39126970">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39126559">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39126559">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What’s the alternative you’re proposing?

Then, they&#x27;d establish connections between that data. This is all sounds kind of hand-wavy, but the gist of it is that a lot of government agencies have data that lives in separate databases and they can&#x27;t easily correlate data between those two databases. Once the data was in Palantir&#x27;s system, they could do queries against all their data, and make connections and correlations that they wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be able to find when the data was previously siloed.<p>One of the sample use cases was identifying people filling prescriptions for schedule II drugs multiple times on the same day, and correlating that with pharmacies run by people connected to known drug traffickers.

As opposed to legacy ERP systems, it focuses on production optimization rather than just financial tracking. Warp Speed has the potential to relegate legacy systems to backend data storage, shifting the entire intelligence layer (and value) to Palantir&#x27;s system. Warp Speed targets both innovative new manufacturers (they note Tesla and Space X alums starting new companies) and traditional large-scale operations.<p>Mission Manager: enables other defense contractors to build on Palantir&#x27;s platform and benefit from their security infrastructure and position of trust within government. You can think of it as an AWS for defense companies; plug and play with the foundations handled for you. While the product just launched in Q4 2023, they just received a new $33 million CDAO Open DAGIR contract. While this is possibly just an advanced POC, it represents significant potential for future growth and wider adoption in the defense sector. Now is the perfect time. From 2021 to 2023, VC firms invested nearly $100 billion in defense tech startup companies, a 40% increase from the previous seven years combined. Time is the most important thing for these startups and Mission Manager shows the potential to save lots of it.</div><br/><div id="41862522" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41862522" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">NicoJuicy</span><span>|</span><a href="#41855137">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41862236">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41863465">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41862522">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41862522">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Now is the perfect time<p>The perfect time is yesterday.

In fact China has serious structural problems that may make all this conversation pointless. But there needs to be some sort of pathway for the global south to move forward. If that involves having China rise up and then countries accepting that all they can do is play the US and China off of each other to get the best deals out of them then thats still a step forward. If climate change comes to pass it may not even matter. The US and the West is the cause for the majority of the historical pollution yet its the unprepared global south that will bear the worst brunt of climate change.

Decades of erosion to US institutions has led to a situation that can only change if things get really bad and the citizens really demand change..or the US elite are challenged with some real competition. I dont see how it can happen naturally in the US anymore. Every time people get fed up, there is a &quot;release valve&quot; or a distraction in the form of crumbs offered to people so that enough settle down or fixate on something else. We saw it after the &quot;Occupy Wall Street Protests&quot; with the beginning of the culture wars as well as the passing of Obamacare which eliminated the most barbaric provisions of health care in the US. It is not meaningful change but it calmed people down. This method will lead to decades of the elite retaining their leverage. I dont want to see my life pass before my eyes and no real reform ends up happening.<p>In terms of the second method of having the elite being challenged, We saw in the cold war how the US system had to prove itself and that led to a strong taxation on the wealthy, good institutions, positive movement for the middle class, all to show the Russians that the US led system is the best.

Now China has entered the scene and it has provided the ability for countries to start playing the US and China off of each other to see what they can get out of both countries.

People always demand improvements. The leadership of this country hasn&#x27;t actually done it until they really have a pissed off populace at their doorstep. I wouldn&#x27;t believe it if it weren&#x27;t for the historical precedent.<p>&gt;What&#x27;s the point in this accelerationism with allies as casualties then?<p>Americans should be first in line when it comes to who the government serves but if you just look at the US government&#x27;s actions vs other governments in the west, the US government clearly does not have their citizens interests first and foremost.<p>Think of all the rights and regulations the EU(or hell even many third world countries) have vs the US.<p>It manifests itself in so many ways:<p>Some easy examples demonstrating small issues as well as big ones:<p>1. EU countries mandate physical addresses for VOIP number registration. US spends years not implementing its half assed regulations Result: Americans are drowning in spam calls<p>2. EU negotiates drug prices as a government and refuses to pay more than a specific %. Companies would rather get something vs nothing from the EU market. US despite being the largest market, refuses to negotiate as a government even though they have a universal health program(for seniors only but thats a different issue). Result: American made drugs are sometimes up to 10x more expensive in the US than elsewhere. A vial of insulin in EU: ~9$ USA: ~99$<p>3. US sends its Navy to patrol world seas, ensuring flow of goods. Result: EU does not meet required 2% of NATO spending and instead funnels that money into social services like subsidized colleges. Result: US citizens either drown with a lifetimes worth of college debt or take a chance in the Military for subsidized college after giving up 4+ years of their young adult life serving their military contract while EU citizens graduate debt free and take a gap year traveling instead.<p>I can go on for literal dozens of examples. I specifically chose to go from small to big to show that the problem is systemic and permeates all aspects of American life. In many ways the American system is one giant scam and they only people benefiting are people who have managed to survive in the upper echelons of the income stratosphere or are foreigners.<p>If the US changed its focus to be more inward, it can focus on rebuilding manufacturing which would increase jobs availability and give more power to workers which would lead to other rights for the common man such as demanding more from the government to help US peoples among many other examples.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41865140" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41865140" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mega_dean</span><span>|</span><a href="#41861823">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41862260">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41862661">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41862290">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41865140">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41865140">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; On other hand, who are we defending from and why are spending all this money on world police when we have a ton of internal problems?<p>Reminds me of this scene in Wag the Dog: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wwgPnYVg74Y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wwgPnYVg74Y</a><p>&quot;The war of the future is nuclear terrorism.

The density of civilian populations in urban areas and the multidimensional nature of the environment make it more likely that even accurate attacks with precision weapons will injure noncombatants.…If collateral damage is likely to be of sufficient magnitude, it may justify avoiding urban operations, which though tactically successful, would run counter to national and strategic objectives.<p>United States Army and Marine Corps 2017 Manual on Urban Operations, quoted in [2]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oxfam.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;more-women-and-children-killed-gaza-israeli-military-any-other-recent-conflict" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oxfam.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;more-women-and-child...</a>

Palantir&#x27;s Q2 &#x27;24 cash flows from operations at 40% of revenues looks closer to the mark [1].

Harvard Business School teaches you skills that would make you good at running a company.
    2. There are lots of companies that could use those skills.
    3. But you don’t want to run those companies, because they make, like, ball bearings.
    4. You want to run a fancy company; you want to run a hedge fund or a tech startup or something.
    5. Meanwhile, the people currently running the ball bearings company would not be all that excited about you, a fresh-faced business school graduate who has never run anything, coming in to run their company, even if you did learn a lot of useful skills at Harvard.
    6. Therefore various industries exist whose principal business is laundering ball bearings companies into opportunities that appeal to Harvard Business School graduates. You wrap the ball bearings company in a name like “private equity” and suddenly it is legible to the Harvard students, so they flock to it.
    7. Those industries are also in the business of getting the ball bearings companies to accept the Harvard Business School graduates, which in practice means not so much “make the ball bearings company excited about its new Harvard CEO” but rather “buy the ball bearings company and install new management.”

This narrative was part of a broader anti-Semitic campaign to justify the persecution of Jews. The Nazis cited several instances as evidence of this purported declaration of war by Jews, most notably a headline from the British newspaper The Daily Express on March 24, 1933, which read &quot;Judea Declares War on Germany.&quot; This headline was in response to a worldwide boycott of German goods organized by Jewish groups to protest against the early actions of the Nazi government, such as the boycott of Jewish businesses in Germany.<p>The Nazi regime used this headline and other similar international actions to claim that the global Jewish community was an enemy of Germany. This supposed declaration of war served as a convenient pretext for the Nazis to intensify their anti-Semitic policies, which eventually led to the Holocaust. The narrative fit into the broader Nazi ideology that portrayed Jews as an existential threat to the German nation and the Aryan race, and it was used to justify the systematic genocide that was to follow. This is akin to Thiel stating &quot;well, if the jews had the power, they too would have committed a holocaust against the Germans&quot;, this is sheer insanity, he uses a similar argument to justify the Palestinian genocide. Stating &quot;they didn&#x27;t dresden Gaza&quot;, huh? What Israel did to Gaza is, by any measurable metric, much worse than what happened to Dresden. His defense of Israel&#x27;s Genocide of Palestinians is not just factually wrong but filled with statements that are evidence of his denial of reality.<p>At 1:03:05 Thiel states: &quot;the intent to commit a crime is where the crime gets committed&quot;. LOL, and the audience clapped - what absolute insanity. Legally and pragmatically, that statement is absurd. One can not judge people based on their &quot;intentions&quot;, which can&#x27;t be separated from personal bias and interpretation, but only on their concrete actions and not their perceived &quot;thought crimes&quot;.<p>So Thiel dishonestly removes all context of a century of brutal colonialism and ethnic-cleansing to paint the crudest zionist propaganda of &quot;they just want to kill all jews&quot; instead of a colonized people whose children, in the same year - months before that event, were brutally murdered by the israeli occupation as they have done for decades: At least <i>507 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank in 2023</i>, including <i>at least 81 children</i>, <i>making it the deadliest year for Palestinians</i> since the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) began recording casualties in 2005.

My brother even if he is my brother and he is a Muslim, If he steals my house and kicks me out, I will resist him.”<p>Although the zionist propagandists know very well that it is their oppressive occupation for which they are hated, they still prefer peddling a false narrative that their targets of colonization just &quot;hate the jews&quot;, because it&#x27;s a very potent narrative that plays into islamophobic and orientalist tropes which the western world finds appealing.</div><br/><div id="41866382" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41866382" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Barrin92</span><span>|</span><a href="#41861799">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41863889">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41862011">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41866382">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41866382">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Thiel states: &quot;the intent to commit a crime is where the crime gets committed&quot;.

This is a very clever stratagem:  those of us concerned about understanding the “other” are redirected from worrying about the alien to worrying about the killer of the alien, and thus our condemnation of genocide reemerges as a sign of our prejudice and small-mindedness. Ender is not the victimizer, but the misunderstood victim of others’ fear and prejudice.</i></div><br/><div id="41866481" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41866481" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jedimind</span><span>|</span><a href="#41861799">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41866382">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41862011">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41866481">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41866481">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The problem is that Thiel himself clearly didn&#x27;t understand the message of the novel. Quoting Ender&#x27;s Game to justify genocide[1] fundamentally misinterprets the novel. Ender is horrified when he realizes he has been tricked into committing genocide and spends his life seeking redemption. Thiel on the other hand is bending over backwards to lie to the audience in order to justify the genocide.<p>Even before the genocide began, it was clear from how israeli officials repeatedly referenced Dresden that they viewed the bombing as a model for their actions—and that is precisely what they did. Thus, it is even more absurd for Thiel to claim that they &quot;didn&#x27;t Dresden Gaza.&quot; They did, and it is much worse and it still hasn&#x27;t stopped after more than a year.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk&#x2F;article&#x2F;prof-amos-goldberg-yes-it-is-genocide&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk&#x2F;article&#x2F;prof-amos-go...</a> - Israel &#x27;undoubtedly committing genocide&#x27; says Holocaust scholar Amos Goldberg</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41862189" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41862189" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Finnucane</span><span>|</span><a href="#41861799">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41866805">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41862189">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41862189">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;I remember my first time I talked to Stephen Cohen he had the A&#x2F;C in his office set at 60, several weird-looking devices for minimizing CO2 content in the room, and had a giant pile of ice in a cup.

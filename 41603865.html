Responding to some of your questions with how I could see the above touch sensor helping:<p>Trash sort and recycling: Not many robots here, majority of sorting takes advantage of object material properties. Some companies tried to add delta robots to keep up with the high rates required to even approach profitability, but they weren&#x27;t good enough. Maybe some municipalities or universities that have lots of funding could justify adding robots, but it&#x27;s just hard to financially justify.<p>Recalibration: I&#x27;m curious what the developers have for handling reduced magnetic fields over time along with gunk. Silicone is washdown rated, but anything soft at high throughput with parts will start to wear out and change pickup characteristics.<p>Washing and destemming a tomato is more of a problem to solve now that will need another 10+ years of price reductions in robot+end effector costs and increased efficiency before it beats bulk washing and hand-destemming (or crude machine work). Maybe it&#x27;ll be a grad-student&#x27;s project for a theoretical future home-bot<p>The Lenovo TrackPoint is likely already 95% of what you&#x27;d need from a trackpad, but this touch sensor is likely not even focused at that market.<p>Things I see useful for this robot touch sensor:<p>* Simpler version that detects part presence, is just a Boolean feedback of &quot;part detected&quot; which can stick on existing end effectors. This is often handled by load calculations of the robot to detect if it has a part, but could also detect if a part has substantially &quot;moved&quot; while it&#x27;s been gripped, sending a signal to the robot to pause<p>* Harder to suggest items for food as soft grippers (inflatable fingers) will grip at the precise pressure that they&#x27;re inflated, reducing the need for sensitive feedback. The application for this touch sensor would be food that needs a combination of different pressures to properly secure something, can&#x27;t think of a great example<p>* Hard to also suggest places where this sensor would help with fine alignment, as major manufacturers have motor and arm feedback with WAY more sensitivity than the average person would realize, google Fanuc &quot; Touch Sensing&quot;. But, this could help when the end effector is longer and it&#x27;s harder for the joints to detect position<p>* Fabric manipulation. Fabric is just a hard problem for robots, adding in more information about the &quot;part&quot; should be helpful. Unlocking more automations for shoe manufacturing at reasonable prices is a big wall</div><br/><div id="41604967" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41604967" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">raunaqmb</span><span>|</span><a href="#41604216">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41604865">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41605883">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41604967">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41604967">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a very insightful summary, thank you! A few things to add about AnySkin that might be relevant:<p>- AnySkin expressly handles wear and gunk by being replaceable. So if it wears out, and you have a heuristic or learned model for the old skin, it will work pretty well on the new skin! We verify this through an analysis of the raw signal consistency across skins, as well as through visuotactile policies learned using behavior cloning. We found swapping skins to work for some pretty precise tasks like inserting USBs and swiping credit cards.<p>- Could definitely be used for part motion detection<p>- Soft, inflatable grippers are effective, but often passive. AnySkin is not just soft, but also offers contact information from the interaction to actively ensure that blueberry doesn&#x27;t get squished!<p>- This sensor would be key for robots that seek to use learned ML policies in cluttered environments. Robots are very likely to encounter scenarios where they see an object they must interact with, but the object is occluded either by their own end-effector(s) or by other objects. Touch, and an understanding of touch in relation to vision becomes critical to manipulate objects in these settings.<p>- Industrial robots do have very sensitive motor and arm feedback. However, these systems are bulky and unsafe to integrate into household robotic technologies. Sensors like AnySkin could be used as a powerful, lightweight solution in these scenarios, potentially by integrating with some exciting recent household robotics models like Robot Utility Models.<p>- ReSkin, the predecessor to AnySkin, has previously been used quite effectively for fabric manipulation! (see work from David Held&#x27;s group at CMU). AnySkin is more reliable as well as more consistent and could potentially improve the performance seen in prior work.</div><br/><div id="41607500" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41607500" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kaibee</span><span>|</span><a href="#41604216">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41604967">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41605883">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41607500">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41607500">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; - Industrial robots do have very sensitive motor and arm feedback.

(VR, or just a richer set of control dimensions for eg photo editing or something.)

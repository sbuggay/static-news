In this case, each individual stack would not take much time but in aggregate, a lot of time is spent in the function at the top of all of the call stacks. This should not be that uncommon to have hotspots in things like copying routines, compression, encryption etc that are not associated with any particular stack.<p>pprof from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google&#x2F;pprof">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google&#x2F;pprof</a> can produce a DAG view of a profile where nodes are sized proportional to their cumulative time, e.g.,

A flame graph gives you a good idea of the hierarchical structure (and quickly). Sometimes you can work that out from a DAG, but not necessarily:<p>Let&#x27;s say that A and B call M, and M calls X and Y. All four edges have roughly the same value. A flame graph can show you that 90% of the time spent in X started with A and that 90% of the time spent in Y started with B, but the DAG can&#x27;t.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40814252" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40814252" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tanelpoder</span><span>|</span><a href="#40813229">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40813668">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40818590">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40814252">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40814252">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had the same experience&#x2F;question at some point when I noticed (and investigated), why didn&#x27;t a new Ubuntu Linux install break out interrupt usage in vmstat anymore.

But the various NVMe I&#x2F;O completion interrupts happened all over the place, even when the CPUs were in random userspace code sections. Neither the bottom-up &amp; top-down FlameGraph approach made it visually clear in this case.<p>But since interrupt time <i>did</i> show up and since the FlameGraph JS tool had a text search box, I searched for &quot;interrupt&quot; or &quot;irq&quot; in the search box - and the JS code highlighted all matching sections with purple color (completely distinct from the classic color range of flamegraphs). And seeing that purple color all over the place made me smile and gave me a strong visual &quot;a-ha&quot; moment.

There was a suspiciously wide chunk with a name indicating something about date times. An bit later we had a solid 10% improvement win.<p>- I had some code with strange behavior under load, undergoing some kind of a performance phase transition before the CPU (or other normal resources) were anywhere near maxed out. I grabbed a flamegraph under normal conditions and under load. The `main` loop was wider, but that&#x27;s not helpful. Walking up the graph a little bit, next to some function the code was supposed to be calling there was a block named sched_yield which was huge and didn&#x27;t exist in the normal trace. The root cause was just a strange (broken) concurrency mechanism in some underlying logging code, causing logging to pile up and hog all the resources past a certain request threshold.<p>The colors are a red herring. They exist just to make it easier to keep track of where you are in the graph, much like how ragged text is easier to read than justified.<p>Height is sometimes interesting. It represents a deep call stack. I find that happens most frequently in error handling code, and if something is called enough to make its way into a sampling-based flamegraph it&#x27;s often worth taking a peek at for other reasons. Runtime is a function of width though, and height doesn&#x27;t play a role.<p>Another point worth keeping in mind is that a lot of the benefit is in being able to quickly fine a plausible explanation for the performance issue. If you find that your application is spending most of its time in `read` calls, perhaps you&#x27;ll want to do less of that, perhaps you&#x27;ll want to submit a perf improvement to the kernel (unlikely?), but what you definitely want to do is look at the next level above the offending code, then the level above that, .... What you&#x27;ll find depends on your application, but the difference between being slow because of locking and synchronization is very different from error handling or just executing the happy path a ton of times, and that insight will help govern your next actions.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40814298" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40814298" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">starkrights</span><span>|</span><a href="#40812339">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40817593">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40813165">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40814298">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40814298">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I donât know if it helps, but this is how I read through the graph from the first article after reading the authors conclusion. (Iâm an idiot)<p>- okay, weâre analyzing DvrDrawImage
- Letâs analyze the function on the left, GpBitmap::PipeLockBits
- Up through ::Decode, takes up 100% of the time from PipeLockBits, so weâre just racing down the call stack to get to that point, and <i>then</i> other stuff starts taking up time
- Lots of WindowsCodecs calls, I guess we kind of expect those to be valid since image processing needs codecs and stuff and things 
- Okay, now thereâs a bar taking up ~45-50% of the ::Decode call, thatâs not a codec or drawing related thing- itâs an os level pagefault. Thatâs fucky. 
- Since the ::Decode call is ~55-65% of the ::DvrDrawImage call, that pagefault is (~40% of ~60% =)~25% of this draw image call<p>So essentially I looked and saw a stack of bars altogether and went âokay, the call at the top of this is the only reason the call 6 bars up the stack (ie, 6 bars down on the flamegraph) is taking time, why?â, and start applying the same process recursively from there.<p>That is, until $why == âdue to codec calls and an ntkernel callâ, and the question becomes âis that valid?â Then the question becomes âare these codec calls taking the amount of time I would expect?â, and â<p>iiuc peaks and colors donât matter. Tbf I think the colorscheming on this chart is shit- afaik flamegraph coloring is just a way of marking the same (or from the same library? Implementation dependent?) function for easy spotting. Like why not make the functions wildly different colors. Redness != hotness of a certain codepath.<p>The only thing peaks indicate is calls that have deeply nested function calls, which I guess would be important if youâre having recursion issues.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40813165" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40813165" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nemetroid</span><span>|</span><a href="#40812339">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40814298">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40814480">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40813165">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40813165">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Did you read the linked article?

But there are some clues to its relevance:<p>1. It&#x27;s close to the boundary between application code and standard library code. It does call MetaData::Cache::getVarsByName, which (going by the name) also is part of the application, but everything deeper in the stack (i.e. on top of those bars) is purely std:: stuff.<p>2. Domain knowledge. The text alludes to this: Record::hasVariable is a conceptually simple operation that&#x27;s not expected to be a major part of the runtime.<p>This does not mean that Record::hasVariable must be the culprit. Maybe some function higher in the call stack (e.g. EditingAPI::Rules::getSourceDataAsLong) is calling Record::hasVariable way too many times?

My bicycles are a perfect example of this. Most components – such as wheels, gear set, and brakes – are interchangeable between the different frames, even though every vehicle is from another brand and year of construction.<p>[…]<p>Unfortunately, compatibility is hardly a feature of bicycle manufacturing anymore. Manufacturers have introduced an increasing number of proprietary parts and keep changing standards, resulting in compatibility issues even for older bicycles of the same brand. For example, if the shifter of a modern bike breaks after some years of use, a replacement part will probably no longer be available. You need to order a new set from a new generation, which will be incompatible with your front and rear derailleur – which you also need to replace. For road bikes, the change from cassette bodies with ten sprockets (around 2010) to cassette bodies with eleven, twelve, and most recently thirteen sprockets have made many wheelsets obsolete, and the same goes for the rest of the drivetrain including shifters and chains.<p>Disc brakes, which are now on almost every new bicycle, all have different axle designs, meaning that every vehicle now requires proprietary spare parts. Disc brakes also required new shifters, forks, framesets, cables, and wheels, making such bicycles incompatible with earlier designs.”</i></div><br/><div id="37346856" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37346856" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scott_w</span><span>|</span><a href="#37339937">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37340162">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37341111">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37346856">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37346856">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Reduced compatibility is an issue but some of these are not, depending on the manufacturer.<p>SRAM 12s cassettes are incompatible with the 11s freehub but Shimano 12s is still compatible. You will need new shifters, so you’d just buy the whole upgrade together.<p>Rim to disc is obviously incompatible but Shimano’s levers, rotors and callipers have all been forwards compatible so far on road bikes.<p>Even upgrading your cassette to an incompatible standard is usually just a case of buying a new freehub body for your rear wheel (Shimano -&gt; SRAM XDR). Ideal? No. Affordable? Yes.<p>The biggest complaints usually come from bottom brackets and even here, changing is usually possible and affordable. Looking at Shimano, I’ve just upgraded my 2016 road bike from an older generation 105 crankset to a newer 4-arm crankset and didn’t need to change the bottom bracket.<p>Things like forks, seatposts, handlebars can be an issue because they’re becoming more proprietary on higher end bikes. I’m not convinced this is an issue that affects your average commuter, however. I just bought a bike where this isn’t an issue, for example.</div><br/><div id="37348227" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37348227" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacquesm</span><span>|</span><a href="#37339937">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37346856">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37341111">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37348227">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37348227">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A family member who is an &#x27;above average&#x27; commuter has rebuilt bikes more than once until the frames wear out. He does commutes from Haarlem to Amsterdam every day and that really adds up in kilometers. It&#x27;s never been a problem to get parts. Also: there is always the local equivalent of ebay if you want to keep bikes running, plenty of new old stock and parts with very little wear on them for sale. For a while I had a pretty rare team bike, a Guerciotti and even for that bike of which I&#x27;m pretty sure no more than a handful were ever made parts were readily available. Bikes are - fortunately - a commodity.<p>What van Moof tried to do is the playbook of every crappy startup: to graft on future revenue onto an initial sale. Every trick they could employ to bind the customer to them they pulled and that&#x27;s exactly what did them in. The bike industry from a bike manufacturers point of view looks completely different than from a bike <i>parts</i> manufacturers point of view. The amount of knowledge required to build a bike is a small fraction of the amount of knowledge required to build all the parts. So most manufacturers will select parts to achieve a certain price point and quality level, add their own frames (or even outsource the building of the frames) and slap their label on it.<p>Van Moof could have been just as successful as Brompton, who make a relatively niche bike that is expensive but has an excellent reputation. Instead they wanted to be Apple, but without the incremental progress that got Apple to where they are today. It&#x27;s an example of premature scaling: some strategies only make sense if you have achieved a certain scale. You can&#x27;t leapfrog that process by deploying those strategies early, it will just bite you.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37341111" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37341111" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aidenn0</span><span>|</span><a href="#37339937">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37340162">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37346856">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37340482">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37341111">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37341111">[19 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh this is such a thing.  The lack of compatibility also makes things less customizable.  I used to always add a horizontal brake lever for reaching when I lift up from the drops (which I do when in traffic), but now that every shifter is different and every shifter is integrated into the brake levers it&#x27;s not really an option.<p>Somewhat unrelated I also kind of hate how popular aluminum has become (or at least was when I last bought a road bike).  Since all the mass produced frames are aluminum, the only options for a steel frame were more exotic models and thus expensive.  In retrospect I wish I had just bought a steel hybrid frame and built a bike myself, but I was rather busy at the time, and it probably <i>still</i> would have been more expensive since so many of the parts are non-interchangeable.</div><br/><div id="37347700" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37347700" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">andrewshadura</span><span>|</span><a href="#37339937">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37341111">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37341340">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37347700">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37347700">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not sure what country you live in, but here separate brake levers and steel frames are still easily found.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37341340" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37341340" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CobaltFire</span><span>|</span><a href="#37339937">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37341111">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37347700">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37346589">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37341340">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37341340">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I ride a Niner RLT Steel (bought as a frame) for that exact reason.<p>It was a tossup between that or a Lynsey, and I snagged a close out color of the Niner for 1&#x2F;3 of the quoted price of the Lynsky at the time, and that included a carbon fork.<p>I’m actually overhauling it now with an entire group set after riding the last one since 2016.<p>Interesting fact that relates: the first couple years of the RLT Steel shipped with a fork that is 15x100 thru axle; nowadays the gravel&#x2F;cyclocross market has settled on 12x100.<p>So I ended up getting a set of New Old Stock (NOS) 29” wheels from that same era that are 15x100&#x2F;12x142 and 22.5mm wide.

Bike thieves quickly learned that stealing VanMoof bikes will only lead the cops to their stash.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oeffentlichen-dienst.de&#x2F;wirtschafts-news&#x2F;46-news&#x2F;570-fahrraddiebstahl.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oeffentlichen-dienst.de&#x2F;wirtschafts-news&#x2F;46-news...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37348191" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37348191" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">furyg3</span><span>|</span><a href="#37347788">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37347810">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37347814">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37348191">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37348191">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They were trendy looking and expensive.

  - Settings were forgotten almost every time the bike went to sleep, it would reset the sounds settings so turning it on or unlocking it would always play the cheesy sound effects no matter how many times I turned them off.
  - For the first year or so the app would regularly log me out. And the design of the app at the time made it look like you were chatting with a bot so it would take longer to login than needed. Thankfully they redesigned it.
</code></pre>
Hardware<p><pre><code>  - The integrated back wheel lock will now only unlock if I move the bike a few inches, any additional inches and the lock re-locks itself.
  - The bike would randomly show an error code and drop power. Vanmoof replaced the battery and onboard computer but I have had it occasionally show error codes since and am nervous it&#x27;ll turn into a brick at some point.

I think this is where my love for the local bike mechanic comes into play: each small town here has a couple of them, and the density is such that no company serving only a single brand could set up that kind of network. And it&#x27;s also why I will never buy a bike online: these people are essential and to buy a bike with them ensures they stay in business. Every now and then when they are short on time and I have something I need fixed right away I&#x27;ll be happy to do it myself assuming I have the tools. But for some bikes (for instance: a tandem that we have that has a lot of rare stuff on it) I&#x27;d rather have the bike shop work on it than that I&#x27;m going to end up risking wrecking something. Older bikes are easier in that sense, far less hard to source stuff.<p>I think Van Moof <i>could</i> have made it if they had been far more strict on QA and designing for reliability from day #1, bikes are as you correctly noted operating in a hostile environment and you need to design for that. Bike electronics are hard (super easy to mess that one up), batteries are hard, software is hard. If you then add a bunch of custom stuff you&#x27;ve set yourself up for failure. I did not do DD on any of the Van Moof rounds but when evaluating what bike to buy I looked at their bikes and decided that I did not like what I saw and went for a Riese &amp; Mueller instead, which has served me extremely well (12000 km and counting, not a single failure in the field other than a broken spoke which was easily remedied, and likely the result of bumping the bike with another one in the garage here). Van Moof had their shot, they failed and I doubt the buyers are going to make this work without a total departure from both the business model and that bike design. They should make a deal with Bafang, Shimano or Bosch or some other experienced manufacturer to make their custom parts for them in return for some margin, the bikes are plenty expensive to leave enough room for that and they can pay for that from the reduced warranty reserve. As an added bonus they get certification thrown in as long as they don&#x27;t change the wheel diameter. Then they can focus on the software (which had plenty of problems).</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37340312" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37340312" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">brnt</span><span>|</span><a href="#37340269">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37340336">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37340889">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37340312">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37340312">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">VanMoof seemed to be a riff on Juicero: expensive custom parts specifically designed to keep you a lifelong overpaying customer.</div><br/><div id="37347302" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37347302" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vanderZwan</span><span>|</span><a href="#37340269">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37340312">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37340346">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37347302">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37347302">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That one video of an engineer taking a Juicero apart and just being stunned from start to finish that it&#x27;s built from the most expensive, high-quality parts imaginable, making it possibly the most over-engineered piece of junk ever, is probably one of the most entertaining YT videos I&#x27;ve ever seen.</div><br/><div id="37347984" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37347984" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yurishimo</span><span>|</span><a href="#37340269">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37347302">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37340346">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37347984">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37347984">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I assume you mean this one from AvE?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_Cp-BGQfpHQ">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_Cp-BGQfpHQ</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37340346" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37340346" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacquesm</span><span>|</span><a href="#37340269">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37340312">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37347302">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37340889">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37340346">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37340346">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The overpaying started right on day #1.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37340889" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37340889" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">conqrr</span><span>|</span><a href="#37340269">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37341913">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37340889">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37340889">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Any ebike company that&#x27;s using parts that my local bike shop can&#x27;t work on is not getting my money.

Also they gave the option to upgrade to newer models for $10 more dollars a month  after a year which I think it helps them to fix operational issues.

Just recently, I bought a NIB VanMoof on CL. The owner had never put together and it sat in his basement for 2 years. So the batteries in it are dead (the controller battery was a spicy pillow, but the motor battery may still be okay), so I figured at the price it was offered at, it worth it just for the parts in the worst case.<p>I knew about the BikeyApp, and getting the encryption keys downloaded before I went to go buy the bike, but unfortunately, before I could stop the PO, he deletes the bike from his VanMoof account because I now own the bike, and he wanted to release it so that I could register it to myself. So I own it now, right? Wrong... Even though I now &quot;own&quot; the bike, I cannot register it because I don&#x27;t have the original manual for it (the PO lost it), which has a special QR code printed on it to register the bike.<p>The PO, who has a receipt for the bike, cannot get VanMoof to transfer the ownership to me, so the bike is parts (which is a risk I was willing to take). I&#x27;m going to strip the craptacular electronics from it and just make it a regular 4spd pedal bike.<p>The funny thing is I was able to get the controller powered up and guess what? The bike was defective from the factory... the controller throws charging over-temp errors regardless of it being hooked up to anything, even dummy loads. This apparently is not an uncommon experience with these bikes from the forum posts I&#x27;ve read about them.<p>Also, as an aside, f* having to carry a phone to use a bike.

Looking up &quot;Meta&quot; in California Corporation Search brings up everything with &quot;Metal&quot; in it, which is a hassle. Their actual company name is &quot;Meta Platforms, Incorporated&quot;. Search for &quot;Meta Platforms&quot; here.[1] California company registration #2711108.<p>Subpoenas are sent, using a process server, to their registered agent,
which is Corporation Service Company in Sacramento, a business which exists to receive subpoenas for other companies. And, conveniently, there are process serving companies with offices in the same building, and you can find them by searching for the address of CSC and &quot;process server&quot;, then ignoring the spam results.<p>Most small claims court web sites explain all this.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bizfileonline.sos.ca.gov&#x2F;search&#x2F;business" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bizfileonline.sos.ca.gov&#x2F;search&#x2F;business</a></div><br/><div id="40743212" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40743212" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">c-linkage</span><span>|</span><a href="#40741842">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40744307">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40743212">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40743212">[43 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To me this appears as a way to outsource customer service to an external entity funded by a cash flow to which Meta does not need to contribute.

Which is why there are &quot;lemon laws&quot; on selling used cars or food regulations.<p>The used car industry as a whole benefits when consumers are willing to pay more. Customers are willing to pay more for a used car if they think it will be high-quality. However, an ethically questionable used car salesman will try to undercut each other by offering low-quality cars that immediately break, giving all used car salesmen a bad name. Consumers now no longer want to buy used cars at all and now the only people making money are those selling a bad product.<p>The point of legal regulation here is to enforce a quality minimum on used cars. This drives the price of used cars upwards. Salespeople get paid more, the customers get better quality, and the world is better off having reused cars that would&#x27;ve been scrapped. Everyone is better off.<p>This could also be true for social media. Forcing social media to invest in better systems to ban users means that social media advertising can be worth more money. Right now, advertising marketplaces are controlled by the companies themselves. Nobody trusts companies to show ads to real users instead of bots. This drives the value of social media advertising down.<p>While individually, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to pay for customer service infrastructure to verify people&#x27;s ownership of accounts, if there is a mandatory standard, all social media companies would benefit because it increases the value of their products.<p>This is one of the roles of government regulation that can create a net economic gain.</div><br/><div id="40745006" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40745006" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">OptionOfT</span><span>|</span><a href="#40741842">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40744676">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40745563">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40745006">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40745006">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sidenote: car sales in general are not ethical.

It&#x27;s a race to the bottom where you always lose.</div><br/><div id="40743342" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40743342" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">exe34</span><span>|</span><a href="#40742054">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40743280">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40745334">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40743342">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40743342">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">all that freedom and you can&#x27;t return a faulty product?</div><br/><div id="40744383" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40744383" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">autoexec</span><span>|</span><a href="#40742054">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40743342">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40745334">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40744383">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40744383">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Long before we started keeping more of our citizens locked up behind bars than any other nation on the earth &quot;all that freedom&quot; has been mostly just advertising, but the free speech is pretty nice.</div><br/><div id="40746616" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40746616" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">exe34</span><span>|</span><a href="#40742054">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40744383">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40745334">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40746616">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40746616">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">at least you guys have guns though!

Facebook knows about these groups and could shut them down trivially, but that does not boost engagement numbers. A lot of meta policies are actually very hostile towards users and make absolutely no sense.<p>For instance, I learned I was somehow shadowbanned or deranked on instagram and confirmed on several accounts with tests. I complained to a friend I knew that work there and all of a sudden my account was getting activity again. Ever since then though the algorithm has been flagging and moderating insanely weird posts for &quot;spam&quot; or &quot;self promotion&quot;, which I figured out is just the algorithm flagging you for a post going viral.  when I comment about anything vaguely related to the tech field, which are always on topic and full of information I will get flagged. It&#x27;s irritating to watch your account get &quot;penalized&quot; in some completely opaque and unfair way when you can see actual rampant spam all over their platforms. And there is practically <i>zero</i> recourse unless you know someone internally, like I mentioned.<p>It&#x27;s not even just their spam &quot;moderation,&quot; their content moderation (which is automated) is hilariously inconsistent and poor. It is utterly weird the way they hide&#x2F;derank posts and comments on instagram and which content they decide to promote. You could like, let your users decide what they want to see and read, but that is clearly not the goal.<p>Lots of problems this company has the resources and knowledge to solve, they simply do not want to. There is no other explanation. Customer service being what it is is just a symptom of a much larger, systemic problem.<p>I do believe social media is a blight on society and I don&#x27;t really care so much one way or another about my account, but if Meta is trying to be what it says it is trying to be, they are completely off the mark and this is just one of a long series of examples.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40741555" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40741555" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wmf</span><span>|</span><a href="#40743229">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40741691">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40741555">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40741555">[17 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s ridiculous that this is necessary but I salute people for using the legal system instead of just feeling helpless.</div><br/><div id="40742166" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40742166" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">photonthug</span><span>|</span><a href="#40741555">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40741635">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40742166">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40742166">[14 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just to actually say what is probably obvious.. this means that corporations have found a way to outsource the costs of providing customer support to the tax paying general public, including those who are not even using their services and never heard of the company.<p>Ag’s should not be requesting that this is fixed, but requiring it in no uncertain terms, and giving out massive penalties for every single time it’s allowed to happen.

Last year YT started sending emails that channels with inactive accounts will start being deleted. So I have been working on logging on my channel account which is a Google ID tied to an email on my own domain (startingupinamerica.com) on which I still get emails. I still have the correct password to this Google ID, and 2FA was never enabled.<p>Google will not let me log in, as they insist on sending a verification code to a phone number I no longer own since years ago. Support requests keep sending me to a guide&#x2F;process that will repeat the same thing again and again and that if I don&#x27;t have any option that&#x27;s that. All I get are the emails that &quot;someone is trying to access your account&quot; when I try to login.<p>I have been wondering what is the resolution in this case, it seems it&#x27;s either know-someone or going to court (and risk getting banned?).</div><br/><div id="40746281" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40746281" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">qingcharles</span><span>|</span><a href="#40743456">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40741781">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40746281">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40746281">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m in the same situation.

So they decided to make passports and contracted a 3rd party who would provide and charge the customer for customer service.<p>To me this seems like a reasonable option for massive free services as well.

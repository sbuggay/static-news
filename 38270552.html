One distills information from a training set into a compressed representation, and the other generates a compressed representation that yields (more or less) fixed state space attractors. It&#x27;s just inducing a bias over the state space of the network, nothing incredibly special, though I&#x27;d consider the initial stage of training to be the most important, as it is responsible for all of the ingest of all of the embedded information the network will be using during autoregressive inference (especially w.r.t. the context of doing so during longer generations).<p>So the notion of &#x27;in context learning&#x27; is one I find to be a bit of an illusion, of course, as no actual learning is being done, just the induction of biases, which appears to give rise to a transiently-&#x27;better trained&#x27; network.<p>You could see this as a bit straightforward perhaps, but I feel it needs to be said.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38274322" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38274322" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Grimblewald</span><span>|</span><a href="#38272112">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38272309">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38272415">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38274322">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38274322">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">While red is the apple is not a correct logical statment using conventional understanding of each term, it is still an understandable english sentence, a structure which likely pops up a fair bit.

The point of the reversal curse argument (I guess) is that it should be able to learn the reverse relationship from entirely other examples [1], but seemingly is not.<p>1. That is, the LLM should be able to learn that âA is son of B who is femaleâ implies that âB is mother of Aâ, regardless of who A and B is. It should then be able to apply this pattern to A = âTom Cruiseâ and B = âMary Lee Pfeifferâ and deduce âMary Lee Pfeiffer is the mother of Tom Cruiseâ <i>without even a single example</i>.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38274317" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38274317" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Applejinx</span><span>|</span><a href="#38274337">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38271914">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38274317">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38274317">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is great work.

That doesn&#x27;t mean it will be more intelligent, but it seems reasonable to infer that the LLM can have a broader base of association to draw from, where we as humans tend to be restricted to associations from our own experience.

Hell, we saw the same things in RNNs, we see it in classic autoregressive models, and so on. But it definitely isn&#x27;t how humans encode information because if you had all 3 pieces of knowledge (you know who Tom Cruse is, you know who Mary Pfieffer is, and you know the relation between Mary and Tom is mom&#x2F;son) then your ability to recall is (nearly) invariant to the ordering.

It is not a very good way to go about studying &quot;how __LLMs__ work&quot; and is rather &quot;how does GPT work at this particular moment in time and aggregating all these unknowns?&quot; There&#x27;s some bitter sweetness because I do like that GPT is free but it feels like a major edge that they have is that the community just does a lot of free research for them and in ways where they can better interpret results than the people who performed the experiments in the first place. I really do believe that academic works shouldn&#x27;t be focusing on proprietary and dynamic methods. It&#x27;s fine to include them in results (and preferably added post review to avoid identity spoilage (or we openly acknowledge that double blind is a joke)) but I&#x27;d rather most researchers focusing on the general concepts and with the ability to dive down the rabbit hole than playing a wack-a-mole game.<p>Also, I&#x27;d totally love it if more research papers were instead blog posts. Kudos to anyone posting their research on blogs, academic or not (I don&#x27;t care about your creds, your real creds are your work). Papers are about communicating with fellow scientists, right?

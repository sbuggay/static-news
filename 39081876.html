You just end up with this giant icebox of stuff you&#x27;ll never do. If a big new prospect demands one of the ideas that&#x27;s in the icebox be implemented immediately in order to close a deal, you&#x27;re probably still not going to pull it out of the icebox, because you don&#x27;t remember that it&#x27;s there. Instead, you&#x27;ll just create a new ticket for it, and eventually when going through the icebox, someone will go &quot;hey, I think we built this already&quot; and close as dupe.<p>Instead, I strongly prefer to have tickets that at least have some possibility of getting done in the short to medium term, and store other ideas elsewhere. Engineering keeps a list of tech debt that they&#x27;d like to address. PMs keep one list per project of possible improvements. For potential new features&#x2F;products, they write PRDs but don&#x27;t immediately turn them into a bunch of tickets.<p>Ultimately I think the giant backlog of stuff that mostly won&#x27;t get addressed is a sign of weak PMs who are afraid to say no and like to fall back to the comfortable answer that is, &quot;sounds interesting, I&#x27;ll write a ticket for it.&quot;</div><br/><div id="39099158" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39099158" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">doix</span><span>|</span><a href="#39097158">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39097518">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39099158">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39099158">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I totally agree. The worst thing is going directly from feedback -&gt; ticket. Not only because of what you describe, but also because you end up with a product that is just a list of features without a coherent &quot;idea&quot;. Especially when you&#x27;ve got eager developers that will see some slack in the schedule and just pick up a random ticket because it&#x27;s &quot;easy&quot;.<p>Usually when customers give feedback it&#x27;s to address an immediate need they have, so they&#x27;ll suggest adding a button&#x2F;option&#x2F;toggle&#x2F;whatever. And that&#x27;s fine, but if you do that for every piece of feedback, you&#x27;ll end up with an unusable mess. Especially because it&#x27;s usually very easy to add that one extra button&#x2F;option&#x2F;toggle.<p>You usually require someone to go through all the feedback and try to address the root cause of what they&#x27;re asking for.

ProductBoard has a CRM approach where you make a note of every customer interaction (call, meeting, email, support ticket, etc), and later you can break down the customer interaction into needs and wishes. So initially all you have is a list of customer interactions.<p>Jira Product Discovery starts with an idea. So if you want to keep track of everything you hear from your customers, you&#x27;re forced to immediately break this down into a long list of all wishes and needs.<p>Benefit of Jira Product Discovery is that it keeps this long list of ideas out of the developer backlog, but it&#x27;s yet another long list. You can connect Jira Product Discovery Ideas later to Jira epics and stories, so delivery is easier to track.<p>ProductBoard is the better product discovery tool if you want to analyze product priorities based on customer conversations.

</code></pre>
I&#x27;m not completely disagreeing with you as this has been my experience, in the past, too.  Here&#x27;s how it&#x27;s usually worked if it&#x27;s taken long-term.  Initially, if it&#x27;s been a while, oh man: the backlog <i>explodes</i>.  But more likely, you&#x27;re in a place like me where you check in with your customers at somewhat regular intervals and, maybe, you know when &quot;Bob&#x27;s Widgets&quot; is going to be checked in with because every time you call Bob, he reads you a ten page list of tiny little fscking details that make you want to reach through the phone and tell Bob there are <i>other</i> customers waiting on <i>Heart Transplants</i> and his little paper cut can wait.<p>Or maybe you aren&#x27;t the one who calls Bob, but someone from Sales, or Customer Support is the one who calls Bob, so now you don&#x27;t just have a back-log, you&#x27;ve got two panicked people who are <i>sure</i> Bob is going to take his business elsewhere.<p>First, Bob&#x27;s easy.  Bob cares about <i>all of those little things</i> but most of the time, Bob&#x27;s not stupid.  He&#x27;s fully aware what&#x27;s important and what&#x27;s not, the reason he brings you the whole list is because he thinks that will get your attention better than it did when he brought up his &quot;critical feature&quot; that got sidelined.  If you don&#x27;t sell to thousands and thousands of customers, but hundreds with a tens of <i>really important ones</i>, and Bob&#x27;s one of them, the problem is failing to apply empathy to the Bob problem.  Personally, I love these guys because they&#x27;re usually very easy to placate.  Usually Bob&#x27;s list has 100 things on it, 99 of which are solved with the same four lines of code, one of which is a horrible pain in the ass.  Usually at the beginning of the conversation, all 100 are important, but after you finish 99 of them, sometimes Bob doesn&#x27;t even <i>notice</i> the one that&#x27;s missing, he&#x27;s too <i>shocked</i> that not only did <i>one</i> thing get fixed, but his list is <i>gone</i>!  Call Bob in a week to follow up; if you haven&#x27;t been neglecting him too long, ... he&#x27;s got one or two bullets or nothing at all.<p>But for all the others, yeah, the backlog will grow ... initially.  If you keep following up, and keep reaching out, though -- you&#x27;ll find your customers are on your back less because they <i>know you know what you need to do and they know you&#x27;re working on it.</i>  Over time, it becomes easier to temper expectations, you have fewer emergencies, things get scheduled more consistently and the backlog ... <i>eventually</i> starts to shrink again.  Your customers not only have limits on the things they want&#x2F;need out of your application, they also complain less and less feverishly about the things that do irritate them because it&#x27;s &quot;just the one button that&#x27;s wonky&quot; and not a thousand little paper-cuts of things that just don&#x27;t seem to work like they should.<p>And yes, always listen to the customers&#x2F;never build what they ask for ... except ... that&#x27;s only good advice in very specific circumstances.  If <i>you know your customer&#x27;s needs better than your customer does</i> than that&#x27;s the <i>best</i> advice you can take.  For everyone else, &quot;always listen to your customers until you understand it precisely on their terms&quot; then start asking them questions to understand why it is they&#x27;re asking for the thing they&#x27;re asking for.  The problem with the &quot;the customer doesn&#x27;t know what they need&quot; premise is that if you dismiss what they&#x27;re asking for and the thing you produce doesn&#x27;t fit &quot;the thing they were trying to accomplish by asking for that&quot; <i>everybody</i> loses.  Sometimes, hell <i>often</i>, you&#x27;re better off giving the customer exactly what they asked for than missing the mark by even a small amount <i>even if</i> you provide something substantially better.  What you end up with is &quot;a cool feature that nobody wants because your customer really did just want the &#x27;print to PDF&#x27; button because of some archaic fax workflow you were unaware of&quot; (or insert some other weird example).<p>I&#x27;m not poking fun&#x2F;chiding here -- I give the same advice to others <i>all the time</i>, but it&#x27;s easy to forget that &quot;you can&#x27;t tell the customer what they want if you don&#x27;t talk to your customers&quot; :)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39100069" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39100069" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nox101</span><span>|</span><a href="#39097966">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39096762">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39100069">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39100069">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; How you think people use your app is different than how they use it

I have always run as a small org or just me, on one or two self-contained products. But isn&#x27;t there a standard view on separately logging two VERY different things? I.e. tracking of customer reported problems, vs. tracking of potential solution work?<p>#1. Customer reported problems&#x2F;desires, with a focus on a particular customer&#x27;s pain, their viewpoint on solutions, etc.<p>A long back log of #1 customer pain points makes sense to me, especially if you can link new ones to related old ones, and review them in order of urgency, recency, magnitude of customer pain and number of related incidents.<p>Groups of related pain points could even be triaged as rationale&#x27;s for potential new adjacent products, as apposed to potential feature work. Without getting into any design work.<p>#2. Feature work tickets, filled out with rich info on what wide-spread or critical customer problem has been selected to be solved. How it fits into the business plan, product plan, development schedule and design plan etc.<p>This seems like a list that should be kept relatively small. A backlog of #2 feature to-do&#x27;s suggest a lot of wasted initial&#x2F;pre design work, on problems that never reached a critical level or product fit. Also designs without serious development plans quickly turn into useless busy work.<p>This separation also allows list #1 to be managed by customer relationship roles, and list #2 by product planning roles. With coordination as problems get prioritized for product planning treatment.<p>--<p>Spit balling and looking for feedback!

In my experience, <i>frequent</i> check-backs with the customer -- and planning those &quot;detours of development to make something visible&quot; or &quot;prioritizing this with a fake back-end to make something visible&quot; (which we may do anyway if we have front-end&#x2F;back-end working simultaneously) -- I find the most useful parts of working this way have nothing to do with the usual Agile Suspects[1].<p>My observations come from the lens of being employed by a few companies where I was a Senior developer with one or two Mid&#x2F;Junior levels designing all or a major part of a product for a third-party (usually IoT or fully digital product someone paid us to design&#x2F;develop).  This may not apply to &quot;I make a SaaS product I sell to customers&quot; because of the closeness of working with them, but some of them likely do:<p>(1) Willingness of the customer to engage in regular communication is (anecdotally -- my observed) biggest factor to success.  Ya know what, sometimes it <i>doesn&#x27;t even matter</i>, either.  I did three jobs for an oil company everybody&#x27;s heard of, paid for via consulting dollars given to them by Microsoft.  They met with us about five times for three products with the vision being to roll out one of them to &quot;every employee except for the clerks&quot; and the rest back-end to the complete appropriate environment.  All three were met with praise and brought us <i>future work</i>.  Not one of the three was deployed beyond test capacity (of the something-ungodly-like &quot;150,000 user licenses&quot; they paid for, we logged all of ten, it was sad).<p>(2) If they are unwilling, or you suspect they are dis-engaged, meet with &quot;your contact over at the company&quot; and have an off-the-record (but you know it&#x27;s not) careful conversation to discover the reason for the dis-engagement.  We were straight-up told &quot;Oh, no, they do this all the time.  They <i>have</i> to spend the consulting dollars.&quot; Emphasis provided verbally but never explained.  It was said as though it could have been finished off with &quot;or they will be fired&quot; -- despite that being absurd; that was the level of intensity.  Sometimes, though, you find out that <i>you&#x27;re not listening</i> (or in a larger forum, they&#x27;re not willing to tell you what the elephant in the room is) and it might be the only opportunity you have to fix it.  A past product I botched pretty well had this issue.  I had a customer become disengaged on a product I was working -- up to the point of actually shopping the product to another company half-way through.  There&#x27;s a lot lost in the detail, but it came down to them paying us to develop a product with the assumption that they&#x27;d have total control over the layout of the data in the database (despite not mentioning it, nor it being specified in any useful way in our contract).  Unfortunately, the product had about one way it could be laid out in the database -- and it wasn&#x27;t a way this unsophisticated customer would be able to just run a few simple SELECT queries on.  Or, that&#x27;s what I thought the problem was.  Once I rang up their &quot;one terribly abused IT guy&quot;, and exchanged a few war stories from my work history, I said &quot;What&#x27;s up with Tom trying to force this ridiculous schema down our throat?&quot;  He laughed and said &quot;The money they budgeted for the project covers everything except the admin tool and Tom knows he&#x27;ll never grasp your Schema well enough to write it himself[2].&quot;  They&#x27;d been telling us they&#x27;d pay a second invoice for the Administration tool and this was confirmation that was out, which I&#x27;d already scoffed at but this was absolute confirmation.  I wish I could say we did the right thing with the information and it all worked out but, unfortunately (and this was out of my control), nothing was done with it.<p>(3) Frequent communication leads to higher engagement which leads to the feeling of partial ownership.  I saw this at two shops -- one where we had almost no competitors developing against the APIs we were experts at -- we were expensive, so customers became invested in the success of the final product.  They were engaged because &quot;if it failed, they might not have jobs.&quot;  But the other shop was unique.  We provided a service that, on the surface, looks a lot like a whole lot of other things, including things sold by Microsoft.  But the product was designed targeting three, specific, narrow verticals.  These verticals, for at least two huge brands, had nothing that really met their needs so our pitch was &quot;we&#x27;ll make a version of our product designed for your company with you.&quot;  And we did.  We responded to every little detail asked down to ensuring the buttons&#x2F;other things looked like every other internal web app they used, branded in a manner that completely hid that it was a SaaS product we sold with another name or that there was another company involved.  But we knew <i>every single big brand had a department that does this</i> even if they <i>hire a whole other company to manage the majority of it</i>.  So we ensured the contracts allowed for us to re-brand and re-sell it to every one of their competitors (and because of the product, it ends up <i>benefiting them</i> if the other company is as successful as they are).  Fast forward a few years, and those two companies have been purchased three times over, almost ended up becoming one, and each time the question of &quot;Should we get rid of Super-App?&quot; wasn&#x27;t just &quot;No&quot;, but met with stories from the department head of &quot;How it was a short meeting after they heard from me and (the three other folks we built it with).&quot;  They continue to pay the yearly renewals and work with us to develop out more things every few months.  We&#x27;ve re-done this with the other verticals to the point of &quot;we&#x27;ve captured all of the low hanging fruit in that vertical&quot; to &quot;we are a very competitive product in that vertical&quot; but where we&#x27;re deployed, our customers <i>love</i> the product.  Those <i>early</i> customers feel actual <i>loss</i> when people talk about replacing it because they feel like they had a part in its creation.<p>(4) Frequent communication means you actually understand what your customers are saying.  The biggest problem with talking to customers is they ask for things that have nothing to do with what they want to accomplish.  &quot;Can I save that to a PDF file?&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;I want to print it in a consistent format?&quot; &quot;I can put a print button on the page that will do that?&quot;  Customers get hung up on specifics of what they want driven by limits of what they believe things can do.  If I had a dollar for every time a customer was surprised it was easy to do something &quot;that, I&#x27;m fairly certain I could make work in IE 6 with a little effort.&quot;  That&#x27;s not a &quot;har har, the customer iz stupiDZ&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;that&#x27;s not their job&quot;, &quot;that&#x27;s mine.&quot;  But they&#x27;re trying to translate a little of what they&#x27;re asking into &quot;Software Development Shop&quot; because to explain it to you in their language, you better know a whole lot about manufacturing headlight bulbs (or whatever), and you&#x27;re trying to translate everything into headlight bulbs.  Over time you understand each other&#x27;s languages and know when to say &quot;... wait a minute, are you trying to ...?&quot; with results that work out a little better than Clippy.<p>[0] Let&#x27;s pick the topics: &quot;Anything in the category of project management, scrum, agile&quot;, and the &quot;Customer&#x27;s Don&#x27;t Know What They Want&quot; (aka Listening to the Customer Results in Features They Don&#x27;t Use(tm)), the &quot;Startup Advice Doesn&#x27;t Apply Outside of Startups&quot; ... but that has nothing to do with what I wanted to say.<p>[1] Building the product this way ensures that the customer and you are on the same page with what the end result should actually be.  Nothing explains how it&#x27;s going to work than a UI that kind of does some of the things the working thing will do.<p>[2] I did inquire why &quot;internal IT Dynamo&quot;, who I knew was a programmer from outside circles, wasn&#x27;t being forced to write it.  He said &quot;I told them I&#x27;d quit.&quot;  It sucked because I was <i>so proud</i> of this design -- it performed brilliantly despite being 6th normal form for 3 tables and <i>it actually had to be 6th normal form</i> to do what I was trying to do.  Even better, because it&#x27;s such a bitch working with that data, I put instead of update&#x2F;insert&#x2F;delete triggers on a set of views so &quot;if you wanted to screw with it in SQL Management Studio&quot;, go ahead, all enforced by simple constraints, 1&#x2F;4 the code that was ultimately required by the customer&#x27;s insisted-upon design but -- importantly -- didn&#x27;t grow table data exponentially for every configuration added resulting in the whole system falling down after setting up about ten configurable products.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39100541" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39100541" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DeathArrow</span><span>|</span><a href="#39099111">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39100541">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39100541">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Instead of spending time planning and concocting roadmaps, replace that activity by talking to current or potential customers on how their lives can be improved, and letting that determine your next feature.<p>There are countless other articles claiming that customers don&#x27;t know what they want.

I still miss the style of learning. Can you imagine going deep on a topic for 50 minutes then switching? AP classes got double periods. I found it so refreshing and I learned a ton.<p>Eg, science, math, study hall, lunch, Spanish, History, Art, English… in a single day?<p>I loved it. What worked for me was studying for tests — and the harder the classes you took, the less homework there was (or it wasn’t required). I had a great history teacher, occasionally good math &amp; English teachers, a great art teacher, and mediocre science teachers. The science TEXTBOOKS were fabulous — you could just read through those things and become a genius.<p>No more textbooks these days — it’s all some pdf segment to download. Bummer for my kids.<p>These days, there are way fewer tests, so my kids always freak when they have tests. I thought tests were great! Just one focused period to perform and then move on. Homework and projects were a big problem for me, because I could never start early enough — it was always a last minute dash. Maybe that trained me to produce fast output, though.<p>Kids were sometimes awful, but there was no way I was going to be popular so I just did my nerd thing. There were enough of us.<p>They had a great drama program which I loved — I did every play and musical I could. And they even had a speech and debate club — so I competed at “extemporaneous” speech—when I went to state competitions, they got the students all together to clap me out like they’d do for the football team. That was unnecessary and funny for the nerd.<p>My kids don’t get these kinds of opportunities, I fear. I was pretty lucky.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42708385" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42708385" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dijit</span><span>|</span><a href="#42708855">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42706606">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42708385">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42708385">[21 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">OK I guess I’m going to go against the deluge of comments here; And give an appreciable reason instead of denigrating those who might choose this.<p>The context, though, I am British. I grew up in Britain. I went to British school.<p>I can’t speak universally about my experience, (even within all of Britain), because it’s my experience which is in one small area of the country.<p>However, school, for me, was by far the single worst mandatory system I have been exposed to in my life. For the entirety of my young life, school was a prison. With inmates who would beat you, Emotionally abuse you, the “wardens” did not want to be there either, and did not care how the other inmates treated you… sometimes doubling down on the behaviour themselves. - The comparison is further solidified by 6-foot galvanised steel bars surrounding the complex, and that I visited an actual psychiatric prison not long after and the cafeteria, recreational grounds, rooms, etc; were <i>identical</i> to those of my school.<p>Education? You probably mean repeating exercises in rote? You likely mean memorisation? That’s not education.<p>It took becoming an adult to learn for myself that I <i>enjoyed learning</i>. My school was not learning, Everything that got me through school was things that my mother taught me- And as a consequence, I was always top of my class.<p>I find it hard to think of school as anything more than forced internment for children while their parents go to work, with exercises designed to keep you busy more than to give a functional understanding. I would not be surprised if this feeling is shared among many of my generation and social class, the endless chasing of metrics has made even the tiniest amount of joy that could exist in school- Non-existent.<p>and for those saying it was good for socialisation with other children- The ostracised, are learning to be helpless and to be victims- They are not learning to “socialise” more. If anything it is probably more harmful for those people to be exposed to more people until they’ve had time to form on their own.</div><br/><div id="42708606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42708606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">globalise83</span><span>|</span><a href="#42708385">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42708500">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42708606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42708606">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The kind of school you went to sounds very different from the grammar school that my working-class father went to in the 1960s and that helped him escape a life of asbestos-breathing drudgery in moribund shipyards.</div><br/><div id="42708642" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42708642" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dijit</span><span>|</span><a href="#42708385">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42708606">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42708500">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42708642">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42708642">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For non-british readers; state-funded Grammar schools famously, were abolished.<p>(I’m being downvoted, but this just objective fact, and something my grandfather brings up commonly).</div><br/><div id="42708673" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42708673" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">simonbarker87</span><span>|</span><a href="#42708385">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42708642">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42708500">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42708673">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42708673">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No they weren’t.

There have been major advances throughout society in every area: medicine, nutrition, sanitation, manufacturing, electricity, refrigeration, printing, computing, telecommunications… the list goes on and on and on. Some of these things contributed major improvements to the average person.<p>Advances in medicine and nutrition, for example, contributed to sharp declines in early childhood mortality and morbidity. Advances in reproductive health care (along with everything else) led to huge declines in birth rates. Smaller families have more resources and attention available for each child.<p>Other advances had less of an impact but still add up when combined. Widespread access to refrigeration improved nutrition and reduced spoilage, allowing increased consumption of meat. More meat means taller, stronger, healthier children.<p>On the other hand, schooling hasn’t improved all that much in 150 years. You can find lots of writing samples and old exams for schools from back then. The bigger difference is that children stay in school much longer and have less need to rapidly enter the workforce in order to support the family.

As far as the person in Mississippi is concerned, they are living the dream.<p>The opportunity to improve your standard of living in e.g. Europe pales in comparison to the opportunity to do so in the US.

Not sure why the district would put up with that. Expulsion works.  I&#x27;ve never heard a story like this and we&#x27;ve been in the district for 8+ years.<p>As for skills, my kids are probably 3 years ahead of where I was at the same age. Devices are not a huge component of their schooling, although I am on a parent board that&#x27;s pushing back on SaaS creep. They&#x27;re forced to have Google accounts which I&#x27;m proposing to remove and&#x2F;or minimize.  Math and reading programs are fantastic.  Teachers are great. There have been one or two mediocre teachers but nothing to really complain about.<p>We also have great private options, but again, we moved to this district to take advantage of the public schools.<p>As an observation the homeschooled kids that participate in extracurricular activities along with the public school kids are definitely behind.  Not only from a traditional education standpoint, but also social skills.  It&#x27;s always an awkward conversation when those parents engage in a conversation asking where our kids are at with respect to reading, math or science.<p>Our goal is to have our kids be the best version of them that they can be.  If they&#x27;re happier, healthier and better equipped than we were then I&#x27;ll be happy. I look at a lot of parents who want their kids to be stars and it&#x27;s painful.

No tolerance? What about a bullying victim who sticks up for themselves? Playground scuffle?

In some areas, school choice where you can choose from another of the available public options may be viable too.<p>The only long term solution here that has potential to fix things legislatively is a true school voucher program that would let you take the tax money assigned for your kids education and put it into whatever option you believed was actually best for their education.<p>This _should_ lead to a start-up like small business ecosystem with lots of small Montessori style schools especially for younger kids. Most likely a &quot;neighborhood schools&quot; model would pop up and parents would end up walking their kids to school again, even in suburban areas.<p>Most likely you would still see bigger options for high school still as teenagers crave more socialization.

These are not the same.<p>The former tends to replicate school and requires a teacher, usually a parent. It’s basically school with added&#x2F;paced&#x2F;altered&#x2F;enriched curriculum at the cost of socialization, although that can be compensated with other forms of peer groups, especially in urban area. Comparing this method versus school A or school B is pretty much like comparing school A and B as two schools can be as different as any given school and homeschool.<p>The latter is what John Holt referred to as homeschooling but is based on self-determination theory and has an abundance of science to support it. Neuroscience backs this theory too, I think the rate at which active learning learns is somewhere around x20 faster than passive learning (ie “teaching”). Very serious folks like John Holt, Peter Gray, or Akilah Richards to name a few have dedicated their life work to supporting self-directed education as a superior form of education. What Peter Gray’s research shows shows is that outcomes are basically the same except for life satisfaction and psychological outcomes. In essence, it leads to same rates of secondary education, jobs and socio-economical outcomes, except an unschooled child makes for a much happier adult later on.<p>Sadly, because the majority of people went through contemporary schooling or some version of it, people’s biases makes people not want to hear this.<p>I’m not sure what the OP’s  circle looks like but I would be surprised if none of those so called “techs pro-homeschooling” are only doing the school at home version without having stumbled upon any of the science around self-directed.</div><br/><div id="42707979" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42707979" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">presentation</span><span>|</span><a href="#42707897">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42708128">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42707979">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42707979">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Can you cite some of these claims, to guide someone like myself who has never heard of any of these things?</div><br/><div id="42708130" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42708130" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jstoiko</span><span>|</span><a href="#42707897">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42707979">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42708128">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42708130">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42708130">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.self-directed.org&#x2F;resources&#x2F;research" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.self-directed.org&#x2F;resources&#x2F;research</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42708128" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42708128" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">whyenot</span><span>|</span><a href="#42707897">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42707979">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42699237">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42708128">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42708128">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; abundance of science to support it<p>A few citations would be helpful.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42699237" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42699237" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jazzyjackson</span><span>|</span><a href="#42707897">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42706338">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42699237">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42699237">[15 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Homeschooling is seeing a surge in popularity, its not just tech people or high status people.<p>IME it&#x27;s a lack of trust, sending your kids to be raised by strangers.

I would expect the average parent to be FAR more effective just based on that care.</div><br/><div id="42708121" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42708121" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">presentation</span><span>|</span><a href="#42699355">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42707149">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42706904">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42708121">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42708121">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But good teachers can make a huge difference, it&#x27;s a shame identifying them is a black art and so few people get that access.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42706904" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42706904" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">giarc</span><span>|</span><a href="#42699355">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42708624">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42706904">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42706904">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I feel like there should be a different word for those that &quot;home school&quot; their child by hiring a private teacher and they learn in the house.

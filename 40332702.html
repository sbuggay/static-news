It’s pretty obvious that quora has a strange culture of know-it-alls trying to show off, but this AI product makes it clear that the act of showing off <i>is the product</i>. The answers are garbage and they obviously don’t care. The key action for sale is not finding an answer, but writing it.<p>What’s really interesting is that Quora product team decided they wanted to juice engagement with fake AI created posts, and real humans are complying to answer them. Questions that make no sense, and no human asked. Quora is proving (again) that people will engage in parasocial behavior with LLMs. We’ve seen AI girlfriends and companions, we’ve seen tutors, and knowledge assistants. This is the opportunity to brag - artificial students (likely cut from the same API as those tutors).<p>I can only assume that question-answering-users are the real market they advertise to, profitably. This would imply that this strategy is profitable or could be profitable for them. The nice thing about this compared to more personalized LLM companions like AI girlfriends is that the inference costs can be distributed across all users by sharing the questions. I would posit that there exists an opportunity to make a Twitter or Reddit clone that explicitly intermixed bots. Maybe even exclusively bots. People want to talk on the internet and told they’re special. The interaction doesn’t need to be organic.<p>For proof, look at all the top-level comments on this HN post with no engagement, by users who have repeated the same pattern discussed about quora.</div><br/><div id="40333042" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40333042" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">weinzierl</span><span>|</span><a href="#40333017">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40332856">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40333042">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40333042">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&quot;I would posit that there exists an opportunity to make a Twitter or Reddit clone that explicitly intermixed bots.

I remember a time back when you would get a Quora result on a search query and you could click on it be find a few answers with comments on them to help you determine their merits.<p>This is completely anecdotal, but these days I honestly can’t even find the answer if I click on a Quora result on a search engine. Instead I’m created by “similar” questions and what not in an UI I don’t really understand too well. Now, I was never a Quora user, as in, I never signed up for an account. So I’m probably not in their target audience. With their modern entry point, however, I’ve simply banned their domain from my search results along with sites like Pinterest because they are essential just a wasted of time if I accidentally hit their sites.<p>Maybe that doesn’t matter. I would have probably never signed up to actually answer things, or even ask, but if anyone who would be potential user is like me. Then they won’t ever get to the “onboarding” process of joining the site, and I’d wager that was more damaging than AI. LLM’s are more akin to the final nail in the coffin for a lot of these sites who have made it so user hostile to join their “communities”. Again, it’s just anecdotal, I’ve done or read no research. But I do think that it’s interesting that we’re now at a point where many people will include “Reddit” in their search queries when looking for answers, and Reddit is the easiest side in the world to join or even read without signing in (at least old.reddit is).</div><br/></div></div><div id="40332877" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40332877" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway4233</span><span>|</span><a href="#40332856">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40332809">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40332877">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40332877">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">From my point of view the underlying problem here seems to be that someone in Quora product team feels that the best way to drive engagement is to predict what the user might want to know about and then spam them with it, rather than letting them discover on their own or use their feedback.<p>I stopped using Quora 8 or 9 years back, because despite how much time I spent curating the feed I was served, the questions always seemed to veer back into the questions on life experiences, `write a short story in 3 lines` or about relationships. This was most probably due to topics like these being a fad in India during the time and often received a lot of answers or upvotes.<p>Every time I marked an question as something I was not interested in, because of the topic, Quora assumed that I did not like the author&#x27;s answer and then proceeded to show 5 other questions the author has responded to. I assumed it was because of some bug on their side ignoring my preferences of topics, until I spent a week in Dubai and saw most of the questions in my feed match the topics I marked as interested.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40332809" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40332809" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">trickleup</span><span>|</span><a href="#40332877">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40332794">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40332809">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40332809">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Quora did a plenty good job of ruining itself, way before AI did.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40332794" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40332794" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">umbra07</span><span>|</span><a href="#40332809">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40332943">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40332794">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40332794">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">On a seperate note, why do people feel the need to exaggerate their Quora profile&#x2F;education level&#x2F;accomplishments?

I really dislike how you open one question and it sort of mixes in answers to different questions. New reddit UI does something similar.</div><br/><div id="40333018" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40333018" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ulrikrasmussen</span><span>|</span><a href="#40332817">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40332872">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40333086">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40333018">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40333018">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Engagement optimization. 5% of users might happen to see something that will keep them on the site, but 95% are confused and waste their time.

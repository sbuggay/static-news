In this case, you could be more aggressive in either direction of pushing BG, because you have a safety net.<p>Because this feels like a holy grail &#x2F; functional cure, I&#x27;m surprised the incredible DIY teams out there haven&#x27;t trained their guns on doing this.

It could technically be done in a straightforward way using two independently controlled insulin pumps, but the complexity and risk of the whole operation goes way up if you are taking way more insulin.  Taking a bunch of insulin and glucagon at the same time is not necessarily a great idea either - they don&#x27;t just annihilate each other without consequence and you could end up with secondary effects like gaining a bunch of weight.<p>&gt;Because this feels like a holy grail &#x2F; functional cure<p>Unfortunately it is not; even dual hormone systems have problems keeping up w&#x2F; the kinetics of glucose absorption and to address this there is also research into tri-hormonal systems, w&#x2F; amylin as the third hormone. In any case you will still need some a-priori info about meals and planned activities, though less so than with a single hormone system. Integration of exogenous data sources to provide this info to the APS is what we are working on at Replica.<p>Also, hate to be the bearer of bad news but beta bionics has shelved their dual hormone ambitions for now; their prototype device soon to be released is insulin-only.

A PID controller continuously calculates an error value e(t) as the difference between a desired setpoint (SP) and a measured process variable (PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D respectively), hence the name.&quot;<p>Getting PID control loops to work has a lot of research behind it, but it&#x27;s still hard to get right with new hardware.

For type 1 diabetics there are three important ones:<p>1. Time in severe hypoglycemia - ideally 0%<p>2. Time in severe hyperglycemia&#x2F;diabetic ketoacidosis - ideally 0%<p>3. Time in euglycemia (also called time in target) - clinical target is &gt;70% and for reference the median healthy non-diabetic is in target ~90-95% of the time.<p>Closed loop systems are very good at #1 and #2 as it takes a while for levels to get to the severe state and insulin can be administered (or withheld) based on CGM.<p>When we talk about algorithming out of meal announcements it&#x27;s whether historical patient-specific blood glucose levels and insulin administrations (i.e. a prediction of what you eat and when) combined with CGM can keep #3 acceptable, not necessarily optimal. Medtronic is using this approach and their newest model more or less eliminates the need for accurate carb-counting but they still require meal announcements. The hope&#x2F;idea is that this can potentially be eliminated in further iterations.<p>Another important thing to keep in mind which is sometimes lost in these discussions is that we don&#x27;t treat numbers we treat patients (i.e. what are the clinical outcomes). Generally speaking, we assume the closer to normal the better but we don&#x27;t have actual data about how much an extra X% outside of target ranges matters in terms of clinical outcomes and complication rates. We only really started getting this data with CGM and complications in these mild states would require very large cohorts and long (10-20 year) follow-ups to detect differences as they&#x27;re likely to also be mild.<p>So while you&#x27;re absolutely correct regarding the limitations and that an algorithm cannot outperform accurate carb-counting and meal announcements the missing piece is that it may be sufficient.

The three low tech &quot;hacks&quot; I&#x27;ve been happy with are the following. First I take a sublingual Melatonin most nights, Melatonin upregulates the insulin receptors and lowers my insulin requirements about 40% by my guess. The second one is dietary I add olive oil to my lunch and dinner, I feel this provides my body a reserve of non glucose energy. Finally I use a very small dose of cannabis most days, I like to get a puff or two and night, THC protects nerve cells from Hypoxia so I feel this keeps my brain cells going when my blood sugar gets low. I feel these three things, give me a leg up on my long term blood sugar control. I am thankful there are hackers and diy opensource initiatives. The CGM readers here in America Dexcom, and Libre both have crazy bad user interfaces. Libre will only let you pair to a single device, I had their device fail leaving a functional sensor in my arm, a quick idea I searched for opensource libre reader app and found two. One worked and started reading the sensor. Dexcom has the issue of being a 10 day use cycle so you run out on varying days of the week. Both take the FDA mandate to have low blood sugar alarms as a blank check to overide any controls about sound or do not disturb to bother about countdown to a new sensor. I liked that external libre2 reader as it was the only device or official app that can be silenced, but their rigid only pair with one device still angers me, what if my loved one want&#x27;s to be able to scan my sensor? Low blood sugars are challenging as they affect my brain and I can answer an amazing amount of questions about my blood sugar wrong if I get too low, my brain trying to preserve energy can be dangerous at times. This was an issue more before CGM. Dexcom decides that it is OK to have a completely automatic warning at any hour of the night &quot;your sensor will expire in six hours!!!&quot;, that warning has little to do with my care as it is too late to influence refill compliance and seems to have been ordered by the executives to some how improve their pRofItiBiLiTY. I am so much happier on a third party app with the silent reader as an extra. Sorry if this was long winded, being insulin dependent has bee a challenge over 40 years. The first 10 years they hadn&#x27;t figured out that insulin reactions are much more subtle on human insulin than the older pig and cow derived ones were.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37323578" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37323578" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gustavus</span><span>|</span><a href="#37323296">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37323743">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37323566">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37323578">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37323578">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So my wife is a type 1er.

Several trials[1-3] dating back several years have looked at &quot;bionic pancreas&quot; or a closed loop bihormonal system.<p>Inreda (a Dutch company) has a CE-marked device[4] that can be clinically used but one limitation has been glucagon stability (has to be replenished daily). Tandem in the US was working on this as well but I haven&#x27;t heard anything about them in a while, not sure how far along they are.<p>The Inreda product is still in the early stages of testing but fully functional. Small crossover trials seem promising (defined by more time in euglycemic state).<p>There is a competing approach with &quot;intelligent insulin&quot; or a self-regulating glucose sensitive insulin formulation that has different bioavailability depending on circulating glucose levels rather than relying on a monitor, this is farther out from clinical use.<p>One of the reasons bihormonal pumps haven&#x27;t entered mainstream use yet is that it&#x27;s more expensive&#x2F;complicated and the current techniques of algorithmic predictions of hypoglycemic episodes and insulin delivery suspension are already very good that hypo isn&#x27;t much of a problem with modern devices like Tandem&#x27;s offering.<p>Medtronic has added a meal detection algorithm[5] that&#x27;s really good too (the best on the market I&#x27;m told by my endo colleagues) and they say we&#x27;re getting close to not needing meal announcement anymore, this practically eliminates carb counting. It&#x27;s the first such algorithm to be in clinical use so we&#x27;re not there yet but the expectation is that this approach will get us there.<p>The question (for glucagon) then becomes how clinically useful more time in euglycemia is as the hypo episode problem is essentially solved, we&#x27;ll need more data to draw any conclusions and it will take a while for this particular question as many of the outcome measures are long-term (i.e. what are the long-term sequela of mild intermittent hyperglycemia, it&#x27;s somewhere between nothing and uncontrolled diabetes but how far along on that line is the billion dollar question).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;28007348&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;28007348&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jamasurgery&#x2F;article-abstract&#x2F;2795853" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jamasurgery&#x2F;article-abstrac...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;24931572&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;24931572&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inredadiabetic.nl&#x2F;en&#x2F;discover-the-ap&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inredadiabetic.nl&#x2F;en&#x2F;discover-the-ap&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medtronicdiabetes.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;minimed-780g-insulin-pump-system" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medtronicdiabetes.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;minimed-780g-insu...</a></div><br/><div id="37324939" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37324939" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nahsra</span><span>|</span><a href="#37323296">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37324180">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37333392">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37324939">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37324939">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s not clear from their site whether the Inreda product also has CGM built into it, or if it must be paired with one?<p>Glucose-responsive insulin also seems like science fiction as this point, but would be extremely powerful tool.<p>I&#x27;m very familiar with one of the most popular, closed-loop system combinations in the USA and I definitely don&#x27;t feel the hypoglycemia problem is anywhere near &quot;solved&quot;.

Pumps are getting smaller, which is one factor that helps and analysis is getting more accurate. Reliability and sensors are improving. But the timing aspect is critical especially without knowledge about environmental factors and the relatively long hysteresis of the feedback is a major obstacle to the big leap forward. Key here is that the body has more data about the situation than an outside device will ever have and that regulation in the body is a fairly global affair [1] so it can act faster and with more precision than you can ever do from a single site. These are all super tricky problems. But compared to the situation only a decade ago it is already much better and I fully expect at least one more round of breakthrough devices.

The main difference lies in having no automated mechanism for regulating blood sugar levels. Due to this - you have to calculate the correct amount of insulin you need for your meals and measure your blood sugar regularly to make sure it stays within balance. If your blood sugar levels tend to be higher than normal (i.e. you aren&#x27;t injecting enough insulin), that isn&#x27;t good. It is OK in the near term - but can be devastating in the long term due to health complications (i.e. blindness &#x2F; nerve damage &#x2F; etc..). If your blood sugars are fall too low - you can have severe consequences in the near term (i.e. die or have a seizure within 1 hour of injecting insulin). In other words - you need to always keep your blood sugar in check in order to survive and to be in good health. Some people find this extremely hard to do - some people like me embrace it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37331251" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37331251" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">et2o</span><span>|</span><a href="#37321913">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37323207">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37326110">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37323253">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37331251">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37331251">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your pancreas actually <i>does</i> know things like that you&#x27;ve ingested a lot of carbohydrates before they enter the bloodstream, etc. Certainly there is also a response to exercise that occurs before you coiod easily detect it with a CGM.

Of course the big players will all push the fear button, but that should be contrasted with the simple fact that they all have had (sometimes multiple) recalls.<p>Do not underestimate how hard it is to do this right, the people that built these DIY solutions have spent a ton of effort on them, probably more than the equivalent commercial players. But long term my prediction would be that the DIY movement will lose out. The competition has massive lobbying power, a lot of funding and looks like the safe option to outsiders, especially when there is feature parity. The main driver for this development was a simple one: all the parts were out there, but nobody was willing to take the plunge and build a closed loop system and have it certified. But that impetus is now gone and future improvements will be much higher hanging fruit.<p>But I&#x27;d love for them to stay around to keep the industry on its toes.

On the plus side though: there is an absolute mountain of information about this disease and there is substantial funding poured into getting it further under control. The holy grail (and artificial pancreas like a pace maker) is still a long way off. But substantial improvements have been made in the last decade and a half and I expect that trend to continue for a while.<p>What I love about this story is that the DIY community managed to break the log-jam of the manufacturers and the regulatory authorities by simply providing them with proof that it <i>can</i> work and can work reliably enough to be allowed on the market. That shortcut probably shaved at least a decade (possibly more) off the progress charts. Manufacturers were (to some degree rightly so) antsy about closed loop systems because it would require them to assume much more liability than they are normally used to, the symptom-&gt;diagnosis-&gt;action loop that you can engage in by close monitoring and patching together available systems cuts the human out of the loop: the system will function autonomously and a software error or hardware glitch has the potential to kill someone.<p>So the manufacturers were effectively all waiting on each other to show that this can be done safely and that holding pattern had already lasted for multiple years. In the meantime, the larger manufacturers had some time to gain the upper hand over reliability and teething problems of the newer generation of pumps and those came together just in time with continuous monitoring to enable a big step forward in a very hacked (but fully functional) way. No single manufacturer would have taken that risk at this point in time without that push. But now that it is done they can&#x27;t be left behind either or they&#x27;ll lose market share rapidly.<p>It&#x27;s a pity that there are not more diseases (at least, not that I&#x27;m aware of) that would benefit from this approach, diabetes is unique in that respect.<p>Best of luck there. By the way: if you want to stay current with the developments in this field the best spot to look for is the announcement of trials, and sometimes the calls for volunteers for such trials.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37322534" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37322534" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xyzal</span><span>|</span><a href="#37323809">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37323014">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37322534">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37322534">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A friend showed me AndroidAPS&#x27;s automation capabilities and my jaw dropped. &quot;If this SSID is visible, I am in a gym, so lower basal rate by 20%&quot;.<p>edit: docs for the interested&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;androidaps.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Usage&#x2F;Automation.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;androidaps.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;Usage&#x2F;Automation...</a></div><br/><div id="37322974" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37322974" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lolc</span><span>|</span><a href="#37322534">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37322721">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37322974">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37322974">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For me, those features were always very gimmicky.

So the pump stops insulin and starts beeping an alarm. No big deal, she just gets up and does a finger stick blood test to check for a false positive. About half the time it will be a false low-blood sugar measure.<p>A related issue is that when you first insert the sensor, the blood sugar reading is way off until the body calms down at the insertion site.<p>So long story short, I think we need better continuous glucose monitors to prevent potential wild see-sawing when there are two opposing meds, as with the insulin-glucagon combo.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37333750" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37333750" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">maximegarcia</span><span>|</span><a href="#37333420">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37323328">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37333750">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37333750">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m T1D.<p>For me, the main thing keeping at being good at the closed loop system is delay.

Embedded convex solvers for large MPC schemes do not come cheap, especially when you want them running every 5 minutes! I have used this DIY loop system in the past.

So much opportunity is either created or destroyed by external circumstances that we don&#x27;t perceive, let alone control. Since we all subconsciously write our own creation myths, it&#x27;s not easy to discover and attribute forces that we aren&#x27;t aware of when looking back on our life paths. The perennial bullshit self-explanation is <i>hard work.</i> How hard they work is one thing that they <i>can</i> control, and they know they worked hard, so they assume it had more of an effect than it did... and in turn, others that worked less hard didn&#x27;t succeed. For example, they might assume that their uncle was willing to set up that meeting with their first big client because they worked hard enough to be worthy of it, rather than realizing that others who worked as hard or harder lacked a <i>connected uncle</i>.</div><br/><div id="37104218" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37104218" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bruce511</span><span>|</span><a href="#37103575">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37104720">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37104218">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37104218">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Very few business success stories credit luck with being a root cause.<p>But in real life luck (or &quot;chance&quot; , if you prefer) plays a part, sometimes a significant part.<p>It was lucky that John and Paul went to school together.

(Told by a UCLA staff member.)<p>In the early 2000&#x27;s, a UCLA professor invited a successful entrepreneur to give a guest lecture on one of their business courses. During the lecture he was asked what made him the success and the fortune - and the answer was distilled to less than seven words: &quot;Get lucky. Then stack the deck.&quot; He went on to explain that the best way to maintain a competitive edge was to make it as hard as possible for anyone else to try to follow his steps or to circumvent his position. But first you had to get lucky enough to afford it.<p>He was not invited again. Too honest and demoralising for the students.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37105213" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37105213" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">simonh</span><span>|</span><a href="#37103575">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37104218">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37107170">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37105468">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37105213">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37105213">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The tricky side of that is how to distinguish between luck and opportunity.

At any rate, both the UK and USA (and arguably most other modern wealthy countries) are essentially social democracies - it&#x27;s largely a matter of degree (and to what extent it&#x27;s prevalent at a federal vs state vs local level).  But from the perspective of an Australian, the economy of the USA looks for all the world like one I want to avoid ours becoming at all costs. To be clear, I&#x27;m very much envious of the opportunities US-based technology workers have, and if there were a way to achieve that level of entrepreneurship and sheer variety of industrial success stories here while still maintaining a cohesive society not beset by destabilizing levels of inequality* I&#x27;d be all for it.<p>(*) on the inequality front, perhaps what puts me off the most is seeing the degree to which relatively few mega-corporations appear to dominate much of the social fabric.

I never wrote otherwise.<p>I did not mean to imply that you did (:<p>You touched on a general topic, and I was speaking to that, more than your specific words.<p>&gt; successful people ... blamed themselves for the failures<p>I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s true. But I&#x27;m trying to draw a thin, wiggly line between awareness of room for improvement (usually more on a rational level), and blame&#x2F;judgement (usually more on an emotional level). The former is great, the latter not so much.<p>I&#x27;d wager that there are also a whole lot of <i>un</i>-successful people who blamed themselves for their failures, <i>even if they could do no better</i>.
People who hate themselves. People who are unhappy. My commentary is more directed at those people and those who would care about them, than the ones you mention.<p>&gt; taking responsibility ... you can succeed by learning<p>This definitely straddles the wiggly line (:
One one side is &quot;taking responsibility,&quot; and on the other is &quot;it&#x27;s your fault.&quot;<p>Certainly one should internalize the <i>lesson</i>. But hopefully not the <i>shame</i>&#x2F;<i>blame</i>. Perhaps neither you nor your successful acquaintences suffer from this affliction, but in my experience many do.<p>I realize that some people are lazy and looking for excuses to escape responsibility, so perhaps you see my viewpoint as somehow enabling or encouraging that bad behavior. I just want to point out that there are downsides in the other direction too, if taken to puritanical extremes. And I daresay the &quot;being lazy is bad&quot; side of the argument gets a whole lot more headspace in our culture than the &quot;it&#x27;s okay, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with you&quot; side. Hence my attempt to bring some balance.<p>&gt; You could consider it like airliners ...<p>&gt; ride a bike the first time ...<p>The thing about airlines is that they operate in a very carefully crafted environment. Planes stay away from each other, are generally aware of each other (notwithstanding that friggin&#x27; biplane without a radio that cut me off on downwind... grr), have high maintenance standards, etc. etc. Real life can be much more dense&#x2F;messy&#x2F;fast-moving&#x2F;full of unknowns, I find. You do not always get the luxury of knowing the variables involved.<p>But the problem with both of your examples is that they assume you can learn and try again. And that&#x27;s not always the case.<p>What if you&#x27;re a passenger on one of those airliners that crashes? What should you have done better, personally?<p>Born in a poor country? Sorry, no re-try.<p>Born with a damaged brain or body? Sorry, no re-try.<p>Have abusive parents? Maybe a few can pull themselves out (probably mostly by luck or the help of others), but it will have lifelong effects.<p>You get the idea. And those examples are extreme; there are myriad other &quot;softer&quot; struggles people have, with varying levels of control. Depression comes to mind.<p>So, in conclusion, my whole long-winded reply is just trying to say: sometimes people (like you) express the &quot;you have nobody to blame but yourself&quot; attitude, with good intentions, directed at the sort of enabled people you were talking about, but it gets applied to other people, with heart-wrenching effects.</div><br/><div id="37106805" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37106805" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">WalterBright</span><span>|</span><a href="#37103575">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37106671">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37107678">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37106805">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37106805">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The thing about airlines is that they operate in a very carefully crafted environment.<p>They do now, as the consequence of many crashes.<p>&gt; And that&#x27;s not always the case<p>I liken this as &quot;humans have two legs&quot; and the riposte is &quot;not <i>all</i> humans have two legs&quot;.

You have to look at the person themselves and try to figure out what about them made X happen - people have too much of a blind spot comparing themselves to the world outside their bubble, or understanding how other people perceive them. They lack the perspective to really know what about them is different<p>For example most successful founders and CEOs in my experience may say taking meeting notes or setting a high bar helps. But really what helped is that they had personality traits leading to these behaviors which are what truly drove the benefits - they are meticulous and detail oriented so they want to use writing to nail down ideas, they set high standards for themselves and others so they do whatever it takes to avoid a bad hire or lazy decision. It would be considered impolite for the CEO to say that about themselves, and maybe they don’t even notice how much of an outlier they are in those traits, so instead you get told the effect rather than the cause of their success. Someone without those traits trying to ape out the processes won’t be able to realize the benefits.<p>Similarly I think to a degree the whole “be connected or privileged from birth” is meant to be taken implicitly rather than ignored altogether, sometimes. Nobody wants to launch into a discussion about social class or inequality in some PR puff piece that’s like “oh mr startup ceo why are you so rich and successful”.

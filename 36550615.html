I’ve built a popular (within the community) study tool, I’ve also been working on an open source AI that I believe is finally better than the state of the art one - I’m going to set up a match between them sometime soon (but need a bot interface, etc). This is without ML, too, which I fully intend to explore soon. And finally I’ve been working on a modern lichess-like app (woogles.io) for it, with tournaments, puzzles, etc that recently hosted its 3 millionth game, with a small team of contributors. It will likely be the test bed for the AI matches. And if that isn’t enough, I’ve attempted to achieve mastery at the game, being rated as high as 7th nationally in the last few years. Although I think I’d be better if I didn’t spend so much time building stuff for everyone to play with.<p>The problem is there’s no money in it. Hasbro is litigious, all of this stuff is open source because I find it curious and deeply interesting, and as a sort of misguided attempt to try to democratize access to it. I’m not going to charge without getting sued, and even if one of the companies like Scopely wanted to hire me, I’m only interested in keeping this open source and free. So I’m not really sure what to do.</div><br/><div id="36556882" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36556882" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">phforms</span><span>|</span><a href="#36555023">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36555506">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36556882">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36556882">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don’t think that great work and financial success are necessarily related; in fact, in many historical cases they were not.

This post really demonstrates why I believe this – mainly because PG doesn&#x27;t touch at all on <i>why</i> someone would want to do great work while romanticizing how great it is to have that desire.<p>I don&#x27;t think the question that ambitious people should be asking themselves is &quot;what is work that I can do that will be great?&quot; but something more akin to &quot;what is work that I will find fulfilling?&quot; <i>Why</i> do you want your work to be great? Do you think that the work being perceived as &quot;great&quot; is fulfilling in and of itself? What are you trying to prove through this work, and whom are you trying to prove it to? These are important questions to ask yourself because, otherwise, you&#x27;re going to end up getting burnt out and wondering what all of your effort was really for.<p>A personal anecdote: when I was younger, I wanted to be great at piano. I played it since I was very young and I spent many hours playing it through my teens. I competed against others at music festivals with moderate success, and I wanted to continue doing great work with it. But this environment put me in a terrible headspace. I would frequently have angry outbursts when I made minor mistakes while practicing. If not anger, I&#x27;d chastise myself to the point of crying (I firmly believe this is what gave me low self-esteem through my college years). When someone would tell me to take a break given my emotional state, I&#x27;d firmly say no and go back to practicing because... why would I stop? The best piano players practice for hours a day non-stop. I&#x27;d spent so many hours practicing and I was actually pretty good.

But point I&#x27;m trying to make is that being ambitious for great work simply because you want to do great work is not a healthy way to do your work. You need to have a deeper reason for why you&#x27;ve chosen the work that you do, and you shouldn&#x27;t fall for the romanticism that these sorts of essays put forth.<p>The work that you do will be great work if you have a reason for doing it other than &quot;I want to do something great.&quot;</div><br/><div id="36557220" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36557220" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">movedx</span><span>|</span><a href="#36556577">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36557289">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36557220">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36557220">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve been studying a lot of Buddhism as of late.

We go through the acts of nourishment and socialization because we are at that stage, being people on Earth. But seeking any personally chosen result or goal is self delusion.

PG&#x27;s advice is to &quot;optimize for interestingness&quot; ; Hamming when he says, &quot;If you do not work on an important problem, it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ll do important work.&quot;<p>I got a kick out of how both of them advocate for being flexible in our approach to work — especially given how launching and pivoting after learning from your users has also been the PG advice for the better part of two decades in startup-focused essays. PG&#x27;s all for switching horses mid-race if a more exciting problem shows up , and Hamming shares the same sentiment, stressing the importance of being ready to seize new opportunities. Today pivoting is just default vernacular in startup world, but also cutting losses and getting that fractal and pushing that to its end is worth it.<p>Curious how has &quot;optimizing for interestingness&quot; played out in your own work or life? Additionally, curious if there are any good HN stories about pursuing research and “pivoting” in fields that are not searching for product-market&#x2F;fit for a startup…<p>(Hamming’s talk has been shared countless times here and this feels like PG’s contribution to a similar idea (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35778036">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35778036</a>)).</div><br/><div id="36553383" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36553383" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">interroboink</span><span>|</span><a href="#36551058">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36550781">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36553383">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36553383">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s an unspoken aspect of the word &quot;important&quot; here — important <i>to you</i>, or important <i>to the world</i> (society, etc)?<p>From Hamming:<p>&quot;I thought hard about where was my field going, where were the opportunities, and what were the important things to do. Let me go there so there is a chance I can do important things.&quot;<p>It seems he is talking about the <i>important to the world</i> aspect. He wants to have a big impact on the world, and be where the action is. The goal is to make a name for yourself, or to at least have a hand in the next big transformations.<p>But there is also the &quot;important <i>to you</i>&quot; aspect. In Hamming&#x27;s case, those two notions of importance align. But not so for everyone.<p>Quoting again:<p>&quot;I went home one Friday after finishing a problem, and curiously enough I wasn&#x27;t happy; I was depressed. I could see life being a long sequence of one problem after another after another.&quot;<p>So, he is happiest when working on problems that have big &quot;important&quot; implications for the world. Good for him; I&#x27;m glad he discovered that about himself, and followed what made him happy.<p>So now for my actual point: I&#x27;d encourage a person to actually first and foremost focus on what is important to them personally — what makes them happy — rather than what seems &quot;important&quot; from some external perspective.<p>I think a lot of people will decide, like Hamming did, that they want to be where the action is, that they want to participate in transforming the world, that that is what makes them happy. But to put that choice on a pedestal as though it is the True Goal — to put &quot;important to society&quot; above &quot;important to oneself&quot; is putting the cart before the horse. It&#x27;s how you get a bunch of unhappy people chasing after other people&#x27;s dreams.<p>It&#x27;s actually somewhat touched upon in TFA, with:<p>&quot;The following recipe assumes you&#x27;re very ambitious.&quot;<p>Indeed — like Hamming was. But not everyone is, and not everyone needs to be to be happy. I am just slightly irked by our somehow reserving the word &quot;great&quot; for ambitious people&#x27;s accomplishments.</div><br/><div id="36557054" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36557054" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">a_bonobo</span><span>|</span><a href="#36551058">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36553383">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36554435">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36557054">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36557054">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;I think a lot of people will decide, like Hamming did, that they want to be where the action is, that they want to participate in transforming the world, that that is what makes them happy.<p>In my 37 years of experience: people do want to be where the action is, but many people who are the main examples of &#x27;being at the action&#x27; already were at a location where the action happened to end up. I.e., people working for a long time on an &#x27;obscure&#x27; problem interesting to them suddenly see that &#x27;obscure&#x27; problem become important and fall into success (think of all the CS people working on DL&#x2F;ANNs in the 90s. I don&#x27;t think Yann LeCunn was a known name in the 90s).<p>The tragedy is that it&#x27;s very hard to predict where the action will be. Literature is full of people who lucked into that position, and obviously ignores the millions who were where the action never ended up.<p>With some experience you can shift your focus to where you think the action will be: it&#x27;s probably best not to run after the money, but walk towards it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36554435" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36554435" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PaulDavisThe1st</span><span>|</span><a href="#36551058">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36553383">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36557054">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36550781">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36554435">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36554435">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Right now, the audio tech&#x2F;software niche is abuzz with ideas and attempts related to using transformer technology within the field.

Dunno. Probably.

The trick is staying engaged and interested in the long, flat middle where progress comes in small dribs and there are frequent setbacks.<p>- Another point I wish the essay made is that many projects reach a point at which it is best to reveal it to others. That is one of the most scary parts, of exposing oneself to criticism and doubt. It&#x27;s what petrifies so many people from even starting. But if you embrace it not as the end, but as part of the process and a natural part of the evolution of the idea, it can itself be turned into a  motivator. It&#x27;s your first milestone. You WANT to get to that point, as a checkpoint. Seek out the feedback, adjust, and press on.<p>- In fact, more should be said about the emotional part of doing projects. The love (or lust), the fear, the frustration, the doubt, and yes, the joy. All those human emotions are part of doing any work. We can run away from it and try to avoid it, or realize it comes with the territory.<p>- Another thing that comes with experience and age is knowing what to say NO to, and avoid getting pulled away into the tributaries. It&#x27;s easy to get distracted by side quests and to engage in bike-shedding. In fact, sometimes it&#x27;s necessary for one&#x27;s mental health. But it is best to keep an eye on the main goal that got us excited about the idea in the first place. Knowing when the break is over and it is time to get back to main path is a trick that seems to only come with age.<p>- Lastly, there is great value in brevity (this is not a critique of PG&#x27;s excellent essay :-) Imagine meeting a friend and they ask what you are working on. You tell them a long, complicated story, and their eyes glaze over. Next person, you learn to shorten it. Same result. You iterate.

So anything that can be described either literally or metaphorically as a religion will have valuable unexplored ideas in its shadow. Copernicus and Darwin both made discoveries of this type.<p>&gt; [18] The principles defining a religion have to be mistaken. Otherwise anyone might adopt them, and there would be nothing to distinguish the adherents of the religion from everyone else.<p>First, anything can be either literally or metaphorically described as a religion, so that makes this an empty principle, since it either covers nothing or everything or both. (“Cheesecake is my religion.” Etc.)<p>Second, the footnote is literally impenetrable to me. Honestly. I can discern no coherent meaning. That everyone could adopt a principle or belief does not mean it must be false just because everyone uniformly and indistinguishably believes it and therefore nobody disbelieves it. Whether people can be distinguished from one another with respect to some belief (say, that in base 10 arithmetic that 1+1=2) has nothing to do with the truth vel non of that belief.<p>And honestly, I am genuinely struggling to fathom a mind that <i>could</i> not only believe that statement but believe it so deeply that they breezily announce it as obviously true.

Otherwise anyone might adopt them, and there would be nothing to distinguish the adherents of the religion from everyone else.<p>I think what&#x27;s going on here is the theory that the purpose of religion is to create a trusted in-group separated from the out-group, with rules that make it difficult to casually join. [1] If you start from that premise, PG&#x27;s footnote makes sense. But this ignores the fact that the largest religions really want as many members as possible and would be delighted if everyone followed their principles.<p>[1] See for instance: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;12&#x2F;24&#x2F;there-are-rules-here&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;12&#x2F;24&#x2F;there-are-rules-here&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="36555867" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36555867" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dmvdoug</span><span>|</span><a href="#36551830">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36553542">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36552226">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36555867">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36555867">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is actually helpful. So, he’s saying, religions <i>really</i> exist for this social function of group formation&#x2F;identity. Thus, we know that the principles they proclaim, which tend to be universal claims of truth, are wrong, since if those principles were true, they would defeat the real purpose of religion. Therefore, one good way to find ideas to explore is to question the principles or bracket them and see what you can do without them.<p>That does make what he’s saying there cohere better. Of course, what he’s saying turns entirely on the ambiguity he’s playing on (which I suspected): religion in the sense of concrete historical&#x2F;social human practices and religion in the sense of identifying strongly with and thus not questioning your principles. Never a good idea to hang your hat on the coatrack of suggestive language games. Or, you know, outrageous bullshit.<p>I almost think it makes it worse, finding a coherent meaning—-which is so silly.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36552226" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36552226" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">carabiner</span><span>|</span><a href="#36551830">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36553542">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36553507">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36552226">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36552226">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Traditionally, footnotes are straightforward explanations of terms or passages.

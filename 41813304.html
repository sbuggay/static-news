I’ve mostly WFH since long before the pandemic, in many different capacities at many companies. A lot of people have tunnel vision and the reality is more nuanced than most allow.<p>For IC work that requires minimal collaboration, WFH is often more productive. Fewer interruptions, more focus. However, when the role requires detailed collaboration and regular interaction with others, productivity for WFH falls off a cliff. This has been measurable at every company I’ve worked for that does a decent job of collecting these metrics. And anecdotally, I can feel it in my own job. When I am doing focus work, WFH is great and I get a lot done. When I need a lot of whiteboard time or deep discussions with my peers, WFH is very inefficient regardless of the remote setup, and the difference is so stark that it is difficult to argue.<p>I think most people are talking their own book. If you are an IC or mostly just do individual focus work, then of course WFH is great. If you need to iteratively collaborate with people on complex design problems or work products, WFH objectively has low efficiency in every organization I’ve seen try it, including companies that are remote-centric.<p>There is a lot of motivated reasoning in these discussions and little acknowledgement that productivity between WFH and RTO varies greatly depending on the task at hand. Every company and most roles are a mix of these types of tasks. I think many companies these days recognize this and try to allocate accordingly, but it creates legal, social, and other issues if you treat employees differently in this regard based on the nature of their roles. The reality that some people must commute to do their jobs effectively creates a class system of sorts but organizations needs all roles to be setup to ensure reasonable productivity.<p>This is not a black and white situation, it is a complex social problem.</div><br/><div id="41817152" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41817152" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vbezhenar</span><span>|</span><a href="#41816635">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41817229">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41817152">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41817152">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It might be efficient to work 60 hours week.

I&#x27;ve been working from home 100% since early 2016. You can make it more efficient in almost everything (I don&#x27;t do creative work - so I don&#x27;t know how that would go). Add to it better wellbeing, lower environmental impact, better access to skilled workforce and lower cost for the company and there should be no doubt WFH works 100% of the time in 99% of companies. I often had small team leaders, or mid managers tell me, &quot;but I don&#x27;t really have that close personal relationship with some of the people WFH&quot;. Yeah, sometimes you don&#x27;t. When you have a tough problem in the office and your boss comes down you can show him how everyone is so busy trying to resolve it. You have a group of guys looking very busy here, a loud meeting over there. And you can just run from one group to the other looking extremely involved.... When people WFH you actually need to know what they are doing (very rare a manager will have a knowledge to fully understand a deep tech issue at such level) or you just trust people are doing their best. And that is very difficult to do when you don&#x27;t know if they aren&#x27;t having a birthday party with their kid and pretending to work when your world is caving in. The solution? You have to have good technical team leads and you rely on them in such situations.<p>The horrible non-solution some companies try? Monitoring. Desktop casting, webcam always on. As long as you do that the productivity will plummet far below that of the office. Why? Because you give people another tool to show how busy they are &quot;at work&quot; other than the work itself. If you have no monitoring you have to prove you&#x27;re working by doing actual work. We all know the products called &quot;mouse jiggle&quot; and such. If you cN get away with looking busy for the camera and moving the mouse many people will. All these people that pretend to work are a huge untapped economic potential. The key to utilising it is making them want to do the work.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41816898" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41816898" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">J_Shelby_J</span><span>|</span><a href="#41816635">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41817279">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41817569">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41816898">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41816898">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a good comment and I had to think about it for a minute.

But that said, just because most people can’t effectively communicate and instead use async communications like slack zombies is not my problem. If lawyers can handle contract negotiations over email, you can handle managing people with a ticketing systems and well written emails.

There&#x27;s just me in my home office room, at work there are 3 other people right next to me and a dozen within ear shot.<p>I get home stuff done during work breaks. When I step away from my desk at work I do so because I need a break from what I&#x27;m doing, not a break from everything. But there&#x27;s nothing else to do at work so I sit and do nothing. At home i:
- unload the dishwasher  
- walk to the shops to buy items for dinner   
- sit in the park<p>And I find doing those things more refreshing than sitting in the break room staring into space, or walking through the city in the noise of cars everywhere.<p>So when I step back to my desk, at home I&#x27;m more refreshed ready to get back into it.<p>This also means when I finish work for the day, in office it&#x27;s another hour or so to get home and then do chores. Vs at home I finish work and I can go for a walk in the park because I&#x27;ve done my chores already.<p>So I&#x27;m happier and less stressed. Which leads to less fatigue and burn out. So I&#x27;m ready to go again the next day.</div><br/><div id="41817474" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41817474" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DrBazza</span><span>|</span><a href="#41814419">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815627">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41817613">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41817474">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41817474">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Commuting is mentally draining.<p>This is an understated problem.<p>Driving?

There isn&#x27;t much substantive evidence of what it claims.<p>Second, even if people aren&#x27;t commuting, it just assumes people work the same hours, but many people are probably working longer hours so you can&#x27;t tell the impact on WFH on productivity.<p>Third, it doesn&#x27;t look at outputs at all, especially the output of the company. While some (or even all) individuals might produce more, the group as a whole will have less communication and each employee might have less context of what else is going on in the company, so much of their contribution might not align as well with company objectives. Management of all the individuals would be more difficult and the company would be less of a team. This would support the idea that the increased productivity is only available to well managed groups. I think this sounds much more likely.<p>Fourth, much of the increase explained is from widening the labor pool. It explicitly mentions those with disabilities, stay at home mothers, and larger geographical inclusion.

A good Internet connection, a good microphone, tooling like Jira (work backlog, prioritization and status updates), Google Drive (documentation), Zoom (VC with screen share), Slack (instant messaging for informal async comms or quickly scheduling ad hoc meetings) and whatever tool people use for scheduling meetings ahead of time.<p>I&#x27;m curious what part of your work wouldn&#x27;t go smoothly given such a setup?

It&#x27;s more work for management at the start but in time, as management and workers get accustomed, it will work out.<p>It seems to be a win for employees and companies.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41815093" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41815093" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">roland35</span><span>|</span><a href="#41814503">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41816732">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41815093">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41815093">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Number one benefit to companies to allow WFH: they can pay me a senior level pay for staff level seniority, and I still come out ahead living in the Midwest versus moving to SF or NYC.</div><br/><div id="41815292" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41815292" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SunlitCat</span><span>|</span><a href="#41815093">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41816287">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41815292">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41815292">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Aren&#x27;t there some companies that consider this (where the employee lives) when calculating their salaries?</div><br/><div id="41815367" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41815367" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hotspot_one</span><span>|</span><a href="#41815093">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815292">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815458">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41815367">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41815367">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I see this alot.

A small minority preferred the office, which was understandable, but the overall results were clear: WFH was beneficial.<p>Despite this, the CEO disregarded the data and announced that employees wanted to return, citing a need for in-person collaboration and productivity improvements—claims that directly contradicted the evidence that had been gathered. His decision was based on personal bias and gut instinct rather than the facts.<p>This led to significant fallout. As executives like myself left, key engineers followed, resulting in a mass exodus of talent and customers. Within two years, the company was a shell of its former self and was ultimately sold off for a fraction of its value to some shit kicker PE firm.<p>Also funny, was that the CEO had always hated WFH, even prior to Covid, even though he himself was always happy to exercise it personally. Even whilst doing WFH himself though, his opinion of anyone else WFH had always been that any of them claiming to actually work was &quot;full of shit&quot; and &quot;taking the piss&quot; and in fact doing absolutely nothing.

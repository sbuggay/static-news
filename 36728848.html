However, they’ve also left me feeling uneasy for reasons I couldn’t really put my finger on.<p>It finally clicked when I read the section justifying the company&#x27;s low compensation:<p>&gt; Industry data shows that Honeycomb is about average in this as a series D startup, not an outlier. I have friends who are line managers at larger companies who take home more than I do in my current role. To be clear, I’m not complaining — I am paid well for what I do, and I’m always, always grateful to be extremely well compensated relative to most American workers, who are well paid relative to the world median<p>It’s great that the author is satisfied with their own compensation. What bothers me is the contrast between their company’s “about average” compensation and these blog posts espousing excellence at every level the company, mentioning “inhumane” schedules in the past to deliver SOC2 and HIPAA compliance, talk of using off time to do continued industry learning, and the insinuation that the insinuation that the author and their boss are established industry thought leaders.<p>All of this talk of excellence and high performance at every level with one big exception: Compensation. Reading the section about how they have data showing their compensation is “about average” gave me flashbacks to early in my career when I was underpaid (relative to doing similar work at other companies) and yet charismatic company leaders insisted our compensation was in line with industry averages according to some data they found somewhere. It took me a while to realize the 50th percentile compensation should go along with 50th percentile expectations and 50th percentile performance. The companies who expect 95th percentile performance but give “about average” compensation and use charismatic leaders to convince everyone that it’s okay are, in my experience, not a good deal for the employee.</div><br/><div id="36732379" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36732379" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nickstinemates</span><span>|</span><a href="#36732077">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36732276">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36732379">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36732379">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What is left unsaid: working at a startup at an executive level typically involves whole percentages of equity in the company.<p>If honeycomb continues to succeed and there&#x27;s some sort of exit or liquidation (which can happen in series D, E rounds for select individuals like executives) then I am sure the total comp is not &quot;about average&quot; but instead much greater than average.</div><br/><div id="36732601" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36732601" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aurornis</span><span>|</span><a href="#36732077">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36732379">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36732757">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36732601">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36732601">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Exit liquidity for executives is great for those executives, but it doesn’t help the rest of the employees.<p>If leaders are writing blog posts about how everyone needs to accept “average” compensation while cashing out high equity grants for themselves, that actually makes it worse.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36732757" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36732757" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dalyons</span><span>|</span><a href="#36732077">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36732379">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36732601">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36732276">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36732757">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36732757">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah for executive positions like VP the vast majority of the comp is in stock.

For example, there is always a tension between rigor and urgency in engineering ; it is the responsibility of engineering leadership to navigate that tension! e.g.: An engineer insists on stopping ship because of a critical bug, but there is an important customer at the other end to make a contractual deadline; what is to be done?  It falls on the CEO to bear responsibility for that decision -- and for engineering leadership to make or inform that decision.  Either way, it is the VP of Engineering who is in the hot seat -- not for OKRs or performance management or other FAANG middle management cosplay, but for making tough, technically informed decisions.<p>That is but one technical piece that is missing here; there are in fact many.

Yeah, there are lots of unhealthy startups, but the really hard organizational health problems are long standing companies with the &quot;dead pool&quot; effect that chased away the best people, long standing feuds&#x2F;grudges, sociopathic&#x2F;paranoid wars over diminishing resource pools and budgets, and deep problems with legacy systems that need to be updated.<p>A startup?

I have similarly wished for this capability, especially the destructability part. What you speak of is still pretty far off for several reasons:<p>-No Collision&#x2F;poor collision on NERFs and GS: to have a proper interactive world, you usually need accurate character collision so that your character or vehicle can move along the floor&#x2F;ground (as opposed to falling thru it) run into walls, go through door frames, etc. NERFs suffer from the same issues as photogrammetry in that they need “structure from motion” (COLMAP or similar) to give them a mesh or 3-D output that can be meshed for collision to register off of. The mesh from reality capture is noisy, and is not simple geometry. Think millions of triangles from a laser scanner or camera for “flat” ground that a video game would use 100 triangles for.<p>-Scanning: there’s no scanner available that provides both good 3-D information and good photo realistic textures at a price people will want to pay. Scanning every square inch of playable space in even a modest sized house is a pain, and people will look behind the television, underneath the furniture and everywhere else that most of these scanning videos and demos never go. There are a lot of ugly angles that these videos omit where a player would go.<p>-Post Processing: of you scan your house or any other real space, you will have poor lighting unless you took the time to do your own custom lighting and color setup. That will all need to be corrected in post process so that you can dynamically light your environment. Lighting is one of the most next generation things that people associate with games and you will be fighting prebaked shadows throughout the entire house or area that you have scanned. You don’t get away from this with NERFs or gaussian splats, because those scenes also have prebaked lighting in them that is static.<p>Object Destruction and Physics: I Love the game teardown, and if you want to see what it’s like to actually bust up and destroy structures that have been physically scanned, there is a plug-in to import reality capture models directly into the game with a little bit of modding. That said, teardown is voxel based, and is one of the most advanced engines that has been built to do such a thing.  I have seen nothing else capable of doing cool looking destruction of any object, scanned or 3D modeled, without a large studio effort and a ton of optimization.</div><br/><div id="40761117" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40761117" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">modeless</span><span>|</span><a href="#40760103">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40760639">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40764657">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40761117">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40761117">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think collision detection is solvable. And the scanning process should be no harder than 3D modeling to the same quality level. Probably much easier, honestly. Modeling is labor intensive. I&#x27;m not sure why you say &quot;there’s no scanner available that provides both good 3-D information and good photo realistic textures&quot; because these new techniques don&#x27;t use &quot;scanners&quot;, all you need is regular cameras. The 3D information is inferred.<p>Lighting is the big issue, IMO. As soon as you want any kind of interactivity besides moving the camera you need dynamic lighting. The problem is you&#x27;re going to have to mix the captured absolutely perfect real-world lighting with extremely approximate real-time computed lighting (which will be much worse than offline-rendered path tracing, which still wouldn&#x27;t match real-world quality). It&#x27;s going to look awful. At least, until someone figures out a revolutionary neural relighting system. We are pretty far from that today.<p>Scale is another issue. Two issues, really, rendering and storage. There&#x27;s already a lot of research into scaling up rendering to large and detailed scenes, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s solved yet. And once you have rendering, storage will be the next issue. These scans will be massive and we&#x27;ll need some very effective compression to be able to distribute large scenes to users.</div><br/><div id="40761548" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40761548" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">totalview</span><span>|</span><a href="#40760103">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40761117">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40762545">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40761548">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40761548">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You are correct; most of these new techniques are using a camera. In my line of work I consider a camera sensor a scanner of sorts, as we do a lot of photogrammetry and “scan” with a 45MP full frame. The inferred 3D from cameras is pretty bad when it comes to accuracy, especially from dimly lit areas or where you dip into a closet or closed space that doesn’t have a good structural tie back to the main space you are trying to recreate in 3D. Laser scanners are far preferable to tie your photo pose estimation to, and most serious reality capture for video games is done with both a camera a and $40,000+ LiDAR Scanner.  Have you ever tried to scan every corner of a house with only a traditional DSLR or point and shoot camera? I have and the results are pretty bad from a 3D standpoint without a ton of post process.<p>The collision detection problem is related heavily to having clean 3D as mentioned above. My company is doing development on computing collision on reality capture right now in a clean way and I would be interested in any thoughts you have. We are chunking collision on the dataset at a fixed distance from the player character (can’t go too fast in a vehicle or it will outpace the collision and fall thru the floor) and have a tunable LOD that influences collision resolution.</div><br/><div id="40762012" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40762012" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sneak</span><span>|</span><a href="#40760103">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40761548">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40762545">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40762012">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40762012">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Both my iPhone and my Apple Vision Pro both have lidar scanners, fwiw.<p>Frankly I’m surprised that I can’t easily make crude 3D models of spaces with a simple app presently.

IMO using these priors will be super important to enabling dynamic 4D reconstruction (since it’s otherwise unfeasible to directly observe every space-time point in a scene). Finally, making NeRF environments more interactive (as other posts have described) would unlock many use cases especially in simulation (ie: for autonomous driving).

Gaussian Splatting project and draw gaussians directly in screen space.<p>Each have various rendering artefacts. One distinction is in handling light reflections. When you use raycasting, you can bounce your ray on mirror surfaces. Where as gaussian splatting, like alice in wonderland creates a symmetric world on the other side of the mirror (and when the mirror surface is curved, it&#x27;s hopeless).<p>Although many NeRF don&#x27;t implement reflections as a simplification, they can handle them almost natively.<p>Alternatively, NeRF is a volumetric representation, whereas Gaussian Splatting has surfaces baked in : Gaussian Splats are rendered in order front to back. This mean that when you have two thin objects one behind the other, like the two sides of a book, Gaussian splatting will be able to render the front and hide the back whereas NeRF will merge front and back because volumetric element are transparent. (Though in NeRF with spherical harmonics the Radiance Field direction will allow to cull back from front based on the viewing angle).<p>- The second aspect of NeRF vs Gaussian Splatting, is the choice of representation :<p>NeRF usually use a neural network to store the scene in a compressed form. Whereas Gaussian Splatting is more explicit and uncompressed, the scene is represented in a sort of &quot;point cloud&quot; fashion. This mean that if your scene has potential for compression, like repetitive textures or objects, then the NeRF will make use of it and hallucinate what&#x27;s missing. Whereas gaussian splat will show holes.<p>Of course like this article is about, you can hybridize them.</div><br/><div id="40763573" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40763573" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xrd</span><span>|</span><a href="#40762252">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40762959">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40762417">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40763573">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40763573">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a beautiful explanation, thanks so much!</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40762417" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40762417" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zlenyk</span><span>|</span><a href="#40762252">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40762959">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40765038">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40762417">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40762417">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s just a completely different paradigm of rendering and it&#x27;s not clear which one will be dominant in the future.

The popularity of gsplats is largely due to its accessibility.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40760048" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40760048" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ofou</span><span>|</span><a href="#40762252">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40762139">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40760048">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40760048">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;d spent hours navigating Street Views with this</div><br/><div id="40760125" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40760125" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tmilard</span><span>|</span><a href="#40760048">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40762139">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40760125">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40760125">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Everyone I believe...

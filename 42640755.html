Once you get past 100 years or so it&#x27;s not even close. Even the imperfect (to say the least) social safety nets in rich countries today are far above the level they were 100 years ago, and people are better off by almost every measure. Middle class people live like royalty a few hundreds years ago, when it comes to access to healthcare, food, travel, leisure (and that&#x27;s before we talk about tech).</div><br/></div></div><div id="42671697" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42671697" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jmb99</span><span>|</span><a href="#42671371">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42671680">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42672133">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42671682">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42671697">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42671697">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think there’s a fairly reasonable argument to be made that the (super)majority people today are better off than they would have been 2-500 years ago, at least in most of the world.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42671682" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42671682" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">esperent</span><span>|</span><a href="#42671371">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42671433">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42671895">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42671682">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42671682">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">From reading around, although I didn&#x27;t find a definitive source worth sharing here, it seems like across several famines in the 1970s, somewhere in the low tens of millions died, while another several tens of millions came close to starvation.<p>So the prediction was off by an order of magnitude.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42671895" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42671895" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">glaucon</span><span>|</span><a href="#42671371">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42671379">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42671895">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42671895">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">| If I were a gambler, I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000<p>I would love to know what it was about England that meant it&#x27;s end was nigh, I mean what about France, Norway or Belgium ?<p>Also, when he said &quot;England&quot; was he actually referring to the United Kingdom (as Americans often are) or were Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland going to be spared in some way ?</div><br/></div></div><div id="42671379" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42671379" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bleuchase</span><span>|</span><a href="#42671895">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42672106">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42671379">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42671379">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Good article.

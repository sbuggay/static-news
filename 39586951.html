It helped me learn much faster when I could just ask a question out loud and get help. Same with bouncing ideas. Also rotating and wheeling over to help someone was easy. And when you needed someone from another team you could just stand up and see if they were at their table or not.<p>That lasted few years then came &quot;smart&quot; office of flexible seating. We had two desks side by side with separating sight walls in multiple rows and you had to reserve your seat the day before or risk someone removing you during the day. Here we could still somewhat maintain our teams cohesion, but no longer could you just ask questions and have it be heard by everyone nor could you just stand up and see if someone was at the office or not.<p>Now it is just random teams chats and meetings. No idea if anyone is present or reading any chats. I can shout into the void and have no responses. Of course the upside is that I can dick around all day, like now I am writing this stupid post instead of working and there isn&#x27;t even a risk someone might shoulder surf me and question if I am doing my work or not.<p>Once a week we go to the office and work in one of the few &quot;team rooms&quot; which brings back the old effectiveness and we get a lot of shit done during those days. Also I have noticed that many newer employees are lacking a lot of knowledge about processes and operations that were common knowledge before pandemic and big part of it the lack of coffee&#x2F;watercooler&#x2F;desk&#x2F;lunch talk. There is no way to just casually over hear or stumble upon or just ask about random stuff.<p>Part of me wishes we could go back to the office, but also the benefits of being able to start working an hour late and quit and hour early and just not do the work you are paid to do is too much to give up on. I held strong for couple years, but after seeing how everyone else was abusing WFH to take care of their kids or run errands during work day I also gave in.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39587140" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39587140" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">skipkey</span><span>|</span><a href="#39588529">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39587050">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39587140">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39587140">[15 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A few years back I was working in an open office setting at a games studio and I got in a discussion with the branch manager about it.  He was convinced that open office was a productivity multiplier.  I asked him who he thought the most productive developers were on the team.  When he gave me names, I pointed out that every one of them were wearing big noise-canceling headphones to block out the collaboration he thought he was fostering.  My solution was different, I usually got in at 6am when almost no one else came in before the 10am standup.  I would get most of my work done by then and then circulate and help the kids as needed.<p>To be fair, it did seem like the artists did get some benefit, but it was definitely a net negative for most of the developers.<p>I’ve been in private offices, and cubes, and open office, and honestly the most productive environment was when I was in a set of cubicles that had sliding doors, around a bullpen with multiple tables.  When you needed to go head-down to get some code down you could, but otherwise you hung out at the tables in the middle.</div><br/><div id="39587976" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39587976" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">paulus_magnus2</span><span>|</span><a href="#39587140">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39587739">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39587976">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39587976">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Please let&#x27;s not glorify working from 6am (effectively allocating time since 5am for work) unless you also left office at 2pm.

I have an office space in the living room which is what you wouldn’t want, we’ve sort of hidden it with some book shelves and some walk decorations and plants, but still, I don’t think you would want it.<p>Anyway, my daughter has a “gaming” setup at the wall next to it and it’s build into a bookcase with a folding table. When she’s not using it you genuinely can’t tell it’s there. It did require some woodworking and some creative furniture “hacking”, but neither my spouse or I are great craftspeople and I think most people would be able to do it. We found our inspiration on YouTube and some actual woodworking help for how to integrate a folding table into a bookshelf on DIY web sites.<p>It’s not for everyone, but you can do it.<p>I don’t work from home more than maybe once a week myself.

Both had obvious merits, and all three buildings were very different from each other.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="39588216" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39588216" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">srg0</span><span>|</span><a href="#39587992">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39587056">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39588216">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39588216">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Devil&#x27;s advocate.<p>Private offices facilitate sexual harassment and some other undesirable behaviors.</div><br/><div id="39588405" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39588405" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blitzar</span><span>|</span><a href="#39588216">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39588316">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39588405">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39588405">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is a decent chance that the retired old guy who is complaining about <i>kidz these days</i> not wanting to work spent from 9am till 5pm in their private office sleeping, drinking and trying to bang Doris from they typing pool.<p>This is why we cant have nice things.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39588316" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39588316" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">esskay</span><span>|</span><a href="#39588216">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39588405">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39588254">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39588316">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39588316">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s got to be the worst excuse&#x2F;reason given for forcing crummy openplan offices I&#x27;ve ever heard.

For my first job I shared a private office with one other person. For my second job I had my own private office to myself. Between those two jobs I had 7 years with either a private or a semi-private office. The depth and quality of my work definitely benefited from the long periods of uninterrupted concentration on the task at hand. I accomplished more in 2 years with a private office than I did later in ~4 years with an open office.<p>For my third jog I went to Google, where I was in open seating for about 10 years until the pandemic. The open seating was a big adjustment, but my brain was still young enough to filter out distractions well enough to get things done. My most productive work was accomplished as an individual task outside of any team effort.<p>My job after Google was with a company that had cubicles with low walls, but this was before the vaccines and so nobody was going in. I struggled to really integrate with any other teams as there was literally no face-to-face interaction. I never even met my boss in person. Again, I did accomplish some significant technical work, but they were lone projects.<p>My job after that again has open seating, Google-style. They&#x27;ve also started hot desking, so I have to reserve a desk for the days I go in. I get whatever monitor and chair are at that desk. Let&#x27;s just say that the condition of the equipment is about what you would expect if it were rented on a day-to-day basis.<p>As I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve found my ability to filter out distractions has suffered. I&#x27;ve read about some studies that suggest that this is common, perhaps even normal as the brain ages. In order to get into a deep state of concentration in an open office I need to put in noise-canceling headphones, turn on a film score, and pull the monitor close to my face so as to minimize movement in my peripheral vision. Whatever spontaneous collaboration is supposed to happen in the office isn&#x27;t happening, and I consider interrupting me while I have headphones in and am zeroed-in on a task to be actually pretty rude. That doesn&#x27;t stop some people (usually TPMs putting together a status report) from interrupting me anyway.<p>So I&#x27;m only happy coming into the office when I have a cluster of in-person meetings scheduled. I&#x27;ll jump into meeting rooms and catch people in the hallway or the micro-kitchen to sync up on one or two things that I may not get as much traction on via random Slack messages. Then I GTFO of there and back to my private office that I customized at home during the pandemic to get any real heads-down work done. Even then I am only really productive when I close Slack and email for a couple of hours.<p>Meanwhile everyone is always complaining about lack of conference or phone rooms, and so they&#x27;re trying to set up a bunch of pods throughout the office for people who need some degree of isolation for uninterrupted coding sessions or Zoom meetings. This whole thing seems really farcical to me. I joked with a co-worker, &quot;Oh, I know! We could build &#x27;pods&#x27; into the structure of the building with rectangular panes of glass and planks of wood mounted on hinges with a latch. That would make it more easy to get HVAC and sprinklers set up in the &#x27;pods&#x27; too!&quot;<p>I&#x27;d definitely come into the office for more full days if I had a private office again. As it stands I&#x27;ll come into the office as infrequently as I can and for as little time as possible. It&#x27;s just miserable compared to my workspace at home.<p>That said, if it&#x27;s at all feasible, I will refuse to take another job ever again that has mandatory office attendance policies unless they can provide me a private office.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39587769" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39587769" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">deathanatos</span><span>|</span><a href="#39587487">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39587651">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39587769">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39587769">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>In the Before Times, you just came to the office every day. It wasn’t even a question; “working from home” was just not practical. “Going to work” meant leaving the house. Then the pandemic happened.</i><p>Well, now… hold on a minute. It was entirely practical. I did it … my whole team did it. We didn&#x27;t do it 100% of the week, since the expectation was that we worked in the office, but we had an informal &quot;work from home Wednesdays&quot; that permitted us to collectively accomplish the various chores that life requires must be done inside working business hours (i.e., mostly visiting other businesses).<p>The tradeoff is pretty straight-forward: I&#x27;m going to trade the commute hours for a mix of &quot;work, not work, and getting stuff done&quot;, and my employer gets effectively the same real work out of me. That we collaborated (all took the same day) made is simpler since we knew to avoid scheduling each other for meetings that day.<p>But there was nothing that stopped that from being 5d&#x2F;wk, and I was glad I did it when the pandemic hit, since I knew that it was quiet possible to work remotely.<p>&gt; <i>Be honest now: would you want to work in that?</i><p>…but yeah, nobody. My home &quot;office&quot; (i.e., the living room) is (especially now; upgrades were made in the pandemic once it became obvious how much I&#x27;d be home) the nicest office I&#x27;ve ever worked in. Because I&#x27;ve never had an office.<p>&gt; <i>And the concept of a completely customizable workspace didn’t sit well with executives who didn’t value the individuality of their workers.</i><p>Some things never change.<p>&gt; <i>Extroverts always think, “We need more communication!</i><p>One of the things I witnessed even prior to the pandemic was that some people are truly incapable of effective communication. I had a coworker who was utterly terrible at Slack, and real difficult to handle when remote … but it wasn&#x27;t much different if you were sitting there talking to them face to face either. Bad, faulty logic, spewed as fast as the fingers would go, and often with less than a sentence per message.<p>Orgs are mostly terrible at Slack. (<i>And</i> email. And meetings.) Things lobbed into n-way DMs is terrible. If it has a topic, put it in a channel. People act like there&#x27;s a shortage of channels &amp; user groups, and they must be rationed. Same with email DLs. IT is of no help here: for whatever reason, I&#x27;m <i>forbidden</i> from creating new email DLs or channels, so it is no real wonder to find my coworkers cramming things into n-way DMs. (Thankfully Slack finally added a &quot;copy the history&quot; to DMs. So clearly Slack sort of sees the problem … just not an effective solution.)<p>And if only people could stop with the &quot;Hi.&quot; followed by line silence.<p>Meeting tech is still terrible, though. Bloated and slow, and features like {draw on screen, not banning multiple people from screen sharing, etc.} just aren&#x27;t <i>widely</i> available. Teams is <i>utterly</i> terrible, only loading successfully like half the time, and the one third-party we have to deal with, however they&#x27;re sending invites, they often don&#x27;t include a URL in the invite body, only in a non-standard (i.e., invisible in any Calendar program aside from I presume Outlook) attribute called &quot;x-skype-something-something&quot; which is a quite the tell as to Team&#x27;s roots. And I only have to use it when some other org forces me to. Even calls <i>with Microsoft themselves</i> will run into technical issues.<p>… and it seems like some orgs (users of Zendesk in particular, maybe?) expect one to auth by sending from the contact email on the account. Except that it&#x27;s a DL, such that emails can reach my whole team, and sending <i>from</i> a DL is utter black magic. (But possible, it turns out!)<p>And like, one wonders … y&#x27;all know you can edit messages in Slack and correct your typos, …right? The amount of politely worded &quot;parse error in English, line 1&quot; replies I have to send is kinda ridiculous. There&#x27;s &quot;they made a typo&quot; and then there&#x27;s me, cocking my head, trying to find a parse that even remotely makes any sense at all. That XKCD YT feature of reading your comment back to you could make a comeback.<p>We need people to work on their writing skills. I don&#x27;t know how, though.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39587651" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39587651" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tehjoker</span><span>|</span><a href="#39587769">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39587651">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39587651">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">workplaces still do not have adequate COVID-19 controls, so offices are disabling and deadly places.<p>the risk of being an office worker used to be tripping on the stairs, car crash while commuting, or sitting too much. now it means contracting a deadly virus multiple times a year.<p>it&#x27;s too bad OSHA doesn&#x27;t set minimum standards here.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

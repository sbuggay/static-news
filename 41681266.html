Allow building against packages without installing them. The core issue here is that Gentoo package build and install happen as a single step: one can&#x27;t &quot;build a bunch of things that depend on one another&quot; and then &quot;atomically install all the build items into place&quot;. This means that Gentoo can easily be partially broken when one is doing updates when an ABI change occurs (modulo so versioning, see next option). This issue with 64-bit time_t is an example of an ABI change that folks are very aware of and is very widespread. It&#x27;s also an example of something that causes an ABI change that isn&#x27;t handled by the normal `.so` versioning scheme (see next option).<p>2. Extend the normal `.so` versioning to capture changes to the ABI of packages caused by packages they depend on. Normally, every `.so` (shared object&#x2F;library) embeds a version number within it, and is also installed with that version number in the file name (`libfoo.so.1.0.0`, for example, would be the real `.so` file, and would have a symlink from `libfoo.so` to tell the linker which `.so` to use). This shared object version is normally managed by the package itself internally (iow: every package decides on their ABI version number to enable them to track their own internal ABI breakages). This allows Gentoo to upgrade without breaking everything while an update is going on as long as every package manages their `.so` version perfectly correctly (not a given, but does help in many cases). There is a process in Gentoo to remove old `.so.x.y.z` files that are no longer used after an install completes. What we&#x27;d need to do to support 64-bit time_t is add another component to this version that can be controlled by the inherited ABI of dependencies of each `.so`. This is very similar in result to the &quot;use a different libdir&quot; option from the post, but while it has the potential to set things up to enable the same kinds of ABI changes to be made in the future, it&#x27;s likely that fixing this would be more invasive than using a different libdir.</div><br/><div id="41682338" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41682338" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">akira2501</span><span>|</span><a href="#41681949">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41682366">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41682338">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41682338">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Allow building against packages without installing them.<p>A partial staged update system would work the best.

We now have a `&#x2F;tmp&#x2F;new` with `libA.so` built for 64-bit time_t. We now want to build `B` for `ROOT=&#x2F;tmp&#x2F;new` with 64-bit time_t and have it link against the new `&#x2F;tmp&#x2F;new&#x2F;lib&#x2F;libA.so`.<p>But setting `ROOT=&#x2F;tmp&#x2F;new` doesn&#x27;t cause us to use the `&#x2F;tmp&#x2F;new` to as our source to link against things.

(in which case, Gentoo should fix&#x2F;clarify it).<p>&quot;link&quot; has 2 meanings:<p>1. As you&#x27;ve pointed at, at runtime we have linking occur that reads files.<p>2. Additionally, building software with `gcc`&#x2F;etc, we tell it what libraries it needs to link against (`-lA`). When we do that, `gcc` as part of the build process searches for `libA.so` (in various locations dependent on its configuration and arguments), reads the `libA.so` file, and uses that info to determine what to emit in the object file that `gcc` is building. So we need to read a shared library. The same is true for headers used at build time. How much this actually ends up mattering varies depending on architectural details, and whether libraries have different symbols exposed (or generate different header files) depending on what the bit-width of time_t is. It may well be that for most packages we could have the build-time linking occur against a 32-bit time_t object as long as runtime linking is done to the 64-bit time_t object (assuming one is using identical package versions or at least versions with a compatible ABI).</div><br/><div id="41684168" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41684168" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aaronmdjones</span><span>|</span><a href="#41681949">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41684104">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41683154">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41684168">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41684168">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; and whether libraries have different symbols exposed (or generate different header files) depending on what the bit-width of time_t is<p>Hmm.

I got to set the fundamental types in the ABI and decided to look forward rather than backward.<p>The amd64 architecture did have some interesting features that made this much easier than it might have been for other cpu architectures.  One of which was the automatic cast of 32 bit function arguments to 64 bit during the function call.  In most cases, if you passed a 32 bit time integer to a function expecting a 64 bit time_t, it Just Worked(TM) during the platform bringup.  This meant that a lot of the work on the loose ends could be deferred.<p>We did have some other 64 bit platforms at the time, but they did not have a 64 bit time_t.  FreeBSD&#x2F;amd64 was the first in its family, back in 2003&#x2F;2004&#x2F;2005.  If I remember correctly, sparc64 migrated to 64 bit time_t.<p>The biggest problem that I faced was that (at the time) tzcode was not 64 bit safe.  It used some algorithms in its &#x27;struct tm&#x27; normalization that ended up in some rather degenerate conditions, eg: iteratively trying to calculate the day&#x2F;month&#x2F;year for time_t(2^62).  IIRC, I cheated rather than change tzcode significantly, and made it simply fail for years before approx 1900, or after approx 10000.  I am pretty sure that this has been fixed upstream in tzcode long ago.<p>We did have a few years of whackamole with occasional 32&#x2F;64 time mixups where 3rd party code would be sloppy in its handling of int&#x2F;long&#x2F;time_t when handling data structures in files or on the network.<p>But for the most part, it was a non-issue for us.  Being able to have 64 bit time_t on day 1 avoided most of the problem.  Doing it from the start was easy.  Linux missed a huge opportunity to do the same when it began its amd64&#x2F;x86_64 port.<p>Aside: I did not finish 64 bit ino_t at the time. 32 bit inode numbers were heavily exposed in many, many places.   Even on-disk file systems, directory structures in UFS, and many, many more. There was no practical way to handle it for FreeBSD&#x2F;amd64 from the start while it was a low-tier platform without being massively disruptive to the other tier-1 architectures.  I did the work - twice - but somebody else eventually finished it - and fixed a number of other unfortunately short constants as well (eg: mountpoint path lengths etc).</div><br/><div id="41685678" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41685678" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jabl</span><span>|</span><a href="#41684857">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41682010">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41685678">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41685678">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">AFAIU all 64-bit Linux ports have used 64-bit time_t, off_t, ino_t from the beginning.

The issue is fundamental to any low level language: the size of a type is a part of its public API (well, ABI), by definition. This is true in C++ with private fields as well, for example: if you add a private field to a class, or change the type of a private field with one of a different size, all code using that class has to be re-built. The only way to abstract this is to use types strictly through pointers, the way Java does.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41682496" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41682496" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wpollock</span><span>|</span><a href="#41681758">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41683239">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41682496">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41682496">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m probably naive, but I see another way forward.

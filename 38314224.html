Most parents either don’t enable the controls, or never use devices while those controls are active. It’s a user experience that is not tested in real world conditions very much.<p>And the people that do experience it, children, obviously don’t want it enabled whether it works or not. They’re not going to go reporting bugs, lol! What parents consider bugs are actually features for the children.<p>Only the kind of adult that wrote this blog post actually uses devices that have parental controls enabled, and sees how they actually work.<p>The author suggests that companies should make their parental controls work to stave off government regulation. I think there’s actually a midway solution.<p>I don’t want to see a government put its hand on the wheel and do the controls themselves. Instead, the government should regulate the companies and use the force of law to get them to make their parental controls work. Create a standard for parental control features that must be offered, tested, and working. If a platform doesn’t have the controls available that actually work, then you can’t sell it.<p>If a government tells Apple it can’t sell iPhones until it fixes these problems with screen time, or that Nintendo can’t sell switches until it fixes their issues, then you can be damn sure they’ll be fixed within the week.</div><br/><div id="38316977" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38316977" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nirui</span><span>|</span><a href="#38314999">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38315074">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38316977">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38316977">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; This is because software engineers never actually use devices that have parental controls enabled<p>Well, I do. Back when I was ~13 years-old I tried to block one of my parent from visiting gambling sites with the parental control feature in Internet Explorer ~6 so they can&#x27;t download virus, and I do have Software Engineer in my job title. Unless of course by &quot;software engineers&quot; you specifically mean the period of life after one been granted with that title, then in that case you won.<p>Of course, my parental control efforts never worked. As many security researchers has suggested in many different ways, it is hard to deploy security if the attacker can touch the hardware. One&#x27;s parent can just pay someone to reinstall the OS, removing every trace of your security measures along with all the projects that you&#x27;ve saved on that computer. In addition to that, the parent could also administer a reasonable dose of beating enough to convince you to not deploy any similar measures on the newly installed pirated OS ever again, and given the fact that the OS is already preloaded with adware and viruses, there is no point of doing that anyways, so you give up with them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38315074" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38315074" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hotnfresh</span><span>|</span><a href="#38314999">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38316977">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38315899">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38315074">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38315074">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; This is because software engineers never actually use devices that have parental controls enabled.<p>Yeah, it’s super-obvious.

Kids are cute and annoying. You love them but they will drive you nuts if you don&#x27;t drain their energy and attention.<p>The previous solution to this was that parents booted their kids out of the house and made them play outside. This has somehow gone from normal parenting to abusive behavior that could get you arrested in some places with a possibility of losing the child.<p>So instead, we throw tvs, ipads, and phones at them just so we can get a modicum of quiet. Not surprisingly, each one of those is bad for the kid. The developmental problem is screen time but the scary one is strangers on the Internet. Elsa Gate upset a lot of people, and that&#x27;s not the worst thing that happens.<p>Policing the Internet is a bad decision. Any Internet Safety Committee will eventually be staffed by the people you would least like to be there. That&#x27;s especially problematic because one person&#x27;s bad guy is another person&#x27;s hero a lot of the time. Although this is the inevitable future due to increasing clamor by Internet companies for regulatory capture, it won&#x27;t even be effective.<p>Parental controls never work. Your kid has way more time and motivation to figure out workarounds, even if the parents and the company set everything correctly. Everyone also knows that there will be at least one friend whose parents don&#x27;t care. This is true whether the parental controls are local or done by a central committee.<p>The only solution to this mess is:<p>* Remove the insane laws and policies that prevent parents from letting their children play outside, especially unaccompanied.<p>* Educate parents on the importance of moderating and monitoring electronics use.<p>* Educate parents on how to educate their children about the dangers of the Internet, especially social media, pornography, and pedophiles.<p>* Accept that some parents don&#x27;t care and will neglect their children no matter what you do. Instead, empower the parents that do care to easily and safely raise their children.</div><br/><div id="38315091" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38315091" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blatherard</span><span>|</span><a href="#38314727">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38316988">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38315091">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38315091">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">By middle school most kids are effectively required to be on their computers and&#x2F;or phones on a daily basis to even just do their homework.

This study found that the use of active mediation was associated with a decrease in victimisation, whereas restrictive parental mediation was not only unhelpful, it actually <i>increased</i> the risk of victimisation. In the discussion section, the authors reference several other studies that also suggest restrictive parental mediation is <i>worse than doing nothing</i> when it comes to stopping online victimisation.<p>The APA appear to go out of their way in the guidance to explain that what <i>they</i> mean by “adult monitoring” is open coaching and discussion, not spying and blocking, but this sort of distinction seems to be missed or deliberately ignored in many discussions about online safety.<p>As such, the source of the problem here doesn’t appear to be that the tools are inadequate at their jobs, but rather that they’re all fundamentally the <i>wrong tools</i>. In this case, no amount of engineering can solve it. Given this, perhaps the question should not be “What parental controls?”, but rather, “Should these kinds of restrictive parental controls even exist?”<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apa.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;social-media-internet&#x2F;health-advisory-adolescent-social-media-use" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apa.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;social-media-internet&#x2F;health-advi...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1016&#x2F;j.compedu.2020.104026" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1016&#x2F;j.compedu.2020.104026</a><p>[2] Definition from the study: “Instructive mediation […] explicitly involves children in the process of online monitoring. For instance, a parent adopting an instructive approach might appraise their children of the potential harms of certain online material, the appropriateness of sharing personal information online, and the latent danger of interacting with strangers on social media platforms.”<p>[3] Also from the study: “Restrictive mediation does not directly include children in the intervention process. Rather, it involves the curtailing of cyber-routines through blocking software or parental monitoring of children&#x27;s online habits and associations.

  - Microsoft makes it almost impossible to do simple things like allow child to buy a Minecraft realm. 10’s of clicks, errors and weird flows

  - parental controls don’t cross ecosystem, and no federation, so you have to setup each service independently

  - there’s no way for the device parental controls to influence web based services

  - there’s no way on Apple devices to allow a particular show, but in general restrict mature content. E.g. if a parent has different standards for violence, language or sexuality.

The right solution is to put full control in parent’s hands (no saying 12 year olds can’t do X), support making device restrictions that are inherited by any application or site on it.<p>And as others have said, incentive companies to remove bugs and make the solutions workable and not easily exploitable.

It’s better than what schools offered with Chromebooks, which were effectively wide open and didn’t allow any parent restrictions for time or content.</div><br/><div id="38315806" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38315806" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ec109685</span><span>|</span><a href="#38315307">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38315004">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38315806">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38315806">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Apple’s App Store rules prevents MDM for parental control apps.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38315004" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38315004" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">treyd</span><span>|</span><a href="#38315307">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38315736">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38315004">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38315004">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A lot of the first set of points seem to be a result of Microsoft&#x27;s self-sabotaging.

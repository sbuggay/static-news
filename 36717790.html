I am willing to quit before doing anything to throw them under the bus or be fired before remaining silent if they are treated unfairly. This does not imply corruption or favoritism, just a lot of transparency. If I think they have a lot of potential, I try to help them optimize their career growth even if this means they may one day overtake me and I end up reporting to them. If I don&#x27;t think they are likely to be successful in their current team or company, I will suggest alternatives and invest my personal time in helping them apply for a transfer or an outside job. If required to mislead people on matters that are important to their long term wellbeing, I will refuse to do so and accept getting fired as a consequence.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s one reason I am not a manager, but I do feel my current manager, unlike a couple of others before, is in this ballpark. In these conditions, I do feel there is space for genuine friendships. A true friend is respectful of their friends station in life. If you are friends with someone in more humble financial circumstances than yourself, you go to affordable places for get togethers. If you are friends with someone more junior professionally, you make sure that personal and professional boundaries are clearly separated and that you will never act to their detriment for your own selfish gain. If it&#x27;s a real friendship, they will also understand that you have your job to do and so do they.<p>Now if you plan to use people for your own ends, it&#x27;s certainly very creepy and unfair to imply you care about them on a personal level. But on the other hand, who wouldn&#x27;t want a senior person at a new company to be their mentor and ally? Act with honesty, compassion and integrity and then friendships are not a problem.</div><br/><div id="36719578" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36719578" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">slg</span><span>|</span><a href="#36719301">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36719890">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36719578">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36719578">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;More of a tech lead myself, but my personal policy is that I put my coworkers above my career.

The strong desire <i>to dictate how the relationship will flow</i> is the little monkey inside coming out to show dominance. In extreme cases, managers show off by neglecting their leadership duties under the guise of being friendly but actually just lazing around in a conspicuous consumption style display. Humans are very tuned to status, his reports were not fooled for a moment. Unless they were hopelessly naive, they knew that this man could get them fired.<p>A much fairer and more effective approach is to focus on the realities of the situation as best as is possible. Don&#x27;t pretend to be equal, you have more power. Don&#x27;t pretend to be better, you&#x27;re just another opinion as far as the realities of the situation are concerned. Only force someone to do something if there is a reason or a necessity to it, ideally just find the overlap between what the reports think is high value work and what you agree with them on. Be scrupulously fair and reasonable, fight instinct and bias.<p>There is no such thing as autonomy when a manager&#x27;s opinions will influence how a report&#x27;s career progresses. To pretend otherwise is negligent, unprofessional management. Managers have power, they should exercise their influence to the betterment of their team. People in notional positions of leadership have a responsibility to make sure people are going somewhere that is better than where they are. Good managers lead. Although sometimes they lead by identifying a technical expert and leaving them alone to do something.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36718413" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36718413" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BaseballPhysics</span><span>|</span><a href="#36720774">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36718790">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36718413">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36718413">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m gonna echo a number of other folks here and also disagree.<p>Maintaining a strong personal relationship with staff doesn&#x27;t preclude giving tough feedback; on the contrary, it supports it by creating a base of trust that you can rely on when things get difficult.<p>Even letting someone go can be done with compassion, and that is supported by a strong relationship.</div><br/><div id="36719759" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36719759" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">t1mmen</span><span>|</span><a href="#36718413">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36718468">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36719759">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36719759">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree with your disagreement.<p>OP says:<p>&gt; And worst of all, as is happening to the friend I mentioned, you will have to lay-off people who don’t deserve it, just because the company says so.

I am very puzzled by this as the people leaving manager A always say the best things about him. But his team is now less than half the size of manager B&#x27;s, and almost entirely recent college grads.</div><br/><div id="36719745" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36719745" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">_ah</span><span>|</span><a href="#36718643">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36720224">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36719745">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36719745">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If everyone has good things to say on their way out the door, that means that Manager A is a &quot;Good Person&quot;. So I can think of two reasons to leave:<p>1. Manager A is a Good Person but actually an incompetent manager. Everyone likes him, but he&#x27;s terrible at teaching people and developing their careers. Eventually, people go elsewhere for growth.<p>2. Manager A is actually fantastic as career development, so much so that he convinces his team that they are capable of so much more. He builds them up and then sends them out into the world with his blessing to do something bigger.<p>FWIW, I think option #1 is most likely.<p>For Manager B, this is a person who is steady and low drama, but also not super invested on the personal level. Likely does what he has to for his team, and the folks who stay are not super ambitious but also appreciate the low drama environment.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

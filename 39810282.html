Lack of a robust language to describe taste and smell<p>2. Variation between people in taste and smell sensitivity levels for individual flavor&#x2F;smell compounds.  It’s like how it would be difficult to talk about color if there were thousands of different kinds of colorblindness and everybody was randomly one kind.<p>You have to train yourself for a very long time to isolate and identify the many many different flavored compounds and then when you do there isn’t any universal language to have a conversation about them.<p>The terroir business is similar.  Clearly fruit grown in very different places tastes very different, anybody can experience this.  When it comes to the fine details though the signal to noise goes way down because of the same lack of language and taste consistency.<p>Add on the people trying to appear like they know what they’re talking about and you get this mass of nonsense which is very loosely connected with reality.</div><br/><div id="39813554" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39813554" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eszed</span><span>|</span><a href="#39812071">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39812505">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39812984">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39813554">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39813554">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Agree with everything you say. Wine experts do try to use a common vocabulary, but it&#x27;s a bit of the competing standards problem [relevant XKCD goes here]. Most of the wine training I received working in the restaurant industry was vocab words to generate up-sells, and <i>most</i> amateur wine snobs don&#x27;t know enough not to fall for it.<p>I did have a fascinating experience, a bit more than twenty years ago, which pulled back a curtain onto a more interesting reality. I was working in private dining for a winery, one of the perks of which was getting to take home quite a bit of wine and food. One time I got offered the leftovers from a vertical tasting - that&#x27;s every vintage of a particular wine - from their top-end estate-grown bottling. It was 15-20 bottles, I can&#x27;t remember exactly, all half to three-quarters full.<p>Anyway, we decided to do it properly, and tasted them all blind. (I mean, how often do you get a chance to do that with close to five retail figures of wine? Most of us were in wine or food or associated industries, anyway, so it was going to be a good story, and bragging rights, if nothing else.) I think there were six or eight of us - me, my flatmate, the three girls from next door, and a couple of hangers on - and we all (without conferring) agreed on the three best vintages. Some of us ranked them ABC, some BCA, etc, but it was those three in all cases.<p>I went back to work a few days later, and told the wine maker 1) Thank you, and 2) you might be interested to know, blah blah blah. His immediate response? Oh, yeah, it was years ABC, wasn&#x27;t it? Which it exactly was.<p>So, there&#x27;s a lot of wine bullshit, but not all of it is.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39812984" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39812984" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jojobas</span><span>|</span><a href="#39812071">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39812505">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39813554">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39812006">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39812984">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39812984">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The same professional taster will at times assign different ratings and features to five glasses poured from the same bottle, and they consistently give typical red wine characteristics to white wine with added odourless tasteless dye.<p>It&#x27;s 90% bullshit science and 10% basic measurable characteristics.<p>Interesting how in the beer industry it&#x27;s much less bullshity, with multiple characteristics objectively measured both at raw materials stage (hops alpha&#x2F;beta acid content, essential oil etc, yeast alcohol limit , malt diastatic power) and different stages of beer production (wort specific gravity, fermentation progress etc).</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39812006" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39812006" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwup238</span><span>|</span><a href="#39812071">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39812057">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39812006">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39812006">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;fsXSP" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;fsXSP</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20240322034212&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;21&#x2F;us&#x2F;the-lone-volcano-in-californias-central-valley.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20240322034212&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytim...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39812057" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39812057" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pfdietz</span><span>|</span><a href="#39812006">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39813026">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39812057">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39812057">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Geology Hub on this feature:   <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Rmfi2JaThSE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Rmfi2JaThSE</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39813026" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39813026" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">davidw</span><span>|</span><a href="#39812057">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39812853">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39813026">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39813026">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve driven by that on I-5 a number of times.<p>Another one that jumped out at me were the cinder cones north  of St George Utah.

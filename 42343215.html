The ARC-AGI benchmark remains unbeaten and I think we can now definitely say &quot;yes&quot;.<p>One big update since June is that progress is no longer stalled. Coming into 2024, the public consensus vibe was that pure deep learning &#x2F; LLMs would continue scaling to AGI. The fundamental architecture of these systems hasn&#x27;t changed since ~2019.<p>But this flipped late summer. AlphaProof and o1 are evidence of this new reality. All frontier AI systems are now incorporating components beyond pure deep learning like program synthesis and program search.<p>I believe ARC Prize played a role here too. All the winners this year are leveraging new AGI reasoning approaches like deep-learning guided program synthesis, and test-time training&#x2F;fine-tuning. We&#x27;ll be seeing a lot more of these in frontier AI systems in coming years.<p>And I&#x27;m proud to say that all the code and papers from this year&#x27;s winners are now open source!<p>We&#x27;re going to keep running this thing annually until its defeated. And we&#x27;ve got ARC-AGI-2 in the works to improve on several of the v1 flaws (more here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arcprize.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;arc-prize-2024-winners-technical-report" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arcprize.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;arc-prize-2024-winners-technical-r...</a>)<p>The ARC-AGI community keeps surprising me. From initial launch, through o1 testing, to the final 48 hours when the winning team jumped 10% and both winning papers dropped out of nowhere. I&#x27;m incredibly grateful to everyone and we will do our best to steward this attention towards AGI.<p>We&#x27;ll be back in 2025!</div><br/><div id="42344486" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42344486" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tbalsam</span><span>|</span><a href="#42343621">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42344483">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42344486">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42344486">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a rather experienced ML researcher, ARC is a great benchmark on its own, but is punching below its weight in terms of claiming that it is a gate (or in terms of this post -- a &quot;steward&quot;) towards AGI, and in my perspective and the perspective of several researchers near me this has watered down the value of the ARC benchmark as a test.<p>It is a great unit test for reasoning -- that&#x27;s fantastic! And maybe it is indeed the best way to test for this -- who knows  exactly. But the claim is a little grandiose for what it is, this is somewhat similar to saying that testing on string parity is the One True Test for testing an optimizer&#x27;s efficiency.<p>I&#x27;d heartily recommend maybe taking down the marketing vibrance down a notch and keep things a bit more measured, it&#x27;s not entirely a meme, though some of the more-serious researchers don&#x27;t take it as seriously as a result. And that&#x27;s the kind of people that you want to attract to this sort of thing!<p>I think there is a potentially good future for ARC!

ARC Prize&#x27;s 2024 messaging was sharp to break through the noise floor -- ARC has been around since 2019 but most only learned about it this summer.

I&#x27;m not an academic researcher but I am quite sensitive to hype and excessive marketing. I&#x27;ve never felt the ARC site was anything other than appropriately professional.<p>Even revisiting it now, I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with being concisely clear and even a little provocative in stating your case on your own site. Especially since a key value of ARC is getting more objectively grounded regarding progress toward AGI. On top of that ARC is &quot;A non-profit for the public advancement of open artificial general intelligence&quot; that you guys are personally donating serious money and time to that&#x27;s helping a field where a lot of entrepreneurs are going to make money and academics are going to advance their careers.<p>My perception is ARC tried it the other way for years but a lot of academics and AI pundits ignored or dismissed it without ever meaningfully engaging with it. &quot;Sharpening&quot; the message this year has clearly paid off in bringing attention that&#x27;s shifted the conversation and is helping advance progress toward AGI in ways nothing else has. I also greatly appreciate the time and care you and Francois have put into making the ARC proposition clear enough for non-technical people to understand. That&#x27;s hard to do and doesn&#x27;t happen by accident.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve found ARC valuable in the real world outside of academia and domain experts because it provides a conceptually simple starting place to discuss with non-technical people what the term AGI might even mean. My high school-aged daughter asked me about vague AGI impending doom scenarios she heard on TikTok. I had her solve a couple ARC samples and then pointed out that today&#x27;s best AIs aren&#x27;t yet close to doing the same. This counter-intuitive revelation got her pondering the &quot;Why?&quot; which led to a deep discussion about the multi-dimensional breadth of human creativity and an appreciation of the many ways artificial intelligences might differ from human intelligence.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42345611" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42345611" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tbalsam</span><span>|</span><a href="#42343621">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42345467">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42346013">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42345477">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42345611">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42345611">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Now that the AI research field is coming around to the idea that something beyond deep learning is needed,<p>I have not heard this from anyone that I work with! It would be a curious violation of info theory were this to be the case.<p>Certainly, some things cannot efficiently be learned from data. This is a case where some other kind of inductive bias or prior is needed (again, from info theory) -- but replacing deep learning entirely would be rather silly.<p>Part of the reason that a number of researchers don&#x27;t take the benchmark more seriously is because it&#x27;s meant to cripple the results. For example, in the name of reducing brute force search, the compute was severely limited! This turned many off to begin with. The general contention as I understand was to let compute be a reasonable amount, but this would not play well with the numbers game. Because if you restrict compute beyond a reasonable point, it makes the numbers artificially low for people who don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes. And this ends up biasing the results unreasonably to favor the original messaging, (i.e., &quot;We need something other than deep learning.&quot;)<p>If it was structured with a reasonable amount of compute, and instead, time-accuracy gates were used for prizes, it would be much more open. But people do not use it because the game is rigged to begin with!<p>Unfortunately due to that, plus the consistent goal-post moving of the benchmark is why it&#x27;s generally not really held with staying power in the research community -- the messaging changes based upon what is convenient for publicity, and there&#x27;s unfortunately been a history of similar things in the past in the pedigree leading up to the ARC prize itself.<p>It is not entirely unsalvageable, but there really needs to be a turnaround of how the competition and prize is managed in order to win back people&#x27;s trust. Placing a thumb on the scales to confirm a prior bias&#x2F;previous messaging may work for a little while, but over time it robs the metric of its usability over time as the greater research community loses trust.</div><br/><div id="42346093" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42346093" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">WhitneyLand</span><span>|</span><a href="#42343621">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42345611">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42345477">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42346093">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42346093">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think youâre overly fixated on some minor points relative to the overall utility on offer here.

The best one is OpenAI o1-preview at 18%. This is significantly worse than the purpose-built models like ARChitects (which scored 53.5). This model used TTT to train on the ARC-AGI task specification (amoung other things). It seems that even if someone creates a model that can &quot;solve&quot; ARC, it still is not indicative of AGI since it is not &quot;general&quot; anymore, it is just specialized to this particular task. Similar to how chess engines are not AGI, despite being superhuman at chess. It will be much more convincing when general models not trained specifically for ARC can still score well on it.<p>They do mention that some of the tasks here are susceptible to brute force and they plan to address that in ARC-AGI-2.<p>&gt; nearly half (49%) of the private evaluation set was solved by at least one team during the original 2020 Kaggle competition all of which were using some variant of brute-force program search.

I note that the second best system is based on an LLM with &quot;test time training&quot; where the first two steps are:<p><pre><code>  initial finetuning on similar tasks 
  auxiliary task format and augmentations

Which is to say, a data augmentation approach.

How do you quantify how many bits it takes a human mind to solve one of the ARC problems?<p>That seems likely beyond the level of insight we have into the structure of cognition and information storage etc etc in wetware. I could of course be wrong and would love to be corrected if so! You mentioned a âtiny portionâ of the human mind, but (as far as Iâm aware), any given âsmallâ part of human cognition still involves huge amounts of complexity and compute.<p>Maybe you are saying that the high level decision making a human goes through when solving can be represented with a relatively small number of pieces of information&#x2F;logical operations (as opposed to a much lower level notion closer to the wetware of the quantity of information) but then it seems unfair to compare to the low level equivalent (weights &amp; biases, FLOPs etc) in the ML system when there may be higher order equivalents.<p>I do appreciate the general notion of wanting to normalize against <i>something</i> though, and some notion of information seems like a reasonable choice, but practically out of our reach. Maybe something like peak power or total energy consumption would be a more reasonable choice, which we can at least get a lower and upper bounds on in the human case (metabolic rates are pretty well studied, and even if we donât have a good idea of how much energy is involved in completing cognitive tasks we can at least get bounds for running the entire system in that period of time) and close to a precise value in the ML case.</div><br/><div id="42345690" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42345690" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aithrowawaycomm</span><span>|</span><a href="#42344336">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42345261">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42346897">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42345690">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42345690">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was speaking loosely but the operative term is &quot;information thermodynamics&quot;: comparing bits of AI output versus bits of <i>intentional</i> human thought, ignoring statistical&#x2F;physical bits related to ANN inference or biological neuron activity.

There&#x27;s a big mess of ANN linear algebra &#x2F; human subconscious thought and I agree these messes can&#x27;t be compared (or even identified in the human case). But we can compare the efficiency of the solution. It is possible that subconsciously humans &quot;generate&quot; hundreds of solutions that are mostly discarded, but I don&#x27;t think the brain is fast enough to do that at the speed of conscious thought: it&#x27;s a 50bn core processor but each core is only 200Hz and they aren&#x27;t general-purpose CPUs. It also seems inconsistent with how humans solve these problems.<p>I believe energy usage would be even more misleading: in terms of operations&#x2F;second a human brain is comparable to a 2020s supercomputer running at 30MW, but it only consumes 300 watts.

I was trying to allude to what you are describing with the bit (ha) I mentioned about higher order thinking but you obviously articulated it much more effectively.<p>I guess Iâm not sure itâs obvious where the right line to draw the boundary for âintentional human thoughtâ is? Surely there is a lot of cognition and representation going on at extraordinary speeds that exist in some hazy border region between instinct&#x2F;reflex&#x2F;subconscious and conscious thought.  Still, having said that, I do see what you are saying about trying to compare the complexity of the formal path to the solution, or at least what the human thinks their formal path was.<p>Iâm generally of the mind (also, ha) that we wonât really ever be able to quantify any of this in a meaningful way in the short term and if anything which qualifies as AGI does emerge, it might only be something which is an âI know it when I see itâ kind of evaluationâ¦<p>Where are you getting 300W from? The body only dumps 100W of heat at rest and uses like 300-400W during moderate physical activity, so Iâm a little confused about what you are describing there. The typical estimates Iâve seen are like 20W or so for the brain.<p>Edit: I should also say that what you describe does seem like a great way to compare solutions between computational systems currently being developed and a good one to use to try to push development forward; it just seems quixotic to try to be able to use it comparatively with human cognition or to be able to meaningfully use it to define where AGI is, which might not be what you were advocating for at all, in which case, sorry for misinterpreting!</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42346897" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42346897" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nnx</span><span>|</span><a href="#42344336">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42347358">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42346897">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42346897">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m unable to figure out how to solve current Daily Puzzle (Puzzle ID: 79369cc6) at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arcprize.org&#x2F;play" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arcprize.org&#x2F;play</a><p>Either I&#x27;m really dumb or the test is getting into captcha-like territory where humans aren&#x27;t really good at solving&#x2F;deciphering the test anymore.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42347358" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42347358" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jebarker</span><span>|</span><a href="#42346897">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42345844">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42347358">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42347358">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m a little surprised by the seeming enthusiasm in the report for TTT as an approach.

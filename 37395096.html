That means thinking about how the humidity sensor is affected by ambient conditions (including the packaging bag, that one has bit me in the past) and having a plan for re-calibration if drift becomes too great. That means picking connectors for your wire harnesses that can handle the number of times you expect to connect&#x2F;disconnect them over the course of your things lifespan. That means tuning the length of that wire harness so you can&#x27;t damage it when you open the enclosure to change the battery or whatever. It means thinking about how ambient conditions affect the rest of the design, so you don&#x27;t have to clean the contacts on all the wire harnesses every so often, because you didn&#x27;t get gold contacts for both the harnesses <i>and</i> the connectors, and you live in a high humidity environment.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m self-taught on virtually all of these points, it <i>is</i> achievable for the hobbyist. Just understand that swapping out one smart relay controller for another is pretty far from having a smart relay controller you&#x27;d even give to your sister-in-law for Christmas.</div><br/><div id="37396933" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37396933" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">generj</span><span>|</span><a href="#37396537">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37397436">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37396933">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37396933">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m a big proponent of open source hardware but as your post shows it often involves skills of many disciplines that requires vigorous thought or trial and error. Electronics and physics are unforgiving in a way processors are not.<p>Even after reaching the prototype phase, the open source hardware is probably only useful to one person: it’s creator.<p>There is a big difference between making a prototype and detailing the build in sufficient detail other hobbyists can replicate it &#x2F; modify &#x2F; use it. Documenting hardware is substantially harder than documenting software. If the project is cool a bunch of people will be excited to jump in; some of these people have zero experience soldering or ordering laser cut parts or whatever. Supporting them is hard.<p>Then another step up to sell the design to other hobbyists, even just a few extra copies on Tindie.<p>And then a huge step up from that to selling to the general public, where suddenly FCC interference certifications are needed and the company is liable if the design burns down a few houses. There’s a reason firms making hardware have real engineers on staff held to  professional standards. Plus all the cash flow and business concerns when the marginal cost per unit isn’t under 1 cent like software.<p>Each of these steps often involves multiple iterations of hardware and therefore lead time and cost.</div><br/><div id="37399979" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37399979" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacquesm</span><span>|</span><a href="#37396537">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37396933">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37397572">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37399979">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37399979">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Even seasoned professionals can get caught in the gap between &#x27;prototype&#x27; and &#x27;production grade&#x27; especially for things that are on the margin of what can be done with a particular hardware recipe.

Learning those as a hobbyist is <i>incredibly</i> difficult, and most of the time you essentially end up cargo culting what everyone else is doing - and there is no guarantee that everyone else is doing the right thing either! It is really easy to end up wasting hundreds if not thousands of dollars like this.<p>This is exactly why companies like Adafruit have become so big. They take care of all the hard part, and provide the hobbyists with essentially a bunch of lego bricks which neatly click together. The only thing you have to do yourself is... the software.</div><br/><div id="37402740" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37402740" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacquesm</span><span>|</span><a href="#37396537">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37402644">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37398358">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37402740">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37402740">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve never spent as much time on hardware bugs as I&#x27;ve spent on software bugs.

What really helps is to have access to good measuring tools and to know how to use them, as well as people with more experience than you to help guide you.<p>Stuff exploding or bursting into flames I&#x27;ve seen exactly once, on one of the most trivial circuits I ever built: a small boost converter for a windmill to charge batteries in low wind conditions. It worked extremely well. Until I disconnected the battery for service and then the boost converter kept on increasing its output voltage until the capacitors let out the magic smoke. Other than that stuff occasionally breaks. Oh, and if you do do RF stuff: beware of RF burns, that is a real risk, coils and capacitors in high power RF circuits should be treated with proper respect.<p>I&#x27;d be much more wary of Lithium-Ion batteries than analog stuff and buck-boost converters are cheaper to source as complete units than to build yourself (though you definitely can if you want). Your typical hobbyist isn&#x27;t going to start off by building themselves an large inverter or a HVDC interconnect. They&#x27;re going to build amplifiers, other audio gear and maybe some measuring kit or digital devices. Sound generators, function generators and so on.<p>By the time you reach the stage where you need to design a resonant LC circuit you&#x27;ll have picked up a lot of working knowledge and some of that will tell you what bits to avoid and what bits you can probably handle.<p>I know plenty of HAMs that know enough math to be dangerous but they usually would not be able to do really complex stuff without access to tools (though I also know some HAMs that definitely would be able to do really complex stuff, they also have the corresponding higher level license).<p>Let&#x27;s not pretend that everybody that builds electronics for hobby purposes is a math wizard, it just isn&#x27;t true. Though it definitely doesn&#x27;t hurt to have a basic understanding of RC and LC circuitry and to understand how to use op amps and other interesting components like that. Applying those is vastly different from designing them from scratch.<p>Also: quite a few people have a ton of fun just building kits and slowly expanding their knowledge and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.

Recently have started to dabble more in embedded devices. I am building a well water level sensor. First I tried to use an NRF based board, but I got bogged down with the SDK ecosystem, it&#x27;s really meant for experienced embedded engineers of companies. Then I fell back to much simpler ESP32-C3&#x2F;S3 boards, which are great, widely supported, easy to set up and pretty reliable. I hook it up to the distance sensor (HC-SR04) and make the distance calculations work. You also have to add a voltage converter if you want to run from batteries, because the sensor requires 5V - easy enough after some reading and failing. Then you have a mess of boards and cables, you need to solder it to a board which requires tools and a bit playing around. Now I was missing an enclosure, tried a few store bought junction boxes, none were perfect, and I decide to buy my own 3D printer (the future is now, print your own things, learn modelling, etc). Those are actually pretty easy compared to everything else, I printed my first models &lt;1h after receiving the printer. Modelling in programmatic OpenSCAD or my currently preferred tool CadQuery - easy to pick up in a few hours of playing around. So yeah, I have had my printer for exactly a week, and I have printed almost a dozen successful prints, and designed a couple of usable and functional parts. Don&#x27;t be afraid of 3d printers, oh and also you can get good printers for much less than 500 USD, I bought a lightly used second hand Sovol SV06 for 150EUR (220 for new) and it works really well.<p>The idea is I didn&#x27;t find an existing water-well sensor for my purposes, so I am building my own. Final price of BOM probably 20EUR. Time spent learning and tinkering - hundreds of hours. Cost of stuff I had to buy to support all this, probably somewhere around 500EUR now. (printer, connector crimpers, cables, MCUs, solder boards, sensors, battery holders, electronic components, filament for the printer, soldering iron, etc). It has all been worth it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37400484" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37400484" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">peteforde</span><span>|</span><a href="#37402316">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37402018">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37400484">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37400484">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Lots of gatekeeping and snark in these comments.

It shouldn’t be too hard to hack your devices :-)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37400812" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37400812" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">em3rgent0rdr</span><span>|</span><a href="#37398747">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37402110">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37400812">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37400812">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you think building hardware is as easy as importing a library, you can burn your house down.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37402110" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37402110" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">monero-xmr</span><span>|</span><a href="#37400812">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37399016">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37402110">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37402110">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So I’m posting this way late and I doubt anyone will read the comment.

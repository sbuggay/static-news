This is the kind of skill that used to be learned at home when you were a kid but as I was growing up this was only passed onto daughters - us boys were taught different skills and my wife grew up in the city. Trying to learn this from books is terrible. Most of the time I call up my mom to teach me over a video call but some things are easier taught in person, especially ones that require manual manipulation of things.<p>I worry that enormous amount of nuance is lost when transmitting skills through written down form instead of in person.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37982920" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37982920" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MandieD</span><span>|</span><a href="#37983049">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37982920">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37982920">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This site is a great resource not only for canners, but anyone storing food... which should be pretty much anyone. The tips for dry food are important if you don&#x27;t want moths.<p>Side benefit of deposit jars for yogurt in Germany: basically free canning jars for jam, especially great for ones I&#x27;m giving away.<p>I do a stress test before getting underway by putting washed jars in the sink, then submerging them in boiling water. I leave them like that until the water is no longer scalding. In a decade of canning, I&#x27;ve only had one jar that cracked after filling, and less than one per batch that fails to seal (could safely be eaten, just needed to be refrigerated and used right away)</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

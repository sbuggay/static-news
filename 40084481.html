Yet I am a very different person than the author here. A lot of the points don&#x27;t resonate with me. Just to pick two random points: I sleep a lot, more than average (at least 8.5 hours almost every day, but often more), and I started coding very young, always enjoying it (author sounds like he just recently started really getting into it), still doing it for fun.<p>I have reached every career goal I wanted, and more. I&#x27;ve been promoted past my goal. I have been and still am very well paid (this was also never a direct goal for me). I shipped some impressive stuff.<p>The advice I would give, is: Do what you are passionate about, what really interests you. But of course I have been very lucky, there.</div><br/><div id="40095859" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40095859" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ttiurani</span><span>|</span><a href="#40095679">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40095395">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40095859">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40095859">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">On the same boat with 25 years of programming behind me, and similar thoughts.<p>My 3 counter points to OP.<p>1. Sleep as much as you can. Looking back I have produced the best results when I&#x27;ve slept close to 9 hours. Too much sleep is almost never a problem because I can&#x27;t produce high quality code for more than about 6 hours per day. When I try, I just tread water, because I have to fix what I did the day before. (If you have more than 10% monotoneus coding you can do almost asleep, you haven&#x27;t yet fixed the code to eliminate that work, or are in the wrong place.)<p>2. Try to get to a place where your &quot;career&quot; doesn&#x27;t matter. This is a privilege that may be impossible to get, but if you can, try to be &quot;just&quot; a team member many times during the years, no matter how high up the ladder you&#x27;ve ended up earlier. IMO that&#x27;s the best way to keep learning and improving in the craft.<p>3. Most importantly, read, understand and internalize how you impact to the world as a technologist. Get a deep understanding about society, ecology and ethics related to technology. Know where the money flows, keep crystal clear who gets wealthy and what gets destroyed to generate that wealth. Aim to get to a place where your code is net positive for the world based on that knowledge.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40095395" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40095395" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vasco</span><span>|</span><a href="#40095679">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40095805">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40095395">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40095395">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Since I was younger, I have always been obsessed with time and how to save more of it.<p>&gt; This is probably why my body got used to sleeping just 4-6 hours per day, and today I find myself reflecting at 4 AM in the morning on what I could have done better<p>You can die up to 30-40 years earlier than you would&#x27;ve by playing this game of training yourself to sleep less.

But for the OP and for us older ones, instead of saying &quot;what could I have done better?&quot;, it&#x27;s better to say &quot;what should I do better today&quot;. This is because a lot of things that could have been done better don&#x27;t matter now anymore. Instead, use the knowledge learned from looking back to the past to improve your future.<p>The only thing I disagree with though is to define a clear education and career path. It&#x27;s always easy to say that in hindsight, but if you are at the start of the path and already fix your destination then, you are closing off a lot of opportunities. I&#x27;ve seen people who had a very clear goal at the start of their career, and then burn out because that goal turned out to be not obtainable, and I think they would have been happier if they cared less and just switched to more obtainable goals as they went along.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40095720" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40095720" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">_nhh</span><span>|</span><a href="#40095805">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40095555">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40095720">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40095720">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I truly hope that in 15 years, when I am celebrating my 25 year anniversary, I wont lay awake at 4am and think about what I could have done better…</div><br/><div id="40095762" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40095762" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jaggederest</span><span>|</span><a href="#40095720">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40095555">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40095762">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40095762">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh you will.

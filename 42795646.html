That don&#x27;t hoard information, but instead step aside and let others take on more responsibility.<p>My first tech lead when I started working had a great reputation. Everyone in the company knew him. I looked up to him. He knew everything! Whatever feature I worked on and needed to ask details about our integration partner, he could answer. Only later did I realize it was more because he had put himself in the middle, than it actually being helpful. I was the one working on something, but he was the one going to all meetings and talking with others. It made it harder for me, never being directly involved. Maybe it made him feel more useful, enjoying being the goto-guy etc?<p>Then I got a new tech lead, and she was the one that made me realize what a manager could be. She encouraged me to own the stuff I was working on completely, and joined meetings more as a backup for me but wanted me to be the main point of contact. Instead of being the middleman of everything, she instead enabled me and mentored me.<p>So I&#x27;ve always aimed to be like her. Now that I&#x27;m at 10 yeo experience, can I enable those &quot;under&quot; me and let them learn by allowing them to take on some of my responsibility? It&#x27;s a constant conscious decision, because the default is to keep feeling important.</div><br/><div id="42820315" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42820315" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ulnarkressty</span><span>|</span><a href="#42820230">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42819746">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42820315">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42820315">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s an interesting viewpoint, since the usual mantra is &#x27;a good manager protects the engineer&#x27; by going to meetings and letting them do deep work without distraction.

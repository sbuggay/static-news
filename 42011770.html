With automation we can all get that.<p>These people with tons of help by and large live fulfilled lives. You find fulfillment in family, friendships, and non necessary creation (art, research, etc); whatever makes you happy.<p>But most of all, the Industrial Revolution made people think we’d all be idle and nothing can be further from those predictions. Many more people, and many more jobs, and most of the world still lives in relative poverty and various forms of insecurity and unmet material and labor needs.<p>Finally there are a lot of problems we have (thousands of health conditions, the environment, autocrats) that will prob take centuries to tackle even with ai, robotics, and being freed up from menial labor.</div><br/><div id="42012766" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42012766" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aljgz</span><span>|</span><a href="#42012511">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42012544">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42012670">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42012766">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42012766">[23 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As optimistic as your comment is, the fact that there are lots of problems does not mean that we will tackle them. In my opinion, if we don&#x27;t aim at doing anything about it, the gap between the rich and the poor will widen. Both between societies, and within one society. I&#x27;m now in Canada, but in my childhood country, most of the recent &quot;smart&quot; (meaning connected) devices and the recent AI models are not available. This is starts a viscious cycle that makes things worse and worse. For the less connected high teck devices, the ratio of the price (That&#x27;s set based on supply&#x2F;demand in the richest countries) to income (that&#x27;s damanged by sanctions and general government stupidity) is getting so high that it&#x27;s really hard to get high-end devices.<p>As the labour required to produce goods and services is automated, one possible scenario is that fewer and fewer people will stay &quot;relevant&quot;, while the rest will sink and become invisible.<p>Things can be avoided, but looking at countries that have been unable&#x2F;unwilling to ensure housing (as one of the 3 most fundamental material needs of the human: food, housing, clothing) stays affordable, does not raise hope. In my opinion, the housing problem is extremely easy to solve when looking at the problem as a technical one, and impossible when you include the way economic incentives are working at it.<p>I hope I&#x27;m wrong, but when I project the current path into future, it&#x27;s not bright.</div><br/><div id="42012977" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42012977" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seventhtiger</span><span>|</span><a href="#42012511">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42012766">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42012795">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42012977">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42012977">[21 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is our goal to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, or to improve the lives of the poor? Because the gap itself is actually irrelevant to poor people&#x27;s lives. Rich people&#x27;s improvement outpacing poor people&#x27;s is not necessarily an issue.<p>Second, a financial gap does not necessarily translate to a material gap. Someone with 1,000,000x someone else&#x27;s net worth still buys the same iPhone and drinks the same coca cola. Many important wellbeing factors are not actually blocked by finance, like healthcare and education. Even if you take all the rich people&#x27;s money and repurpose to education not much will change. Maybe an iPad for every kid, but what good does that do?<p>Housing is actually a great example. Real estate has a way of sucking up entire GDPs worth of money. As a country you can&#x27;t pay your way out of housing problems. Look at something like China which has been consistently overbuilding housing for decades now. They still have housing issues.</div><br/><div id="42014069" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42014069" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hakfoo</span><span>|</span><a href="#42012511">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42012977">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42014073">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42014069">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42014069">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Rich people&#x27;s improvement outpacing poor people&#x27;s is not necessarily an issue.<p>That&#x27;s like saying &quot;the fact there&#x27;s a black hole in the centre of the galaxy is not an issue.&quot;<p>Extreme wealth distorts the universe around it.  There are people who have no business making nation-state level decisions that are still on the speed dial of the people who are, because of their financial positions.<p>There&#x27;s also a strong case that education blocked by finance, on a second order.  Wealth creates flight opportunities.  Parents who can afford it take their kids out of the default public school and take them to a magnet, charter, or private school.  Not everyone can afford that, even if some are nominally tuition-free-- if they don&#x27;t offer the same bussing, for example, that&#x27;s going to add thousands of dollars a year in bus or petrol costs to get the kid to and from campus.<p>But aside from that, when the parents take their kids away, they also take their volunteerism, activity support, and holding staff accountable. The public school ends up supported by the least resourced and least concerned parents, and the students left behind suffer.<p>Housing is probably solvable with a more holistic central-planning mindset.  Everyone wants to live in a few desirable areas, but we have no mechanism to generate more desirable areas.  A planned economy could help by steering new economic development to places where housing can be built affordably, perhaps with build-out mandates.  The Chinese &quot;Ghost Cities&quot; are actually a great idea in retrospect-- if you build everything at once before the first residents arrive, you can avoid some of the very expensive retrofit problems.  Building a subway on the barren ground of a planned city is a lot cheaper than drilling under Lower Manhattan.<p>A secondary problem is that housing costs and the need for retirement&#x2F;end of life savings creates a doom loop-- if you&#x27;re paying 60% of your income on a mortgage, you can&#x27;t invest in any other way, so it HAS to be the nest egg.  I&#x27;m not sure how to address that-- richer and more universal pensions might help reduce the load on home equity, and there are certainly ways to de-asset-ify land (maybe replacing outright land ownership with peppercorn leases-- people wouldn&#x27;t be able to &quot;buy&quot; a house, at best they could try to bribe the existing owner to abandon the lease and hope to grab it when the property goes back up for redistribution)</div><br/><div id="42015130" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42015130" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sokoloff</span><span>|</span><a href="#42012511">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42014069">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42014073">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42015130">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42015130">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Parents who can afford it take their kids out of the default public school and take them to a magnet, charter, or private school.<p>I think it’s pointless to try to prevent this.

Make an effort to omit the most common allergens, such as lactose and peanuts.<p>I wonder what this would cost, and assuming it&#x27;s affordable, why we don&#x27;t simply do it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42013544" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42013544" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nightski</span><span>|</span><a href="#42012511">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42013035">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42014430">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42012619">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42013544">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42013544">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s no need for UBI imho.

Here&#x27;s a robot at Berkeley folding towels in 2010.[1] A Willow Garage robot folding jeans in 2012.[2]
Foldimate in 2017.[3] Even boring old Chicago Dryer had this working by 2021.[4]<p>They&#x27;re all really slow. That&#x27;s because they have no understanding of dynamics. The item has to come to a full stop between operations. Chicago Dryer got past that problem with a sequence of steps at different stations, each station taking about one second. That yields a useful commercial machine for large laundries.<p>It&#x27;s just a demo problem, though. The approach is interesting. They&#x27;re trying to use LLM technology on a completely different kind of problem. For that, you need a lot of training data.<p>If you&#x27;re going to do things in this way, you need data from the inside of doing it. That&#x27;s hard to acquire, but not impossible. They claim to use &quot;robotic training data&quot;. Not sure if this is from robots being operated by humans as teleoperators. Others have tried that. There&#x27;s a Stanford project that looks very similar.
Something like this has been used to train quadrotor drone controllers. 
There&#x27;s no obvious cheap way to acquire lots of data of this type, though. You have to run your own experimental setup and log.<p>Motion tracking from vision on a squirrel colony would be interesting as a data source. Squirrels are very agile and easy to observe. Then run the skeleton movement data back through a simulator and try to extract the forces the muscles are exerting. Now you have something usable for training an agile robot. Maybe sports videos could be used for training.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.eecs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;~pabbeel&#x2F;papers&#x2F;Maitin-ShepardCusumano-TownerLeiAbbeel_ICRA2010" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.eecs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;~pabbeel&#x2F;papers&#x2F;Maitin-Shep...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MOtbcYE4Z4o" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MOtbcYE4Z4o</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=C76osXtpLeM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=C76osXtpLeM</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YpTuwKu5fY0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YpTuwKu5fY0</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42013834" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42013834" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">plaidfuji</span><span>|</span><a href="#42012371">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42012753">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42013187">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42013490">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42013834">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42013834">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I suspect we’re at least five years away from those rather ordinary capabilities in robots.<p>I agree, and I think it will be even longer before people are comfortable with a clothes-folding robot in their home even if the capability is technically there.<p>As much as I would love to never fold a t-shirt again, I’m also not willing to pay likely thousands of dollars to put a bulky set of robotic arms in my laundry room that moreover pose a non-zero risk of injuring somebody, particularly a child. If it’s skilled enough to turn things inside out with a sudden flick, it’s also skilled enough to poke your eyes out with a flick.<p>I feel like if the goal is to simplify people’s lives, the entire process of laundry needs to be re-imagined, from the basket to the return to closet. It should essentially be a black box - I toss my dirty clothes in a hole, and behind the scenes the washer and dryer decide what to wash in what loads and when, fold or hang the dry clothes and return them to storage (drawer or closet). The home layout may need to be reimagined to place all of these unit operations in close proximity.<p>Or, you reimagine washing&#x2F;drying as more of a clean-in-place process - like the closet doubles as both storage and as washer&#x2F;dryer and the robotics move the cleaning supplies to the clothes, rather than vice versa. The same could be applied to dishes - the dishwasher is the cabinet.<p>Another interesting opportunity arises when you automate batch handling - you can spread out the cleaning process to be more continuous. Rather than do huge loads, you can soak each item as they become dirty and take more advantage of residence time, which will use the water and detergents more effectively.<p>There are so many opportunities for reinvention of cleaning processes in the home, it feels like automating the way humans currently do it is inefficient for many reasons.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42013490" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42013490" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smolder</span><span>|</span><a href="#42012371">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42012753">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42013834">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42013450">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42013490">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42013490">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; industry heads predicting the timeline of “robots in every home”.<p>The maid from The Jetsons is due in about 2018 by Elon&#x27;s timeLIEn.<p>I think it&#x27;s more like 30 years than 5 for that sort of intelligence to be practically deployable.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42013450" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42013450" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">steveoscaro</span><span>|</span><a href="#42012371">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42012753">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42013490">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42014432">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42013450">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42013450">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Tesla Optimus robot can already fold clothes...<p>With hands, not some purpose-designed tool.<p>It&#x27;s slow but the trajectory of improvements is clear and rapid.</div><br/><div id="42013541" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42013541" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smolder</span><span>|</span><a href="#42012371">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42013450">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42014432">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42013541">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42013541">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Tesla Optimus is so far a special effect, not a real thing.<p>Currently you&#x27;re better off hiring the person piloting the awkward robot to fold your clothes than having them pilot an unnecessary robot.</div><br/><div id="42014279" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42014279" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">steveoscaro</span><span>|</span><a href="#42012371">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42013541">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42014432">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42014279">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42014279">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well you’re clearly just reading some clickbait articles and not following the actual development at all.</div><br/><div id="42014368" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42014368" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smolder</span><span>|</span><a href="#42012371">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42014279">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42014432">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42014368">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42014368">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m basing my opinion off the demonstration Tesla did where they were remotely operated, and footage of that event.

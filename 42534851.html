Something that might be in perfect working condition and could be used for another 10 years has to be thrown out because of one single component.<p>I understand that batteries come in all shapes, sizes, capacities, yada yada, but imagine if we had standard rechargeable batteries like we have standard non-rechargeable batteries and things were built in a way where you could easily replace batteries like we could on phones a decade ago.

Maybe manufacturers make it less obvious that you can get batteries replaced, because doing so would hurt sales of new phones.  I dunno.<p>Sure, in an ideal world standardized batteries would be available off the shelf, and regular people could replace theirs with standard or even no tools.

They improve repairability and device longevity, but they increase manufacturing costs, reduce the effectiveness of waterproofing, and increase customer support issues. Battery contacts can degrade or become loose, causing phones to power off unexpectedly when handled roughly. Customers buy cheap 3rd party batteries and then complain to the phone manufacturer when battery life is poor. In some cases, 3rd party batteries malfunction and damage the phone (or even cause injury), and the customer blames the phone manufacturer. Samsung and Apple don&#x27;t want to see news articles about their phones blowing up, even if it&#x27;s obviously not their fault. And yes, they do tend to sell more phones if they use integrated batteries.<p>Rather than mandating a specific solution, a better strategy would be to tax electronic waste so that manufacturers have more financial incentive to make phones that last longer. It might also be helpful to limit the liability of anyone who sells phones with removable batteries, or have more standards for battery manufacturers, as most malfunctions will be due to 3rd party batteries.</div><br/><div id="42537643" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42537643" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mmis1000</span><span>|</span><a href="#42536589">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42537241">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42538443">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42537643">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42537643">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Most phones don&#x27;t have battery that is removable.

An iPhone is portable, but the battery embedded in it isn&#x27;t. Contrast the battery pack that something like an ICOM walkie talkie would have, which is portable in itself.<p>Other ways to see it: An Electron program is portable, a .exe program is not portable; they are both programs.

You don&#x27;t necessarily have these constraints with a toothbrush.

4. I get up and my phone is still at ~78% charge.<p>For devices with more software capabilities than phones (e.g. macOS) you can use software (e.g. Al Dente) that will cap the charge level <i>and</i> run off wall power. In practice this means that if I plug my laptop in at 90% charge, it will take weeks to drop to 80% since it&#x27;s running off wall power, and unless I&#x27;m doing particularly high power-draw things the drop to 80% comes down to the battery&#x27;s self-discharge rate.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42536630" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42536630" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ceejayoz</span><span>|</span><a href="#42535560">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42535862">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42536791">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42536630">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42536630">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re sure it&#x27;s not the &quot;optimized battery charging&quot; feature?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;108055" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;108055</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42538195" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42538195" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">guerrilla</span><span>|</span><a href="#42535560">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42536791">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42535674">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42538195">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42538195">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I can&#x27;t beleive I&#x27;m seeing this on HN.

Almost all devices requesting it are so-called &quot;trigger&quot; devices used to adapt older equipment to run on USB power.<p>I have a fun-restoring fact for you though:  USB PD 3.0 in 2018 added a feature called Programmable Power Supply which allows a device being powered to request any voltage from 3.3 to 21 volts in 20mV increments.

The EU&#x27;s cookie law still requires a banner if your site uses a cookie to store something like preferred language or default location (even if it&#x27;s not tied to a specific identity), as those aren&#x27;t considered &quot;strictly necessary&quot; cookies. GDPR&#x27;s right to be forgotten hasn&#x27;t been updated to stop abuse by people who want to hide their past crimes or controversial behavior.

There is a dollar value associated with the cost of recycling proprietary chargers. Taxing that would be a source of revenue for the EU and allow other chargers for purposes that we can&#x27;t predict today. The current law is purely a cost center for both governments and manufacturers.

Examples of strictly necessary cookies are auth sessions and shopping cart contents, not preferred language or default location. Paragraph 25 of the law states[1]:<p>&gt; Where such devices, for instance cookies, are intended for a legitimate purpose, such as to facilitate the provision of information society services, their use should be allowed on condition that users are provided with clear and precise information in accordance with Directive 95&#x2F;46&#x2F;EC about the purposes of cookies or similar devices so as to ensure that users are made aware of information being placed on the terminal equipment they are using. Users should have the opportunity to refuse to have a cookie or similar device stored on their terminal equipment.<p>Is storing preferred language or default location strictly necessary, or just a legitimate purpose (and thus requires consent)? The EU has had since 2009 to clarify this, but many sites (including the news article about the USB-C law) interpret it to mean that consent is required, and thus have cookie banners for these things.<p>If you can&#x27;t agree that the cookie law is a bad law that either needs to be repealed, clarified, or made more strict, then I don&#x27;t know what to tell you. It&#x27;s a perfect example of a well-intended law that causes more problems than it solves. And it&#x27;s a perfect example of the EU failing to update a law with clear flaws.

Is a radio equipment allowed to support a higher charging power (e.g. 40 W) when using a proprietary charging protocol than when using USB PD (e.g. 30 W)?<p>The RED (in its Annex Ia, Part I, point 3.2), ensures interoperability with different charging protocols. For that purpose, radio equipment which is subject to the ‘common charger’ rules must ‘ensure that any additional charging protocol allows for the full functionality of the USB Power Delivery referred to in point 3.1, irrespective of the charging device used.’*<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eur-lex.europa.eu&#x2F;legal-content&#x2F;EN&#x2F;TXT&#x2F;?uri=OJ:C_202402997" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eur-lex.europa.eu&#x2F;legal-content&#x2F;EN&#x2F;TXT&#x2F;?uri=OJ:C_202...</a></i></div><br/></div></div><div id="42535281" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42535281" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Const-me</span><span>|</span><a href="#42535224">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42535331">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42537649">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42535281">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42535281">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m not sure it matters; I hope market economy should do the rest.

It&#x27;s hard to come to a new large community and project with somewhat unusual norms, and established editors should try to do a better job helping people learn the ropes, but at the same time I have gone to look repeatedly when some newcomer complained about being antagonized (either complained here, or other forums, or on Wikipedia) and maybe half the time the newcomer making the complaint was being a total jerk to everyone but really didn&#x27;t like being called out.<p>If you (the generic you reading this comment) want to put a bunch of volunteer effort into finding newcomers who are having a tough time and helping them out that would be a valuable contribution.

It was then, and still is now, often a frustrating slog when multiple editors disagree about something, especially if there&#x27;s some kind of (typically unstated) ideological motivation involved, e.g. promoting one ethnic group or nation. There are various dispute resolution processes, which work more or less, mainly by attracting more eyeballs any time there is a stuck conflict, but trying to form consensus with a pseodonymous global group of volunteers is just an inherently hard problem.<p>The main differences between the first few years vs. today are that (1) many topics at least have some kind of article written about them (often still mediocre, especially parts from the early days that haven&#x27;t seen much dedicated focused effort) which means that there&#x27;s a bit more bias toward preserving what is already there (an understandable tendency in the face of a constant onslaught of vandalism and entropy), (2) people recently tend to demand a bit better sourcing for claims than was done up to about 2010, so there&#x27;s sometimes a bit of a disconnect between the quality standard applied to existing material vs. newly added&#x2F;changed material, and (3) there&#x27;s a bit more focus than before on earning little gamified badges like stars or green + signs in the corners of articles.</div><br/><div id="42382779" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42382779" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cxr</span><span>|</span><a href="#42379148">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42381689">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42383975">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42382779">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42382779">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your pivot from &quot;newcomers who followed the rules [i.e. those who took the time to educate themselves beforehand about the speed limit so they don&#x27;t break it]&quot; to &quot;newcomers who are having a tough time [because they need help learning the ropes]&quot; isn&#x27;t particularly artful or subtle.<p>I&#x27;m referring specifically to experienced editors who take the stance that some action by a new&#x2F;IP account is coming from an confused&#x2F;uninformed place for no other reason than <i>because</i> it&#x27;s an inexperienced editor—a bag of foregone conclusions and the kind of presumptuousness that, perversely, your comment exemplifies.<p>And you&#x27;re wrong about 2004 Wikipedia versus 2014 Wikipedia versus 2024 Wikipedia.

The interview mentions the last major flare-up along those lines: FramGate, though it amusingly got mis-transcribed as &quot;Forum Gate&quot;.<p>The WMF handed out a 1 year ban from English Wikipedia to an admin called Fram, who this interview describes as &quot;gruff, not friendly, not the most empathetic&quot;, for unspecified harassment. There was a great big &quot;community&quot; revolt over it, and the WMF wound up backing down by letting the English Wikipedia arbitration committee undo the ban.<p>The Foundation has a lot of practical power, in that it runs the servers. On a pure technical level, it can do absolutely anything and nobody can stop it. But it worries a lot about driving away the admin structures that keep Wikipedia working. Wikipedia would melt down very quickly under its own weight if the entire admin infrastructure was legitimately pissed off and stopped contributing.<p>(I keep putting &quot;community&quot; in quotes because in wiki parlance it gets used to refer specifically to the set of people who involve themselves in Wikipedia governance, rather than the broader community of people who use and edit Wikipedia. There&#x27;s a lot of power assigned to a fairly small group of people who invest their time in on-wiki politics.

I consider them wholly misleading and improper.  As such, I do not read Wiki articles on anything subjective (history, people, etc) because such articles of this type I am in a position to judge, I judge very poorly indeed, so I have reason to think all articles of these types are no good, at all.<p>For some classes of articles, such as math or computer science concepts, I find all Wiki articles utterly hopeless - the explanations only make sense to someone who already understands.<p>I&#x27;m conscious also of the massive propaganda efforts being exerted by various entities on various pages, such as, for example, the Ukraine War, or the Russian Government.<p>This leaves the balance, articles on simple, fairly non-subjective and uncontrovertial subjects, and they seem okay.<p>It&#x27;s not great, and when I really do need to know about something, I consult an actual, curated, non-mass-edited encyclopedia.<p>Also, many years ago, I used to edit&#x2F;contribute, but that stopped, because it became increasingly difficult and unpleasant due to other editors, and in any event, anything you added sooner or later would be removed or edited away, one way or another.<p>Oh and then have the Foundation, doing it&#x27;s voodoo-idiocy in the background, such as the amazing new editor which no one wants or likes.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42378552" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42378552" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">simonw</span><span>|</span><a href="#42383996">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42380487">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42378552">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42378552">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Annie has a fantastic TikTok account <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tiktok.com&#x2F;@depthsofwikipedia" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tiktok.com&#x2F;@depthsofwikipedia</a></div><br/><div id="42381014" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42381014" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Vinnl</span><span>|</span><a href="#42378552">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42380487">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42381014">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42381014">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Her Mastodon is fun too: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wikis.world&#x2F;@annierau" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wikis.world&#x2F;@annierau</a></div><br/><div id="42383486" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42383486" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tkgally</span><span>|</span><a href="#42378552">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42381014">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42380487">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42383486">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42383486">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As is her Instagram: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;depthsofwikipedia" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;depthsofwikipedia</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42380487" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42380487" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hmmmmmmmm11</span><span>|</span><a href="#42378552">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42380516">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42380487">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42380487">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">From the article: &quot;I would say, generally, it&#x27;s pretty good on US politics — even local politics.&quot;<p>Ctrl-F &quot;bias&quot;: 0 results<p>Wikipedia is simply not trustworthy on anything remotely political due to the extreme ideological slant of its editors.</div><br/><div id="42381942" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42381942" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hk__2</span><span>|</span><a href="#42380487">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42382851">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42381942">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42381942">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Wikipedia is simply not trustworthy on anything remotely political due to the extreme ideological slant of its editors.<p>This reminds me of when the BBC reported that they get &quot;complaints from people who feel that [their] reporting of the conflict has been biased against Israel, and complaints from those who feel it has been biased against the Palestinians&quot; [1].

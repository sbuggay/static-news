At my last position (from which I was unfortunately laid off a few months ago) as a senior staff engineer at a ~100 person startup with a ~30 person engineering org, my manager, the  CTO, raised this to an art form.  I joked with our other senior staff engineer (whom I hired) that our manager never said anything but &quot;Figure it out.&quot;  Once, after an eng all hands meeting, I Slacked my colleague and said &quot;Well, if that wasn&#x27;t peak $CTO-NAME, I don&#x27;t know what is.  I&#x27;m pretty sure what I just heard was the 25 minute version of &#x27;figure it out.&#x27;&quot;<p>&quot;Figure it out&quot; is a great message when you have a talented group of engineers working with you.   They&#x27;re experts at what they do, otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t have gotten hired.  &quot;Figure it out&quot; gives them room to get shit done, and it also goes a long way toward validating any concerns they might express.  It&#x27;s almost magical, really.<p>I worked there for almost a year, and I what I just wrote here for all of you is the absolute most valuable thing I learned in all that time.  As a leader, telling smart, curious, and deeply technical people to &quot;figure it out&quot; will get you everything you ever dreamed of and more.<p>The only problem is that if you&#x27;re not careful, you can end up talking too much, which leads to the other half of the lesson: shut the fuck up.  Literally just stop talking, and leave some space in the conversation that you&#x27;re not filling up with words.  It&#x27;s best if you can stop talking right as you&#x27;ve sketched out the barest outlines of a big idea, or told a good story, or you&#x27;ve just got <i>something</i> that&#x27;s conceptually interesting to drop in the other person&#x27;s lap.<p>Once you do that, &quot;figure it out&quot; + interesting idea + &quot;shut the fuck up&quot; is just like weaponized nerd sniping.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38228273" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38228273" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">opportune</span><span>|</span><a href="#38228182">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38228411">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38227221">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38228273">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38228273">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don’t think this is necessarily true.

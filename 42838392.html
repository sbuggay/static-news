It conjectures that, for a series of standard optimization problems including minimum vertex cover, the best known approximation factor (how close you can guarantee to get to optimality with a poly time algorithm) is actually the best <i>possible</i> approximation factor. To disprove the conjecture, one needs a better approximation algorithm for one of those problems. Such an algorithm could be used to solve (to optimality, and in poly time) another set of problems, which are widely believed to be NP-hard. This would <i>not</i> prove P=NP (to be clear: the above quote is not claiming that), but it is true it would revolutionize TCS.<p>The thing is: this is TCS and theoretical complexity. You cannot disprove UGC with just code. You need a mathematical proof. This is not an indictment of the code which may be very good. But such an enormous claim would require pretty intense scrutiny before it would be accepted as true.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42885538" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42885538" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bicsi</span><span>|</span><a href="#42885234">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42838393">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42885538">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42885538">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is just BS.<p>If you follow their paper, their &quot;inductive&quot; argument can also prove that the result is optimal (the sqrt(2) constant is taken from thin air and may also be replaced by 1 without changing the proof).<p>My guess is that they tested some graphs, and &quot;empirically&quot; saw a bound of sqrt(2), and then came up with a proof to self-fulfill the profecy.

To crave the instant gratification, the high of risk taking etc.<p>I think the time has come when android and ios should make a special versions of their online shops for children and teenagers and simply ban those types of games from those shops. This will at least prevent children from having their brains rewired. Of course this will remove the vast majority of games from the online shops, but so be it.<p>I remember my experience with these types of games. I wasted a lot of time and got a lot of needless frustration but I never once paid those bastards a single cent. There was a game called Candy Crush Saga. It was very popular in its day. Their in game super power currency was something called &quot;lollipop hammers.&quot; They made one candy disappear. It seemed a pretty simple game, assuming the game boards (i.e., the candys) were randomly generated, but of course they weren&#x27;t. They were carefully created so that they present problems that are very difficult to solve under the game&#x27;s usual rules but were easy and downright delightful to solve using a lollipop hammer.<p>I would look at the gameboard for a long time and imagine all the great combos I would achieve, if I could only get rid of a single pesky candy, but alas, one had to use a lollipop hammer for that. I actually ended up having a lot of respect for the designers, it was not easy to design a board that would be incredibly difficult unless one candy was removed but if that candy was removed, it would all solve itself in an explosion of combos and extra points.<p>I was very proud that I solved so many of these boards without using a single lollipop hammer. But my reward would always be a board that is even harder and where the temptation to use the hammer was even greater. Eventually I decided that this is simply torture. I did not mind hard puzzles, I liked solving hard puzzles, but the temptation of the lollipop hammer being always there and me having to constantly use willpower to avoid clicking on those hammers made the whole experience miserable.<p>So quit and deleted the game, but I can proudly say that I never paid for a single lollipop hammer and I left 8 of the 10 hammers you get for free unused. I hope some random King employee looked at my cancelled account with so many puzzles solved and yet so few lollipop hammers used and felt a little pang of defeat. But I doubt it.</div><br/><div id="37654984" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37654984" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chucky_z</span><span>|</span><a href="#37654938">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37655933">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37654984">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37654984">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Apple Arcade allows these types of games and removes all monetization like this.

Any manufacturer selling games to Nevada must abide by the Nevada rules for any machine they sell anywhere in the world, so no switching a machine out for something that looks the same but operates differently.<p>It should also be noted that there is a seperate class of machines called &quot;pull tabs&quot; that are legal in some jurisdictions (often found in places like gas stations and bars) that often present as a slot machine or video poker, but actually work more like a lottery scratch off - the result is 100% pre-determined, and any agency the player appears to be given is an illusion. So, like, if you hit the jackpot on a video poker (like) machine, and get given a royal flush on the initial deal, even if you discard all 5 cards you&#x27;ll get another royal flush on the draw.</div><br/><div id="37654247" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37654247" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Eji1700</span><span>|</span><a href="#37653968">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37654039">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37656314">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37654247">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37654247">[16 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Vegas really is very well regulated.

My younger brother was instantly hooked to it. The trick made him overestimate the probability of having 3 images the same, as he was seeing this pattern quite often just before stopping.

Note: I&#x27;ve been out of this industry for at least 15 years, so some of my knowledge might have aged, but I&#x27;m fairly certain that it&#x27;s still true in the general sense.<p>First, under federal regulations, there are three classes of gambling.  First, class I, which is basically, &quot;I make a wager with you over the outcome of a sporting event&quot;.  So if I&#x27;m playing golf with you and I bet you $10 a hole on outcome, that&#x27;s class I.  It&#x27;s not regulated at federal level, and not generally regulated at state level.<p>The next class is Class II.  This covers things like raffles, and mid-week church bingo.  There are some limits, but it&#x27;s not regulated by the states generally, and not by the feds at all.<p>Class III is what we think of as traditional gambling.  Table games, traditional slot machines, etc.  This is absolutely regulated by the states, and only allowed if the states allow it.  This is what your Vegas and Atlantic City casinos operate under.<p>But there are Indian casinos outside of this in these markets operating.  How do they operate, you ask?  The simple answer is, if the games are operating as Class I or (more likely) class II games, the states have no say in them.  And it&#x27;s very easy  to make a lotto drawing, or a bingo card, appear as a slot machine play.  All random wins are basically equivalent to each other.  If you go to an Indian casino, and you want to play a slot machine, but it&#x27;s requiring you to wait on another player, you&#x27;re dealing with a class II machine.<p>What about class III?  Well, states are allowed to negotiate compacts with the various Native American tribes where they allow them to conduct class III games.  A number of states have done this.  This allows them to run, say, blackjack and poker, as well as slot machines that don&#x27;t fall under class II.  Interestingly, in a lot of jurisdictions, you&#x27;re still basically following the ideas of class II, but just not requiring competition.  So if you go to a casino in Oklahoma, you&#x27;ll see that you are (most often) playing a game of instant bingo on each spin, or possibly a game of instant lotto on each spin.  Because that&#x27;s what the compact between the state of Oklahoma and the tribes there allows.<p>But there are still loopholes that allow you, in some jurisdictions, to run slot machines outside of these provisions.  Let&#x27;s say, you&#x27;re allowed to run raffles that allow up to a $1000 prize on a $1 entry.  These are just numbers to use to illustrate the concept, and they vary state to state.  So I set up a slot machine that you pay $1 a spin, which is an entry in a lotto that pays maximum $1000, and after the total number of tickets allocated is depleted, will pay the house 10%.  Perfectly legal, though local law enforcement in the bible belt in the south may disagree.  I&#x27;ve coded a number of systems that implemented exactly this.<p>Other jurisdictions may allow you to have prizes up to, say, 25x the entry on machines, to allow the legality of the claw machines.  This can also be (ab)used to make slot machines.</div><br/><div id="37655636" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37655636" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">spondylosaurus</span><span>|</span><a href="#37653968">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37655184">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37654857">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37655636">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37655636">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; If you go to an Indian casino, and you want to play a slot machine, but it&#x27;s requiring you to wait on another player, you&#x27;re dealing with a class II machine.<p>This is all really interesting, but I don&#x27;t think I follow on this point (and I&#x27;d like to understand!)—are you saying that two players are playing on different machines, but the second machine can&#x27;t operate until the first is done?

I am just thinking that i should think and often seem to make myself appear as if i was thinking – and that&#x27;s it. It feels a lot like &quot;fake it till you make it&quot;.

I apparently am about as high as you can likely get a percentile score to go for the number of questions here on inner voice and representational manipulation, and as low as possible on mind&#x27;s eye and orthographic representation<p>The inner voice and mind&#x27;s eye don&#x27;t surprise me, I&#x27;m among the more hyperlexic people I know and seem to have total aphantasia, but I didn&#x27;t realize (though I guess it seems like an obvious possibility in retrospect) that there were people who processed words as <i>text</i> in their head - I guess the survey itself said that surprised them too.<p>I also didn&#x27;t consider that there could be a large degree of variability in representational manipulation, and assume that this kind of inevitably leads to some pretty hard to bridge inferential gaps when speaking across that divide. Honestly maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding what&#x27;s meant by that, because the other extreme sounds to me like there are some people who <i>just can&#x27;t do metacognition</i> which sounds insane. I&#x27;m guessing however that this is similar to an experience I had with a (now ex-)lover who was <i>shocked</i> when I mentioned I don&#x27;t have visualization, and asked &quot;So you&#x27;re telling me you have no imagination at all?&quot;, which like, I wouldn&#x27;t say is true? My imagination can be prosaic, narrative, auditory, abstract, olfactory, emotional, or kinematic, just not visual. I kind of assume that&#x27;s similar to what I&#x27;m doing here, like whatever &quot;manipulating representations&quot; means here is a useful capability by which to do metacognition but not the thing itself... but it seemed like their questions pertained to a lot of different kinds of manipulation of abstractions or mental models, so I can&#x27;t really figure out how you&#x27;d examine your thoughts per se without that ability.

Like if I&#x27;m debugging something I&#x27;ll sometimes narrate what the program is doing in words. Also if I&#x27;m trying to figure out how some event happened I&#x27;ll try to tell a story in my mind.

People call it “intuition” but it isn’t some magical sixth sense, it’s just not using one’s language centre for compute, which is what many seem to do.<p>The moment I start consciously considering something, it all usually goes to hell - so a large part of how I operate is preventing myself from lapsing into “conscious thought”, and instead to keep whatever it is just below the surface until it’s cooked.<p>I infuriated teachers throughout my childhood by apparently paying zero attention but then inexplicably having the correct answer to whatever was posed to me, and have never quite related to other people, as it usually feels like I’m trying to bridge an immense gap of comprehension - not, to be clear, that I think other people are stupid - just more like I am running fundamentally different software, and everything has to go through an extensive translation and abstraction layer to make sense to others.<p>If I speak my thoughts directly, then they often emerge as allegory, as it’s the only way I can try to encapsulate the otherwise rather inchoate froth of connection which leads to a result. Sometimes others understand the allegory, but more often than not, they do not, as the symbols mean something else to them.<p>So yeah. I don’t think my mind works like most other people I encounter.

- 拔苗助长 (Ba Miao Zhu Zhang) - Point at the mulberry tree to curse the locust tree = deflective criticism<p>These condense a whole story with moral lesson in them, and they facilitate recall of that concept. The trick is omission of everything but 4 characters from the whole story. Sometimes they&#x27;re just an enumeration:<p>- 柴米油盐 （Chai Mi You Yan) Firewood, Rice, Oil, Salt = essential things for everyday life
- 都道府県 (To Dou Fu Ken) all 4 types of Jap. prefecture = everywhere<p>I think brevity is key for words that aim at aiding thinking. All languages allow composition; consider &quot;Eierschalensollbruchstellenverursacher&quot;. But only if the word is short, can you quickly cast your thought into its form (as if speaking) and proceed to compose it with the next thought. You do this until your individual mental capacity runs out.<p>It&#x27;s also very important that others know the concept.

Instead, they could be caused by damage to other cognitive systems that interact with language, or by the disorder&#x27;s broader impact on cognitive function.<p>For instance, schizophrenia is a complex disorder affecting various cognitive domains, including attention, memory, and executive functions, which are crucial for reasoning and problem-solving. Therefore, the observed impairments might stem from these broader cognitive deficits rather than a lack of language proficiency.<p>Brain damage can affect multiple brain regions and their connections, leading to a wide range of cognitive impairments. It is possible that the observed deficits in reasoning and problem-solving are due to damage to specific brain regions responsible for these functions, rather than a disruption of language processing itself.<p>While the presence of intact language abilities does not guarantee intact thinking abilities, it is necessary to consider the potential confounding factors, such as broader cognitive deficits or damage to other brain regions, before concluding that language is not sufficient for thought. Further research is needed to disentangle the complex relationship between language and thought and to determine the specific contributions of language to various cognitive processes.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40756264" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40756264" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dangrossman</span><span>|</span><a href="#40757455">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40756267">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40756264">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40756264">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Contrast that with Helen Keller&#x27;s description of her mental state before language: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scentofdawn.blogspot.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;07&#x2F;before-soul-dawn-helen-keller-on-her.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scentofdawn.blogspot.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;07&#x2F;before-soul-dawn-he...</a></div><br/><div id="40756435" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40756435" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">toasterlovin</span><span>|</span><a href="#40756264">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40756353">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40756435">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40756435">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Something to keep in mind is that according to Wikipedia, Helen Keller met Anne Sullivan, her caretaker and the person who introduced her to language, at around 7, which is probably around the age many people with normal language acquisition would start to have the kinds of changes in cognition that Keller attributes to learning language.</div><br/><div id="40756634" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40756634" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">082349872349872</span><span>|</span><a href="#40756264">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40756435">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40756353">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40756634">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40756634">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">See also <i>Spacetime for Springers</i></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40756267" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40756267" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Jun8</span><span>|</span><a href="#40756264">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40757434">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40756267">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40756267">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The entry in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy has a good summary of the Language of Thought Hypothesis. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;language-thought&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;language-thought&#x2F;</a><p>Jerry Fodor, who advocated an internal mental language, was seen as an old crank when I studied Linguistics in late 90s; I just looked him up and, god, he died recently in 2017.

Babies learn this without language. They do not have words for the particular concepts such as &quot;object&quot;, &quot;fall&quot;, &quot;ground&quot;, but as concepts they are learned all the same.<p>For thought, all there really is, are concepts, or forms in platonic terms. In our case, learned patterns in the world which correspond to particular sense perceptions. Imagination, or the latent space between the forms, is our initial (and only, I&#x27;d argue) mode of thinking. These forms, encoding both logical and sensory - of which they are inseparably bound - can be strung together to form thought. They agree to a type of logic, affording the capacity to extract meaning out of the world.<p>It is an embodied logic, not boolean algebra. The logic is grounded in the ground, the earth underneath your feet. It is grounded in the sun, in its heat and light. It is grounded in the logos, or the intelligible unfolding of the universe. The intelligibility is afforded because of its own nature - that it is built up out of real patterns, patterns all the way down. But it also requires the appearance of the patterns in our sense perceptions in order to be &#x27;seen&#x27; and thus known.<p>As such, logic of this sort is found to be based off of the learned patterns of how the world appears to us so as to make it intelligible, affording our ability to live within it. Then you get sensory being mapped into grounded logic and vise versa, so as to experience the unfolding of the logic with imagination, and I suppose the affective state changes it produces are then fed back into the logic. So emotions seem necessary in order to &#x27;react&#x27; to sense perceptions, so that the logic is grounded in caring about what happens, like a mother does with  a child. Otherwise there is just appearance, which has no qualia in and of itself, and so the patterns that can be discovered in the world have no ground.<p>Determining the necessity of the ground of appearances is probably what will determine if we can have AGI or not. We&#x27;d like to think computation alone will get us there, or even embodied cognition, but without the transcendentals, its dimensionality of knowing will always exclude this ground, so it cannot know what patterns are most relevant or salient, so it cannot perform relevance realization and overcome combinatorial explosion. So AI cannot be a temporal embodied agent, since the logos of the world is incomprehensible, except through itself, of which we Beings are made out of. We rely on lower order logic, such as math, for our AI. It is how we make sense of the real patterns we see in the world, but they are an abstraction over the thing itself. So a machine is confined by boolean algebra, while we are confined by the logos itself. Sounds  nice anyhow.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40757386" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40757386" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bbor</span><span>|</span><a href="#40757278">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40756504">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40757386">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40757386">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I hate to quote an abstract, but I&#x27;m really struggling to understand the purpose here -- it seems like they&#x27;re angry that Chomsky defined language as symbolic operations and relegated the external facets to &quot;history of language&quot; or &quot;anthropology of language&quot; or other such fields.<p><pre><code>  We conclude that although the emergence of language has unquestionably transformed human culture, language does not appear to be a prerequisite for complex thought, including symbolic thought.

Here is one quote from Chomsky:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;
... One general assumption about language, almost a dogma in philosophy ... [and] linguistics ... is that language is primarily a means of communication ... probably that&#x27;s totally false. It seems language ... is designed as a mode of creating and interpreting thought.
&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>In my opinion, I find Chomsky to get mired in certain quagmires around intelligence and computation, especially in regards to AI, where he&#x27;s somehow managed to rationalize an absurd stance. I remember watching a video with Chomsky claiming that language&#x27;s primary purpose was not communication and thinking it was potentially plausible but highly unlikely.

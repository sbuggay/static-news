In his conclusion:<p>&gt; Although it certainly doesn’t feel like it to people who hit edge cases, the tiered support model is a technology which took us decades to popularize and which made the world much better. It brought down the cost of financial services and supported product innovation which would have been impossible under the mid-century bank staffing model. We could not have credit cards or discount brokerages without the tiered support model. The biography of Charles Schwab makes this point persuasively at considerable length: competent telephone operations were instrumental to bringing equity ownership to the middle class. You should prefer a world with credit cards and discount brokerages to one which doesn’t have them, even as you listen to hold music occasionally<p>Tiered support is here to stay because tiered support is <i>cheap</i> and <i>resistant to the &quot;unintelligent customer DoS&quot; (my words, not his)</i>. As he points out, you <i>can</i> have professional troubleshooters with the capability, authority, and expertise to troubleshoot the problem, but their labour costs in the hundreds of dollars an hour.<p>I personally think there is a reasonable model of the world where customers explicitly pay a hundred dollar fee to have a highest-tier escalation to the office of the CEO&#x2F;equivalent troubleshooting team and have them take a look at your case, but this is a model that has not yet been developed or in wide use anywhere.</div><br/><div id="38182132" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38182132" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">boilerupnc</span><span>|</span><a href="#38181006">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38181489">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38187245">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38182132">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38182132">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’ve been having a fun ride reading “QualityLand” [0] .<p>In that world - those who have QualityPoints can exert far more escalation force on all parts of their life (change the traffic signal now for 10 units) than lower level folks.

I don&#x27;t know much about the banking sector, but there are lots of authors writing accessible, detailed books that look into the intersection of politics, technology, society, identity, and other factors.<p>I think part of what makes Patio11&#x27;s writing so attractive to the HN crowd is that he writes with technical rigor in a way few social scientists can manage. A lot of social science is, in my opinion, nibbling around the edges of a lot of the &quot;stuff&quot; in digital worlds - but there is a lot to get through and it&#x27;s not a huge field! So reading a lot of the source texts can be kind of frustrating: good stuff, but if they&#x27;re describing a field you work in there will probably be parts it seems like they got wrong.

E.g. moving loans can have huge &quot;rearrangement fees&quot;, loan guarantees may be almost impossible to transfer and the bank account info is in quite a few places and having it wrong can cause missed payments.<p>A good example is that when it was proposed that one should be able to transfer their account number to another bank (as telecoms have to do for phone numbers here in Finland at least), the bank lobbyists said this is technically impossible, which is of course ridiculous. And that we still this day and age have to wait for days for a bank transfer to clear.<p>There are some new banks (e.g. Monzo) that once you use them, it really shows that most banks just suck.<p>When you have literally a license to create money out of thin air, you can be really incompetent (except in lobbying of course) and still make hand over fist.</div><br/><div id="38181546" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38181546" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">abdullahkhalids</span><span>|</span><a href="#38181334">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38183321">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38181546">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38181546">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; A good example is that when it was proposed that one should be able to transfer their account number to another bank (as telecoms have to do for phone numbers here in Finland at least), the bank lobbyists said this is technically impossible, which is of course ridiculous.<p>If you mean the bank account numbers used within Finland, sure, they can be changed. In the new system, there will be country-wide database which will now indicate which bank each account number is associated with. But your account also has an IBAN number, which has country and bank&#x2F;institution identifiers. Those will have to change if a customer moves banks, absent an international finance law change.<p>And my understanding is that its quite common to use IBAN everywhere.

The IBAN cannot remain the same, because international institutions need to know which institutions they are dealing with. Not all institutions are legally allowed to or want to transact with all institutions.<p>So the added layer of complexity is that customers will have to change their number in some places but not in others. And banks will have to have a system of ensuring they match the right IBAN with the right local account number. Whenever this fails, there will be problems such as delays or money being deposited in wrong accounts etc.<p>This is unlike DNS over IP, which is universally&#x2F;internationally agreed protocol which has 100% coverage.

They probably wouldn’t mind making it easier to move on, but core conversions are such a nightmare that they have dedicated onboarding teams for this with lots of tooling and knowledge, and since everyone else’s data structures are different, there’s no point standardizing your own.<p>Additionally, there are, like, three big players in the space (at our level, at least). When you’re choosing a core, you’re probably going to be more concerned by questions such as “what percentage of our total revenue will go to this one application” and “what features can we use to save us tons of work and money” and “will this make us more money”. You probably won’t be too concerned with whether converting off the core fifteen years down the line is super difficult or “just” pretty difficult.

This article made me understand <i>why</i> it&#x27;s so shitty. No one seems to want to do their job. Everything — I mean <i>everything</i> — takes ages. The branch employees are utterly powerless. The only thing they can do right there and right now is cash transactions, everything else requires a form to be filled and signed and sent &quot;to the back office&quot; for the thing you asked for to <i>maybe</i> happen in &quot;3 to 5 working days&quot;. I have only tried calling them once. They use a toll number, but then still try their hardest to &quot;solve your issue&quot; through an automated voice menu before you have any chance to talk to a real human. Writing to the right person directly to their work email sometimes gets your problems solved very quickly though.<p>It was a culture shock because I&#x27;m Russian and banks don&#x27;t play as important of a role in our society because of the Soviet past. Yes, most of our population has a bank account these days. Yes, most people are paid by transfers to that account. But — our entire banking system <i>was built from scratch in the 90s</i>. Banks had to sell the whole idea of banking to people to begin with. So if you have an issue and you go to a branch to get it sorted, you do get it sorted on the spot by a branch employee. It probably also helps that many Russians &quot;don&#x27;t trust banks&quot; so they&#x27;d go to an ATM on their payday and withdraw their entire salary and use cash for all their transactions. We&#x27;ve also never had checks, we skipped that entirely. We also have this nifty СБП system that allows you to instantly make a transfer from any bank to any other bank using just the recipient&#x27;s phone number. Very useful for things like splitting bills. I was shocked to find out that most other countries don&#x27;t have anything like this and even sending someone money within one bank is quite <i>a process</i>.</div><br/><div id="38185144" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38185144" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ponector</span><span>|</span><a href="#38184005">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38182687">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38185144">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38185144">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Passage about checks is simply not true.<p>Other countries in EU have similar systems where you can use phone number instead of IBAN.

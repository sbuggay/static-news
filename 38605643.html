Seems like a hard claim to back up. What would “moving” the homeless from, say, Portland look like? Setting up a giant slum on Mount Tabor? Building a network of trailer parks? I can’t imagine any answer to “let’s concentrate all these undesirables somewhere where we don’t have to look at them and they can’t interrupt us” that ends up being a nice trip for said undesirables<p>Think about why homeless people go to downtown centers of big cities: community, institutional support nearby, income, tradition, and (relative) safety from police.

But for the sake of fleshing it out,<p>&gt; I want to live for free too and not have to work and do drugs whenever I want.<p>Here&#x27;s the rub: When you get to the point of needing free housing, you are usually more or less already at the, shal we say, &#x27;mature&#x27; phase of your addiction where there is hardly an ounce of joy left to be had from it. The daily grind of figuring out how to get high is basically just your hellish normal, and the best rush you might get here and there in  your average month is akin to eating a nice meal, having a good (but not great) conversation, or a satisfying workout.<p>Compared to good sex? Get out of here. That phase of drug use is <i>long</i> gone. If you want that back even for a fleeting moment you have to go through the hell of withdrawal first. Even doses that put you dangerously close to OD don&#x27;t really reach that anymore unless you risk them after a period of abstinence (which is where most opiate addicts used to die, back before fentanyl was the norm).<p>However, with all that said, I&#x27;d argue a functional addict is better equipped to deal with the stuff you mention above better than a severe addict who is trying to get sober after years of active addiction. Obviously acute withdrawal is an absolute bastard, but so are the following months of post acute withdrawal (aka your brain and body re-learning how to function at a completely new level of physiology). If we were doing it right, sobriety would be a hard requirement up front, followed by a good deal of support during the transition back into housing.<p>True, it&#x27;s much easier to get sober in stable housing. But you know what&#x27;s even easier still? Continuing to use in a more comfortable and secure environment. Or worse yet, when free housing is still pretty scarce, using your pad as a commodity to score perks from your friends who are still homeless, or worse, using it as a safer and more secure place to stash and deal quantities of drugs to support your addiction directly. Anyone in active addiction will consider these possibilities the moment the lock is turned and they are alone in their new home (not all will act on it, of course). Housing yes, but probably not &#x27;housing first.&#x27;<p>You don&#x27;t take a patient with a gunshot wound and make sure they have a long term care bed to lie in comfortably while they bleed.

Safe use sites would go some way towards hiding the problem if managed well.<p>Legalizing will not solve the problem of addiction. It will not solve overdoses (many overdoses are not caused by surprise differences in dose; people often overdose after relapse, or deliberately seek out stronger than usual supplies).<p>We have to accept that legalizing will solve some problems, but will likely keep killing at least some people.<p>Housing is another solution to hiding the problem.

American politics are sad in that it&#x27;s hard to celebrate any victories when you know those victories are doomed to mismanagement anyway.</div><br/><div id="38606501" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38606501" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">briffle</span><span>|</span><a href="#38606357">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38606931">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38606501">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38606501">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The &#x27;officials&#x27; did not do that.

Nothing has ever reduced domestic violence or alcohol related deaths as much.<p>It also more or less created organized crime in the United States, and laid the foundations for every illicit-business-at-scale that would follow it. Of course it reduced alcoholism: alcohol was illegal, and anything made illegal will be necessarily reduced in availability. But it didn&#x27;t get rid of it, and it made the alcohol that remained far more dangerous:<p>- The economics of smuggling meant that lighter alcohol like beer and wine were far less profitable to transport than hard liquors like whiskey, bourbon, vodka, and moonshine. SO MUCH moonshine.<p>- Because the aforementioned products were illegal, there was now zero government oversight involved in their production and distribution, meaning you often had no idea what the fuck you were actually buying and if it was any good, or hell, even <i>safe to consume.</i> Much like the war on drugs, and, if you wanna get REAL political, the fall of Roe v Wade, making it illegal, be it booze, smokes, pot, meth, or abortion doesn&#x27;t make it not happen: it makes it unsafe.<p>- Worse still, the legal issues meant that if a particular establishment was selling unsafe liquor, <i>you couldn&#x27;t do shit about it</i> because, again it&#x27;s illegal and any report to authorities about the lack of safety put you in legal hot water. This meant the enforcement that <i>did exist</i> was basically down to the aforementioned organized crime rings, who didn&#x27;t bother with a jury trial, they&#x27;d just put you in a hole out in the woods.<p>And, naturally, no taxes are paid on all this commerce that is very much still happening, and is riskier to the people engaged in it, to suit the puritan sensibilities of a loud minority.

But the US should actually do something with the severe addicts rather than just tossing them in prison, or creating laws against that and leaving them on the streets.<p>Mandatory rehabilitation would do a lot. But rehabilitation would work much worse in an environment where relapse is easily attainable, anyone who has had any kind of addiction will tell you that.<p>I think part of the problem is people with no real experience pushing their narrative. Many honest drug addicts will tell you the actual solutions that will be around wholistic rehabilitation: withdrawals treatments, reintegration into society, no permanent records, removing stigma. And some would prefer to be funneled into that rather than go to rehabilitation by free will. Free will stands no chance against a heroin or meth addiction.<p>My family member works in a psychiatric clinic in Central Europe. They deal with severe addictions. They have proper rehabilitation programs with dedicated facilities where people with severe addictions that have led to mental disorders learn to reintegrate with life, attend job interviews, take care of themselves, and so on. I have spent my childhood around these people as family members of clinicians would attend various events (Christmas parties, weddings, funerals, other outings, etc) and I have not felt threatened by anyone in rehabilitation.<p>But yeah, what I see in West Coast cities is threatening. It’s a day and night difference between that and proper care for hard drug addicts though. West Coast is what ignoring the problem looks like. Central Europe is what solving the problem looks like. In both cases, hard drug sales are not legal.<p>And the solution is ridiculously simple. If someone is acting out in public due to drugs, police would be called. The police would deliver them to a psychiatric clinic in a municipal hospital. The clinic would put them in a ward and on a rehab program, start withdrawals management, set up a social worker for employment, and so on. It would take several months to rehabilitate someone and some people would go through the program a few times. Not all of it is easy and the taxpayer pays for the healthcare. But that’s the cost of solving this problem, and that does solve it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38608093" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38608093" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">losteric</span><span>|</span><a href="#38607386">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38607921">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38609440">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38608430">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38608093">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38608093">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s an orthogonal issue to dealing with addiction, which would be a problem regardless of legalization status...</div><br/></div></div><div id="38608430" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38608430" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">graeme</span><span>|</span><a href="#38607386">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38607921">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38608093">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38608287">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38608430">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38608430">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This doesn&#x27;t really address the comment.

The extreme version of this is just dragnet police enforcement turning every simple drug use into ever-worsening drug use (aka the weed-to-fentanyl pipeline).<p>In your specific case, it means a low-level drug offender going to jail and coming out hardened using more aggressive drugs, evermore ready to unleash violence at worse levels.<p>I&#x27;m happy to think through what a low-recidivism version of &quot;treated criminally&quot; could be, but it is not any of the options we currently have.<p>The paper I linked has some interesting suggestions as to how to change the current incarceration systems to support actual drug treatment.<p>P.S: I think police should have better tools, and better pay (it&#x27;s a hard job!) but <i>also</i> higher accountability, Police vs. Anti-Police is a made-up twitter dichotomy.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;books&#x2F;NBK234751&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;books&#x2F;NBK234751&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="38609650" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38609650" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">felizuno</span><span>|</span><a href="#38607386">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38609005">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38608477">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38609650">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38609650">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think we probably agree to a large extent. There are a lot of comments here, so I want to quote one of my responses to another person in an effort to inject some consistency, but tl;dr the reason I think decriminalization is the issue is that AFAIK our criminal justice system is the only way we can confiscate drugs or force a person into treatment such as inpatient detox and&#x2F;or rehab:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;
To me it&#x27;s not so much about punishing drug use (jail time), it&#x27;s about stopping drug addiction (intervention and recovery). For example I think intervening in such a way that a user is confirmed to get at least a few hours of sleep before potentially using meth again would be a big start.<p>I&#x27;ll admit that I support confiscating drugs when found, but I&#x27;m not advocating that arrest is always appropriate. I am in favor of punishing selling meth, which I acknowledge is perhaps hypocritical given my other beliefs knowing that plenty of people sell to support their habits.<p>I do think it&#x27;s important to have a mechanism of mandatory intervention, and my non-lawyer understanding is that criminalizing drugs is really the only way to put mandatory intervention on the table. I met mothers who could not force their children into rehab, for example. I should be clear that I don&#x27;t feel this way about all drugs, but I think that methamphetamine specifically poses a risk to the safety of both users and people around them that merits mandatory intervention.<p>If we had functional mechanisms to to enact mandatory interventions for users that were non-criminal I&#x27;m definitely open to that. Depending on the targeted success rate it seems like inpatient detox + rehab would be required in many cases, and I am simply not aware of non-judicial ways we can force a person into those circumstances against their will (which in the case of meth I admit I support even if that opinion is controversial).<p>I am not an expert, but nonetheless I&#x27;m now entangled with the topic as one that defines significant aspects of my life (loss of smell and hearing, PTSD, facial disfiguration). I think we can do better than we have been, both recently and since Nixon, but I think that having tough conversations is part of how we&#x27;ll get better. My experience is that people in my situation frequently have our perspectives invalidated as &quot;politically incorrect&quot; or otherwise irrelevant [...], and I wanted to speak up to make sure people know that we exist and we don&#x27;t want our numbers to grow.

You can go there and they&#x27;ll take care of you, including professional psychologist&#x2F;psychiatrist support (and medicine to help get off drugs); in the main institution we&#x27;re working with[2], former homeless and former drug dependents help directly in welcoming people.

It sounds like you&#x27;re in a better place which is great to hear :)<p>Me and most people I met who were victimized by drug users &quot;blame addiction&quot; in the narrow sense that we don&#x27;t think the people who victimized us would have behaved that way in the absence of the drugs. I don&#x27;t think the general attitude was that drug users are bad people, more that drug use can result in people acting in ways that they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t. I certainly don&#x27;t think using any drug reduces a person&#x27;s human value.<p>I&#x27;m in support of targeting pathways and outcomes that I think might be similar to yours. We probably have different perspectives on some forms of harm reduction and agree on others, which I think is inevitable based on our different experiences. I think we agree that medical attention and pathways to overcoming addiction outside of jail are important ingredients to a successful recovery.<p>To me it&#x27;s not so much about punishing drug use (jail time), it&#x27;s about stopping drug addiction (intervention and recovery). For example I think intervening in such a way that a user is confirmed to get at least a few hours of sleep before potentially using meth again would be a big start.<p>I&#x27;ll admit that I support confiscating drugs when found, but I&#x27;m not advocating that arrest is always appropriate. I am in favor of punishing selling meth, which I acknowledge is perhaps hypocritical given my other beliefs knowing that plenty of people sell to support their habits.<p>I do think it&#x27;s important to have a mechanism of mandatory intervention, and my non-lawyer understanding is that criminalizing drugs is really the only way to put mandatory intervention on the table. I met mothers who could not force their children into rehab, for example. I should be clear that I don&#x27;t feel this way about all drugs, but I think that methamphetamine specifically poses a risk to the safety of both users and people around them that merits mandatory intervention.<p>If we had functional mechanisms to to enact mandatory interventions for users that were non-criminal I&#x27;m definitely open to that. Depending on the targeted success rate it seems like inpatient detox + rehab would be required in many cases, and I am simply not aware of non-judicial way we can force a person into those circumstances against their will (which in the case of meth I admit I support even if that opinion is controversial).<p>I am not an expert, but nonetheless I&#x27;m now entangled with the topic as one that defines significant aspects of my life (loss of smell and hearing, PTSD, facial disfiguration). I think we can do better than we have been, both recently and since Nixon, but I think that having tough conversations is part of how we&#x27;ll get better. My experience is that people in my situation frequently have our perspectives invalidated as &quot;politically incorrect&quot; or otherwise irrelevant (not what you&#x27;re doing BTW thank you for your perspective), and I wanted to speak up to make sure people know that we exist and we don&#x27;t want our numbers to grow.<p>Congratulations on your recovery, and FWIW I really like your your username&#x2F;giraffes :)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38608504" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38608504" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">KennyBlanken</span><span>|</span><a href="#38607386">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38608217">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38608373">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38608289">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38608504">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38608504">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Please stop incessantly committing appeal to emotion fallacies.<p>This is about as helpful as &quot;please go to welfare office and tell everyone to just work harder&quot; or &quot;please go to a substance abuse center and tell everyone to just, you know, stop using drugs mkay?&quot; or &quot;please go to a prison and tell everyone that crime is bad and they just need to fly right and everything will be fine.&quot;</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38608289" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38608289" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mitthrowaway2</span><span>|</span><a href="#38607386">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38608103">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38608217">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38608982">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38608289">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38608289">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Prohibition of drugs just doesn&#x27;t work.<p>It seems to me like there are places where it does, and places where it doesn&#x27;t.

Its super frustrating in a lot of cities right now because the current political environment seems to want to have a &quot;stochastic junkie&quot; if you will. When it comes to violence, disorder, theft and just generally refusing to be part of society in a non-harmful way all we get right now is a ton of verbiage about how addiction is a disease, these people can&#x27;t be held responsible for the actions they&#x27;ve undertaken, they&#x27;re serving their addiction, etc, etc, etc. And so then someone says &quot;Well if they are completely incapable of conducting themselves rationally then we should probably step in and force them into treatment to remove the thing that is making them act this way.&quot; And of course a huge uproar comes in response from the same enablers &quot;We can&#x27;t force them into treatment! They have rights! We need to wait until they choose to enter treatment and they have to consciously take responsibility for completing the treatment.&quot;<p>And so we&#x27;re caught in this terrible in-between with people who can&#x27;t be held responsible for their actions, but who also can&#x27;t have the state enforce care on them unless they ask for it, and regular citizens just trying to peacefully live their lives bear the brunt of it. Its a luxury belief whose costs are disproportionately borne by the lower income members of society which makes it even more galling to watch it masquerade as some sort of progressivism.

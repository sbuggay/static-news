It&#x27;s also pretty obvious you were arranged in that shape to emphasis a group conversation activity is taking place.<p>Kind of the opposite as when you get seated at a restaurant in a long rectangle table. You immediately know it will be difficult to talk to the whole table and will have multiple conversations taking place. If you&#x27;re at one end, you&#x27;ll likely only talk to 3-4 people. If you&#x27;re at the center, you might talk to 3-4 to the left and right but they&#x27;ll be different conversations. Not that this is a strict law of table talk, just kind of what usually takes place. Sometimes there&#x27;s something that comes up that gets everyone&#x27;s attention and the whole table is shouting.  An even more extreme example, is a bar top seating, where you are just a line facing the same direction. You might only talk to your neighbors and possibly their neighbor but it&#x27;s not great at facilitating larger group discussion.<p>If you ever go to a banquet or wedding where they have round tables but a very tall floral decor piece thing in the middle, it completely breaks the circle advantage. I think eye contact and your ability to convey body language is a major component.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42421906" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42421906" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">o11c</span><span>|</span><a href="#42416771">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42418673">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42421556">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42421786">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42421906">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42421906">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your case is relatively unusual and unlike general conversations, since you have:<p><pre><code>  - a topic that everybody knows will be the focus, and

That&#x27;s a long way to say that around three to four voices is ideal if you want independent lines (except they&#x27;re not really independent, like two people shouting past one another; there&#x27;s a weird mix of both working together while each yet manages to stand out in good counterpoint) though even better than this claim would be to compare, say, Bach&#x27;s two-part inventions to works that have more voices.<p>For those who do not know counterpoint, you have only three motions a voice (a horizontal line of music, traditionally sung) can make relative to another voice (move closer, apart, or to hold steady) combined with limited voice ranges (say, a doubling of frequency, or so) and limited interval choices (seven, or so) within an octave or frequency doubling, and the voices are very close to one another but only rarely cross one another, on top of all that various rules systems that forbid or frown on such things as the tritone, parallel fifths, and so on into the weeds such that with more than a few voices you quickly run out of valid options for all the voices to move independently.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42419319" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42419319" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jancsika</span><span>|</span><a href="#42416433">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42421911">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42418176">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42419319">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42419319">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think you&#x27;re taking the metaphor about a string quartet as a &quot;conversation among equals&quot; too literally.<p>In terms of perception, I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s much of a relationship to a human conversation. To make things equal, the string players would need to take turns soloing while the others wait more or less silently to respond, each with their own solo response. You&#x27;d be bored out of your gourd if string quartets were written that way.<p>But more to the point, the vast majority of time in a string quartet is devoted to two or more of the players producing phrases of music <i>in parallel</i>, and that is musically coherent and pleasing to the players and audience. Most humans cannot track two humans speaking in parallel <i>at all</i>. That alone tells us that music cognition is a very different phenomenon than speech cognition.<p>In short, I&#x27;m not sure why a string quartet would be considered the optimal genre for humans to produce music together. And even if it is, the reasons why are even less likely to do with the protocols around human speech cognition, and certainly not with some bizarre equivalent of the &quot;theory of mind&quot; associated with the musical phrase produced by one of the instruments[1].<p>1: Small digression-- In Elliott Carter&#x27;s 2nd String Quartet he actually started with a concept that each instrument was a kind of &quot;character&quot; in a play among the quartet. In this case, the problem with OP&#x27;s metaphor becomes obvious even in the introduction-- the homogenous timbre of a string quartet makes it difficult to hear the differences among the characters.

The establishment of four parts as the &quot;standard&quot; scoring for vocal ensembles can be traced back to the 15th century.<p>On the other hand the second and more famous dining (and conversation) club founded by Dr Johnson had originally 9 members, and gradually grew from that to dozens.

At Cheltenham Science Festival he explained that when it comes to having an enjoyable chat, the upper limit is a gang of four. When social groups have five or more members, the chances of them laughing together plummets.<p>He said: “You very rarely get more than four people in a conversation. In the normal run of things, when a fifth person joins a group, it’ll become two conversations within about 20 seconds.” Alternatively, a “lecture” situation develops in which one person holds court and the others act as an audience.<p>In larger groups, “you have to decide whether the person who is speaking is really so important you’d rather be standing there saying nothing”, he said. If the speaker is not very interesting, the audience tends to splinter into groups of four or fewer. Dunbar believes that the underlying reason is that we can only track what a certain number of people are likely to be thinking at one time.<p>Scientists call this the “theory of mind”, which involves being able to see the world from another person’s perspective. Also known as “mentalising”, it is crucial for conversation because people often use imprecise language, which makes context important. “The language we use is full of metaphors and unfinished sentences. The listener has to be able to figure out what it is the speaker is trying to say,” said Dunbar.<p>Additionally, the speaker must track whether those they are talking to are following their meaning. Dunbar believes that the limits of our ability to predict the thoughts of others in this way explains why groups that work in challenging situations — such as SAS patrols and surgical teams — tend to do best when there are four members.<p>In The Social Brain, co-authored by Dunbar, he argues that Shakespeare must have intuitively known about this phenomenon as it is rare for his plays to have more than four significant characters speaking in one scene.<p>He wrote: “[Shakespeare] instinctively understood the mentalising capacities of his audience. He was anxious to ensure his audience wasn’t cognitively overloaded by the number of minds in the action on stage. [It is] a masterclass in the study of human psychology.”</div><br/><div id="42417130" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42417130" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">calf</span><span>|</span><a href="#42398812">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42398966">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42418151">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42417130">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42417130">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not exactly Shakespeare but this reminds me what I enjoyed so much about the opening act of Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s O show was how it used so many acrobats and dancers to choreograph a concurrent scene, you were just overloaded with what you could pay attention to at any one moment.

But I wonder if it’s really just about mental limits, or if there’s something else going on? Like, isn’t it also about the vibe of the group or the type of people involved? Some groups are just better at keeping everyone engaged no matter the size- like certain friend groups or teams that have great dynamics.<p>Also, not sure if the &quot;four is magic&quot; thing holds up everywhere... In my experience, some of the best conversations happen with just two people. Like really deep, meaningful stuff you can’t get with more people. And for bigger groups, there’s often this chaos energy that can be fun in its own way. Yeah, it’s not the same as an intimate chat, but it’s not worse, just different.<p>That said, I do like the idea that our brains are wired for certain sizes - makes sense when you think about the mental juggling it takes to track other people’s thoughts and reactions. And I love how Dunbar tied this to Shakespeare—kinda cool that he instinctively kept scenes small to avoid &quot;cognitive overload.&quot; Makes me wonder if modern writers and creators even think about this stuff or just stumble into it.<p>So yeah, the mental limits idea is interesting, but I feel like the type of people, the setting, and even the purpose of the group matter a lot too. Sometimes it’s not the number of people, but how good they are at making everyone feel included... which is maybe a rarer skill than we think.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42418049" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42418049" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pessimizer</span><span>|</span><a href="#42417808">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42417059">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42418049">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42418049">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Very interesting, but there&#x27;s no link or reference to a paper here, just<p>&gt; But his research has also explored how people act in smaller groups.<p>My assumption is that Rhys Blakely was at Cheltenham Science Festival enjoying a lecture, and decided to fluff up a minute of it into an article.

This limit appears to be a consequence of the mechanisms of speech production and detection. There appear to be no differences between men and women in this respect, other than those introduced by women’s lighter voices.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=VoBNag8AAAAJ&amp;cstart=100&amp;pagesize=100&amp;citation_for_view=VoBNag8AAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;h...</a><p>-----<p>edit 2: and this:<p>Guillaume Dezecache, R.I.M.

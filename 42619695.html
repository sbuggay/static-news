A few years back I was making a gift which involved a ton of electronics and embedded hardware. One of the components I had laying around was a real time clock which refused to go beyond 31.12.1999, no matter what I did. Turned out that in (2021 iirc), there were still rtc modules on the market that had this problem. But it did not affect me all that much since the date had to be displayed on screen so I did the hacky-patchy thing to trim the first two bytes from the string and prepend &quot;20&quot;. I bet there are tons of software and hardware out there that use dirty hacks like that to &quot;fix it&quot;.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42620517" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42620517" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">IshKebab</span><span>|</span><a href="#42620578">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42620517">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42620517">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think anyone disputes that it was a real problem.

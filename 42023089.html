If you’re comfortable, I’d like us to try and be 10% more vulnerable than we normally would in a work setting.” I remember feeling a mix of anxiety and excitement rise in my chest. I sat pondering what I would share. I decided to go for more than 10%. I shared about how my marriage had almost collapsed a couple years prior and a taste of how painful it was. Some of my coworkers shared deeper things I’d never heard in a work setting. It was awkward. It was beautiful.<p>I&#x27;d rather not have my manager forcing me to do group therapy.

One thing I notice in your writing is you’re very tied up in things having meaning and mattering in some specific way. This itself can lead to burnout because if everything must matter you must be emotionally invested in everything. But you can care without it mattering to you. You can do a good job without being totally invested in everything about it. You can love what you do without it having significance in every detail.<p>In a complex job with a fast pace, a fair amount of tech debt around every edge, a relentless pace of innovation happening, and - yes - growth, there’s too much to be invested in everything. It doesn’t have to matter that much. The parts you really care about, the craft and quality of your work, your relationships, mentoring and growing the people around you, seeing things get better one piece at a time, and a few things - they can matter. But everything can’t. And even those you have to at some very deep level realize don’t matter really.<p>Stripe doesn’t really exist in this world. It’s a shared fiction to help frame the interactions between you and a few people you actually interact with in a day. The real truth is the only thing that happens in your days is you type on a computer and talk to a few people. It actually doesn’t matter in any meaningful way what you typed or some higher purpose around humbling honesty or exothermic curiosity or PMEs or whatever stories we tell ourselves to create some sort of reality out of the fiction. The only important things you really do is how you shape the lives of the people you interact with, and how you shape your own life.<p>Burnout is hard. Adopt a daily meditation practice. Let your mind heal by letting go of meaning and practice enjoying the moment you’re in with whomever you’re with, but most especially yourself. The joy will come back faster the faster you let go of things needing to matter or have deeper meaning, especially when those things are a fiction like a company or a career or any of the other small and big lies we’ve been told and we reinforce to ourselves daily. I know I’ve been there man, and I know exactly - exactly - the sensations and experiences you describe. It gets better, but I think once you get there it never totally goes away and it’s easier to slip back.<p>FWIW I don’t think burnout is the same as depression. I’ve felt both and burnout is different. It’s that loss of ability to engage - which overlaps with depression - but usually doesn’t come with the thoughts of hopeless despair and desire for life to be over. It’s just more of a deadness and inability to initiate what you think you should want to do but can’t, and it pervasively impacts everything.<p>It gets better.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42024476" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42024476" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">guitheengineer</span><span>|</span><a href="#42024793">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42024980">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42024476">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42024476">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’ve seen this pattern repeated so many times that I feel like it can be generalized:<p>when your mental health collapses nothing else holds value, it really doesn’t matter if you achieved your dream job, got all the prestige and income you initially desired, being mentally healthy is the basis of the pyramid.<p>Something I learned based on that is to really prioritize it!<p>Even if someone considers their career to be everything, realize that spending some of your earnings seeking professional help (therapy) is even a cheap investment considering that if you break and have to quit, you’re going to lose hundreds of thousands, and to recover it will suck (I’ve heard of people trying to quit tech altogether after burning out)<p>Sneaking something else related to mental health: sleep should be #1 health wise, when you’re consistently not getting quality sleep for months, there’s nothing you can really do to get around that, it will eventually just break you (your body won’t care if you’re coping with coffe or exercising!)<p>Btw that’s great writing and I really appreciate your courage in sharing this!

Years, not months.<p>Be gentle with yourself and forgive yourself.</div><br/><div id="42024735" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42024735" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pixelatedindex</span><span>|</span><a href="#42024373">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42024466">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42024735">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42024735">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Be gentle with yourself and forgive yourself.<p>This is so hard for people like me who have high standards and are hard on themselves. I always wanted to buy a home - I graduated at the right time but I never got a job at big tech. When I did get my full time job it paid a good chunk below market, provided no equity and now post-pandemic whatever was at my fingertips is at least an arms length away.<p>I have not done poorly for myself but I continue to rent in my mid 30s whereas my buddies at FAANG are much farther ahead in life. I was&#x2F;am not kind to my past self in the current phase - constant thoughts of should have done this, should have known that, etc.<p>With the current economy I feel like another chance might not come for another 5 years at the minimum, so I’m trying to learn my lesson and go to therapy, and accept it gracefully. I can’t even type “life isn’t a race and I shouldn’t compare myself” without putting it in quotes.<p>Point is, don’t be like me.

No doubt this person will find something exciting in no time.<p>Apropos of nothing as interviewers we do not put any weight on your submitting solutions after the window closes because we have to evaluate candidates consistently for business and legal reasons. We can’t give one person extra time because that’s not applying a consistent bar. Smaller companies may be more flexible but big tech won’t be. On the plus side big tech knows interviews are often a function of luck and setting and will generally always invite you to apply again without prejudice a few months later.<p>Being in a position to recover by getting bored and hacking on stuff you’re passionate about without pressure is something we’re really lucky to have, and I always try to do this between jobs.</div><br/><div id="42024595" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42024595" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lucianbr</span><span>|</span><a href="#42024450">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42024456">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42024595">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42024595">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; On the plus side big tech knows interviews are often a function of luck<p>How does this not mean &quot;we hire at random&quot;?

At this point, I can try everything—&quot;Treating it just as a job&quot;, &quot;finding happiness elsewhere&quot;, &quot;just get shit done&quot;—but nothing works. For a long while, I only found myself to blame. I felt idiotic for not having the energy to work like everyone else does.<p>Past one and a half years, have been years of self-discovery. I have been hacking on projects full-time (hopefully, I will make sustainable money soon). And it&#x27;s been so fun, and relieving, and joyful to direct your creative energy to projects, with no authority to answer to. It&#x27;s not without difficult times though. Sometimes, I feel blocked to the point of abandoning months of hard work, but I am slowly learning how to avoid those situations.<p>Honestly, everything I was advised was a lie (or at least, didn&#x27;t work for me). I like being able to shape things, and use my creative energy to do useful things. Politics, and bureaucratic processes, drain my energy to an extent that I simply can&#x27;t function. And no matter how hard I try, I can&#x27;t ignore it with the mindset of &quot;it&#x27;s just a job.&quot; I can&#x27;t find happiness in &quot;being promoted&quot; or whatever rating I am given.<p>I just want to ship good software. When I am driven, I will forget about everything and just dive in to solve the problem. Sadly though, it&#x27;s not an easy ask in a modern-day corporate environment.<p>So, I would say what you&#x27;re experiencing is normal in many ways. Don&#x27;t kill yourself over it. If you have a list of fun projects, attempt them. For many of us, creative energy is precious, and needs to be directed well to keep ourselves sane.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42024567" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42024567" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gradschoolfail</span><span>|</span><a href="#42023090">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42024526">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42024567">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42024567">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Time for PG to, with chainsaw &amp; pernach, remind Patrick about founder mode?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

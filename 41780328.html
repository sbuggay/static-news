However, Medicine is also facing a replication crisis to the same degree. Would people also suggest that Medicine is not a science?<p>I think it comes down to the fact that both disciplines work with people and behaviour, and people are not homogeneous nor are behaviours easily predicted. For that reason, I think that a distinction can be made between “hard sciences” and “soft sciences” - we just can’t get the same level of precision that the hard sciences can, but that doesn’t mean that Psychology isn’t scientific. We still apply the scientific method to discover phenomena and develop testable theories, just like other sciences.

The latter is conventionally considered unscientific. Epidemiology was once built on basic scientific observation, it&#x27;s now also disappeared down the drain-hole of endless mathematics without real world hypothesis testing.<p>Medicine in contrast spent a lot of time being unscientific in the past, and is now much more-so.

Wait until the means to do so become available, and try to find those ways instead. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not the state of psych. research.<p>There is of course also a more practical side. For psych and med interventions, you don&#x27;t need to know how it works. If method A works better than method B, it&#x27;s a good idea to try A before trying B. However, that research is also difficult, and many papers have been found wrong afterwards.

And this strengthens my confidence.<p>There was an understanding of natural selection even back to antiquity. How could there not be? Did people not tame the animals and plants? These are experiments, and they saw the results.<p>There were great contributions to astronomy long before Kepler. There were many experiments that influenced the whole field. There was a lot of important chemistry that happened long before Lavoisier (conservation of mass) and Dalton (atomic model).<p>The proto-sciences are nothing to scoff at. They aren&#x27;t useless and they weren&#x27;t ill-founded. They were just... noisy (and science is naturally a noisy process, so I mean *<i>NOISY*</i>). There&#x27;s nothing inheriently wrong with that. The only thing wrong is not recognizing the noise and placing unfounded confidence in results. That famous conversation between Dyson and Fermi discussing von Neumann&#x27;s elephant wasn&#x27;t saying that Dyson didn&#x27;t do hard work or that the work he did had no utility, it was that you can&#x27;t place confidence in a model derived from empirical results without a strong underlying theory. You&#x27;d never get to that if you only observed because you&#x27;d only end up making the same error Dyson did.<p>Science, in its nature, is not about answers, it is about confidence in a model that approximates answers. These two things look identical but truth is unobtainable, there is always an epsilon bound. So it is about that epsilon! Your confidence! So experiments that don&#x27;t yield high confidence results aren&#x27;t useless, but they are rather just the beginning. They give direction to explore. Because hey, if I&#x27;m looking for elephants I&#x27;d rather start looking where someone says they saw a big crazy monster than randomly pick a point on the globe. But I&#x27;m also not going to claim elephants exist just because I heard someone talking about something vaguely matching the description. And this is naturally how it works. We&#x27;re exploring into the unknown. You gotta follow hunches and rumors, because it is better than nothing. But you won&#x27;t get anywhere from observation alone. Not to mention that it is incredibly easy to be deceived by your observations. You will find this story ring true countless times in the history of science. But better models always prevail because we challenge the status quo and we take risks. But the nature of it is that it is risky (noisy). There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that. You just have to admit it.</div><br/><div id="41806003" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41806003" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">elmomle</span><span>|</span><a href="#41802869">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41804974">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41806463">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41806003">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41806003">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><p><pre><code>  &gt; There was an understanding of natural selection even back to antiquity.

Isn&#x27;t this OP&#x27;s point, though?  People saw results, and even worked with what they saw, but underlying theories were all over the place and it wasn&#x27;t until the time of Mendel that we started to have even the most rudimentary sense of rigor or scientific method when it came to the field that we now know as genetics.  And the contention is that what came before Darwin and Mendel wouldn&#x27;t stand up as rigorous science in our eyes, but was nevertheless the crucial foundation for what became the field of genetics.</div><br/><div id="41806246" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41806246" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">godelski</span><span>|</span><a href="#41802869">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41806003">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41806463">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41806246">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41806246">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In a way yes, but I&#x27;m saying their proposal of how to handle the situation is too strong: don&#x27;t do experiments<p><pre><code>  &gt;&gt;&gt; there needs to be a long period ... where people aren&#x27;t doing experiments and are just observing and describing.

I strongly disagree with this because observation isn&#x27;t enough. You have to experiment.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s fuzzy. But embrace the fuzziness. Acknowledge it. The truth is that observation isn&#x27;t enough. You can NEVER discover truth from observation alone. Science doesn&#x27;t work without interaction. There&#x27;s three classes of casual structure: correlation, intervention, and counterfactual. We know the memes about the first, but the other two require participation. You&#x27;ll get lucky and have some &quot;natural experiments&quot; but this is extremely limited. What I&#x27;m saying is that we can work with these issues without tying our hands behind our backs and shooting ourselves in the foot. Stuff being hard is no reason to handicap ourselves. I&#x27;m arguing that only makes it more difficult lol<p>I think one of the major issues is that we (scientists) fear that my openly discussing limitations and admitting that we don&#x27;t have high (statistical) confidence will result in people not taking us seriously. And in many ways this is a reasonable response. I&#x27;m sure many scientists, myself included, have annoyingly found that an honest limitations section ends up just being ammunition for reviewers to reject the work. A criticism my advisor has given me is that I&#x27;m &quot;too honest&quot;. Maybe he&#x27;s right, but idk, I think that thinking is wrong. Because science is about ruling things out, not proving results (you can effectively achieve the latter by doing the former but you can&#x27;t directly do the latter). And the younger the field is (e.g. my field of ML is VERY young), the noisier the results are.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d rather live in a world where we&#x27;re overly open about limitations than not. We&#x27;re adults and can recognize that&#x27;s the reality, right? Because papers are communication from one expert to others? (And not to the general public, though they can see) Because as I see it, the openness is just letting others know what areas should be explored.<p>Don&#x27;t fear the noise, embrace it. It&#x27;s always there, you can&#x27;t get rid of it, so trying to hide it only makes more.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41806463" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41806463" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ctchocula</span><span>|</span><a href="#41802869">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41804974">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41806003">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41803912">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41806463">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41806463">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; There was an understanding of natural selection even back to antiquity.

And sometimes he succeeds! For instance, he attempts to make the “sulfur of antimony” by following the instructions in The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony (Der Triumph-Wagen Antimonii), written by an alchemist named Basil Valentine sometime around the year 1600. At first, all Principe gets is a “dirty gray lump”. Then he realizes the recipe calls for “Hungarian antimony,” so instead of using pure lab-grade antimony, he literally orders some raw Eastern European ore, and suddenly the reaction works! It turns out the Hungarian dirt is special because it contains a bit of silicon dioxide, something Basil Valentine couldn’t have known.<p>&gt; No wonder alchemists thought they were dealing with mysterious forces beyond the realm of human understanding. To them, that’s exactly what they were doing! If you don’t realize that your ore is lacking silicon dioxide—because you don’t even have the concept of silicon dioxide—then a reaction that worked one time might not work a second time, you’ll have no idea why that happened, and you’ll go nuts looking for explanations. Maybe Venus was in the wrong position? Maybe I didn’t approach my work with a pure enough heart? Or maybe my antimony was poisoned by a demon!<p>&gt; An alchemist working in the year 1600 would have been justified in thinking that the physical world was too hopelessly complex to ever be understood—random, even. One day you get the sulfur of antimony, the next day you get a dirty gray lump, nobody knows why, and nobody will ever know why. And yet everything they did turned out to be governed by laws—laws that were discovered by humans, laws that are now taught in high school chemistry. Things seem random until you understand ‘em.<p>Well, this example doesn&#x27;t just fail to support the argument, but undercuts it. Basil successfully identified the kind of antimony that would work, -despite- having no concept of sulfur dioxide. He did not write down something like &quot;not all kinds of antimony work for this recipe, so get a bunch of different kinds and try them all&quot; -- that, or a stronger version (&quot;sometimes the recipe fails, we don&#x27;t know why&quot;), would support the author&#x27;s point.<p>So we&#x27;re left with the author trying to argue that this alchemist thought the world was &quot;too hopelessly complex to ever be understood&quot; on the basis of ... the alchemist correctly identifying the ingredient that would make the recipe work.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41803572" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41803572" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">autoexec</span><span>|</span><a href="#41803605">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41802896">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41803572">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41803572">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We&#x27;ve learned that it hasn&#x27;t produced much research that holds up to replication, that the vast majority of research never gets properly replicated at all anyway, and that despite the endless meta-analysis of glorified internet surveys people&#x27;s mental health hasn&#x27;t been  improving.<p>We&#x27;re certainly learning how to use psychology to manipulate people though.

As I mentioned in my main comment, the study <i>naturally</i> has a metric fuckton of variables and noise which makes even basic experiments extremely difficult, but there are other factors like willingness to close that gap (is it surprising few want to climb a treacherous mountain?), as well as the whole structure of academia and the way metrics are formed. How do you create a foundation when you&#x27;re not only not incentivized to replicate but actively dis-incentivized? How do you explore that mountain which certainly has many pitfalls and uncertain paths when you must publish frequently?<p>Those problems are not remotely isolated to psychology, but they have a huge and crazy difficult mountain to climb and should we be surprised that few try to climb it when attempting to do so is far more likely to lead to academic success rather than helping the field make their way up? Even if you don&#x27;t fall off? It can take a long time to actually capitalize on those gains. I do think this is a conversation academia needs to have. Everything in place is logical and makes sense, they were done for good reasons, but I think we need to be honest that exploration is just a highly risky business.

But you&#x27;ll never know until you go). We can inch our way out or we can be brave. I think unfortunately it is only explorers who can tell the brave from imaginative. It sucks, but is this not the nature of it? A story as old as stories are. But we wouldn&#x27;t be where we are if we didn&#x27;t engage in risky business.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41803197" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41803197" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ordu</span><span>|</span><a href="#41802896">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41802969">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41805066">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41803197">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41803197">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; professional training as a therapist does not produce a statistically significant improvement in ability to treat mental health conditions.</i><p>It produces a statistically significant improvement, just not with people who are already gifted at it.

It&#x27;s not exactly false but it&#x27;s a little misleading (like some other parts of the essay).<p>Lots to say about it but this is a finding that has been reported intermittently for decades. However, it&#x27;s being spun a little misleadingly.<p>Note that the author says that untrained professors were selected for their ability to be warm and empathetic. It&#x27;s not everyone (we all know not everyone is warm and empathetic), and even trainees learn very very early (like immediately in their first term) the basics of therapy. Not everyone is warm and empathetic, and people going into clinical psychology are sort of self-selected in their empathy to start with.<p>This research is kind of being taken out of context too. Wampold, one of the authors cited (who I have the greatest respect for) is very big on &quot;nonspecific factors&quot;, meaning things like empathy, good social skills, and so forth. His studies in general tend to be focused not on &quot;does training matter?&quot; but &quot;do specific therapy protocols matter, or is it about the clinician&#x27;s social&#x2F;relationship skills?&quot;<p>If you want some kind of medical standards, you can&#x27;t just say &quot;oh it&#x27;s ok, everyone can just be warm and empathetic&quot;. You have to train on it, grade it, hold it to some standard. Otherwise you get manipulative, self-serving therapists who do harm in the long run (the length of a study versus real settings is another issue).<p>Another issue is that many of these issues are not unique to psychology. In lots of medical scenarios it&#x27;s been shown that the amount of training needed to competently do a wide variety of procedures is lower than current standards in the US require. Experienced clinicians in many fields have acquired biases that interfere with practice, young trainees are much more worried about performance and are more open-minded and so forth (on average a little; not trying to stereotype).<p>A huge, enormous volume of studies over many years have shown that therapy works compared to all sorts of placebos and controls; that some therapists are reliably better than others; but that what makes therapy &quot;work&quot; overall is not what protocol-driven therapies (CBT etc) assert. It&#x27;s not so much that training isn&#x27;t necessary, it&#x27;s that the field has has been obsessed with scientific details that, although well-intended, don&#x27;t matter, and healthcare in general is full of phenomena that we&#x27;d rather not admit.</div><br/><div id="41805205" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41805205" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">titanomachy</span><span>|</span><a href="#41802896">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41805066">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41807196">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41805205">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41805205">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for writing this, appreciate the point of view of someone who knows what they’re talking about.

The problem is everyone is different on some level, and we often don&#x27;t have the resources to get to the root of any problems. So treatments that may work extremely effectively for some may be thrown out because they don&#x27;t work effectively for everyone, and can be contraindicated. Somatic therapists especially have to deal with this. Effective treatments are often outside of the &quot;evidence based&quot; tests, which can be based entirely around showing symptom improvement. This creates a catch-22 where if you lessen the restrictions you get a lot of crackpot providers, where if you keep them tight you keep people from being able to access treatments that may work well for them.<p>There&#x27;s also competing models for mental problems and approaches - the psychiatric model is similar to a doctor giving treatment for an illness. They tend to have a belief in biological determinism, IE if a parent had an illness then its likely you will have one too. The Biopsychosocial model is a little bit more holistic around the experiences of people and their physical environment and upbringing. The Trauma model is one I personally ascribe more to which conceptualizes mental health problems as understandable reactions to traumatic events that are conditioned within us.<p>There are a <i>lot</i> of people who get real relief from outside the mainstream providers, and there are a lot of people for whom the standard providers have not been able to help.

I would expect after all those years mental health to be accounted in a serious criminal case like killing somebody.

So what about parents in those cases, aren&#x27;t they having their part on the sick mentality of their child? Why not pressing charges to them?<p>Even assuming the premise of killing someone implies mental illness, and assuming the mental illness stems from trauma, there&#x27;s a pretty large leap in reasoning here. Why must the trauma come during childhood? Why not in adulthood? Even in childhood, why does it have to come from the parents?<p>Then you have the idea of continuing up the causal chain. Why are we pressing charges to the parents? If the parent&#x27;s traumatized their kids, there&#x27;s good chance they did it due to their own mental illness&#x2F;trauma, which means the parents themselves were abused in childhood.

As we&#x27;ve recently discovered, a massive swath of psychological studies are non-reproducible. So maybe we shouldnt treat psychology as if it were a rigorous scientific pursuit, but a philosophical one, or even a therapeutic one (IE. make it synonymous with psychiatry). Leave the science to the neuroscientists, who can quantify and measure the things they&#x27;re studying (I understand there is some overlap between these fields sometimes). If your study consists of asking people questions and treating their answers as quantitative measurements of anything, I don&#x27;t know- it feels like something has been lost in the sauce there.

Otherwise you&#x27;re proving me right!<p>I happen to think your overly broad generalization is more right than wrong, but I also recognize the silliness of asking to be &quot;enlightened&quot; on an entire branch of human endeavor via internet comments. This is a problematic argument form, and someone calling out this behavior does not prove you right.<p>So let&#x27;s be clear about what &quot;enlightening you&quot; means. If your argument is &quot;psychology is based on a fundamentally flawed&#x2F;useless study design (surveys) and we can never learn anything real from it&quot;, then a few examples of reproducible, interesting, not a-priori obvious results from surveys should be sufficient to show that we actually can learn real things from surveys. (And be careful not to fall into the &quot;I could have told you that!&quot; fallacy.)

The most salient example of this is the &quot;implicit bias&quot; studies that came out of Stanford. Their study design was something like:<p>Task 1: Associate good words with white&#x2F;Christian&#x2F;American themes as fast as you can<p>Task 2: Associate bad words with &quot;foreign&quot; themes<p>Task 3: Associate good words with white&#x2F;Christian&#x2F;American themes <i>again</i><p>Task 4: Associate good words with &quot;foreign&quot; themes<p>And the result is: you&#x27;re racist because Task 4 takes you a few milliseconds longer. It never occurred to them (or it did and they intentionally forced the result) that in Task 4, you&#x27;re literally <i>unlearning</i> what you&#x27;ve just practiced 3 times. It was one of the most blatantly bad studies I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life and I didn&#x27;t see anyone else calling out how problematic it was, because <i>Stanford</i>.<p>So in general I actually agree with your take: the field is rife with junk science, some of it obvious, and almost certainly some of it intentional.

Why would it be fallacious? Social studies are rife with findings that are either extremely obvious to everyone, extremely obvious to conservatives specifically (because psychologists are nearly always on the left), or extremely obvious to anyone who reads the study design.<p>I recently wrote an essay about why replication studies can&#x27;t fix science [1] and one of the problems cited is the prevalence of studies that aren&#x27;t worth replicating because &quot;I could have told you that&quot;. Examples include silly papers like [2], which is literally titled <i>&quot;People&#x27;s clothing behaviour changes according to external weather and indoor environment&quot;</i> yet somehow manages to also say, <i>&quot;It is evident that further studies are needed in this field&quot;</i>, or [3] saying that the average male student would like to be more muscular.<p>But there are less silly examples which crop up due to the ideological bias in the field. Academics purge any conservatives they find, meaning that social studies spends a lot of time and money investigating things that are considered obvious outside of far left spaces. Jonathan Haidt is famous for arguing that this is a problem (albeit, not actually doing anything about it). As an example highly apropos to this thread, psychologists recently started discovering that stereotypes are usually accurate. Much other work in psychology is built on the suspiciously circular premise that stereotypes are either fictional and thus mere folk intuitions, as Mastroianni would put it, or are accurate only because people believe they are accurate (the field of &quot;stereotype threat&quot; is like this). On the left the idea that stereotypical achievement gaps are socially constructed is considered obvious and a matter of faith, to people on the right the opposite is true: idea that they reflect actual truths about reality is the obvious idea.<p>So even if you set aside the offensively wasteful, there&#x27;s still a lot of scope for study claims to be considered obvious by some and not by others.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.plan99.net&#x2F;replication-studies-cant-fix-science-0e195234a280" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.plan99.net&#x2F;replication-studies-cant-fix-science...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0360132306003672" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S03601...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openurl.ebsco.com&#x2F;EPDB%3Agcd%3A4%3A12322516&#x2F;detailv2?sid=ebsco%3Aplink%3Ascholar&amp;id=ebsco%3Agcd%3A18009272&amp;crl=c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openurl.ebsco.com&#x2F;EPDB%3Agcd%3A4%3A12322516&#x2F;detailv2...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41802835" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41802835" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">inSenCite</span><span>|</span><a href="#41802203">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41803143">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41802835">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41802835">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This was a great write up.<p>One thing that struck me as to the difficulty &#x2F; young-ness of this field is also the fact that it is the only science that is us studying our thinking selves.

Dr. Charan Ranganath was a member of my dissertation committee who recently wrote a wonderful book about memory and gave some really fantastic interviews.

Now yes, some of this is informed by neuroimaging and neuroscience spanning human and animal models, but also lots and lots of behavioral memory research. And the findings that are discussed are pretty reliable, shown over and over again in different ways. So, no, this article is not great. It did not do diligent research.

I say this holding a degree in physics! (undergrad physics, grad CS&#x2F;ML)<p>By this I mean that to make confident predictions, you need some serious statistics, but psych is one of the least math heavy sciences (thankfully they recently learned about Bayes and there&#x27;s a revolution going on). Unlike physics or chemistry, you have so little control over your experiments.<p>There&#x27;s also the problem of measurements. We stress in experimental physics that you can only measure things by proxy. This is like you measure distance by using a ruler, and you&#x27;re not really measuring &quot;a meter&quot; but the ruler&#x27;s approximation of a meter. This is why we care so much about calibration and uncertainty, making multiple measurements with different measuring devices (gets stats on that class of device) and from different measuring techniques (e.g. ruler, laser range finder, etc). But psych? What the fuck does it even mean &quot;to measure attention&quot;?! It&#x27;s hard enough dealing with the fact that &quot;a meter&quot; is &quot;a construct&quot; but in psych your concepts are much less well defined (i.e. higher uncertainty). And then everything is just empirical?! No causal system even (barely) attempted?! (In case you&#x27;ve ever wondered, this is a glimpse of why physicists struggle in ML. Not because the work, but accepting the results. See also Dyson and von Neumann&#x27;s Elephant)<p>I&#x27;ve jokingly likened psych to alchemy, meaning proto-chemistry -- chemistry prior to the atomic model (chemistry is &quot;the study of electrons&quot;) -- or to astrology (astronomy pre-Kepler, not astrology we see today). I do think that&#x27;s where the field is at, because there is no fundamental laws. That doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t useful. Copernicus, Brahe, Galileo (same time as Kepler; they fought), and many others did amazing work and are essential figures to astronomy and astrophysics today. But psych is in an interesting boat. There are many tools at their disposal that could really help them make major strides towards determining these &quot;laws&quot;. But it&#x27;ll take a serious revolution and some major push to have some extremely tough math chops to get there. It likely won&#x27;t come from ML (who suffers similar issues of rigor), but maybe from neuroscience or plain old stats (econ surprisingly contributes, more to sociology though). My worry is that the slop has too much momentum and that criticism will be dismissed because it is viewed as saying that the researchers are lazy, dumb, or incompetent rather than the monumental difficulties that are natural to the field (though both may be true, and one can cause the other). But I do hope to see it. Especially as someone in ML. We can really see the need to pin down these concepts such as cognition, consciousness, intelligence, reasoning, emotions, desire, thinking, will, and so on. These are not remotely easy problems to solve. But it is easy to convince yourself that you do understand, as long as you stop asking why after a certain point.<p>And I do hope these conversations continue. Light is the best disinfectant. Science is about seeking truth, not answers. That often requires a lot of nuance, unfortunately. I know it will cause some to distrust science more, but I have the feeling they were already looking for reasons to.</div><br/><div id="41803230" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41803230" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">closed</span><span>|</span><a href="#41802016">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41802885">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41803230">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41803230">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As someone who did statistics and psychology, I&#x27;m very surprised by this take, for a few reasons:<p>1.

SubiculumCode commented the main part of what I wanted to convey, so I won&#x27;t repeat.<p>1. Yes! But that&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t exactly change things, in fact, it&#x27;s part of my point. A big part of why this happened (and still does!) is due to the inherent difficulties and the lack of existing tools. If you ever get a chance, go look at a university physics lab. Even Columbia&#x27;s nuclear reactors (fusion or fission!) and I think many will be surprised how &quot;janky&quot; it looks. It&#x27;s because they build the tools along the way, not because lack of monetary resources (well... That too...) but because the tools don&#x27;t exist!<p>My critique about the psych field is that this is not more embraced. You have to embrace the fuzziness! The uncertainty. But the field is dominated by people publishing studies that use very simple statistical models, low sample sizes, and put a lot of faith in unreliable metrics with arbitrary cutoffs (most well known being the p-value). Many people will graduate grad school without a strong background in statistics and calculus (it&#x27;s also easier to think this is stronger than it is. And of course, there are also plenty who would be indistinguishable from mathematicians. But on average?). There are rockstars in every field, even when not recognized as rockstars. But it matters who the field follows.<p>And I must be absolutely clear, this is not to say that work and those results are useless. Utility and confidence are orthogonal. You might need 5 sigma confidence verified by multiple teams and replicated on different machines to declare discovery of a particle but before that there&#x27;s many works published with only a few sigma and plenty of purely theoretical works. (Note: in physics replication is highly valued. Most work is not novel and it is easy to climb the academic ladder without leading novel research. This is a whole other conversation though) This is why I discussed Copernicus and Brahe but would not call them astronomers. That&#x27;s not devaluing them, but rather nothing a categorical difference due to the paradigm shift Kepler caused. Mind you, chemistry even later!<p>2. I specifically mention economists (my partner is one). I could highlight them more but I feel this would only add to confusion. I believe those close to the details will have no doubt to their role. I don&#x27;t want to detract from their contribution but I also don&#x27;t want to convolute my message which is already difficult to accurately convey.<p>3. I think this is orthogonal. I&#x27;m happy to bash on other fields if that makes my comment feel less like an attack rather than a critique (or wakeup call). I&#x27;m highly critical of my own community (ML) and believe it is important that we all are *<i>most*</i> critical of our own tribes, because even if we don&#x27;t dictate where the ship goes we&#x27;re not far removed from those that do. I&#x27;ll rant all day if you want (or check my comment (recent) history if you want to know if I&#x27;m honest about this). I&#x27;ll happily critique physicists who can solve high order PDEs in their sleep but struggle with for loops. Or the &quot;retired engineer&quot; trope that every physicist knows and most have experienced.<p>But it is hard to be critical while not offending (there&#x27;s a few comments about this too). Maybe you disagree with my critique but I hope you can reread the end of comment as hopeful and encouraging. I want psychology to be taken more seriously. But if the field is unable to recognize why the other fields are dismissive of them, then this won&#x27;t happen. Sure, there&#x27;s silly reasons that aren&#x27;t reasonable, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s no reason.<p>It is a matter of fact that the (statistical) confidence of studies in psychology is much lower than those of the &quot;hard&quot; sciences (physics, chemistry, and yes, even biology (the last part is a joke. Read how you will)). In part this is due to the studies and researchers themselves, but the truth is that the biggest contributing factor is the nature of the topic. That is not an easy thing to deal with and I have a lot of sympathy for it. But how to handle it is up to the field.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41802885" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41802885" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">miksumiksu</span><span>|</span><a href="#41802016">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41803230">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41803005">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41802885">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41802885">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not all psych is as jurasic as you describe.

Certainly. It&#x27;s difficult to talk in general because there&#x27;s always exceptions. I also think it&#x27;s very easy to misunderstand my comment. I didn&#x27;t think psych is useless. But science isn&#x27;t so much about having the right answer as your confidence in your model of &quot;the answer&quot;. It&#x27;s not binary. My point is that when working in a field where it&#x27;s very difficult to have high confidence to normalize it and become over confident in results because everyone else is working with similar levels. I have (and made) similar criticisms of my own field, ML.<p><pre><code>  &gt; core consturcts are solid.

You don&#x27;t have to answer, this isn&#x27;t a challenge. But these are questions every good scientist should be constantly asking about their own work and their own field. That&#x27;s the &quot;trust but verify&quot; part. It&#x27;s why every scientist should constantly challenge authority. Because replication is the foundation of science and you don&#x27;t get that without the skepticism.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41803005" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41803005" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">goldfeld</span><span>|</span><a href="#41802016">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41802885">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41803046">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41803005">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41803005">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Psychology is not inherently treated as soft, it&#x27;s jusst that its human element attracts intuitive people much more than rational ones.

Speaking very briefly, there are five classes of perceptions: emotions, wishes, thoughts, beliefs, and body sensations. The division of perceptions into these classes is not a result of purely intellectual exercise or idle theorizing. If one starts carefully and diligently observe contents of their mind, these contents will delaminate into such classes naturally. Try that yourself and you will see it as a fact.<p>Further introspection and assessment of arising perceptions would reveal some interesting patterns: there are two mutually incompatible kinds of emotions, and two mutually incompatible kinds of wishes, and so on.<p>One could make observations about the interplay of these perceptions and their dynamic. For example, if someone in some specific situation experiences an emotion X and a wish A (with some specific qualities), they can either realize that wish or choose not to do so. Each choice will lead to some changes in the contents of the mind: emotion X is replaced by emotion Y, and&#x2F;or wish A is changed into wish B, and so on. Gather enough observations of that kind, and you could eventually formulate some hypotheses about possible general laws of perceptions (e.g. make a prediction that emotion X will change to emotion Y in specific set of circumstances).<p>These hypotheses could be verified by training several people to observe the same five classes of perceptions in the same manner. Arrange various test events for them, record their choices and outcomes of these choices (described in the same language of five classes of perceptions).<p>If most of them report more or less the same subjective outcomes (without being told about hypothesis and predictions, of course), that&#x27;s the first step of verification for a possible general law of perceptions.<p>The second step of verification would be to apply brain imaging to those trained people, allowing us to map emotions X,Y,Z to some distinct patterns of the brain activity. After that do the same experiments with people who are untrained: arrange same test events for them while recording their brain activity. If changes in their brain patterns match for emotion X changed to emotion Y, that would be an objective confirmation of hypothesis formulated earlier.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41802175" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41802175" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">empiko</span><span>|</span><a href="#41802016">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41803046">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41804268">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41802175">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41802175">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The parallels to ML you drew are on point.

I came over from physics because it is so cool. But what I found odd is that few people were as interested in the math as I was, and even moreso were dismissive of the utility of the math (even when demonstrated!). It&#x27;s gotten less mathy by the year.<p>My criticisms of ML aren&#x27;t out of hate, but actually love. We&#x27;ve done great work and you need to be excited to do research -- and sometimes blind and sometimes going just on faith --, because it is grueling dealing with so much failure. Because it&#x27;s so easy to mistake failure for success and success for failure. It&#x27;s a worry that we&#x27;ll be overtaken by conmen, that I have serious concerns that we are not moving towards building AGI. But it&#x27;s difficult to criticize and receive criticism (many physics groups specifically train students to take it and deal with this seemingly harsh language. To separate your internal value from your idea). So I want to be clear that my criticism (which you can see in many of my posts) is not a call to stop ML or even slow it down, but a desire to sail in a different direction (or even allow others to sail in those directions as opposed to being on one big ship).<p>I do know there are others in psych with similar stories and beliefs. But there&#x27;s a whole conversation about the structure of academia if we&#x27;re going to discuss how to stop building mega ships and allow people to truly explore (there will always be a big ship, and there always should!

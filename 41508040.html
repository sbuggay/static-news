Far from it. I grew up in the 90s and looking around I&#x27;m amazed at what we have.<p>Last week was the first time in 5 years that I physically went to the bank, and it was only due to a rare edge case scenario that their online services (until now) don&#x27;t cover. Just about all admin in my life is done online.<p>And there&#x27;s so much tech to tinker with. Raspberry pi, Arduino, PCs, ... Connect it to your mobile device and it just explodes what you can do, if you have the energy and time for it. Fun &#x2F; nerdy tech is (for the most part) dirt cheap now. Sensors, electric motors, microcontrollers - it&#x27;s all there readily available for basically nothing.<p>... and considering the personal tech &#x2F; mobile devices. I remember interviewing for a job in the biggest city in the country some 16 years ago. Printed paper map, getting paper tickets for the subway, getting lost and almost missing the interview. That&#x27;s unthinkable nowadays. I&#x27;d have the map on my phone and I&#x27;d let my mobile phone guide me through the subway, with the ticket on the phone.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41508318" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41508318" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gipsies</span><span>|</span><a href="#41508270">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41509308">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41508750">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41508318">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41508318">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In the future people might think the same about Bitcoin and AI.</div><br/><div id="41509168" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41509168" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aleph_minus_one</span><span>|</span><a href="#41508270">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41508318">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41508409">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41509168">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41509168">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; In the future people might think the same about Bitcoin and AI.<p>Perhaps, but these will be different people than those who miss the 90-00 internet.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41508409" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41508409" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ocean_moist</span><span>|</span><a href="#41508270">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41508318">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41509168">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41508986">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41508409">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41508409">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; In the future people might think the same about Bitcoin<p>In 2017 I thought I missed bitcoin, still managed to mine a meager amount on my parents computers.

The internet functioned fine for over a decade, profitably, without invasive adware like we see now, which is to the point of total degradation of the core service itself - this is not the cause of consumers, but rather the current mindset of the wall street landscape.<p>As far as ânot willing to pay for itâ what do you call subscription models of popular language models like chatGPT? I would pay an <i>embarrassing</i> amount for a google that worked like google did 10 years ago. That isnât my fault that product doesnât exist anymore, the demand is there.<p>This angry tone isnât directed at you, I just find it so frustrating that people believe itâs such a binary choice. Google had the literal monopoly on tech talent and knowledge for 20 years and decided to divert that into the most cannibalistic and predatory business model around. Can you imagine had they directed the same efforts to making an actual competitor to AWS? I am speaking as a career cloud infra guy and business owner running on cloud - as much as I hate MS products Iâd sooner migrate to azure than ever spend a penny on a google cloud product for anything more critical than running the office coffee maker. That, I think, was a tremendously bad decision for the internet, and the decision absolutely was not binary. Make a good product people find useful and people pay for it.

BBS&#x27;s were probably of greater interest in the early 90&#x27;s.  If you had a specific interest, there might just <i>nothing</i> online about it yet.<p>2. Dial-up <i>sucked</i>.  It was slow, not terribly reliable, and it monopolized your phone-line.  Many can probably remember dialing into their university and hanging up 10 times until they finally got a faster modem on the other end.  (You could tell how fast a modem was by its handshaking sounds.)  A lot of people first experienced the internet on university dialup, because home service wasn&#x27;t there yet or was really expensive.<p>3. The late-90&#x27;s internet was sometimes very difficult to navigate.  Search engines generally sucked.  Even if you had their inflexible syntax correct and had perfect search terms, their indexing was often just not up to the task.<p>4. Protocols were heavily balkanized.  HTML and WWW were not yet dominant.  There were other things too, like gopher.  Gopher had it&#x27;s own search engines... that sucked.<p>5. People actually used usenet to have discussions.  Usenet really was better in the late 90&#x27;s.  There were enough people using it that you could learn some really interesting stuff, but it hadn&#x27;t been rendered unusable by bots, spam, and copyright trolls yet.  It was like reddit, but <i>way</i> geekier and far less comprehensive.<p>6. Chatting with people in real-time was a thing.  Imagine discord, but text-only.  You guessed it, that was it&#x27;s own protocol :IRC.<p>7. In general, everything was splintered and needed it&#x27;s own programs.  You could talk to other people in a dozen different ways, and they all had their own protocols and programs.  Nothing was truly dominant.  Many here can probably still remember their ICQ number.<p>8. A lot of the awesome stuff we take for granted now just wasn&#x27;t there back then.  Wikipedia was not a thing.  If you wanted info on anything local like restaurants, etc., you could just forget about it.  Multimedia was rudimentary as heck because even just adding one 60 kilobyte image to your site would add half a minute to the load time for users on a relatively fast modem, and much more for those that weren&#x27;t.  Text was king!<p>9. Malicious code was truly hazardous back then.  Browsers of the day were like natives of the Americas before smallpox arrived.  They had no immunity at all.  By the late 90&#x27;s you could really F&#x27; up royally if you weren&#x27;t careful.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41509445" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41509445" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dackdel</span><span>|</span><a href="#41508400">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41508192">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41509445">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41509445">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">check out nostr. gives me the feeling of 90&#x27;s internet</div><br/><div id="41509457" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41509457" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aleph_minus_one</span><span>|</span><a href="#41509445">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41508192">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41509457">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41509457">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; check out nostr. gives me the feeling of 90&#x27;s internet<p>I&#x27;m not so sure about that: in the 90s, there was no social media.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41508192" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41508192" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">voidfunc</span><span>|</span><a href="#41509445">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41508445">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41508192">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41508192">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Nerdy teen laments being born too late.

Growing up with computers becoming exponentially faster and better every 6 months was freakinâ amazing and Iâm happy to have seen it.<p>&gt; I am also at the age where I can take advantage of the shift towards AI and related technological advancements<p>Me too! This shift comes every few years. The first successful mass deployment of modern AI technology was in the 1970âs when the post office started using computer vision to route mail. The shift to AI that I got to see was Google. That was amazing.<p>Big fan of the current LLM shift too, of course, but it feels less magical than Google did. A little because I understand it better, a little because it benefits me less personally than Google did. Feels more like a marginal improvement whereas Google felt like omg everything is different now the olds are so behind the times they canât even comprehend!!<p>But I think itâs more that the big shift happens with your newfound ability to grok things, leverage information, and get shit done in your late teens &#x2F; early 20âs than the actual technology available. Whatever new tech happens around that age will feel like a profound hugely impactful change in the world (but itâs actually you, not the tech).<p>&gt; I just think the internet is much worse than it was<p>It is.

Most people are perfectly happy with how the internet is right now and don&#x27;t care for going back to things you used to do online a decade or two ago.<p>On social media: today it&#x27;s no longer even about ordinary individuals sharing their ordinary lives online like they used to 15 years ago. It&#x27;s about consuming content around your interests (which includes entertainment). Very few people on my instagram make personal posts anymore (myself included) and when they do, they&#x27;re few and far in between. It&#x27;s all brands and content creators. I also think people&#x27;s mentality has shifted and they no longer care about sharing their lives online. It was a new concept to many between 2006-2014 to be able to do it, and so many did. Now they&#x27;re past it. It was interesting in 2008 to see that Johnny is currently sipping on a latte in front of his window. Now nobody gives a fuck unless Johnny is a celebrity.<p>On scrolling TikTok-like feeds: not to glorify the concept but it makes it easier for the anti-social-medias to accept if you think of it as the equivalent of when your parents would get home, turn on the TV and start flipping through the channels trying to find something interesting to watch. TikTok and Reels put the TV in your pocket. 80% of the content on them is of no substance but occasionally a valuable post does come up and provide me with something I need&#x2F;enjoy. The other day, I had a spontaneous date night because a reel showed up for my wife about some food truck nearby and she shared it with me (we went there an hour later and it turned out to be a good one - we&#x27;re going again next week). P.S. it didn&#x27;t even cross my mind to bother posting a snap of my meal as a story on IG :)</div><br/><div id="41508487" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41508487" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ocean_moist</span><span>|</span><a href="#41508445">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41508493">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41508487">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41508487">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I also think people&#x27;s mentality has shifted and they no longer care about sharing their lives online.<p>I tend to disagree.

I have such a cool life!&quot;. This is how it is for young people.<p>As for TikTok, I find myself scrolling with no end in sight. I think the studies on the addiction level of shortform content and its long term effects is going to be extremely shocking.<p>I can watch an episode or two of a show, maybe 30m-1hr, and turn it off. But TikTok keeps me constantly stimulated and I can easily forget what I am watching and &quot;doomscroll&quot; for hours. With TV I make the conscious decision to watch it. With TikTok I have to make the conscious decision to not watch it or open the app. This may be a side effect of how my brain works, but a lot of young people have similar experiences.<p>I think the main difference in our experiences is a generational gap in how social media is used.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41508493" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41508493" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tarsinge</span><span>|</span><a href="#41508445">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41508487">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41508304">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41508493">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41508493">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And what is the content people scroll to?

There are IRC channels dedicated to niche interests.<p>I haven&#x27;t engaged with proper social media in years because I realized the above and just...left.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41508453" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41508453" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cjbgkagh</span><span>|</span><a href="#41509101">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41508340">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41508453">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41508453">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Was tough to get past the first sentence.

switched copper line monopolies. It remains a dream today - unfinished
work we still have not realised.  Because it&#x27;s not a thing, it&#x27;s a
<i>social project</i>.<p>There&#x27;s a line in &quot;Leave the world behind&quot; [0] where Rose says about
Friends that it&#x27;s feel is &quot;nostalgic for a world that never happened&quot;<p>It&#x27;s called &quot;anemoia&quot; [1] It&#x27;s many things. One is that it&#x27;s a way
of expressing latent values that don&#x27;t fit into the current culture.<p>&quot;Small fish have no place to go&quot; is a comment on a perceived reality
that misses (and so reveals) two important points; the Internet didn&#x27;t
change [2], people did. It&#x27;s not a place you go, it&#x27;s a thing you do
and the attitude you bring to that.<p>But ultimately the Internet is nothing but <i>people</i> connected by
wires. People have moods we call &quot;culture&quot;. Back then it was
unbelievably optimistic and giddy. People wanted to reach
out. Everything was ripe with possibility and fun. The OP is justified
to wonder what it was like to live then.<p>Now we know what kind of things are at the other end of that wire and
it feels more like a dark forest.<p>It&#x27;s more than that people like me &quot;just get older&quot;, the culture has
palpably changed for the worse. Climate change maybe. It&#x27;s become
objectively more pessimistic and neurotic. Sure there&#x27;s a few
hold-outs, but that takes a lot of Prozac to keep up.<p>Anyway, the future of the Internet is all about &quot;small fish&quot;.  That&#x27;s

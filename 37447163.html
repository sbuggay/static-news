This is not a fitness tracker specific observation and I&#x27;m sure it varies from person to person, but my experience has been that if I look for opportunities to just be <i>active</i> rather than focus on more strenuous <i>exercise</i>, I tend to engage in a lot more physical activity.  In my case, I think the increase in overall active time probably balances out the fact that the activity is at a lower level, especially since I end up fitting the extra active time in where it&#x27;s likely replacing no activity at all rather than replacing more beneficial exercise.<p>As I said, this isn&#x27;t really a fitness tracker specific experience since I don&#x27;t actually use one.  But I think there&#x27;s some interesting psychology at work here that a fitness tracker probably amplifies.  Aside from people with certain health issues, &quot;walk more&quot; is a pretty easy task with a very low bar to entry compared to the health benefits.  You likely don&#x27;t need special equipment or a membership to anything or a change of clothes or a shower after and it&#x27;s pretty easy to feel like you can fit into your day even if you&#x27;re tired or busy.  You could reasonably argue that going for a run after work isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> much more of a heavy lift than going for a walk, but I&#x27;d bet good money that I&#x27;m not alone in feeling like it is a lot of days.

One can equally marvel at the same capture of the ruthless efficiency of an endurance running human - the longest running mammal, by far. Every bit of the human body engages towards that efficiency, from kinetic action via immediate energy storage and release via tendon springiness (not just in legs but all the way through the upper body, recovering vertical fall energy, as well as lateral counterbalance motion to be released for forward motion) to the cardiovascular system acting as a massive thermal regulator (via breathing mostly, blood and lung moisture as heat carrying fluids, but also fingers+hands that move for balance double as finned heatsinks), enabling the evolutionary prey hunting strategy of outrunning them to exhaustion.<p>Running does not damage joints because that&#x27;s what we evolved to be ever since we started standing upright and to be able to do so as long as possible both in duration and age, and even if we take a hypothesis of extreme selective pressure since the days when food started coming from fields and livestock, a few thousand years would have barely put a dent on our physiology being evolutionarily built for running; instead, running with no or bad warmup by stomping on concrete with bad or unfit shoes and bad posture biased by our modern sitting-all-the-time world does.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37462176" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37462176" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">idontwantthis</span><span>|</span><a href="#37460335">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37460959">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37463062">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37461763">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37462176">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37462176">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Don’t exercise because other exercise is better.

All the halfway decent options are all huge clunky smartwatches. If you have no interest in apps on your wrist, because you already own a phone, it seems like the only option is the ugliest Garmin I&#x27;ve ever seen or Chinese ones of unknown quality that do not connect to any of the fitness ecosystem.

This is mostly so that the steps algorithm can adjust (somewhat imperfectly) for how your dominant hand sees a lot more motion throughout the day. As such a couple questions are interesting here:<p>1) are you using that setting, and is it set correctly?
2) are you by any chance ambidextrous?<p>Regarding accuracy in general, a quick scan of the abstract didn’t comment on it, just noting that people who wear trackers tend to be more active and have the health benefits associated with that.<p>In general, step tracking at the wrists is actually fairly difficult and many activities both interfere with recognizing steps (walking a stroller is a big one) or register as steps despite not having taken any (washing the dishes will get you a lot of steps). There’s a reason Fitbit has allowed for wearing a tracker on your hip for many years. You can also enable step tracking on your phone, and it will be quite accurate as long as your phone is in a hip pocket.<p>All of that said, the latest research on the subject shows that you’re best off being active, where activity is defined as 150 minutes per week of heart-rate elevating activity, whether that’s walking or something else. There’s also a strong effect for walking immediately after a meal that has some separate benefit with respect to regulating blood sugar.

Drawing detailed conclusions from activity studies is problematic, but the broad conclusions are consistent: the body likes movement and lots of it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;healthy-lifestyle&#x2F;stress-management&#x2F;in-depth&#x2F;exercise-and-stress&#x2F;art-20044469" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;healthy-lifestyle&#x2F;stress-manageme...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;annals-of-technology&#x2F;walking-helps-us-think" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;annals-of-technology&#x2F;walking-...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37460755" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37460755" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">noman-land</span><span>|</span><a href="#37460663">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37461033">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37460688">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37460755">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37460755">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Based on my extremely limited understanding, you need at least 90 minutes a day to see positive results.</div><br/><div id="37460803" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37460803" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">barrkel</span><span>|</span><a href="#37460663">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37460755">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37460688">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37460803">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37460803">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well presumably if there&#x27;s a threshold effect, +40 minutes should have shown an increase because it would have pushed people who were already walking over the threshold.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37460688" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37460688" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">boringuser2</span><span>|</span><a href="#37460663">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37460755">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37461295">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37460688">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37460688">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The problem is the pace.<p>Walking briskly and casually walking are very different activities.</div><br/><div id="37460749" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37460749" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">coldtea</span><span>|</span><a href="#37460663">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37460688">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37461295">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37460749">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37460749">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As if walking briskly would make people with shitty lives and situational depression (like, tons, judging from statistics and related depression drug usage) happy?<p>Exercize is good for endorphins and depression, but let&#x27;s not oversell it on inducing hapiness.</div><br/><div id="37460796" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37460796" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">moritzwarhier</span><span>|</span><a href="#37460663">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37460749">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37461295">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37460796">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37460796">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Walking at the sides of busy roads is very different from walking around a calm neighbourhood, or even a park, a forest or any other environment which is not high-density urban or industrialized, polluted and ugly roads.<p>The good options are inaccessible to a large part of the world&#x27;s population during work week.<p>Therefore this study misses crucial factors and is an excersise (pun unintended) in absurdity.<p>Still, I also see some positive effects from Apple Fitness gamification even without the watch, and I&#x27;m privileged enough to be able to reach a park in 15 minutes.</div><br/><div id="37460905" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37460905" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Gigachad</span><span>|</span><a href="#37460663">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37460796">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37460869">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37460905">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37460905">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Walking in American cities is awful, but if you live in a good country that limits vehicle access its super relaxing to walk around the city and see all the cool stuff going on.<p>No toxic fumes.

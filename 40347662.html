That CPU just isn&#x27;t a good target for C - pointers are awkward, you can&#x27;t really do stack frames, and the addressing modes don&#x27;t even support &#x27;structs&#x27; very well. Fun to program assembly on, though. For your purpose the NES makes it double hard because it hardly has any ram (2 KB, and typically an additional 8 KB inside each cartridge except in the oldest games), and a character-mode graphics architecture rather than a framebuffer. If you do really want to do an 8-bit flight sim, the Atari 400&#x2F;800 machines are an okay target. The Atari ST would be a better target.<p>Speaking of those machines, I&#x27;d love to see someone deeply reverse engineer the pseudo-voxel&#x2F;fractal landscape engine that Lucasfilm Games invented for Rescue on Fractalus, Koronis Rift, etc. It still seems completely magical that they could pull that off on a machine with those specs.<p>Starting from zero, you might start at a high level and work your way down. Do a simple polygon flight engine using OpenGL and your favorite high level language of choice. Then write your own polygon rasterizer that you can overlay versus the OpenGL rendering as a reference. Then maybe rework it in pseudo 8-bit code (C constrained to only unsigned char variables, or similar), which should translate directly to assembly language on the target of choice. On a real 8-bit machine, unless you want low single digit frame rates, you probably have to pull a lot of dirty tricks. Maybe a 16-bit platform would be a better choice. This is speculative - I learned 3D (to a novice degree..) on a 486 PC under 16-bit DOS using C and assembly for inner loops (bitblts, texture mapping).<p>There&#x27;s something about the aesthetic of late 80s PC flight sims (F-19 Stealth Fighter, LHX Attack Chopper, etc.) and their flat shaded polygon graphics that feels in vogue right now. Check out Thunder Helix on Steam.<p>Anyway there&#x27;s definitely a magical feeling writing graphics code when you get your first feeling of realistic movement and rotation in 3D space working. Hopefully the ubiquity of ultra-realistic doesn&#x27;t diminish that sensation too much.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40349700" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40349700" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">boyter</span><span>|</span><a href="#40350673">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40352676">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40349700">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40349700">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Wow... bookmarked.

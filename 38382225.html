It&#x27;s sort of a &quot;category error&quot; to lump all jobs together where you happen use a welder.<p>A lot of manufacuring welding was already low paid and boring, you sit there with your mig gun and make the same welds over and over. Often the hiring pool is &quot;unskilled&quot; labour (i.e, you take people who didn&#x27;t have the job title &quot;welder&quot;) and  they train you to operate this one station. These jobs are robot fodder and honestly that&#x27;s probably a good thing.<p>Site or construction welding requires a lot more adaptability, e.g. ability to read plans, resolve issues when the plans are wrong, handle different materials, do layout, alignment, jigs etc and provides an endless stream of &quot;one off&quot; work.<p>(Of course there are a lot more niches than these two!).<p>These are barely the same market so you&#x27;ll be confused by the numbers if you consider everyone to be in the &quot;welder&quot; labour pool.</div><br/><div id="38388162" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38388162" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">digdugdirk</span><span>|</span><a href="#38386436">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38390485">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38388162">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38388162">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">All good points, but I do want to add context for users of this site who don&#x27;t have any experience with manufacturing or physical trades - the commentary above about manufacturing welding should not be interpreted as welding being a low skill activity.<p>The same distinction between &quot;manufacturing&quot; welding and &quot;construction&quot; welding should probably just be applied within all types of welding in general. It&#x27;s all about the application. Welding just sticks two pieces of metal together, so to use glue as an analogy - it can be used to stick macaroni to paper for a primary school activity, or used during surgery to save someone&#x27;s life. Same action, two wildly different skill levels required for a successful result.<p>Having spent some time with prototyping shops and custom product manufacturing houses - those welders are insanely talented. There is an wild amount of knowledge required (metallurgy, chemistry, physics, electronics) to be used in practice, and the physical demands (fine motor control, holding pieces or your body under complete control at various angles&#x2F;positions) should not be underestimated. Couple that with the understanding of the product being produced and how their actions can improve the end design, and you&#x27;re left with what I tend to see as the closest thing to a wizard as we have in the modern era.<p>It&#x27;s like the old saying goes - &quot;Give a man a hammer and everything starts to look like a nail. Give a man a welder and everything starts looking like whatever the hell he wants it to be.&quot;</div><br/><div id="38390465" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38390465" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hef19898</span><span>|</span><a href="#38386436">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38388162">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38390485">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38390465">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38390465">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Came here to point out the fact that manufacturing welding, for anything that is supposed to hold against loads, is anything but unskilled labour.</div><br/><div id="38390772" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38390772" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DoingIsLearning</span><span>|</span><a href="#38386436">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38390465">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38390485">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38390772">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38390772">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I get that when it matters they will examine and x ray joints etc. But still, it really is humbling&#x2F;scary to think how dependent each of us is on someone else doing their job just right.

As a result it can become uneconomical to perform the one-off tasks.  Even though the assembly line and the on-site are different categories, they&#x27;re part of the same economy and partially compete for some of the same labor and jobs.<p>So for example, in the past you might have had a machinist one off you a part. But now that same skilled operator could be programming (or feeding) a couple CNC mills that put out dozens of parts an hour.  So the one off machined part is suddenly uneconomical.
(Fortunately 3D printing has reduced the specialized skills needed to produce many kinds of parts, temporarily reversing the trend for some things...)<p>Same happens elsewhere, I assume: pipework that might have been welded on site 50 years ago is now often assembled from bolted flanged segments (which are now cheaper due to mass production) or whatever-- even though they&#x27;re more likely to leak&#x2F;fail over time.<p>Good news for the people doing the work is that they stay busy regardless.  But for those who need the work done, the increased cost of one-off work can be problematic and make some kinds of project impossible to do profitably.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38386638" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38386638" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">quickthrowman</span><span>|</span><a href="#38386436">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38388204">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38386497">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38386638">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38386638">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Site or construction welding requires a lot more adaptability, e.g. ability to read plans, resolve issues when the plans are wrong, handle different materials, do layout, alignment, jigs etc and provides an endless stream of &quot;one off&quot; work.<p>Also coordination between trades, MEP systems in large spaces need lots of coordination to avoid conflicts.<p>I agree, it’s hard to imagine instances in which automated welding would help out pipefitters, for example. Automated welding above ceilings or inside a mechanical chase doesn’t seem like it would save much time. The welding robot would need to get onto a lift or be hauled inside the chase. A lot of the battle with pipe fitting is wrestling the large diameter pipes into place so they can be welded. Same deal with tinners, ductwork is generally in places that aren’t easy to access.<p>I’m much less familiar with the sort of welding that ironworkers do (95% of the construction work I oversee is remodel&#x2F;working in existing spaces) but perhaps that could benefit from automation.<p>As a construction professional, construction automation beyond simple things like automated CMU machines seems like a very difficult problem to solve in general, in both the field and management sides.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38386497" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38386497" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dieselgate</span><span>|</span><a href="#38386436">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38386638">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38389128">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38386497">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38386497">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree with your points but still found the article interesting - was also a bit thrown off since &quot;construction&quot; more commonly applies to the site welding you mentioned rather than manufacturing&#x2F;fab.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38389128" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38389128" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">csours</span><span>|</span><a href="#38386436">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38390774">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38389128">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38389128">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Disclosure: I work for General Motors, anything written here is solely my own experience and opinion. I&#x27;m not an expert on welding automation, but I&#x27;ve been around it quite a bit.<p>I think the most important thing to say is: Automation doesn&#x27;t solve problems; to use automation, you have to solve all the problems that automation will encounter. This is called Design for Automation.<p>From the article:<p>&gt; &quot;Manufacturers adjusted their upstream processes to produce more uniform parts with less variability. Part tolerances were reduced in things like metal stamping, jigs and fixturing were made more precise, new handling methods were introduced to prevent parts from being damaged moving between stations, and parts were thoroughly cleaned before welding.&quot;<p>Some notes: the welder may be the cheapest part of the automation solution. A welder is deployed in a &#x27;station&#x27; in a &#x27;cell&#x27; in a &#x27;zone&#x27;. Each of those has it&#x27;s controller (PLC, robot controller, weld controller) of some type. The station includes some kind of conveyance or handling. There&#x27;s also a jig or parts holder for every weld station.<p>There&#x27;s about 1 skilled tradesperson (electrician) per zone or two. There&#x27;s also various kinds of monitoring, from cycle times to weld tip temperature. Fun fact: the aluminum welders have little &#x27;pencil sharpeners&#x27; that shave the copper weld tips to keep the welds consistent. Aluminum spot welders don&#x27;t spark like steel welders do.<p>Every so often, a part is taken off for destructive testing with a hammer and chisel.<p>In addition to welding, a lot of glue is used in the body shop. Glue is great because it has a lot of surface area, and it stops squeaks, rattles and other noises.</div><br/><div id="38390757" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38390757" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Animats</span><span>|</span><a href="#38389128">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38389699">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38390757">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38390757">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Design for Automation<p>Ever see a Macintosh IIci?

Welding up new stuff in series production, welding for reparations to existing structures and welding when producing one-offs are all completely different both from an environmental aspect as well as from the technology and techniques available.<p>Only the first readily lends itself to automation, the other two are still the domain of manual welding and even the stuff that is automated quite often requires experienced welders to fix up after the robot for things that didn&#x27;t quite go as they should have to ensure the welds pass muster. And welding robots can&#x27;t fix their own mistakes (yet).<p>Welders are artists at making the tools to do the job, jigs (even one-off jigs) and fixtures as well as creative ways to manipulate the tooling (for instance in cramped or inaccessible spaces), pantographs and all kinds of material knowledge go into the mix for a complex welding job. Welders as a rule are highly opinionated (not unlike software people) about how they approach their job, they take substantial pride in what they make and by the time they reach their pension are more sought after than they can handle work-wise.

While it hasn&#x27;t gotten to handhelds yet (AFAIK), you can actually measure pretty much all of the variables that matter live using the same optics.<p>So it can get realtime feedback - which means it can adapt, and also, measure the quality of the actual weld for you.<p>See, e.g, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lasersystems.ipgphotonics.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;real-time-weld-process-monitoring" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lasersystems.ipgphotonics.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;real-time-w...</a><p>So it&#x27;s not just the betterness of the welding technology, but what it enables.<p>In that sense, it&#x27;s like what CNC did to production woodworking over time.<p>You can always make what a CNC does by hand, though it&#x27;s sometimes annoying or slow.<p>So some looked at it as just a better wood cutting thingy, and were unimpressed or didn&#x27;t want to have to learn.<p>But looking at it as a better cutter misses the point.  It enabled automation and other things that simply did not (and arguably could not) exist without it.<p>You will find essentially no production woodworking that is not CNC based anymore, often with entire lines that go from &quot;raw wood&quot; to &quot;finished product&quot; without human intervention.
Those who looked at it as a better wood cutting thingy, or didn&#x27;t want to learn, were all left behind.<p>(Note i carefully am talking about production woodworking)<p>Whether it&#x27;s automation or other things, laser welding will do the same.  It isn&#x27;t just a better welder. Using lasers enables things that were really hard or complicated to do before.<p>Even Miller Electric (for those not in the know, they have a significant percent of the market share of MIG&#x2F;TIG welders) realizes this, and 2 weeks ago announced a partnership with IPG to bring laser welding to the masses.<p>Given the price point of most handheld 2-3kw laser welders is still 20-30k, and miller&#x27;s price point is &lt;5k, this is a fairly forward looking thing on their part.  They clearly don&#x27;t hope to try to convince most welders to spend 20-30k.<p>They instead must think that laser welding is going to eat them somehow, and think they need to lead instead of try to catch up.

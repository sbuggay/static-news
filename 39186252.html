Operations (not surgery) are so incredibly bad &#x2F; incompetent in most healthcare settings that software frequently gets the blame for much deeper problems. This article is a doctors perspective on how software did not fix a completely broken workflow. I don&#x27;t begrudge him that but there is no software in the world that can ever address those types of problems. In my experience doctors are a tremendous barrier to resolving problems in healthcare operations, they are chasing their own incentives that are in some ways opposed from those of the patient just like the insurers are. It is very tortured process to institute proper operations in a medical setting, I spent most of my career doing it, no one complains about the software when operations make sense to begin with. In-N-Out instead of McDonalds, is something that should be incredibly aspirational to healthcare as an industry but doctors tend to despise the comparison.</div><br/><div id="39187430" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39187430" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hyponatremia121</span><span>|</span><a href="#39186974">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39187002">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39187430">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39187430">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Operations (not surgery) are so incredibly bad &#x2F; incompetent in most healthcare settings that software frequently gets the blame for much deeper problems.&quot;<p>&quot;In my experience doctors are a tremendous barrier to resolving problems in healthcare operations,&quot;<p>I&#x27;m a hospital-based physician that works in a system with great operations and results.  The physicians, nurses and other staff work amicably together.  Management is reasonable&#x2F;nice.  The EMR, though is universally despised.  No one likes it.  It is a major factor in burnout.  The UI&#x2F;UX is inconsistent.  There are slowdowns and outages daily.  There is a well known lag in the appearance of text in text boxes after typing that seems to be variable.  I&#x27;ve caught the EMR cancelling orders I placed on critically ill patients in the ICU more times than I can count.  We have to actively protect the patients from the EMR.  Healthcare workers aren&#x27;t perfect but they are trying to do their best for very ill people in a high-risk setting and the EMR is well-known blocker.  I long for the days of paper records because this is worse.  Paper charts didn&#x27;t go offline, have slowdowns, didn&#x27;t lose orders, were easily located, and easy to enter data into.</div><br/><div id="39187724" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39187724" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">complex1314</span><span>|</span><a href="#39186974">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39187430">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39187520">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39187724">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39187724">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One of the biggest scandals in Norwegian health care at the moment is a botched transition to Epic in one of the biggest university hospitals.

Respectfully I don&#x27;t understand how your facility can face those issues with a system like that and also be considered to have great operations and results. With Epic it is possible to workaround a lot of notorious problems but management has to understand and have in place the operational capacity to do it. If a system is allowed to persist in an organization that may have or actually did result in patient deaths in the ICU and it was up to me I would see the facility shuttered until that got sorted out.<p>I also want to be clear that doctors are not by any means the only obstacle to resolving workflow problems. You being put in a position to protect patients from a business process of the facility that may accidentally result in their death is the literal definition of incredibly bad &#x2F; incompetent operations. That software didn&#x27;t magically appear and become responsible for ICU ordering magically on it&#x27;s own. In this instance whatever insane people have been given responsibility for that implementation are responsible.<p>After consideration, this comment from a doctor, in a nutshell encapsulates so much of what is wrong. A doctor on the front lines alluding to staff burnout, thinking that people almost or actually dieing because orders are being cancelled inappropriately in the ICU is somehow &quot;a software problem&quot;, while simulatenously praising the management, operations and results of their institution.

In-N-Out staff is well compensated, customers rate the institution as one of the most beloved in american life. McDonalds achieves neither of those things. What makes In-N-Out different? The difference is competence in operations. A lot of healthcare today delivers an inferior product at an inferior price, it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way. A lot of people think that quality is only possible at an increased &quot;price&quot;. A change in thinking is what is needed to achieve a change in quality (result&#x2F;price).<p>Responding to the request below for a specific example. Hand washing, you wash your hands when medically appropriate to prevent facility acquired infections. If you don&#x27;t you are progressively warned ultimately leading to termination and&#x2F;or loss of license. If instituted nationally this alone would save at least 5,000 lives a year. Good luck getting it instituted at most facilities.<p>A different example, diesel fuel and generator maintenance is a meaningful part of medical facility physical plant. A shocking number of facilities place procurement responsibility and oversight of this in the hands of a doctor who also has medical responsibilities. The results are as financially and operationally disasterous as you would expect. Data centers have similar requirements. Who do you think pays more and operates better?<p>Formularies are a sort of default medication lookup table. Most organizations have one that was created decades ago by people who aren&#x27;t with the organization anymore. Review and revise them with someone who understands both the medical&#x2F;pharmacological aspects of the drugs involved as well as their costs. Win for doctors, win for patients, win for insurers, almost no one does this. They have some clueless administrator carry forward last years formulary with minor changes or alternatively have a medical professional with absolutely no idea what costs are involved do it.</div><br/><div id="39187322" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39187322" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">deadmutex</span><span>|</span><a href="#39186974">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39187278">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39187071">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39187322">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39187322">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Can you please add more details&#x2F;examples?

There isn&#x27;t one thing, there are a lot, a lot of things from how items and equipment are procured which is very complex to simple things like making sure that people wash their hands when they should. How laundry and trash are handled. HVAC and plumbing are insanely complex in a hospital setting. It is absolutely absurd how viscious the fights get between staff and management over parking assignments. It requires virtually a threat of termination to make a lot of doctors follow even a 3 to 8 step evidentially developed checklist for certain situations.<p>ACHC, joint commission, CLSI for laboratory, are groups that outline some very basic frameworks of how facilities should be operated. Less than half of facilities can meet even these extremely low bar standards for operations. It is difficult for me to see how many patients have been harmed by ransomware impacting hospital opertions, this is entirely preventable and no one on the hospital side has been meaningfully held accountable so very little will change.<p>A counter example is the pricing transparency regulations. Failure to meet those is resulting in multi-million dollar a year fines which is resulting in change.

They really haven&#x27;t seemed to improve much. I personally think a big part of the issue is actually scope, these systems are expected to do everything - medical notes, script ordering, appointment management, billing of course, and 3000 other things. This weirdly leads to a distribution problem, you can&#x27;t be a serious competitor in just one area, you have to do everything. Only the monolith can shift the monolith. Then combined with the risk (or perceived risk) of working with medical data, and you&#x27;re left with something that just never improves.<p>If your curious, here&#x27;s where I discuss these points in the thesis <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;barnett.surge.sh&#x2F;welcome&#x2F;complexity.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;barnett.surge.sh&#x2F;welcome&#x2F;complexity.html</a></div><br/><div id="39187601" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39187601" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jharsman</span><span>|</span><a href="#39186568">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39187415">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39187601">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39187601">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is very true. There several reasons why most EHRs are so bad:<p>1) The people who pay generally do not use the system. This is true for enterprise software in general and leads to vendors prioritizing having all features organizations ask for (regardless if they are a good idea or not) and also prioritizing features management deems important over fundamental workflow, UX and polish in general.<p>2) EHRs are very large and complex and can almost always gain more customers by gaining even more features and replacing smaller more specialized systems. A typical EHR will have features for ordering tests and viewing results (for clinical chmistry, microbiology, radiology and more special stuff like physiology etc), appointments and resource planning (rooms, equipment, personnel, staffing), clinical notes including computing scores and values based on other values, medication (ordering, administering, sending prescriptions electronically) and administration (admissions, discharge, payment, waiting lists). That is a lot of different stuff!<p>3) Once a vendor wins a contract and installs their EHR, very little can be gained by improving the lives of users. Contracts and sales cycles are very long, and the vendor gains very little financially by improving the system. So many vendors are focused on charging money for customer specific features or adding new features to win new tenders.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the solution is, public alternatives have failed spectacularly since they are typically run by public administrators who have even less of a clue how to develop software and what users want than the vendors.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39187415" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39187415" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Zanfa</span><span>|</span><a href="#39186568">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39187601">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39186604">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39187415">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39187415">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is absolutely true in my experience as well.<p>Ironically, it&#x27;s also a somewhat of a circular problem, given the inherent complexity of medical processes, every organization has organically formed their processes over decades. When choosing software solutions, they pick software that caters to their specific needs, rather than change processes to fit existing software. This results in vendors building endlessly configurable products that add even more complexity. As a potential new entrant, this means you&#x27;d need to not only support N processes, but something like (number of clients) * N processes.<p>There are some initiatives towards EHR interop (e.g. FHIR), but from what I&#x27;ve seen so far, they suffer from similar problems.

The issue is that these systems are created by several (6-8 if memory serves) different private companies and the UK Government can&#x27;t force the GP to change or adopt a standard system.<p>The different GP EHR systems record patient information in their own ways. Think of a database entry for chemo medication, one EHR provider having a db column labeled &quot;Drug X&quot; with the patient entry listed as &quot;Yes&quot; with separate columns for dosage, frequency etc. Another will list the drug, dosage and frequency in the same field. Even if they have the same column e.g. frequency, different EHR&#x27;s may list &quot;5d&quot; or &quot;5 Days&quot;. There are also spelling errors, doctor&#x27;s personal shorthand abbreviations etc.<p>The problem is that the UK interoperability system has is to implement a safe translation layer that will allow records to be transmitted between these systems that doesn&#x27;t kill anyone. The astonishing amount of different types of information that are used and all the oversight needed to ensure that information is accurately transferred has made this project way more costly and time consuming that originally thought.<p>There is, of course, waste and profiteering, both internally to the Government project (huge contract salaries) and also with the private EHR companies (overruns and re-builds are all handsomely paid for).</div><br/></div></div><div id="39187100" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39187100" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dieortin</span><span>|</span><a href="#39186568">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39186793">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39187551">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39187045">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39187100">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39187100">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If Iâm not mistaken, the Spanish healthcare system has a fully electronic medical record.</div><br/><div id="39187505" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39187505" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dgellow</span><span>|</span><a href="#39186568">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39187100">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39187045">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39187505">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39187505">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Germany too</div><br/><div id="39187844" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39187844" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Naijoko</span><span>|</span><a href="#39186568">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39187505">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39187045">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39187844">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39187844">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha<p>This is a joke.

Medical is heavily regulated, not only at the point of care, but likewise on the administrative side.<p>In the event of an adverse effect the hospital and medical team(s) involved must be able to provide clear track record of following the protocols. The administrative team must have the data to provide all the required metrics.<p>Suppose a simple bloodwork protocol: nurse draws blood, delivers to lab, lab does analysis, results are funky, lab releases invalid report indicating rejected sample, doctor issues redoing of bloodwork, nurse draws blood again and so on. Sample rejection is recorded somewhere, distorts statistics for admin, costs time. In practice, in the event of suspected badly drawn sample nurse is internally informed of that to redeliver the sample, lab releases clean report, sample vial is recorded as discarded by nurse, business goes on.<p>Medical is FULL of these tiny optimizations around protocols. However, any HMS must follow the protocol, implement safeguards against divergence from protocol, yet to be user friendly it must accommodate all those deviations while still providing &quot;correct&quot; track record with eventually consistent timestamps and so on.<p>Timings can be very important. For example at ER priority levels dictate not only queue ordering, but also time to care. With HMS implemented it becomes crucial to record times correctly (both from CYOA and metrics standpoints), therefore from the perspective of user, the HMS becomes first priority over caring for patient. Users inevitably complain :)<p>In certain protocols timings also play a huge role in determining care type. Discharge a patient in x hours and it is outpatient care, fail to discharge patient in x hours and the case promotes to inpatient care, with all the associated complexities of care and documentation. Patient returns in x hours - it&#x27;s the same case. Fail to provide care in x hours - different treatment protocol.<p>Readers may think &quot;just provide sane defaults for common case and let staff explicitly record uncommon cases&quot;. That simply does not work. Defaults are defaults and users submit defaults. Having insane defaults actually prevents hospital admin&#x2F;it&#x2F;legal from being overwhelmed with correcting submitted data. Users complain.<p>It&#x27;s ugly. You have to juggle between good care, actual processes, legally required processes, metrics and what not to make the system usable and correct where every user is adversary.<p>EDIT to add:<p>On top of all that, every hospital has unique implementation of processes and structures. The differences may not necessarily be major, but there are differences.<p>Any HMS that intends to become a commodity instead of custom project for a single hospital or department must be highly customizable. first, high customizability typically misses optimization (especially workflow optimization) opportunities. Second, implementing HMS is akin to implementing SAP: the end result is amalgamation between core product developed by a vendor and implementation by hospital admin&#x2F;legal&#x2F;it. Many here have either first-hand experience or close knowledge why implementing ERPs (HMS <i>is</i> an ERP) typically lead to barely usable monstrosities. The stakeholders at organization typically have neither working understanding of underlying processes and policies and how they tie together nor will to implement processes and policies more suitable to be managed via ERP.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39187200" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39187200" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hashishen</span><span>|</span><a href="#39186816">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39187000">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39187200">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39187200">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">about %85 of my wowrk as a sys admin for a medical group was troubleshooting EMR software</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

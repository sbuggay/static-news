Undercover police caught me, and by God&#x27;s grace they chose to let me go.<p>MDMA had just begun to carry a minimum 10 yr prison sentence throughout the state.<p>I had no idea what I was doing in my life, like I was asleep and not awake, until I got caught that night.<p>About 15 minutes into the interrogation at the scene, Officer Garcia - I still remember him - knowing my mental state of panic and realization of reality, said to me &quot;You know, when I was your age I did the same thing, and I was forgiven and let go. So what I&#x27;m going to do is forgive you and let you go this time. Go home, and don&#x27;t ever do this again.&quot;<p>I drove home at about half the speed limit that night, trying to process what had happened. First time I had experienced such forgiveness and mercy.<p>The aim of my life now is to maximize the amount of good I can do for others. I&#x27;ll never forget. I could still be in prison.

I caught two felonies (both from the same incident)
Luckily, I had a good job at the time and it was my first offense, so I was able to get house arrest.
After seeing what could have been my life, I completed my BS in CS, online part-time and convinced the state of California to let me move there. 
I received five years of probation, so even though I was off house arrest, I had to convince the state of California to take me as a probationer.
I don&#x27;t think this is usually offered, even though I had gainful employment waiting for me. I feel very fortunate.
Since then, I&#x27;ve worked for various startups and Fortune 50 companies as a software engineer. I was lucky enough that the tech industry valued me more for my skills than punished me for my past.
I will be forever grateful to the state of California and the tech industry for this.
I&#x27;ve looked into, and tried to volunteer for various programs that try to teach inmates or felons technical&#x2F;engineering skills. All have fallen through.
I&#x27;d love to hear what you&#x27;re working on OP, and if you want to brainstorm a way we can try and help more inmates turn their life around through software development.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38233413" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38233413" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">codingrightnow</span><span>|</span><a href="#38237290">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38232024">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38233413">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38233413">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a former software engineer for over a decade and current corrections officer in a max level state facility, this is a very interesting topic.

That&#x27;s the only choice you get to make. Then, after 3, 5, 10 years, we send them out into society and tell them, &quot;Make better choices.&quot; But we haven&#x27;t prepared them for that at all. We have given them almost no chances to make decisions and learn how to make good ones. We just tell them the decision to make and they do it.

The biggest issue is that you&#x27;ll always be a foreigner. Even if you jump through the hoops to become a citizen, you won&#x27;t be accepted the same way that Americans accept immigrants. US conservatives are painted as disliking immigrants, but that&#x27;s only true for immigrants who don&#x27;t culturally assimilate. Conservatives have no problem electing immigrants like Winsome Sears, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Young Kim. The mayor of Helena, Montana is a refugee from Liberia. The state with the most foreign-born governors is Georgia. Anyone who claimed that these people aren&#x27;t &quot;real Americans&quot; would be shunned and shamed across the political spectrum.<p>There&#x27;s also the issue of employment and compensation. My skills are worth far less in other countries. I make over $250k&#x2F;year in compensation, and my taxes are low enough that I&#x27;ve managed to accumulate &quot;fuck you&quot; money before the age of 40. I could retire, but I want to maximize my family&#x27;s quality of life. It&#x27;d also be nice to have an aircraft and a cabin on some land in the middle of nowhere. My chances of accomplishing those goals in another country are much lower. (I&#x27;ll probably have the cabin in a few years.

And I was very happy that I was able to get original non-counterfeit pills on the dark net, from vendors that had thousands of positives reviews. Being a nerd, and successful when it comes to business, risk-free supply had never been an issue. Luckily I bought Bitcoin when they did cost $0.20...<p>Fighting the dark net has always been a stupid idea. It&#x27;s the cleanest way for people to get the substances they need, with the lowest amount of risk in every single regard. Lowest risk to get your substance cut with something unhealthy, lowest risk of getting ripped off, lowest risk of getting into criminal circles.<p>Fighting the dark net means pushing people to street dealers, increasing suffering, violent crime and deaths.<p>So, why did I get addicted? Depressions, anxiousness, and finally: Being on the autistic spectrum, which now seems absolutely obvious from earliest childhood memories, but my parents never took me to a neurologist to get that diagnosed. I just lived with being &quot;different&quot;. Until I could not take it anymore, and tried to help myself with substances.<p>How did I get off the addiction? Did a search for the best-rated neurologist in the region, made an appointment, got treatment. It took a while, but in the end a combination of substances was found that worked out better than opiates.<p>But that being said: Those substances are the same that I can get as prescription medication, or as &quot;drugs&quot; on the street. It&#x27;s just that now I no longer have to spend Bitcoin on it, but get them for free from the health care system. Yay!<p>Please remind yourself: Nearly everything that is taken and sold as &quot;drugs&quot; on the streets is used to treat some problem, just in a very dangerous way, without proper education, without proper risk management.<p>Whatever that scary drug that your parents and your school are warning you about to be evil: It&#x27;s just medication. The poor people die on the street trying to get their supply, the rich guys get a subscription to get it for free.<p>If your country has a problem with drugs on the street, and with crime due to people trying to get those substances, your country SIMPLY HAS A PROBLEM PROVIDING HEALTH CARE to its citizens!<p>So please stop demonizing substances, demonizing substance &quot;abuse&quot;, demonizing people providing those substances in a clean and safe way via the dark net, and demonizing people who sadly did not have the luck of their health care system helping them.<p>And go fix your health care systems.</div><br/><div id="38235723" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38235723" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">supertofu</span><span>|</span><a href="#38235170">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38232491">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38235723">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38235723">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I resonate with this comment strongly.

My father was left with nothing at some point in his life, living like a hobo in an abandoned, broken, leaking RV next to gypsies (heck, he&#x27;d even, for free, help the gypsies&#x27; kids with &quot;homework&quot;).<p>And he was still proud --and still is-- of never having done anything illegal.<p>People <i>choose</i> to engage in crime, and there&#x27;s nothing obvious about it.<p>Nobody needs the latest iPhone or the latest sneakers.

They <i>choose</i> the easy path.<p>And that is not obvious at all. Most poor people and by very, very, very far, even most hobos, are <i>not</i> thieves and are <i>not</i> drug dealers. When you deal drugs you have on your conscience how miserable you make the lives of so many others: it&#x27;s not even about legality here.<p>I had a friend and roommate at one point (and still friend to this day), we&#x27;d split rent and he&#x27;d barely make any money. Serving pitas at a tiny kebab&#x2F;pita place three nights a week for hardly any money. And he was okay with that. He didn&#x27;t care about clothes or cars or phones or fancy hotel rooms or whatever. He&#x27;d just be honest and survive.<p>What I&#x27;d like to know is why people believe it&#x27;s &quot;obvious&quot; they choose a criminal life for $25 K a week instead of an honest life flipping burgers.<p>It&#x27;s not obvious and that mindset of &quot;fancy luxury hotel rooms&quot; and &quot;latest iPhone&quot; should just die.

Involvement in opioids and that lifestyle&#x2F;culture is something that I did not have any contact with UNTIL I was sent to prison. Perhaps we should consider whether 
1. Prison is making people worse (that is just an objective fact)
2. We want to be institutionalizing people that clearly are capable of much more, who turn to things like dealing out of their drug habits, or lack of resources&#x2F;options.<p>Before anyone wants to go google&#x27;ing and coming up with immediate judgements, why don&#x27;t you look into that there was absolutely zero prosecution of the case being referred to.. They said they found &quot;residue&quot; in my apartment, put out a nationwide manhunt for me, then immediately dropped the case as soon as I was judged by the media and the judge. They couldn&#x27;t just destroy my apartment and all my stuff and say  &quot;we found nothing&quot;. Leaving them to prosecute me for 1oz of a synthetic opioid 8x stronger than morphine, that itself, had a potency of roughly 1%. It was almost completely inert. absolutely useless. and this was a completely unrelated case.<p>To the person who said I sold drugs to kids..

It was rampant in the form of &quot;cheese&quot; when I was a teen; one of my closest friends was left to die when he began vomiting from an overdose. When I was in the Marines I saw Marine after Marine prescribed opioids for pain and injuries after deployments, many of them separated out and continued using. As an adult I&#x27;ve lived in the Bay Area and Portland; I&#x27;ve gotten to observe first hand what culture these drugs cultivate on our streets. I&#x27;ve gotten to see opioids make their way, sometimes by mistake, into the rave scene and the constant fear it creates among people who want nothing to do with those drugs. We have Narcan at our house because people consistently use the church parking lot next door to shoot up in their car. I&#x27;ve personally ran down the street and through the fence to go bang on doors because I saw someone passed out for too long - not because I want them gone, but because I don&#x27;t want to see someone else die.<p>To put the entire mantle on dealers would be a mistake, imo. Their choice to sell can come from a variety of incentives: sometimes from clout, sometimes their upbringing, sometimes lack of opportunity, sometimes lack of education, many times a mixture of the above. Often enough these people are users themselves; the pain the people they sell to endure they also typically endure.<p>I don&#x27;t view this post as victim-seeking and I don&#x27;t really view him as a victim. Instead, I view this as a critique of prison culture that reinforces its outcomes. I view him as someone that wants to change and has the capacity to change, but there is little if any pipeline or incentive to do so. If there is one, it seems frail. When people want to change we should have a stepped pipeline for reintroducing them to normality and finally society.<p>Like you, I&#x27;d like to see less opioid related deaths in the future but I think there&#x27;s more than one way to get to that goal. If there&#x27;s a way that can make productive citizens out of people rather than shutting them away forever then I&#x27;m all for it because, frankly, the threat of a felony or life imprisonment didn&#x27;t stop people before.

People claim to live in a democracy, none more so that many in the US, and yet AFAIK noone gets taught law as a mandatory subject when growing up. If you are not taught something how can the public even debate it? Is this the legal system applying a form of Darwinism on the population in a dictatorial fashion? Is this a form of intellectual torture being applied on some who want to enjoy themselves in non-alcoholic ways?<p>If I had the money I&#x27;d get a Judicial Review to find the reasons why judges dont want people to be taught the law as a mandatory subject for a number of reasons, and for adults to be kept up to date with legal changes in a TLDR fashion, that doesnt rely on the opinion of the state broadcaster and other news outlets.
Some people are too busy to watch&#x2F;read the news, which is the only en-masse way to keep up to date currently, and there is also the issue of why is legal conformity pushed on people if they are doing no harm? Just what exactly is a democracy and do you really have a say?<p>If Roe v. Wade (1973) can mandate a change across a country like the US, are these judges who shy away from making a countrywide decision to keep people abreast of legal changes, not only undermining the idea of democracy, but also just keeping themselves in a stealth sado masochistic schadenfruede-like position of authority with accompanying lucrative income?<p>Has any scientific study measured the dopamine receptors of judges or serotonin receptors or testostorone levels when they pass a judgement? Has the scientific community shown they derive pleasure from controlling other peoples lives in non scientific ways, because I see the reoffending rate is quite high, and the system is clearly not fit for purpose.<p>To the original poster, just remember there are some people who agree with your actions, enjoy the mental mind games of programming, it can keep you occupied even when not in front of the computer. :)<p>The Law of &#x27;Joint Enterprise&#x27;: Graham Virgo Cambridge Law Faculty

I was left with the difficult choice of either living there and walking to a temp agency with hopes of making $10.50&#x2F;hour doing manual labor (without an ID or social security card at this point), or getting on a bus to NYC to see some associates, and coming back in a week or so with $15-25k in my pocket and living in comfy luxury hotels until I could rent an apartmentâ¦ I chose the latter, obviously, and was back in prison after 14mo.<p>...and later:<p>&gt; I am very grateful for the opportunity, but I recognize that this is very much the exception and not the rule, and the success of the Maine model of corrections should highlight the absolutely embarrassing lack of opportunities in the rest of the system, to do anything but become a bitter, broke criminal; deprived of not just your freedom, family, financial security and reputation, but also of your self-identity as someone worth investing in changing. We need to do better as a society, and understand that, yes, there are people in the system that deserve this kind of punishment, but a large majority of our prison population are just regular peopleâ¦ non-violent drug offenders like myself.

Maybe he wasn&#x27;t directly violent, but dealers like him directly contribute to dragging many more people into addiction, violence, and even death.

It&#x27;s not uncommon for hard-opiate users to willingly ingest or even seek out fentanyl. I have multiple dead friends whom I asked repeatedly not to even stop using heroin&#x2F;fent, but just to consider smoking it instead of shooting it. Opiate addicts live on the razor&#x27;s edge between life and death where they&#x27;re alright with taking the gamble every time they push the plunger. It&#x27;s sad, and heartbreaking, but it is what it is.<p>(My father and his wife are dead from an opiate overdose as well, fwiw. Suspected fentanyl.)<p>2. There&#x27;s a very solid chance, given his background and history, that the author was also using himself. If you live with a hard-drug addiction, you eventually become a husk of a person and you will hurt even the people who love you the most, so that you can keep using. Again, sad and heartbreaking, but it&#x27;s the nature of the demon. One of the worst parts of getting sober isn&#x27;t often the withdrawal, but coping with the regrets and memories of the decisions you made while using.<p>None of this is to say what was done is okay, or that people ought to have sympathy.<p>But what I do mean to do, is shed some light on what these sorts of situations are really like.</div><br/><div id="38232237" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38232237" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">macintux</span><span>|</span><a href="#38231233">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38232200">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38232794">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38232237">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38232237">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; There&#x27;s a very solid chance, given his background and history, that the author was also using himself.<p>The author chimed in here and acknowledged that.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38231933">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38231933</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38232794" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38232794" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">haswell</span><span>|</span><a href="#38231233">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38232115">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38232200">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38232415">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38232794">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38232794">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">From a purely moral&#x2F;ethical perspective, this doesnât withstand scrutiny.<p>The foundational ideas underlying the justice system are inherently religious (in the literal sense) in that they depend on a world view that takes at face value the notion of free will, and assumes that all causal factors are under the control of the perpetrator.<p>The more we learn about the mechanics of the brain, the less we have a reason to believe in what people typically mean when they say someone did something freely and of their own accord.<p>This is not to say that people who do bad things shouldnât be locked up for it.

And not long ago, those same survivors were looked at as social pariahs for the misfortune of being born with a deficient brain.<p>But when the malfunction (or collective systemic factors) leads someone to break the law, weâre predisposed to fall back to the deeply entrenched Judeo-Christian viewpoint that insists we are all free to make choices, and this freedom means the wrong choice is sin, and therefore a direct moral indictment.<p>Except the person who steals food out of necessity has no choice in the place of their birth. No control over growing up in economic circumstances that make it more likely theyâll get caught in the broken prison system.

So, too, the appropriate punishment. We have no accepted theory of consciousness and more scientists than ever have aligned with the idea that free will is something we <i>experience</i>, but not something that exists the way we think it does. But until we make some scientific breakthrough, all of these ideas are ultimately in the philosophical realm, which is why we need to reexamine them regularly.<p>Over the course of history, weâve held deeply flawed beliefs as societies that all âgot us $this farâ. The reasons weâve kept evolving&#x2F;progressing is that weâve changed our models of understanding when new data indicates itâs necessary. Humans stopped sacrificing children. We stopped believing in the geocentric theory. For the most part, we stopped accepting slavery. We donât carry out a myriad of bizarre ritual based on the color of peopleâs hair, etc.<p>Many modern institutions are associated with religion because religion was pervasive during their inception. But there is no reason to cling to faith-based beliefs just to preserve the underlying principles and human wisdom that still have utility. And when the religious dogma weâre talking about is one that involves how and when we remove the most sacred of all human rights - how we imprison other humans, we  <i>better</i> be adjusting our views to match our current understanding of the world.<p>And bringing up specific cities with lax policies is unrelated.

It was very common in the past in almost all cultures for a certain number of men to just reject society and go off into hermitage. Sometimes those hermits would band together into brotherhoods. Often they would make beer, or honey or some other collective task to earn enough money for the members to spend the rest of their time in quiet contemplation. I can imagine such a life might be attractive to a lot of programmers who tend to be introverted and feel alien to normal society.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;singularitygroup.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;singularitygroup.net&#x2F;</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twitch.tv&#x2F;ask_jesus" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twitch.tv&#x2F;ask_jesus</a><p>3. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BDAkkiwmmBQ">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BDAkkiwmmBQ</a></div><br/><div id="38232785" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38232785" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">btrettel</span><span>|</span><a href="#38232474">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38233012">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38232785">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38232785">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve had a similar idea before.<p>I once was talking to someone who wanted to financially support independent scientific research.

I mean, a 21st century digital cult!? That is some juicy stuff!<p>What I found was a young idealistic kid who was playing a character online. He was optimizing for views and we all know what kind of behavior gets attention online. The character <i>was</i> overblown and narcissistic.  There is zero argument from me that if you take selected clips of him from when he was at the height of his streaming fame he was a dumb-ass edge-lord playing the role of a prophet or spiritual leader. He even leaned into it when he was accused because he thought it was funny.

Long story short: I sacrificed my physical, mental, emotional, and future well-being as a human shield so my non-biological daughter who I won&#x27;t see again could have part of a childhood and not develop a cluster-b personality disorder like her mother. To those that don&#x27;t understand what these people are like behind closed doors, you simply have no frame of reference. There are no words that will allow you to understand; many social workers and psychiatrists are often even fooled into serving as these people&#x27;s unwitting thralls. Their nature is predatory. They smash mirrors within and without (even posting something public about it like here will summon a small herd of them to cover the tracks with doubt). They have no ideology other than predation, so they follow the ideology of the hour that gains them the most; they wear personalities like hats. It was after being attacked, yet again, that I was DARVOed (because I was actually escaping for good this time, and the cherry on top of these relationships is always, without fail, a DARVO kick-in-the-ass on the way out the door). Then, despite having over two hours of her attacking me over years of time recorded, including her pouncing atop me and snatching my phone on the very day in question, the brilliant detective at Atlanta PD warranted me, and I stayed in the Rice Street gulag where the schizophrenic kid was murdered by police via bedbug consumption (the police there use subterfugal torture methods to &quot;keep people in line&quot; by throwing them in freezing-in-winter, low-to-no ventilation, hot-in-summer, or bug-ridden cells, keeping lights on at all hours, refusing medical care, 30 people bricked in cells meant for 8, kept standing for days, COVID outbreaks in entire cell blocks, standard US prison system fare, torture by any sane definition of the word). It&#x27;s when I looked down at the homeless man in that cell, the one laying flat directly in the piss and the shit on the floor so he can lay down in the real estate that no one wants, that I said to myself, &quot;yeah, that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m at.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s after that, I underwent a psychosis so vast that every word, every symbol, every story, every axiom, every fear, every thought, and all of human history amassed into a unified and perfect whole; only after would I come to recognize that what I saw was identical to the ascent in Merkabah literature, Thelema&#x27;s visit to the City of the Pyramids, Samadhi, and several other analogies for such experiences. Myself had disappeared, and in its place was a sacrifice burning through time like a star. There were only really two forces in the universe, entropy and creation, and the two were yet an illusion still of a singular. Dark matter became simply matter not yet light, returned to the path of least resistance towards supermassive black holes in the center of galaxies, dark energy became simply the remnant left by matter past the edge of observability to continue the pulling, decimation, and return, breaking the laws of thermodynamics that were merely local phenomenon, and creating novel matter in the process, the early stages of which would expand in an accelerated manner that would appear as a bang, but be more akin to a snake eating its own tail and growing.<p>I wandered in a daze, searching for what I called my fellow &quot;wizards&quot; or fellow autists or fellow disciples, not fully knowing what I was doing or why. I researched Benedictine and Bhuddist monestaries to try to escape the world. So yes, US hermits are very real, we are very noble, and we are fucking livid regarding the state of adequate hermitages.

I have a more principals &#x2F; tradeoffs approach to code review:<p>Areas:<p><pre><code>  - Readability - how understandable the code is
  - Maintainability - how the code enables the project to evolve
  - Risk - security, regulatory and other vulnerabilities
  - Correctness - whether the code does what you intended
  - Robustness - how well the code handles unintended circumstances
  - Performance - how resource efficient the code is
</code></pre>
All of the above areas need to be considered within the context of the project and individual team members.<p>## Readability<p>Code is readable if it meets your expectations and surprises you only when there&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t yet know about the technology. We expect code to look like the code around it. To follow most, if not all of the technologies idioms. To use clear and informative names. To explain why deviance exists. To be as abstract as the concepts being abstracted are crystallised.<p>## Maintainability<p>Maintainability is the code&#x27;s relationship with the wider team and time. You should be able to learn all you need to know to change, test and deploy code. You should be confident that any changes you make will not cause unintended changes elsewhere in the code. To make a change, you should have to touch as little code as the concepts being changed are crystallised. You should be able to debug an issue as easily as, the system the issue is in, is old. You should be able to track down and alter the changes that introduce a bug quickly. You should be able to learn why a change exists.<p>## Risk<p>Code is low risk if it accounts for, and where possible, mitigates the various risks to a project.<p>## Correctness<p>Correct code does as you expect and surprises you only when there something about the system you didn&#x27;t yet understand. Validating correct code is as automated as the validations are frequent. Correct code is only as complicated as the concepts it models. Correct code is only as abstract as the concepts it models are crystallised.<p>## Robustness<p>Robust code handles unexpected circumstances safely, quickly and predictably. Validating robust code is as automated as the validations are frequent and as comprehensive as the failures are risky.<p>## Performance<p>Performant code is as resource efficient as the resources are expensive, but also as efficient as the development costs are cheap.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36652675" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36652675" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nlnn</span><span>|</span><a href="#36652231">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36650247">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36652675">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36652675">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One goal that I think often gets missed out of code review guides is education.<p>To me, code review is not just there to produce better software, but also better developers.<p>It&#x27;s a great place to talk about tradeoffs, alternative approaches, reasoning behind changes, etc.<p>Maybe less useful in huge projects with many contractors you&#x27;re never going to work with again, but I&#x27;ve seen the mentoring aspect have great benefits in small teams.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36650247" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36650247" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Pannoniae</span><span>|</span><a href="#36652675">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36652746">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36650247">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36650247">[16 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">From what I&#x27;ve seen so far, people <i>love</i> debating code style.<p>The main problem is that those programmers mostly care about superficial syntax and don&#x27;t actually care about code readability or design. They just go for the lowest hanging fruit and criticise variable naming or whitespace because it is easy; they don&#x27;t talk about the object graph or the event lifecycle of the program, because that&#x27;s hard.<p>A very common thing I see nowadays is a forced adoption of gofmt&#x2F;black&#x2F;whatever, hoping it would solve the obsession with the formatting. However, this just locks in a (often substandard) coding style and removes <i>any</i> kind of personality from the code. This is good if you are a manager trying to treat your employees as fungible units of work, but is bad for actually maintaining a codebase. Also, it doesn&#x27;t stop obsession with style, it just forces a specific style on everyone which most of the time, everyone slightly hates.<p>This is a really good article which summarises the problem way better than me. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;luminousmen.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;my-unpopular-opinion-about-black-code-formatter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;luminousmen.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;my-unpopular-opinion-about-blac...</a></div><br/><div id="36652863" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36652863" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">benrutter</span><span>|</span><a href="#36650247">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36650380">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36652863">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36652863">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I definitely agree that Black (which I love) is pretty overrated in the number of problems people think it will solve for them.

This betrays the rest of your comment. You start out saying how arguing specific indentation style is superficial but then betray this with that comment. If it truly is superficial then it does not matter what you lock in as long as you lock it in.<p>As with many things it&#x27;s not actually a technical problem. It&#x27;s a social problem. And it can work. Where I am right now for example we do have formatting locked in and enforced by linters. And it&#x27;s not an issue there&#x27;s no debate about it in regular PRs at all. The code formatter adjusts it and that&#x27;s that. If you want to change it, create a PR that changes the rules and put a cross section of developers on said PR to discuss it.

For example, breaking long logging lines into multiple lines decreases readability, but the formatter doesn&#x27;t care because it only sees the max. line length and that&#x27;s it.
Same with breaking long function definitions: it doesn&#x27;t consider what makes sense or what is readable, it just messes the code up. Similarly, some projects differentiate between single and double quotes (e.g. single quotes for data, double quotes for userstrings), and this just drives a tank over it.<p>Or completely disallow tabs, even when it&#x27;s necessary for accessibility, like with screen readers (not even PEP8 enforces spaces, but black decides to without a configuration option)<p>Same with whitespace: it refuses you to add more than 1 (or 2, can&#x27;t remember) empty lines inside a function, even when it would be more readable to space it out.<p>I heavily disagree with the assumption that consistency is better than readability. I believe that people can be civilised and not change each other&#x27;s code just for the sake of formatting nitpicks, only when they actually edit the code.</div><br/><div id="36650540" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36650540" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tayo42</span><span>|</span><a href="#36650247">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36650459">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36651055">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36650540">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36650540">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Black not being configurable and getting popular is lame.<p>Every project should be able to argue once about style, what is important then just apply that going foward with a configurable style checker.</div><br/><div id="36651390" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36651390" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sixstringtheory</span><span>|</span><a href="#36650247">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36650540">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36651055">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36651390">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36651390">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If itâs configurable, then itâs never settled.

They weren&#x27;t the one to dive into the problem and consider it and fix it but they think their knee jerk reactions are always more valid than the remote possibility you know what you&#x27;re doing as the person in the trenches. I&#x27;m going to paste a monologue I gave recently:<p>sometimes as people who care about our craft, we need to step back and keep the big picture in mind. the goal is to make a functioning website, or video game, or text editor. the user couldn&#x27;t care less about your code formatting, composition vs inheritance decisions, or commit messages. these are useful tools to the extent that they make it easier for yourself or others in the future to provide more value to the user.<p>at my job, people (mostly external contractors) might make pull requests with formatting annoyances, pointless null checks, getters and setters that have no reason to exist, useless comments, &quot;== true&quot;, things of that nature. I&#x27;d ask these to be fixed and sometimes they would be, but other times someone else would just come in and approve the PR themselves. 
I realized one day that not a single one of those ugly PR&#x27;s that made it through have ever come back to bite us in any way. everyone&#x27;s time was better spent continuing to work on providing value to the user instead.<p>I hold myself to a higher standard, but when reading others&#x27; code, I&#x27;ve found it really means nothing to me where they put the brackets or what naming convention they use, or even if they change these up randomly. I care that it does the thing, has no glaring red flags, looks appropriately performant for the problem at hand, and won&#x27;t be a maintenance nightmare (will spending 30 minutes changing something right now save at least 1 hour dealing with it later? will those code even be around by the time we get to that point, or replaced by something else? in many cases probably not, of course consider how foundational or isolated the code is.) in all my experience, any bikeshedding over aesthetics has proven to be a total waste of time.<p>if we&#x27;re making a thing that lets the people designing a website make a thing for the visitors, I care that the experience is good for the designer and the visitor, it does what it should, etc. and it&#x27;s <i>reasonably</i> maintainable, but I&#x27;m not going to drag someone into the bikeshed and beat them with the tire pump of subjective aesthetics until they rename their variables to my whimsies.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36652498" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36652498" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rotifer</span><span>|</span><a href="#36651976">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36649842">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36652498">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36652498">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I write and review medical software.  When I&#x27;m reviewing code the most important question is, &quot;Is it correct?&quot;  If it&#x27;s not, then the review simply isn&#x27;t approved (obviously).<p>Anything that makes it harder to determine correctness is a strike against the code.  This can include anything from high level organization, to comments, to the naming of variables, to the use of whitespace.  For example, with respect to variable names, if you&#x27;re implementing something that has to conform to the DICOM standard, then you should <i>consider</i> following their nomenclature, even if it may not be what you&#x27;d normally use in other contexts.<p>Aside from correctness issues, I&#x27;ll make anything from &quot;strong recommendations&quot; to &quot;mild suggestions&quot;.  (In theory, any of these could cause me not to approve a change, but the closer we get to &quot;mild suggestion&quot; the less likely that is.)  Examples might include:<p>- You&#x27;re trying to do something with X.  I&#x27;m a domain expert in X and while your code is technically correct it&#x27;s not idiomatic.  I suggest doing it this other way instead.<p>- You added a public function to a library, but it will fail if the String argument isn&#x27;t a valid Photometric Interpretation.  Yes, I see that you only call it with valid values, but since it&#x27;s public anybody can now call it, and they may not be so diligent.  How about making it an Enum?<p>- You have a loop that, superficially, looks like it&#x27;s calculating Bar, but upon closer examination it&#x27;s (correctly) calculating Bar&#x27;.  How about adding a comment stating this, so that no one is tempted to (incorrectly) &quot;fix&quot; it?<p>- You&#x27;ve implemented a function that does Y.  All our code links with the Foo library, which happens to have a function that does Y.  How about using that instead?<p>- Your log message makes sense if you&#x27;re reading the surrounding code, but someone from support seeing it in the log file won&#x27;t know what to make of it.  How about including this contextual information in it?<p>- In the loop that you added, your indentation is inconsistent with the rest of the function.  How about making it the same?<p>- Why do you have four blanks lines in the middle of your function?<p>In my own code I&#x27;m pretty anal about formatting, comments, log messages, use of whitespace, etc.  I&#x27;m definitely less harsh when reviewing other people&#x27;s code, but I have to admit that when I see sloppy formatting, grammatical errors or gratuitous use of whitespace, I&#x27;m on the alert for sloppiness in other areas, such as design and implementation.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36649842" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36649842" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RangerScience</span><span>|</span><a href="#36652498">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36649676">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36649842">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36649842">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ehhhhh yeah kinda?

And even then, the design might need to be changed if it happens that some things weren&#x27;t taken into consideration, or new specs are communicated and priorities change.<p>It&#x27;s also worth not spending too much time on creating the perfect design upfront, since it might change during development. The whole waterfall vs. agile situation. An initial proposal document helps with avoiding lengthy discussions and friction during code reviews, but it also takes a lot of effort to produce, and even then, reviews can be difficult for many reasons.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually confusion about what matters, or if it&#x27;s a desire to make people jump through hoops, or maybe boredom?<p>My theory is that sometimes it&#x27;s a need to say _something_ to prove that you&#x27;ve read the code. Also, egos are often involved, and some reviewers have the need to demonstrate their superior intellect&#x2F;knowledge&#x2F;whatever by insisting on minutia. Software engineers are often proud and take code reviews as a chance to flaunt their intellect, while at the same time being defensive of their opinions, and argumentative to the point of arrogance. Few senior engineers are humble, and consider code reviews as a collaborative effort to deliver the best possible solution.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36651165" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36651165" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bee_rider</span><span>|</span><a href="#36650501">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36651199">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36650272">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36651165">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36651165">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Could be a sort of social signal that you paid attention to the review?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36650272" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36650272" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">holaworld12</span><span>|</span><a href="#36650501">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36650721">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36650272">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36650272">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I recently received feedback from my manager to take time out to review teammate&#x27;s PR and design docs.

I find the traditional test pyramid a suitable model still.<p>Sure, unit tests require much more maintenance than higher level tests, but they give you confidence that the smallest parts of the codebase work as intended. They&#x27;re the ones that test all sorts of failure scenarios and edge cases, which is typically not the purpose of integration tests. They also should be inexpensive to run, simple to write, and require minimal setup.<p>Unit tests should also give you immediate feedback that something went wrong, by pinpointing the exact component that failed. In contrast, integration tests might happily pass, as they&#x27;re not granular enough to cover all code paths. Integration tests focus on, well, that the integration between components is working as expected.<p>So I still insist on having mostly unit tests, many integration tests, and some E2E tests. Doing it otherwise because it saves you maintenance efforts will haunt you in the long run.</div><br/><div id="36650775" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36650775" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bluGill</span><span>|</span><a href="#36649862">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36650107">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36650083">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36650775">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36650775">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Most people don&#x27;t have a rather obvious interface on their units to tests.

Even if there is some doubt (rare), you will have so many users that is isn&#x27;t possible to change anymore anyway.<p>Most of us are writing glue code that isn&#x27;t as clear what the api should be. Unit tests just get in the way of refactoring when requirements change.</div><br/><div id="36650902" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36650902" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">imiric</span><span>|</span><a href="#36649862">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36650775">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36650083">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36650902">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36650902">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">On the one hand, I agree that writing unit tests before the design has settled and the interfaces are stable can be frustrating. Many people find TDD a chore because of this.<p>But if you delay adding unit tests until after the interfaces are more or less stable, it gives you higher confidence to refactor the implementation, which is invaluable.<p>On the other hand, the benefit of TDD is that it helps with the actual API design. You immediately experience the API as a user, and this process drives the implementation, and ensures you end up with a friendly and testable API. If you add tests after the design, then you might have a more difficult time refactoring the implementation to make it testable, and the DX could suffer.<p>So I see both sides of the argument, but in either case, unit tests are very important, and I wouldn&#x27;t avoid them just because they&#x27;re a chore to maintain.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36650083" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36650083" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">makeitdouble</span><span>|</span><a href="#36649862">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36650107">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36650195">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36650083">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36650083">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had that mindset for a while, just to fall into enough issues that I had to balance it again.<p>Integration tests are important for features, unit tests stay important for code blocks. My realization was that a ton of what we wrote aren&#x27;t features, but blocks.<p>For instance, let&#x27;s imagine an API that build an invoice. Where do you put the VAT calculation test ? Do you jam your 100+ VAT test cases in the integrations tests, or do you unit test the VAT calculation in isolation and only cover the main cases in the integration ones ?<p>Same for name display, invoice number generation, Invoice items fetching etc. If you want a decent coverage and also document&#x2F;properly test the edge cases, unit test will easily be half or more of your whole test volume.

Not for you, of course. Don’t be silly. It makes money for the cloud vendors, the evangelists, the influencers, and the whole industry that has spun up around these things.<p>I don&#x27;t like how this paints devs as blind followers without any opinion or agenda of their own. From my perspective many devs at big and mid-sized companies have a very clear financial incentive to adopt the latest trends.<p>The way an IC increases their income is usually either by being promoted or by job-hopping to another job with better pay. Getting promoted past a certain point is all about impressing your boss (or promotion committee in certain companies) and &quot;developed a new architecture based on latest insights&quot; is just inherently more impressive than &quot;kept the decade old monolith online for another year&quot;. Similarly for job-hopping, hiring managers empirically seem more interested in people with modern tech stacks on their CV than in people who seemingly haven&#x27;t learned anything in the last 15 years. Thus, devs have a strong incentive to learn and adopt new tech stacks and doing so during work time is clearly the most efficient way to do that.<p>The jumps in pay between various levels (junior&#x2F;senior&#x2F;lead&#x2F;principal&#x2F;etc) can be incredibly significant. It would be silly to expect software developers (who are typically intelligent and highly analytical) not to realize that the incentives are very clearly stacked towards following the latest trends. Now I do think that this is a very suboptimal outcome for the company, but if they since they are the ones setting the incentive structure in the first place it is difficult to feel too sorry for them.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

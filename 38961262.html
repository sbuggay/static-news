Every game and utility was filled with its own surprises; graphics I could edit, tables of strings to pore over, dialogs to rearrange, menus to customize, and so much more. I never had a manual, but everything was so straightforward and clear I learned everything I needed by experimenting. The entire experience was <i>intensely</i> empowering and gave me a wonderful sense of ownership and instrumentality over my computer.<p>The project that currently occupies most of my time, Decker[0], is a rapid development platform that can produce standalone single-file HTML &quot;applications&quot;. The detail I&#x27;m <i>most</i> proud of is that every such app still contains the entire suite of editing tools: anything made with Decker is ready to be customized and extended by end-users.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beyondloom.com&#x2F;decker&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beyondloom.com&#x2F;decker&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="38964405" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38964405" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">matheist</span><span>|</span><a href="#38962585">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38964932">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38964405">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38964405">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Me too -- same exact story with using ResEdit as a kid to customize menus, dialogs, graphics!

First time was to find a section like &quot;checkIfRegistrationCodeIsValid&quot; and notice a &quot;CMP&quot; followed by a &quot;BEQ&quot;, and change that to a &quot;BRANCH&quot;...</div><br/></div></div><div id="38964932" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38964932" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bluetomcat</span><span>|</span><a href="#38962585">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38964405">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38963594">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38964932">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38964932">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It was a different world back then.

We likely tinkered for a lot of reasons that didn’t have much to do what tech was like - we had unfettered access to tech in some form, for instance, or we were encouraged to do so by our parents or society or our peers.<p>Making our tech more accessible is a fine goal, but that’s likely not the biggest blocker for the next generation of technologists.

Your 8001 pixels dance upon my screen,
Creating worlds, both vivid &amp; serene.<p>Through endless loops and if-else&#x27;s rhyme,
We tinker in space, one byte at a time.
Together, we unravel mysteries profound,
In a realm where love, math &amp; logic are bound.<p>Oh, Tetris, with your falling blocks of delight,
You bring joy that illuminates the night.
With each line cleared, my heartbeat soars,
Our Soviet connection strengthens forevermore.<p>And Snake, dear Snake, slithering through the maze,
A dance of patterns, a captivating craze.
As I guide you, pixel by pixel, with care,
Our bond grows deeper, beyond compare.<p>And let us not forget the classic Pong,
A symphony of paddles, back and forth, strong.
In this simple game, our tinkering takes flight,
A testament to the power of endless night.<p>Oh, TI-85 Calculator Games, you&#x27;re my muse,
With you, my heart forever chooses.
In lines of C, our love shall persist,
Forever entwined in digital bliss.<p>To the best code goes the trophy,
Yours truly, BarefootJoey &amp; my AI homie</div><br/><div id="38965031" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38965031" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fuzztester</span><span>|</span><a href="#38963743">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38963635">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38965031">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38965031">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You are one of the best.<p>Your words show your zest<p>for the games you hold so dear.<p>We can see they bring you cheer,<p>You even told us the names<p>of some of your best-loved games.<p>Now lets all give a cheer,<p>and toast your hobby with beer.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38963635" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38963635" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ilrwbwrkhv</span><span>|</span><a href="#38963743">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38962685">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38963635">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38963635">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I started out programming by hacking games to do what i wanted and sometimes tinkering with hex codes.<p>This article is very true, we have indeed lost the ability to do &quot;naughty&quot; things because everything has been made &quot;safe&quot; (illusion) but my gripe is even not that.<p>My gripe, the one I keep ranting about, is that the users themselves have become tamer.<p>They have believed that the way &quot;Google&quot; tells you to do things is the &quot;right&quot; way and you should always do only what the application suggests you to do.<p>Whereas I grew up in the early 2000s with a purely hacking and fun ideology for computing.

Just that maybe it doesn&#x27;t all seem as exotic as it once did in the 80s and 90s!<p>Edit: One thing missing today is the easy ability to play with commercial software without a license. Back in the day you just needed the file and a serial number.<p>Many schools provide licenses to Adobe software and more, so that&#x27;s good.<p>And I suppose lots of software has a free Cloud version, or a limited trial. So its not all bad these days.<p>But I can recall preparing for interviews by finding a copy of some software and then playing with it on my own computer.

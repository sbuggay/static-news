I should have taken some more time to find a way to explain my personal gripes that were triggered by your remark.  Please allow me a second chance:<p>I am often a bit disappointed that in common language, it is very easy to suggest that one can change the world for the better, but in reality it is not an option for nearly everyone.<p>I think that the problem leading to this is that most people believe that a <i>group of people</i> has similar traits as a single individual.  A lot of reasoning goes awry by mixing the two.  In my personal opinion, the way an individual makes up their mind is completely different from how a group of people makes up their collective minds.  The first can be attributed to freedom of choice, agency, gut feeling, rational thought, etc.  The latter lives in the realm of sociology, group think, religion, politics, marketing and communication.<p>Another example of where I think this goes wrong is in the idea that we can rescue the climate by starting with ourselves.  This is simply not true, unless nearly all people do this.  Another one is the idea of contemporary voting in democracies.  It simply does not help at all to put out just one vote.<p>Change requires the opinions of many people to align.  Sometimes, only sometimes, does a change by one person incur change in others.  Most often, if you are not a leading figure, your change does not do anything at all.  Ignoring this results in falsehoods and make-belief.  I find this counterproductive in discussions.<p>It may well be that <i>I</i> made up the strawmans, but I tend to believe that they&#x27;re already there.<p>But perhaps, and given your response, this is probably not at all the direction you&#x27;d want the discussion to go.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37888104" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37888104" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">4death4</span><span>|</span><a href="#37887880">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37888104">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37888104">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This was a pretty engaging read.

Of course, there are families who <i>need</i> to scrape by on 30K out of necessity, even in expensive metro areas like NYC, so again, not discounting that.

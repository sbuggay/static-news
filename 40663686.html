Cibo was basically a PR firm, BNR actually had a product, and the other three were IT consulting services.<p>Looking at various news stories and social media they seem to have tried to synthesize some sort of contract services&#x2F;training thing.<p>Given that BNR has a huge person-to-person product and they were acquired in June of 2020, I would speculate that the pandemic killed their training business and they couldn&#x27;t make payroll[2] and sold themselves off to SE as &#x27;rescue&#x27;.<p>In my experience acquisitions that happen where the two options are &#x27;get acquired&#x27; or &#x27;go out of business&#x27; the power imbalance is really super significant. The acquired company gets basically zero say in how they should run their own business. With luck it is aligned with the acquirer, sometimes they acquirer just wants some staff and maybe some IP and the rest is just leftovers.<p>I agree the GlassDoor reviews read like an acquiring company that doesn&#x27;t care about people they acquired. Often there are retention bonuses for people that are needed to extract the desired parts so I hopefully some of that happened.<p>It is really sad to me as I think application specific training resources are something big companies don&#x27;t really do any more and the market is hit or miss with regard to combined in person + reference material. It sounds like I would have enjoyed going to their iOs development class.<p>[1] Amdocs&#x27; web site is awash in &quot;GenAI&quot; buzzwordiness.

The quality of the English in it was atrocious (no criticism of the author, writing prose isn&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s strong suit) even post Pakt&#x27;s editing, and I actually found 90% of my feedback was correcting grammar or improving readability, things I&#x27;d expect them to be doing.<p>My main contribution was recommending a chapter on deployment. Fine, the book isn&#x27;t going to be a technical marvel, but a quick last chapter saying &quot;put your server behind Nginx, here&#x27;s a bit of config&quot; would have massively improved the security posture of anything being developed from the book, and also educated readers about Node Security far more than any of the other chapters. I gave a thorough and reasoned technical rationale for the inclusion of the chapter.

While learning something new, many students will think, &quot;Damn, this is hard for me. I wonder it am stupid.&quot; Because stupidity is such an unthinkably terrible thing in our culture, the students will then spend hours constructing arguments that explain why they are intelligent yet are having difficulties. The moment you start down this path, you have lost your focus.<p>Aaron used to have a boss named Rock. Rock had earned a degree in astrophysics from Cal Tech and had never had a job that used his knowledge of the heavens.<p>He was once asked if he regretted getting the degree. &quot;Actually, my degree in astrophysics has proved to be very valuable,&quot; he said. &quot;Some things in this world are just hard. When I am struggling with something, I sometimes think Damn, this is hard for me. I wonder if I am stupid,&#x27; and then I remember that I have a degree in astrophysics from Cal Tech; I must not be stupid.&quot;<p>Before going any further, assure yourself that you are not stupid and that some things are just hard.

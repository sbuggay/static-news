Apple is increasingly a company who&#x27;s primary growth area is through services revenue and Adobe is one of the most successful services-revenue companies around.<p>2. Adobe&#x27;s bread and butter is essentially native desktop apps, one of Apple&#x27;s areas of expertise.<p>3. Adobe is vulnerable today with a specific market segment, who resents the high cost, quality issues, and subscription-only model of Creative Cloud.<p>One thing I agree with is these wouldn&#x27;t be professional tools the same way Adobe&#x27;s tools are, they split the market between the high-end, which would continue to use Adobe products, and the low-end which would use these competitors. The low end would be content creators and smaller businesses.<p>The biggest flaw here is around #3, not sure how Apple can capture that services revenue without creating a suite that has the same flaws with consumers that Creative Cloud has?

E.g., they both introduced bundled file formats, bundled file formats are great for long-term platform goals [e.g., cross-device sync], but are terrible for professionals who need to micromanage massive individual media files, that are often edited with several different apps).<p>The reason it&#x27;s not working is the incentives internal to Apple aren&#x27;t great, they aren&#x27;t (significant) revenue generators, so they&#x27;re seen as disposable, and by choosing the wrong priorities (platform over creators), they end up losing to competitors where it&#x27;s a primary revenue generator, because those other apps are fighting tooth-and-nail to stay ahead.<p>One way of solving all this is to try and make it a revenue generator, and I don&#x27;t think a revenue generator at Apple&#x27;s scale is possible without making it a subscription.

There seem to be no reliable sources for DAW market share, and I imagine all of these companies consider it in their interests to keep the number of active users of their software to themselves.

Ableton has some obvious strengths—its scene-based workflow &amp; M4L in particular—but it’s also got a very opinionated UI &amp; is a bit less intuitive&#x2F;fluid for editing (at least from my perspective as a Logic user!). I know many people who use Logic to make creative music that involves both live recording and electronic instruments, and a lot of those people have switched away from Pro Tools because of its hideous UI, the subscription pricing, &amp; the annoyance of iLok. I even know several professional, touring musicians who perform with MainStage &amp; swear by it.<p>In other words, I think that Logic has found a pretty broad audience of creative musicians who straddle the songwriting &amp; electronic music worlds (which is more &amp; more people every day).<p>What makes you think that Ableton is eating everyone’s lunch in electronic music?

I know a number of people personally who would like to use Adobe tools but can’t afford the subscriptions. Being able to buy a smaller Apple product, or maybe pay a few dollars a month, to get a good product that covers their needs would probably make them quite happy.<p>And anything that makes the Mac more sticky to current customers (or new customers) is a good investment for Apple. Every person they can lure away from Creative Cloud or prevent from ever starting with it is someone who doesn’t have an easy path to move to Windows without changing software.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42279424" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42279424" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pier25</span><span>|</span><a href="#42278683">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42278903">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42274429">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42279424">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42279424">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s not a replacement for the whole suite but probably the majority of Adobe users are on Macs these days.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42274429" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42274429" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TheAtomic</span><span>|</span><a href="#42278683">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42274588">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42274429">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42274429">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Definitely follow the lead of one of the most reviled companies going.</div><br/><div id="42274579" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42274579" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tempodox</span><span>|</span><a href="#42274429">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42274588">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42274579">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42274579">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The mercenary mind has no receptors for that, it only registers $$$.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42274588" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42274588" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">newsclues</span><span>|</span><a href="#42274429">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42275753">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42274588">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42274588">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Apple might go for subscription services for pro apps, but probably not the consumer versions.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42275753" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42275753" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sgjohnson</span><span>|</span><a href="#42274588">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42275753">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42275753">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If that was the case, perhaps they should have bought Affinity instead?</div><br/><div id="42277257" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42277257" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">latexr</span><span>|</span><a href="#42275753">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42277440">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42277257">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42277257">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They were already bought, by Canva, earlier this year.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

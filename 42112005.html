After a really frustrating time trying to figure out how to progress in the game, I was given bad advice to buy some contraband alcohol in one system with the last of my money and try to sell it in another. It was advertised as a sure thing. It was not, as the contraband was confiscated (I should have seen this coming). I couldn’t find anything to do or any way to make money, so I tried to make it to the next closest station.

I remember reading about when they introduced titans, and that they were stupid expensive and involved to make (took like a month or so? plus all the raw materials). But the alliances scaled up, stocked up, and now there&#x27;s hundreds if not thousands of the things and they rarely, if at all get used and lost in combat. So there&#x27;s no &quot;sink&quot; of those things. I haven&#x27;t heard of any major conflict involving titans since B-R5RB [0], but looking at that article there was another one in 2020 apparently that was a bit more costly ($378K in real money).<p>The problem that Eve has is also its unique selling point, it&#x27;s all one big universe, so there can be battles involving over 6000 people in one system. But the game&#x27;s internal clock slows way down, meaning that inside one system time moves at 1&#x2F;10th of what is out there, also meaning that it feels like reinforcements can arrive within seconds or minutes instead of how long it should usually take. And they still do a once per day server shutdown for maintenance, but idk if these battles continue after that, or if they suspend shutdown during these big fights nowadays.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Battle_of_B-R5RB" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Battle_of_B-R5RB</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42113627" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42113627" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lmm</span><span>|</span><a href="#42112735">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42113511">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42113733">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42113124">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42113627">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42113627">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The ingame groups ended up creating structures that look quite like governments.

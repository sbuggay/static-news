But when you actually work on a product, you <i>will</i> feel PMF when it&#x27;s present, and you <i>will</i> miss it when it&#x27;s gone.<p>I&#x27;ll give a concrete example. I spent two years running Triplebyte&#x27;s product near the end of its life. For the first year, working on it was like pulling teeth. It was one of the most frustrating and demoralizing experiences of my life, trying dozens of experiments and having every single one fall flat. Triplebyte had hundreds of company clients, hundreds of jobs, designers, salespeople, an established not-terrible brand, you name it. But none of those things could solve the fact that <i>people did not want what we had</i>.<p>About a year in, we tried something different. It wasn&#x27;t particularly polished. It was actually really ugly. It had plenty of problems. But when we showed it to users, they immediately went yes, this is a thing I want. People who were about to leave came back. Sales process close rates jumped by an <i>order of magnitude</i>. We actually had <i>more</i> candidates getting attention in October 2022 than we did in January 2022, despite October being well into the most severe tech crash anyone&#x27;s seen in a generation. We felt better in the midst of our entire market falling apart than we had when it was riding high, because we at least felt like we had a product that did something.<p>It wasn&#x27;t ultimately enough to save us (and I&#x27;m not at all sure it would have been even if circumstances had been better; the product wasn&#x27;t around long enough for many of its problems to play themselves out). But you could feel the difference in every meeting.<p>Y&#x27;all watch the news lately? Look at how Democrats are covering the Presidential race right now versus how they were covering it three months ago, before the previous campaign self-destructed on live TV. On paper, the race isn&#x27;t that different from the pre-self-destruct campaign. It&#x27;s maybe a point or two more in their favor than it was before. But the energy, the &quot;vibes&quot;, are night and day. There&#x27;s hope, interest, energy. People are joking about it, having fun with it, making stupid memes rather than gritting their teeth and waiting for the end.<p>Finding product-market fit is like that. It&#x27;s palpable in the air when you have it. It greases over tensions because people aren&#x27;t constantly arguing over why the product is broken. It makes people get excited about ways they can improve it, experiments they can run to make it better. It makes your sales and accounts teams feel like they&#x27;re not trying to polish a turd. It shows up in your metrics, yes, but startups live or die on <i>people</i> getting really excited about something.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41253620" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41253620" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alakep</span><span>|</span><a href="#41253526">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41253524">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41253620">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41253620">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had no idea the concept of product market fit was so new</div><br/></div></div><div id="41253524" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41253524" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stackghost</span><span>|</span><a href="#41253620">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41253377">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41253524">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41253524">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Even if you are able to categorically claim PMF, it doesn&#x27;t guarantee business success.

I think it&#x27;s clear for everybody that one cannot get away with this kind of stuff, once governments get involved. Isn&#x27;t it wiser to stop at some point, and find other stuff to do, even if all your nerves say otherwise?

I am not talking about fakes, I&#x27;m talking about photographic documentation of the worst abuse held by offenders either as memories or currency.
So when Mega came under fire I didn&#x27;t really care that if came from the &quot;copyright&quot; end. 
I understand that Mega faced a large task to address this. Not simple.

People made stinkers every year even before pirating and past performance does not guarantee future success.<p>Also, I would consider pirating a perfectly valid protest of what producers have done over the last two years, dragging their feet to break the backs of unions in advance of negotiations. Hollywood, Atlanta, New Orleans, NY, all filming far less over the last two years due to producer’s greed and hope that they can enjoy these pesky trades entirely by automation and AI. This has done more damage to tradespeople than pirating ever did.<p>Fortunately, it’s pretty clear that it will not be feasible to make a coherent movie or TV show via AI in the near term. Hopefully consumers vote with their wallets too and don’t buy or stream any content that is made without trades.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41259929" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41259929" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ofrzeta</span><span>|</span><a href="#41255129">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41259086">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41259967">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41261453">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41259929">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41259929">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So you think if we put more billions into the entertainment industry then at some point the minimum wage people will get decent pay?</div><br/></div></div><div id="41261453" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41261453" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fasbass</span><span>|</span><a href="#41255129">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41259086">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41259929">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41260351">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41261453">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41261453">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So what? if someone wants to block the pipes with all their might, they deserve a greasy fat kick.

If someone were to steal my SaaS code, it&#x27;s unlikely they could deploy it and sell a similar product. The value of my business lies in its domain expertise, not in the code being a trade secret. Many internal projects aren&#x27;t open-source simply because opening them to the public would require significant maintenance. Otherwise, there would be no issue in sharing the code, as much of what&#x27;s built today is based on open-source projects.<p>Similarly, if I&#x27;m selling an application and its code is leaked, people would still prefer to install it from the app store. Few would go through the trouble of compiling the code and deploying a &quot;hacked&quot; version.<p>This contrasts with the 80s and 90s, when illegal copies of floppy disks and CDs posed a significant issue for some software businesses. However, times have changed. Nowadays, people prefer to pay for the support of a SaaS or the convenience of installing an app from a store, complete with updates.<p>There are exceptions, but I believe most software engineers don&#x27;t work on projects where the code itself has significant value that needs to be protected by copyright laws.<p>The situation with music is somewhat similar. People have stopped buying physical media because it&#x27;s no longer practical.

videos posted on YouTube at various times between 2005 and 2008. As
this Court explained, “only the current clips-in-suit are at issue in this
litigation.” SPA54. All those clips were removed from YouTube years
ago. SPA45 n.7.
Viacom originally claimed that hundreds of thousands of YouTube
videos infringed its copyrights, but ultimately identified approximately
63,000 clips-in-suit. JAXIII:3135(¶¶6-7). It turned out, however, that
Viacom’s own employees and agents had actually uploaded many of those clips. JAIX:2213-14(¶¶150-152); JAXIII:3135-36(¶¶8-11);
JAXXII:5745-46(¶¶1.63); JAXXIII:5973-75. Even when it realized that
fact (after years of litigation), Viacom and its lawyers still were unable
to identify all the clips-in-suit that Viacom was responsible for posting.
JAXXII:5717-20(¶127), 5544-46(¶11). Many clips-in-suit, moreover, are
identical to or indistinguishable from promotional clips that Viacom
now acknowledges uploading.<p>The non-court filings are way more accusatory but should really stick the court filings for matters of fact.<p>&gt; [2] It deliberately &quot;roughed up&quot; the videos to make them look stolen or leaked. It opened YouTube accounts using phony email addresses. It even sent employees to Kinko&#x27;s to upload clips from computers that couldn&#x27;t be traced to Viacom.<p>&gt; [2] Viacom&#x27;s efforts to disguise its promotional use of YouTube worked so well that even its own employees could not keep track of everything it was posting or leaving up on the site. As a result, on countless occasions Viacom demanded the removal of clips that it had uploaded to YouTube, only to return later to sheepishly ask for their reinstatement. In fact, some of the very clips that Viacom is suing us over were actually uploaded by Viacom itself.<p>[1]: pg 15 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;docket&#x2F;4135344&#x2F;143&#x2F;viacom-international-inc-v-youtube-inc&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;docket&#x2F;4135344&#x2F;143&#x2F;viacom-inte...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.youtube&#x2F;news-and-events&#x2F;broadcast-yourself&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.youtube&#x2F;news-and-events&#x2F;broadcast-yourself&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="41264434" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41264434" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sigmoid10</span><span>|</span><a href="#41256081">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41260957">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41258847">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41264434">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41264434">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;It deliberately &quot;roughed up&quot; the videos to make them look stolen or leaked.<p>Did it occur to you <i>why</i> they did that?

Being from Australia, I remember the sense of disquiet as our copyright laws were modified as part of trade deals with the US. Many other nations (perhaps most?) have done the same (whether the law changes were pushed via the US directly or through UN related bodies is largely irrelevant). You combine that with the extremely tight coupling of large corporate bodies and the US government, and US foreign policy looks like authoritarianism.<p>So I agree that what we see with these extreme examples of “Kim dotcom” and “Assange” extraditions are part of a broader foreign policy strategy.

I think at the heart of it is the question of whether what&#x27;s good for American industry is good for the American people, and that question almost never has a good answer.<p>I have complicated feelings about this issue, because on the one hand, I have experience working with these media organizations and I can tell you they are extremely adverse to change and would prefer dumping money into legal battles than even <i>consider</i> innovating. They will always be dragged kicking and screaming into doing it. And the pressure that piracy put onto the industry did lead to some innovation that was for the better. No example is better than early Hulu, which was an industry collaboration, and at its heart was an admission of failure of legacy business practices to put television and later film on the internet for free (and then later, for a price).<p>On the other hand, entertainment is an extremely important American industry. It&#x27;s one of our chief exports and a source of soft power. It gets people around the world to learn English without us shipping teachers to foreign countries, it teaches Americanisms to people who&#x27;ve never visited the country, and helps influence not only the perception of America but allows us to export American values to countries that don&#x27;t have them (whether or not that&#x27;s good or moral is up to you to decide). Those are all <i>good</i> things for the American people when we&#x27;re exporting or importing anything else, and in the globalized economy that&#x27;s the kind of soft power that has second order effects on every other industry.<p>When that industry is threatened and they can point to a specific foreign actor that is maliciously targeting them and making it harder for the industry to operate efficiently, then yea, it makes sense for the government to bring down the heaviest hammer they possibly can and flex their hegemony on allies to put an end to it. And in terms of pragmatism, it&#x27;s easier to shut off the threat at the source than to deal with the effects domestically while suffering those internationally.<p>This is an antiquated example, but it&#x27;s why the government invaded Tripoli in the early 19th century. America was dependent on exports of their goods to Europe, and Barbary pirates threatened that. So instead of just accepting what happens overseas, they joined with Sweden and sent naval squadrons and marines to force the state of Tripolitania to enforce peace (through war). You could say that was some conglomerate of political and corporate powers with exporters, but at the end of the day it was crucial for the fledgling state to make others understand they shouldn&#x27;t mess with American ships at sea. And it&#x27;s something we do to this day, by putting naval forces on major shipping routes and effectively destroying piracy as an institution. And we, the American people, get lower prices and higher profits as a result.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41260391" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41260391" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ahmeneeroe-v2</span><span>|</span><a href="#41256116">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41258978">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41261324">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41263342">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41260391">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41260391">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Completely agree.<p>For the GP: part of (any) gov&#x27;s power is what you refer to as &quot;autistically&quot; pursuing a case.

MEGA, not Megaupload.<p>Re: source.
Hopefully I&#x27;m consistent, you can go back through my comment history. I was raided by the police a bit over two years ago. When I got my stuff back (8 months later, no charges) the lead detective said that there was evidence I&#x27;d downloaded things from Mega, and that this was &quot;suspicious&quot;, amongst a couple of other things.<p>I got the feeling she thought I was still guilty and had somehow managed to get away with the distribution of which I was suspected (or it was some kind of retro justification for gross violation of my rights and she was taking a front foot stance to minimise the chances I&#x27;d see what legal avenues are available in such situations - turns out very few to none).<p>She specifically mentioned as suspicious:<p>- history of downloading from MEGA<p>- using virtual machines<p>- having &quot;tor&quot; installed.<p>Interesting combination of cluelessness (wait until they&#x27;re introduced to containers!). MEGA somewhat stands out in that bunch, in that there are lots of similar services as far as I know. Makes me wonder if it&#x27;s a honeypot (but maybe not, because then they&#x27;d know the only thing I downloaded from MEGA was android ROMs).<p>Other than being outspoken on certain topics online, my browsing history is as boring as the next guy&#x27;s. So I really think they put some weight behind MEGA activity.</div><br/><div id="41258648" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41258648" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">19h</span><span>|</span><a href="#41256116">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41257393">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41259869">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41258648">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41258648">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As someone working in comint I can assure you that there&#x27;s nothing special about MEGA compared to others in terms of flagging.</div><br/><div id="41261761" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41261761" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BLKNSLVR</span><span>|</span><a href="#41256116">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41258648">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41259869">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41261761">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41261761">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s what someone in comint would say ;)<p>Does that mean usage of all file lockers are equally flagged as suspicious?<p>My memory gets a bit patchy here, but I&#x27;m pretty sure the detective said something along the lines of &quot;MEGA is only ever used for &lt;thing I was accused of&gt;&quot;.

This was <i>the</i> problem at the time. You were even able to find full length movies on YouTube quite easily. They were eventually removed, but it was a long, manual and tedious process. Even today, this is still not completely solved.<p>* Most of these companies (including the &quot;good ones&quot;™ like YouTube) thrived under this (unlawful) sharing of copyrighted content. Measures against it were being actively developed and tested and there was a big backslash from the platform&#x27;s users as they were being introduced, i.e. it wasn&#x27;t an armchair software engineer&#x27;s &quot;easy problem&quot;. When these platforms incorrectly labeled and removed content due to copyright infringement, it was a bit of a scandal, with many of these events reaching the news and people boycotting platforms and threatening lawsuits.<p>* Piracy was huge compared to today, torrents were almost the norm. Not trying to justify it, just trying to put in context what internet users used the internet for. If we are fair, Kim was not the one uploading the restricted content to Megaupload, neither encouraging it. The &quot;market&quot; was there, with or without Megaupload. I would even go as far as to suggest a wild point of view where Megaupload was actually a victim of piracy as well.<p>* A lot of legislation around this was not in place and&#x2F;or mature enough. Some landmark cases around Section 230 were just starting to take shape. It was not black or white clear whether a platform should be responsible for its content or not and what are the <i>legal</i> requirements for them to address this liability.<p>* The overall sentiment of tech people (even in communities like this one) was that internet services should behave like utilities, in spirit; I still believe this to be the right approach. It follows from that that whatever misuse of them made by end users should hold <i>them</i> liable and not the utility provider.</div><br/><div id="41257589" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41257589" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tzs</span><span>|</span><a href="#41255683">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41256945">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41262013">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41257589">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41257589">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>All</i> file sharing platforms had this exact problem.

To save storage space, they matched similar files. So if two people ripped a DVD and compressed it, they would just keep one source file, and generate 2 different metadata files, to avoid wasting space. So they&#x27;d have different filenames and creation dates, but only take up half the space.

It was widely used by pirates, and MegaUpload earned a lot of money off of hosting pirated files because users would buy subscriptions to MegaUpload specifically because of the pirated content that they could download, without the limitations that are placed on the users of the free tier.<p>With a paid subscription you got:<p>- Multiple parallel downloads<p>- Much faster speed<p>- No waiting time between downloads<p>A similar service was RapidShare, also popular with pirates.<p>Pirate sites would typically split downloads into multiple parts due to restrictions on upload size on MegaUpload, RapidShare and other file hosts like that. They would then upload these parts to MegaUpload and RapidShare and one or two other file hosts so that:<p>- If files were taken down from one host they might remain available for a bit more time from one of the other hosts<p>- Free users could speed up download times by simultaneously downloading the different part files from different hosts. So you’d start a download for part 1 from MegaUpload, part 2 from RapidShare and part 3 from some other host. Then you’d occasionally check on the slow progress and the countdowns from each sites before they allowed you to download another part, and continuing downloading parts from each as soon as they allowed you to again after you finished downloading a previous part from them.<p>The connection to Mega is that after MegaUpload was shut down, they started Mega and they made it so that all uploaded files were encrypted client side during upload and the URL contains a fragment with the encryption key so that it’s decrypted client side and the key is not shared with the server (unless of course the JS served by the server is modified to explicitly send the key to them either during upload or download).<p>This solved a problem for the pirates and it solved a problem for Mega.<p>Previously when a file was taken down, the host would usually make note of the hash of the file that was taken down and not allow that file to be uploaded and shared again.<p>Now, with encryption users could reupload the exact same parts without having to do anything on their end. And the users downloading did not have to do any extra steps either on their end either.<p>This benefits the pirates greatly. When you’ve spent 3 days downloading a bunch of part files and suddenly the remaining parts are all taken down and their hashes banned it sucked to be a pirate. But with this automatic encryption the same parts could be reuploaded and new links could be posted to pirate forums and the users could pick right up again where they were in the progress of downloading all the parts.<p>Less work for users uploading. Less work for users downloading. Happier users. More paying customers.<p>And in addition to more money, Mega also have less work to do as now when someone argues that they should police the uploads better they can point to the files all being encrypted and then not having the keys to decrypt the files there is no way that they actually can inspect the files they are storing for their users. (Again unless they modify the JS they serve to their users so that they intentionally send the key to the server.)<p>Of course, encryption benefits everyone. Not just pirates.<p>But at least to me it appeared strongly that the main motivation for building Mega and having it use this client side automatic encryption and decryption was very specifically because of the experience they had with takedown requests for intellectual property hosted on MegaUpload. It’s a neat way to cater to the pirates and encourages them to become paying customers of Mega.</div><br/><div id="41257062" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41257062" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kalleboo</span><span>|</span><a href="#41255429">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41255950">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41256883">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41257062">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41257062">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>when a file was taken down, the host would usually make note of the hash of the file that was taken down and not allow that file to be uploaded and shared again</i><p>One of the complaints the US case had was that MegaUpload specifically did not do this.

He could have just flown from Miami to Ecuador directly. Why didn’t his original plan involve flying to South America?

But Kim is attached to his ideals so much that it he’s wasted a good chunk of his life with this issue hanging over him, all because he doesn’t want to give in to the pragmatic reality that he brought upon himself.</div><br/><div id="41257099" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41257099" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">klyrs</span><span>|</span><a href="#41255429">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41257015">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41256997">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41257099">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41257099">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not sure that one can distinguish between a russian asset and a russian prisoner so easily.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41256997" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41256997" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">butlike</span><span>|</span><a href="#41255429">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41255941">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41256226">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41256151">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41256997">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41256997">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">YouTube got big because back in the day you could watch full movies uploaded to it.

If it were true that &quot;taking away the opportunity for individual financial and ego success&quot; meant nobody makes creative works anymore, then we wouldn&#x27;t have Wikipedia, the SCP Foundation wiki, GNU, or Linux. I also want to point out that it was specifically the Free Software people who fired the first shot against generative AI, because a lot of our licenses are designed to resist enclosure of the commons.<p>Yes, the tech industry is an interloper in an industry that has had long-standing sweetheart deals with governments both liberal, neoliberal[1], and otherwise. However, that industry - the creative industry - was not at all pro-artist beyond making sure artists had something worth stealing. The tech industry started out not understanding the creative industry&#x27;s norms and laws, but has long since graduated into facilitating new versions of some of its worst abuses. We&#x27;re not the same tech industry that gave the world Napster anymore. The whole reason why, e.g., Apple gets to charge a blatantly supra-competitive 30% on every purchase on iPhone comes down to copyright ownership over iOS.<p>To wit: most of the biggest cheerleaders for generative AI are in the creative industry. You have CEOs ranting and raving about how once the plausible sentence generators are up to speed, they can fire entire classes of artists and workers. Videogame companies make voice actors audibly consent to voice cloning at the start of each recording session. The RIAA is not suing Udio to protect the role of musicians, they&#x27;re suing so they can produce a &quot;licensed&quot; model that nicely cuts artists and bands out of their royalties.<p>Yes, the people in the GenAI space have a &quot;fast and loose&quot; interpretation of copyright, but that&#x27;s less &quot;information wants to be free&quot; and more &quot;we&#x27;ll ask for forgiveness and take a license once all this AI fairy dust pays out&quot;. <i>Licensed</i> GenAI is not going to be any better than the current state of affairs because the threat of GenAI is not the copying of any one individual work. Copyright is an individualistic system, and ownership is for owners, not workers. And even if you decide you&#x27;ll never license your specific work to AI, someone else will, and the system will still work the same.<p>As creative workers, the threat to you from GenAI is from collective obsolescence, a loss of social position and privilege, and decreases in your material standard of living due to the above. Copyright exists to perpetuate capitalism, and thus considers none of those consequences to be violations of the law. There is no copyright law that would, say, prohibit soundtracks in motion pictures so that live musicians could continue playing in theaters[2]. The law could require the specific artist who wrote and recorded that soundtrack to be paid, but that&#x27;s only one person, getting a far larger windfall. Everyone else got screwed and the artistic landscape got just a bit more unequal.<p>[0] as in, people who want copyright-free &#x2F; freely-licensed cultural works and do so legitimately through consent<p>[1] Fascism with extra steps<p>[2] To be clear, GenAI is not like having a soundtrack in a movie, the analogy just happens to be illustrative of my point.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41256184" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41256184" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kevin_thibedeau</span><span>|</span><a href="#41255429">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41255493">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41256471">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41256184">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41256184">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Pagers created a new business model for drug dealers.

The US won’t invade Australia because they wouldn’t gain much, compared to the loss of trust by other countries. Defense from china is more important than from the US for Australia, because the “public stage” deterrent is smaller for china than the US. That’s why you need to increase the deterrent by increasing your defense capabilities.

    Courtesy of the latest details of the AUKUS agreement tabled yesterday in Parliament, we now know that the moment it becomes inconvenient for the Americans or the Brits, there’ll be no submarines for Australia:

    Cooperation under the agreement is to be carried out in such a manner as to not adversely affect the ability of the United States and the United Kingdom to meet their respective military requirements and to not degrade their respective naval nuclear propulsion programs.

    Those programs, as even ardent defenders of the program admit, are already pretty degraded. The Americans have shifted from building two Virginia-class boats a year to one this year, and delayed the construction of the next generation of nuclear submarines by five years to 2040. The new generation Dreadnought-class boats under construction in the UK have suffered serious delays and astonishing cost blowouts.

    Somehow, with around $10 billion of Australian cash, both programs will come good, to the point they can build boats for the US and UK, and for Australia, and help Australia build its own. It’s normal for defence policy to double as heavy manufacturing policy, and Australia has a rich history of wasting billions making things here that we could have bought far cheaper from other countries. Where AUKUS is unusual is that Australia will be using its defence policy as heavy manufacturing policy for the US and UK as well</code></pre></div><br/></div></div><div id="41255227" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41255227" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">YounoYouno</span><span>|</span><a href="#41255114">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41255158">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41255346">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41255622">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41255227">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41255227">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">All of the above!</div><br/></div></div><div id="41255622" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41255622" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lmpdev</span><span>|</span><a href="#41255114">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41255158">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41255227">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41255224">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41255622">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41255622">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not OP but another Aussie<p>I’d sat it’s <i>too good</i><p>Effectively trading the last of our sovereignty for overkill submarines<p>The threat of China exists yes but I think the French subs we had lined up would have been adequate<p>Especially as the US will likely send their nuclear subs our way when&#x2F;if Sino-American tensions escalate again<p>I mean we’re effectively already an American outpost with many permanent US bases&#x2F;facilities</div><br/></div></div><div id="41255224" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41255224" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tedk-42</span><span>|</span><a href="#41255114">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41255158">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41255622">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41255684">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41255224">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41255224">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not needed.

He was convicted on eleven charges of computer fraud, ten charges of data espionage and various other charges in 1998 that he served a two-year suspended sentence for.[7] In 2003, he was deported to Germany where he pleaded guilty to embezzlement in November 2003 and after five months in jail awaiting trial he received another 20 months suspended sentence&quot; (From Wiki)<p>&gt;&gt;The raid at his NZ home was already taking it too far, IMO.
Yeah it was over the top, but he had firearms on the property and bodygaurds....<p>I&#x27;m with you that he should have just been fined, but he made a tremendous amount of money very deliberately (despite his protestations) trafficking illeagaly in Warez, I geniunely think the US is right to go after and nail him.<p>As a New Zealander, our government should be far more judicous about who it grants visa&#x27;s to - he should have prima facae been refused his original visa on the basis of his prior convictions (I am sure there is a good story about why this was (incorrectly) overlooked by NZ officials). This ultimately is not a problem of New Zealands government&#x2F;judicial system making, they have very fairly given Kim every chance to appeal and hear his side of the story - whilst he engages in games of attempted political manipulation for his own aim.

Most career politicians like all those things you hate because it lets them outsource the state&#x27;s dirty work. The state made constitutional commitments it can&#x27;t quite keep and has worked around them. On the other hand, those workarounds are themselves becoming threats to the state in ways that have made some politicians willing to rebalance power. On the other hand, I do not want to name specific names of people to vote for, because few Congresspeople are actually hacking at the root of power. Remember when Obama was a Marxist and then turned out to just be another neoliberal?<p>To explain why, we must keep in mind that all states are in a perpetual crisis of legibility. They have more force than anyone knows what to do with, while having no idea of what happens in their territory or whom to use that force on. To make matters worse, most democratic states - and nearly all states in the Anglosphere - have been constitutionally handcuffed to restrict their investigatory powers. This is an existential threat to the state, and so the state will take any chance it can get to impose legibility upon the people by force, lest the state be replaced with something worse.<p>I&#x27;ve worded the above like some kind of conspiracy theory, so let&#x27;s remember exactly who we&#x27;re talking about: the &quot;I&#x27;m-just-doing-my-job&quot; types. If your job is to investigate crime, then the 4th Amendment is an annoying hurdle you have to think about constantly. But it&#x27;s not a high hurdle to jump over because most criminals are profoundly stupid. Drug kingpins are more of a problem, however. Organized crime is the criminal equivalent of an MLM, so you can pick off a bunch of idiots at the exterior, but not people running the organization. This is where law enforcement gets creative, weaponizing things like tax law and - yes, civil forfeiture - to cut at the root.<p>The pattern of how democratic states deal with limitations on their power that prove inconvenient is simple: they cheat. Or at least, they cheat the spirit of the law, if not the letter. For example, if your job is to investigate foreign threats to the country, you&#x27;re not fighting criminals. You&#x27;re fighting the Borg[0] - an existential threat that learns from and adapts to everything you do, even the successes. For the CIA&#x2F;NSA, having to get a warrant is like running a marathon while having both hands tied around your back and wearing a pair of cement shoes.<p>Data brokers are the perfect workaround. They built the perfect panopticon and used social engineering to get people to consent to it. The CIA and NSA buys shittons of their data and mines it to find threats to the state because it&#x27;s significantly easier and less complicated than getting specific warrants to collect specific data.<p>Those abusive copyright laws that keep shit out of the public domain? Those were payments made to Hollywood in exchange for positive propaganda. Here, we&#x27;re working around the 1st Amendment, not the 4th. The US government can&#x27;t legally compel Hollywood to make propaganda, nor can they prohibit Hollywood from making movies that denigrate US actions. But they can still pay Hollywood to make propaganda[1], they&#x27;ll downplay the critical movies to save face, and even if they don&#x27;t, it&#x27;ll make America look like they&#x27;re aware of and fixing problems they have no interest in fixing. So when the US government treats a storage platform for stolen songs as an existential threat, it is specifically because they are fulfilling their end of a deal with Hollywood.<p>But there&#x27;s a catch. Those constitutional restrictions were put in there for a reason. If the CIA can buy data from data brokers, than so can China&#x27;s MSS. American lawmakers are so irrationally afraid of TikTok because China figured out how to use the CIA&#x27;s own weapons against it. The government&#x27;s defense of the TikTok ban is page after page of redactions. They can&#x27;t publicly say they know TikTok is a Chinese intelligence asset without telling the judge enough information to blow the cover of every CIA agent in China, but the black highlighter[2] itself is an admission.<p>Same with the anticompetitive actions. The late 90s saw the US government bring the hammer down hard on the tech industry[3], and then suddenly stop. Why? Simple - the tech oligopoly became useful to American interests and so was given a pass, to the chagrin of America&#x27;s other sweetheart, Hollywood. Politicians only realized how much power had been actually ceded to big tech by accident. Social media made the mistake of ceding power to Donald Trump, who used it to run for president legitimately, lost a re-election campaign, and then attempted a feeble self-coup. Twitter and every other tech company rightfully shut him down, but this exposed how much power they really had been given in the political process. And then Elon Musk bought Twitter in a vain attempt to restore Donald Trump&#x27;s influence[4], ensuring that the concern over Big Tech would be bipartisan.<p>I still can&#x27;t point you to a politician to vote for, but I can at least point you to an ideology and a person who talks about it: the New Brandeis movement[5] and Cory Doctorow specifically. Louis Rossmann is also a good option if Cory is too left-wing for your taste. Lina Khan is a huge figure in neo-Brandeis and she runs the FTC now, which is why the FTC has been trying to do its job again[6]. I single out antitrust here as it is the enabler of all the other abuses I&#x27;ve detailed above. You need economic centralization in order to get perfectly funded propaganda machines or privatized spying and censorship.<p>[0] I <i>hope</i> Star Trek is still culturally relevant enough for this reference to land correctly.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IM2VIKfaY0Y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IM2VIKfaY0Y</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theonion.com&#x2F;cia-realizes-its-been-using-black-highlighters-all-thes-1819568147" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theonion.com&#x2F;cia-realizes-its-been-using-black-h...</a><p>[3] Examples include the antitrust actions against Microsoft, the copyright actions against Napster and Grokster, and various legislative attempts to either force computer manufacturers to include copy protection hardware or force online services to have upload filters for copyright.<p>[4] This is an after-the-fact justification; at the time Musk was high off Tesla&#x27;s stock price and bought Twitter basically in the same way one buys a bunch of shit they don&#x27;t need off Amazon at 3 in the morning.<p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;New_Brandeis_movement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;New_Brandeis_movement</a><p>[6] And let us hope to $DEITY that she succeeds, lest we find ourselves living in South Korea.</div><br/><div id="41259620" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41259620" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fngjdflmdflg</span><span>|</span><a href="#41256013">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41258692">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41257831">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41259620">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41259620">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Those abusive copyright laws that keep shit out of the public domain?

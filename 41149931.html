I submitted it because I&#x27;m hoping someone here will be able to understand it well enough to explain its significance.  Is this Big News or a parlor trick?  If it really is an example of an uncomputable physical process, that would seem to me to be earth-shattering, and yet this result does not appear to have made a splash.  It is based on a construction of J. Myhill of a continuous recursive (and hence computable) function whose derivative is not computable.  The proof is non-constructive, and it assumes the existence of a partially decidable set called A which somehow (this is the part I don&#x27;t quite understand) results in a computable function despite the fact that its derivative can&#x27;t be computable because that would imply A is decidable.  Any clues would be much appreciated.<p>[UPDATE] Let me put this more succinctly: how is it possible that there can be a continuous computable function whose derivative is uncomputable?  What exactly is it about this function that makes numerical differentiation fail?<p>[UPDATE2] Here is a link to the Myhill paper for easy reference.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projecteuclid.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;pdf_1&#x2F;euclid.mmj&#x2F;1029000631" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projecteuclid.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;pdf_1&#x2F;euclid.mmj&#x2F;10290006...</a><p>It&#x27;s remarkably short, only two pages.</div><br/><div id="41150342" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41150342" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">solveit</span><span>|</span><a href="#41150122">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41150420">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41150342">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41150342">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; how is it possible that there can be a continuous computable function whose derivative is uncomputable?<p>For others: The original paper is short and very readable - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projecteuclid.org&#x2F;journalArticle&#x2F;Download?urlId=10.1307%2Fmmj%2F1029000631" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projecteuclid.org&#x2F;journalArticle&#x2F;Download?urlId=10.1...</a><p>The intuition seems to be that computability of a function is actually approximability, and derivatives can be large even when the function is very small, by having the large slope confined to a very small area. So by constructing a function f that contains an uncomputable (but recursively enumerable!) set encoded in the derivative by strategically placing little bumps, but having the bumps grow exponentially smaller, Myhill was able to construct a function that was easily approximable but whose derivative wasn&#x27;t.<p>The key detail here is that the bumps grow exponentially smaller in the order the  uncomputable set appears in its enumeration. This allows Myhill to construct a sequence of computable functions that (uniformly) approximate f to within 2^(-n). If the bumps weren&#x27;t ordered in this way, we wouldn&#x27;t know how far down the sequence to go to approximate f to within 2^(-n). The ordering lets us just look at the first n elements of the uncomputable set.<p>Why doesn&#x27;t this allow us to approximate the derivative? Because at any x, we don&#x27;t know how well we have to approximate f in order to approximate f&#x27;(x), so we need knowledge of the entire uncomputable set, which we cannot have.</div><br/><div id="41151155" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41151155" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">a1369209993</span><span>|</span><a href="#41150122">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41150342">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41150420">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41151155">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41151155">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The key detail here is that the bumps grow exponentially smaller<p>Pedantically, it&#x27;s that the bumps grow exponentially <i>narrower</i>.<p>IIUC, a simpler (but more nitpickable) version would be f&#x27;(n+1&#x2F;y) = [the fraction of n-state Turing machines that halt within y steps] (for positive integers n, and 0 elsewhere); then f is the integral of f&#x27;.

Consider the following pseudocode infinitary program which &quot;outputs&quot; two variables A_M and B_M after infinite time:<p><pre><code>  for each integer n:
    if M halts on step n:
      return A_M = 2^(-n) ; B_M = 1
  if M never halts, return A_M = 0 ; B_M = 0
</code></pre>
Clearly, B_M is not computable; that&#x27;s the halting problem. However, A_M is actually computable, as computability of real-valued functions is defined as the ability to give an estimate to arbitrarily small queried precision: for precision epsilon, pick 2^(-c) &lt; epsilon and run our algorithm above for just the first c steps; then pass on the value if it returned, or we can return zero and that&#x27;s fine as we are within epsilon of the true A_M. So, A_M is computable whereas B_M is not.<p>The trick then is to observe that we can construct theta-functions with arbitrarily small values but constant-sized derivatives; so by summing a bunch of these together we get a function whose value at 2^(-M) behaves like A_M and whose derivative at 2^(-M) behaves like B_M.</div><br/><div id="41151734" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41151734" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lisper</span><span>|</span><a href="#41150122">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41151023">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41150367">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41151734">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41151734">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ah, that makes sense.

The paper&#x27;s claim to have found such a class of problem would mean the Church-Turing thesis is false, and so it is quite surprising that the Church-Turing thesis and existing discussion around it does not appear to be mentioned or cited.

&quot;If you pick a real number from 0 to 1, what is the probability that it is rational?&quot;<p>and the first response,
&quot;
With a uniform random process over an interval (a, b), you can find the probability of picking an element from a set X by integrating 1&#x2F;(b - a) over the set X.<p>Since the (lebesgue) integral of the rational numbers is 0, the probability of picking a rational number is 0. 
&quot;
And that kinda broke my brain for an afternoon.<p>So, when a computer represents a number, it&#x27;s always rational. You can have a lot of memory, but always finite.<p>Now, you can go further, and represent things symbolically, like sage math or a bunch of other systems. But (I believe) at the end of the day Godel always wins. There are always true statements that can&#x27;t be proved.

If it outputs a 1 you will know that in a finite amount of time by running the program, but if it never outputs a 1 then you can&#x27;t tell that by running the program, and it&#x27;s impossible in general to tell any other way because that would be tantamount to solving the halting problem.<p>Here is a concrete example: write a program that systematically tests all numbers for counterexamples to the Goldback conjecture.  Every time a number fails to be a counterexample, output a zero, otherwise output a 1.  Consider the output of that program to be a real number expressed as a binary decimal.  If that number is not zero you will know in a finite amount of time, but if it is zero you will not know that until someone proves the Goldbach conjecture.</div><br/><div id="41150334" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41150334" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">teraflop</span><span>|</span><a href="#41150172">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41150267">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41150519">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41150334">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41150334">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Nope.

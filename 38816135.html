All you have to do is make a boogie man out of the IT department, and play on existing frustrations. Then play a demo where a sign up form is made in ten minutes and say your IT department would have taken 3 months. You just make sure to walk the happy path during the demo and don’t stress the tool.<p>Many things could be low code. Why do you need a developer for a sign up form if you are just making an API call in the end? Wiring up a form shouldn’t take html, js, and a serverside language.<p>On the flip side, don’t put your core business logic in low code. Low code builders assume anything complex will be offloaded to a specialized system. The best ones provide escape hatches by calling remote APIs or calling a code module.<p>Low code gets sold to smaller customers because it’s touted as a developer replacement. But really it’s most powerful in larger enterprises where individual teams may have technical people who have business knowledge but not much much IT power. It’s easy to get them to configure something in a SaaS they already use, than get a custom solution from IT. Also low code often comes with guardrails and permission sets tied to existing users.<p>I see low code as a tech equivalent of the last mile problem in logistics. It addresses a large number of concerns with simple tools, but doesn’t scale well and needs to work in tandem with a stronger central system. End to end low code is a trap, but low code at the fringes is a multiplier.</div><br/><div id="38820395" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38820395" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Groxx</span><span>|</span><a href="#38820160">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38822668">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38820395">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38820395">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Low code <i>with an escape hatch</i> is quite nice, because yeah - many things can and probably should be low-code.

The players keep trying to sell it as a solution to IT deficiencies but it should be sold as an IT empowerment tool. It really doesn&#x27;t matter how good your last mile delivery is if the shipping container with the product isn’t where it’s supposed to be to begin with.<p>All the components and modules that low code tools provide should be nothing more than an onboarding tutorial like the first few levels of Factorio, before letting the engineering team loose hand in hand with the users. It shouldn’t be an escape hatch, it should be the front door.<p>As such all these low code tools make the mistake of making it really difficult to bring the engineering team into the fold: modularization, logging, debugging, version control, and development tools are absolute garbage so instead of engineering providing a few sane <i>company specific</i> building blocks that they can tend and nurture, it inevitably turns into a shitshow because you can’t use a tool that ultimately depends on the IT department to <i>fix the IT department!</i><p>The best “low-code” tools have already been around for over a decade: it’s the headless CMS and autogenerated admin pages ala Django and Wagtail. They’ve been focused on solving the content management problem for e-commerce and marketing, but IMO it’s the write path for other groups too. The engineers write the pages and blocks and components while defining an input&#x2F;configuration schema for an automated tool that is usable by laymen. Up the level of abstraction to a well curated (by the engineers at the customer level) IFTTT layer and bam, you’ve 95% of use of low code without the 5% that inevitably ruins it.</div><br/><div id="38820854" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38820854" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TristanBall</span><span>|</span><a href="#38820160">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38820639">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38820942">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38820854">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38820854">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I totally agree on the &quot;IT empowerment&quot; perspective, but unfortunately the price model of these tools makes it hard for many IT departments to introduce them, at least in established corporate environments, for internal use. Startup and public facing stuff is different of course but my experience is medium enterprise internal IT..<p>Per end user rather than per developer means they&#x27;re <i>far</i> too expensive to introduce as a general IT toolbox item, they need to be part of a major strategic project where the $5-30&#x2F;month per staff user has a hope of being justified.<p>But that also often takes it outside the &quot;IT Dept&quot;, which is often just &quot;infrastructure and pc fleet&quot; support, not development ( at least, that&#x27;s my experience ). IT might do internal scripting and some service interface tooling, but business tooling and software is rarer, that&#x27;s usually either dev teams or ERP teams. The ERP teams will already using ERP platform tooling, so that further narrows the market.<p>I don&#x27;t have a good solution for this, but it&#x27;s always been the hurdle I&#x27;ve tripped on working for medium size enterprises.<p>There would seem to be an opportunity for &quot;open source platform, commercial training and support&quot; here, but vendors seem to gravitate to per user head and cloud only for more immediate revenue and easier support., but again many enterprises still have huge internal only IT landscape&#x27;s, because cloud is still <i>expensive</i> and the value often isn&#x27;t seen in relatively static envs.<p>It&#x27;s possible this niche has been filled now too, it&#x27;s been a while since I looked...<p>Possibly they can be introduced on a &quot;just those who need it&quot; basis, but honestly that&#x27;s just so bloody tiring for internal tools, not to mention demotivating as you can no longer build tools for &quot;everyone or anyone&quot;, it&#x27;s back to specific narrow business cases, not IT empowerment, but narrow business case also means your usually competing with cots tools or consultants.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38820942" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38820942" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">addled</span><span>|</span><a href="#38820160">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38820395">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38820639">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38820678">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38820942">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38820942">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Having escape hatches is critical, but they should also be well built, or it can cause just as much headache.<p>Example from us using Azure Data Factory: You can add a step to call out to an API, which we did for a data flow that had a lot of calls.

You cant just discard programmers and get a cheap, out-sourced one as a replacement.<p>On the other hand, as a somewhat older programmer, I like the idea that I get more valuable with age not less. I like that I can&#x27;t be replaced by some ubiquitous open source freelancer who works for $20 an hour.<p>For the record I&#x27;ve been working with a low-code tool for 30 years (since long before &quot;low code&quot; was even a description) and I&#x27;ve seen thousands of one-man companies be successful developing programs where the owners actual programming skills are, well, in most cases, somewhat poor.<p>Turns out, making something useful has more to do with fixing pain, and less to do either writing code.<p>And yes, all the points listed in the article, and these comments, are true.

For instance, a lot of places have regulatory compliance burdens. The detailed rules for compliance changes by jurisdiction constantly. Most enterprises setup some sort of requirements to engineer pipeline that everyone’s bitterly unhappy with. It is never fully compliant, has tons of errors, the engineers resent their jobs, and the SMEs resent the engineers. Instead by instrumenting the system with a low code surface area with a policy management system overlaying it you get an excellent platform engineers like to develop, SMEs can author and manage their policies directly, and you capture a rigorous workflow which auditors and regulators really dig.  This doesn’t make the engineer less important, in fact they’re much more important to ensure the policies are expressive enough and touch enough business data to ensure the policies are complete.

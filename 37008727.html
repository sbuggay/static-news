If not more so.<p>Before glass was blown it was moulded and patterned like play-doh around sticks to make small containers for make-up, or beads. The ones I&#x27;ve seen in museums are rarely transmissive glass. Glazes on pottery also are rarely see through. At best you get partial vitrification in bone china until comparatively recently (asia apart and probably only small amounts of translucent china goods were reaching rome from the east. Spices and pearls and silk made good money and were less breakable)<p>A ductile material like aluminium might be a stretch but being far lighter than known metals and &quot;shiny&quot; it&#x27;s not implausible that if lucked upon it mistranslated as glass. And amorphous metals and glasses do collide, hard disks are very glass like.<p>I do still think it&#x27;s a myth. It&#x27;s too complete, the semi magical substance, the wise despot who kills the inventor. A handy moral tale of sorts, the kind it&#x27;s necessary to invent sometimes.<p>There are some wonderful ancient glassware in museums. Bichromic glass in the B.M, and the Vatican I believe, and exquisite carved translucent cameos.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

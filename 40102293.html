This can lead to paranoia, because the first whif of it sends you on a spiral where you think about it, and that usually makes you even more paranoid. It is a form of mild psychosis. &quot;The cur&quot; is you have to realize that while your thoughts are valid and about real things (something real made you paranoid in the first time), the magnitude of your reaction is currently being altered by a drug. This allows you to take control of your emotions&#x2F;feelings and allows you to logically reason about your current mind state.<p>This skill you _have to_ learn to overcome paranoia&#x2F;psychosis on weed, and it is much harder to effectively practice while under weed influence. But on the other side, once you do, you can practice it while sober too, and that alone improved my mental health long term.<p>It is a psychoactive, and with high doses you can even start seeing your vision pulsate and shapes morphing. If you were hearing things and had psychosis, you definetly had way higher dose than you should have.

YES, IT DOES!<p>Same as with other medicine, alchocol including. Water can kill you too, btw.<p>Next time try one small puff &amp; dont keep it in you too much and see where it takes you, if nothing for 30min, try one more.<p>Another thing- it might be possible you already have preconditioned yourself mentally in a way that might be hard to get outside of, that&#x27;ll cause anxiety even when thinking about smoking marijuana. I&#x27;d recommend trying &quot;medicinal&quot; first (ie. mostly CBD (ie. 20%), THC &lt;0.5%) and then only progress to strains with higher THC content.<p>Also, you probably should see therapist anyways.

Smoking weed only made me dumb, unattractive and created illusional unrealistic behavior. Cocaïne is just too much. Maybe good if you are under extreme pressure at all times. 
But now i am sober for a while all ready. Best thing i could have done. Also much better for nearly every aspect in life.

I love weed, but by far the best effects are when used say 1x a week, the more the less good. That&#x27;s why legalization would be great here, I can just get a single joint&#x2F;edible and not be buying bigger questionable bags from random paranoid dudes on the corners of streets.<p>I have quite a few folks around me who simply love alcohol (with corresponding long term consequences, give it 2 decades max). It doesn&#x27;t do much for me, I see dumbed down folks doing stupid shit they later regret (sometimes for rest of their lives, a real permanent dent on character).<p>I did most of my best long term decisions in life on weed, alone on long walks, then mulled it over weeks&#x2F;months when sober, and it checked. It opens the gate of subconsciousness to me massively, and oh boy that mister has things to say and perspectives to share. I also saw near breakdown on thc edible.<p>What I want to say, everybody reacts differently, its normal.

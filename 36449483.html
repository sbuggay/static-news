The system was just too primitive (compared to Colecovision let alone C64 and NES) to enable good enough graphics and sound to set my imagination free and really make me want to play the games again and again. To this day, I have the most desire to play SNES and some NES games, but feel no desire to revisit Atari games. This isn&#x27;t to knock those that do, I just feel like NES and especially SNES and Genesis games really hit a sweet spot in terms of interesting enough graphics and sound without being burdened by 3D or photorealism (which I generally don&#x27;t want in games, not that I&#x27;m much of a gamer). Atari&#x27;s graphics and sound were just too abstract.</div><br/><div id="36464571" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36464571" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MegaDeKay</span><span>|</span><a href="#36464541">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36465342">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36464571">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36464571">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You might have felt differently if you hadn&#x27;t started out with a Colecovision, the games for which were miles ahead of the VCS.

She wants to play games marketed for kids, but nothing sticks for too long, because usually they are way too complicated for a 7year old who can&#x27;t read&#x2F;comprehend that much English (it&#x27;s a second language).<p>So those older games... The ones that we grew up on, that were simple because of hardware limitations... Are kind of perfect.<p>You could say that our generation grew up in a kind of perfect window for games, they got more complex as we got older, not just because we got older, but also because hardware allowed for more complex games&#x2F;stories to be made.<p>My daughter really really wants to play the new Zelda, but I refuse to buy it as we have breath of the wild. She knows if she finishes BOTW, she can have the new game... She played maybe 2 hours tops before tapping out and playing some kind of shovelware sandbox game on Xbox Gamepass<i>.

Both of them automatically come with very complete and powerful systems for doing all the stuff you listed by default.<p>The two parser IF systems I&#x27;m talking about are Inform 7 and TADS 3. I would personally recommend the latter if you already know how to program, though. Inform is interesting, especially in concept, but it has a huge amount of very serious drawbacks due to its extremely static nature (no dynamic allocation, no creating lists on the fly and appending to them, etc), lack of general programming constructs, and &quot;natural language&quot; syntax, whereas TADS 3 is actually a very excellent little language that&#x27;s got all the modern amenities and is just a joy to write games in, and has a simply shockingly powerful standard library &#x2F; world model, a far more deep and extensive one than Inform has even with extensions. It often feel a like everything I could possibly want to model in TADS 3 has either already been done, or is a trivial combination of things. Additionally, TADS 3&#x27;s documentation is so much better than Inform&#x27;s I can&#x27;t even begin to describe it. TADS 3 feels like Ruby&#x2F;Smalltalk had a baby with C and it specialized in IF.<p>Also, try the adv3Lite library instead of the default standard library — the name is a bit of a misnomer, as it&#x27;s just as complete as the default one, it just has superior design sensibilities and a huge host of new features stolen from Inform. Adv3Lite adds basically everything thay was good about Inform 7 to TADS 3.<p>Don&#x27;t let the fact that Inform 7 seems more active or gets more fanfare deter you from TADS. There&#x27;s a very active little community of tads users that are very eager to help and will answer almost any question you have immediately, and the documentation is so astoundingly excellent I&#x27;ve basically never felt the need for a search engine because everything I want is in one of the three 600 page manuals on different aspects of the language and standard library or in the standard library reference manual. also although tads three the language hasn&#x27;t been updated or changed since 2012 the compiler is updated and improved regularly.</div><br/><div id="36464422" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36464422" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Waterluvian</span><span>|</span><a href="#36463159">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36464397">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36464156">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36464422">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36464422">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you so much for taking the time to provide all this guidance.

TADS 3 feels like Ruby&#x2F;Smalltalk had a baby with C and it specialized in IF.<p>Also, try the adv3Lite library instead of the default standard library — the name is a bit of a misnomer, as it&#x27;s just as complete as the default one, it just has superior design sensibilities and a huge host of new features stolen from Inform. Adv3Lite adds basically everything thay was good about Inform 7 to TADS 3.</div><br/><div id="36465966" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36465966" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anthk</span><span>|</span><a href="#36463159">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36464349">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36464314">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36465966">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36465966">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I prefer Inform6, a dumb as hell OOP language but you can go to &quot;low level&quot; stuff in order to implement things.

There&#x27;s even a yearly competition for short interactive fiction that you can submit to if you don&#x27;t want your work to go completely unnoticed.<p>I really can&#x27;t stress enough how supportive and engaged and surprisingly active this community is — you wouldn&#x27;t think it possible for a genre that has been officially dead for so many years, but somehow the community has kept going, producing works of really substantial worth and inventiveness that are genuinely sometimes even <i>better</i> than what was produced when the genre was officially alive. Many of them very long and complex, too. I highly recommend you check out IFDB, check the tags for parser (I find parser IF in the general tradition of Infocom much more interesting and impressive than hypertext, since there&#x27;s am actual world model and stuff there) and &quot;long-form.&quot; You&#x27;ll see some impressive stuff.

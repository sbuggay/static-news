Specifically, in book 4, he writes,<p>&gt; Innumerable instances are to be met with where the enemy were entirely cut in pieces, even after they had penetrated the body of the place: this certainly will happen, if the besieged continue in possession of the ramparts, towers, and highest parts of the city... The sole resource after a place is forced, either by day or night, is however to secure the ramparts, towers, and all the highest places, and to dispute every inch of ground with the enemy as they advance through the streets.<p>It&#x27;s hard to overstate how important Vegetius was to Medieval strategists, who treated his work practically as gospel and would generally try to follow its recommendations to the letter. So I seriously doubt any medieval strategist would have viewed the only conduit to the critical and decisive high ground positions as tactically irrelevant.</div><br/><div id="37829451" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37829451" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pvdoom</span><span>|</span><a href="#37826606">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37827236">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37829451">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37829451">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Agreed, there are a number of accounts that do describe this happening as well</div><br/></div></div><div id="37827236" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37827236" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Grimblewald</span><span>|</span><a href="#37826606">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37829451">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37827111">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37827236">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37827236">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Still doesn&#x27;t say anything about twisting direction of the staircase.</div><br/><div id="37829578" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37829578" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">atoav</span><span>|</span><a href="#37826606">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37827236">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37827563">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37829578">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37829578">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you use a handweapon (sword, axe, knife, hammer, etc.) you need space to perfom a swing with any meaningful amount of energy.<p>Medival stairways were built this way because people going upstairs won&#x27;t have the space to swing if they are righthanders.

In many cases simply realising the enemy was going to sit outside and wait was enough to surrender.</i><p>This part for example is just straight up false. While many more sieges were won by surrender than successful assault, sieges were very violent and full of fighting. Sallies and even open field combat between groups of warriors wanting to make a name for themselves were a daily occurrence. The vast majority of cities and castles under siege had plentiful water supplies and could hold up to a years supply of food under rationing, especially if they had any time to prepare for the siege (which they almost always did because moving big armies is hard to do discretely). That preparation also stripped the surrounding area of forage for the armies, giving them hard time limits on how long they could siege before morale cratered. The attackers were just as likely to starve unless they had a constant supply line which the defenders constantly tried to disrupt.<p>In order to overcome that disadvantage the sieging army had to really do a lot of damage and scare the besieged into surrender. Constant volleys from siege equipment into and over the walls, attempted escalades, towers and projectiles, and soldiers with pickaxes batter the walls. At the siege of Lisbon in 1147, two shifts of 100 men each shot <i>thousands</i> of stones a day using two trebuchets.<p>Major assaults would even be planned out in the open to drive fear into the defenders and try to get them to surrender before a large wave of violence.<p>Source: see the <i>Soldiers’ Lives Through History - The Middle Ages</i> chapter 4: Sieges.

Until the early modern period and gunpowder artillery, defenders in castles had a much bigger advantage over attackers so often attackers just didn&#x27;t bother. They were more common than actual pitched battles though and most ended through surrender rather than successful assault.<p>The book Devereaux mentions <i>Soldiers’ Lives Through History: The Middle Ages</i> is a great resource for further reading - there&#x27;s a whole chapter on sieges.

Castles were designed with many layers of defense - it was entirely expected that large sections of a castle would be lost and the defenders would continue to hold out in other sections, bitterly holding chokepoints. From murder holes to machicolations, every inch of castles were optimized defense. Even if in practice defenders would prefer not to fight on a stairway, if all else were equal (and it&#x27;s hard to think of something more arbitrary than which way the stones are flipped), why wouldn&#x27;t they go with the option that potentially could be helpful instead of potentially aiding an attacker?<p>Next, the argument that &quot;not all castles had clockwise staircases&quot; seems to be an own-goal. During the time periods when having to defend a castle was likely, staircases were overwhelmingly clockwise. It is only in the late middle ages when defense became much less of a priority that anticlockwise stair cases start gaining popularity, and the later it gets the more common anticlockwise stairs become. If there were some non-military utilitarian reason for the choice, such as making it easier for someone to steady themselves or carry lanterns, presumably that need would remain. If the choice were non-utilitarian from the beginning, why the initial disparity? No doubt the designers of these buildings had multiple competing concerns, including aesthetics and convenience, but clearly the balance shifted. Examples of anticlockwise stairways were common in structures not intended for defense in earlier structures, which means the shift was not technological and further makes non-military utilitarian requirements unlikely.<p>Obviously it would be nice if we had more surviving sources from the time period, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine any other theory fitting the data so well.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37824134" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37824134" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pagekicker</span><span>|</span><a href="#37825461">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37828064">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37824134">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37824134">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This article is not very good, notably, it is almost all guessing, no evidence.<p>An explanation that I would have found plausible: building stairs clockwise is cheaper somehow.</div><br/><div id="37826227" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37826227" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JdeBP</span><span>|</span><a href="#37824134">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37828064">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37826227">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37826227">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The irony is that you would have found the original proposition of the hypothesis, by Theodore Andrea Cook in 1903, to be <i>exactly the same thing</i>.

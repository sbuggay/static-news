Going through it feels <i>very</i> relaxing, and activates some very existential kind of creativity (not the &quot;solve the problem smarter thing), and fuels my energy a lot more than anything else in life. Being in this bored state is a precursor of feeling control over life again, and adjusting the inner compass to get updated directions to follow.<p>... but this doesn&#x27;t happen when being busy&#x2F;distracted, a state that <i>drains</i> my energy, and even accumulates dread every single day until the stressors are gone again and I feel &quot;bored&quot;.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40785980" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40785980" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hacker-l</span><span>|</span><a href="#40785684">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40785504">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40785980">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40785980">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This reminds me of a saying ...

By that I mean the feeling of being bored arises when the following conditions are true:<p>1. You don’t enjoy the thing you’re doing <i>for itself</i>, intrinsically<p>2. You can’t see how doing this thing now adds up to a greater purpose and long-term goal. This lack of a path leads to a loss of interest in the particular moment.<p>For #1, I really like what Japanese thought has to say about this. More specifically, Zen Buddhist-adjacent ideas like wabi sabi and the haiku poetry form. [1] They really help you center yourself on the moment and appreciate the impermanence of existence, which gets rid of that “wasted time” feeling.<p>#2 is more tricky and this problem is more endemic to modernity as a whole. I’m not sure what the solution is, other than to make long-term life plans and consistently fight off all of the cultural pressure to discard them and YOLO instead.<p>1. I wrote about wabi sabi and haiku on my (somewhat inactive) Substack last year, which you might find interesting:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onthearts.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;how-to-write-a-proper-haiku" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onthearts.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;how-to-write-a-proper-haiku</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onthearts.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;what-does-wabi-sabi-really-mean" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onthearts.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;what-does-wabi-sabi-really-mean</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40785851" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40785851" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mseepgood</span><span>|</span><a href="#40785189">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40784820">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40785851">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40785851">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If I ever get bored, it&#x27;s only in situations where I can&#x27;t easily leave to do what I want.

I got the first one probably 8 or 9 years ago but the others maybe 3 or 4 years ago.  The original one was made before iqair bought airvisual.  They all are working fine currently.<p>Also, for the indoor ones, you can set DND mode (I forget the exact name they use) and it&#x27;ll turn off the display during the night. Does have one downside I&#x27;ll cover in a sec though.<p>That said, until this year I always just used their website to view the data or the app. It worked.. ok. But their graphs were tiny and not very easy to use. So this year I started digging in deeper and set tried to connect things to grafana. The indoor units have a samba share where you can pull down data, but the issue is they only update that data every 5-15 minutes (15 when its in DND mode).<p>The outdoor unit does NOT have a samba share.  You need to use their API for that.  Now this is where I&#x27;m really unhappy and eventually looking at AirGradient or some other option. In order to get api access to my data on the outdoor unit I either need to pay (a lot, I forget how much) for api access, or I can get free api access if I allow iqair to sell my data to everyone else.<p>.. not interested in that<p>So I&#x27;m currently only getting data from my indoor units and only getting every ~5-15 min data points.. but they are working.  I did invest a lot in these devices so  not ready to upgrade to anything different just yet, but every time I see one of these air quality topics pop up here on HN it really makes me want to change.</div><br/><div id="41280839" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41280839" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">strogonoff</span><span>|</span><a href="#41280198">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41280263">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41280005">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41280839">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41280839">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I am sure the sensor is fine and the weird USB port can be fixed (though it looked like they do not make it easy to disassemble the body).

Radon sensors are hard to find.<p>In general from easiest to hardest:<p>- Temperature, humidity, pressure: many cheap, small and accurate sensors available.<p>- Particulate matter: many options as well though if you want good accuracy and silent fans you need to pay more.<p>- CO2: most sensors are actually just measuring other stuff (TVOC) and guessing CO2 concentration from that. You can get good true CO2 sensors from eg. Sensirion for $30+.<p>- VOC, CO, NO, O3 and other gasses: hard to measure reliably. Most sensors are comparatively large (few small SMD MEMS types exist), are power hungry (basically a heater element) and give you a crude estimate as they react to bunch of different gasses and the output is a mix of their concentrations.<p>- Radon: basically impossible for hobbyist. If you know of any sensor module I can buy below $100 in unit quantities please share.<p>Edit: I know airgradient are not hobbyists and they probably could get some radon sensors but it is still harder than for large companies. Their product definitely has the DIY vibe (but high quality) and I really like that it is easy to recreate and source all parts for it yourself, except the custom injection mold case.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41280683" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41280683" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stephenitis</span><span>|</span><a href="#41280675">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41280830">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41280461">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41280683">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41280683">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree, I&#x27;d like to go with air gradient but i need a radon sensor</div><br/><div id="41280717" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41280717" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">madspindel</span><span>|</span><a href="#41280675">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41280683">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41280461">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41280717">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41280717">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aranet.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;home&#x2F;products&#x2F;aranet-radon-sensor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aranet.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;home&#x2F;products&#x2F;aranet-radon-sensor</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41280461" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41280461" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nov21b</span><span>|</span><a href="#41280675">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41280017">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41280461">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41280461">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have the Airthings Wave+ and one thing that bugs me is the relative humidity threshold.

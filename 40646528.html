If you end up repeating a position, you know the turn player will repeat the same move as before. By iterating over every possible move and every possible response, you can calculate the expected value of a position. Writing out the equations where V(s, i, j) is the expected value of the position when turn player will attempt move i and the opposing player will attempt move j:<p><pre><code>  V(s) = max i (min j V(s, i, j))
  V(s, i, j) = (probability move i or move j changes the state) * V(new state) + (probability state doesn&#x27;t change) * V(s, i, j)

It makes presenting percentages a bit ugly (the nice 5%-intervals obviously look better) so I would not recommend it for the digital game, but I think 6-sided dice could be used to make more readable physical tiles (printing the ranges for happy and sad, together with numbers of smileys equal to the number of positive and negative outcomes, to make tiles easily readable from all directions at a glance; I do not think there is a need to spell out the neutral outcomes).</div><br/><div id="40677968" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40677968" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">igpay</span><span>|</span><a href="#40675312">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40677909">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40677976">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40675464">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40677968">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40677968">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The D20 was the first die shape I tried and I ended up just sticking with it.

This means both players have full access to all information, and that implies there must be a single &quot;best&quot; move. If the board is at a certain state and one player is to play next, the strategy of the opponent is irrelevant for determining the optimal move.<p>Proof:<p>Suppose that it is possible that different strategies exist that outperform each other. Lets consider the case that there are three &quot;optimal&quot; strategies that counter each other, call them Rock Paper and Scissors. Since these are the three &quot;optimal&quot; strategies, both players know the exact move produced by these strategies. The first important part to note is that there is no cost to changing strategy during the game. If an opponent has one fixed strategy, say Rock, the &quot;optimal&quot; strategy is to change your strategy to Paper. Since you have full information on the state of the board, you do not have to guess the strategy of the opponent, because there is no hidden information. Now you could consider the opponent strategy to be hidden information, but this doesn&#x27;t hold for the following reason: If knowing the opponent strategy would alter your choice of move (by for example changing to Rock that specifically counters his hidden Scissors), the opponent can freely change to Paper after you made your move, because he can see that you changed to Rock before making his next move. If it was impossible for the opponent to tell that you changed your strategy, that implies that each strategy produces the same board state, and that implies the strategies are identical.</div><br/><div id="40675550" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40675550" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blharr</span><span>|</span><a href="#40673469">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40675302">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40674371">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40675550">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40675550">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Aren&#x27;t the same conditions true for chess, though there is no proof that a best strategy exists?<p>What if it&#x27;s not just rock&#x2F;paper&#x2F;scissors, and there are more than 3 strategies?</div><br/><div id="40675950" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40675950" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Ruphin</span><span>|</span><a href="#40673469">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40675550">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40675728">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40675950">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40675950">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is no fundamental difference between Chess and Tic-Tac-Toe other than the computational complexity.

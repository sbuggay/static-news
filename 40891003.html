Latin also used very frequently the word &quot;non-null&quot;, with the meaning &quot;one or more&quot;. Latin had a few more other words that could be used to express the quantity &quot;zero&quot;. The same was true for Ancient Greek and for the languages for which even older records exist.<p>What the parent article intends to discuss is the invention of a purely positional system for writing numbers. Before the invention of such a system for writing numbers, the words meaning &quot;zero&quot; were used in all languages only for the unique quantity &quot;zero&quot;. They were not used as components of the numerals used to name bigger numbers.<p>The necessity to write very big numbers for accounting or computational purposes has made desirable the invention of a system that would be less cumbersome for such big numbers than the system used for the spoken numerals.<p>That was the positional number system, where a small set of symbols is sufficient to write even very big numbers. Any purely positional number system needs some kind of symbol for zero, which must be usable in any position.<p>When the sexagesimal Mesopotamian number system began to be used positionally, a symbol for &quot;zero&quot; had to be added. So nobody thought directly about a &quot;zero&quot; symbol. They just wanted to reuse the same symbols in all positions, and sooner or later someone understood that adding a symbol for &quot;zero&quot; is the solution to this problem.</div><br/><div id="40913517" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40913517" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Someone</span><span>|</span><a href="#40903856">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40906041">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40913517">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40913517">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; All languages have had words for &quot;zero&quot;, for at least a few thousand years<p>&gt; What the parent article intends to discuss is the invention of a purely positional system for writing numbers<p>I don’t see how <i>positional</i> is required there.

Like any cardinal numeral, it could be used to answer questions about how many things are in a certain place.<p>So it was really the number &quot;zero&quot;.<p>For the empty set, the most appropriate Latin word was the noun &quot;nihil&quot; (&quot;nothing&quot;), sometimes contracted to &quot;nil&quot; (with long &quot;i&quot;) hence the NIL of LISP for the empty list.<p>So the concepts of &quot;zero&quot; and &quot;empty set&quot; were distinguished in Latin and also in the other known ancient languages.<p>Some modern programming languages use &quot;null&quot; in a wrong way, when they should have stuck to the NIL of LISP. A null integer or floating-point number denotes the quantity &quot;zero&quot;, but a null pointer is not a quantity. A null pointer points to nothing, so it denotes the object NIL.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40908853" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40908853" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dayjaby</span><span>|</span><a href="#40903856">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40906041">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40913437">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40913153">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40908853">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40908853">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In German, it&#x27;s the same.

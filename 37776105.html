But I think it&#x27;s interesting to remember how slow that took. The iPhone was released in 2007, but the real winners of mobile were launched years later -- Uber (2010), Snapchat (2011), and TikTok (2016) -- and those winners took several more years to even start to gain true traction in the market.<p>I don&#x27;t think a lot of people back in 2007 could have predicted that the biggest thing to come from mobile would be an app that let teens remix music videos and share with their friends.<p>This is why I think it is a little pointless to try and create mental models for what products and features to build to capitalize on AI (though it can be fun). It&#x27;s so early that we&#x27;re not capable of understanding what&#x27;s possible yet. If anything, we&#x27;re probably at the viral &quot;fart app&quot; stage that mobile was in for its first few years.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37776353" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37776353" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gpt5</span><span>|</span><a href="#37776348">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37776361">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37776353">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37776353">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One striking realization from the AI revolution is that what appears as a technological advantage might in fact become a disadvantage. Consider companies that have invested heavily in building a technological edge. Google Translate, for instance, faces challenges as a simple prompt can overshadow its billion-dollar product. Similarly, Grammarly&#x27;s competitive edge may now rely more on its momentum and user interface than on its underlying tech. As ChatGPT introduces new capabilities, countless products see their technological edge vanish. To illustrate, the introduction of the image input feature means that, with a single prompt, it could serve as a top-tier school homework assistant, a photo-based calorie counter, and a plant identifier all at once.<p>This dynamic raised into question the viability of ML research as a core business strategy. Take Midjourney, for example. They&#x27;ve made significant strides and achieved dominance with their advanced text-to-image generation technology. But if a product like DALL-E 3, or its successors, could render their entire offering redundant in a few short years, than it&#x27;s a tricky path for a company to take.<p>To me, this suggests that the actual &quot;new strategy in the age of AI&quot; is that tech companies need to transition from relying on their tech edge as their competitive advantages, to relying more on more stable moats. For example, the network effects rooted in two-sided marketplaces. It also hints that tech giants like Google, who above all relied on their tech advantage, could face existential challenges in the coming decade. A sort of a win-or-die situation. While companies like Amazon might be in a more stable ground for now.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37776361" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37776361" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">loondri</span><span>|</span><a href="#37776353">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37776211">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37776361">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37776361">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This article praises AI for improving products, but what about the jobs it might take over, like customer service roles?<p>And can AI truly understand human emotions to handle sensitive customer issues or create artwork that resonates with people on a deeper level?

And the answer is, if you’re just making API calls, nothing. Sorry. There’s nothing stopping Jian Yang from creating newpipeline.ai in a weekend.
Here’s a couple of things which could set you apart off the top of my head.<p>Customers. Having customers is an advantage over the next guy who doesn’t, because now you can start customizing your product for unique needs rather than having a generic crud app.<p>Custom models. A custom model means some kid can’t just replicate your app easily.<p>Unique data. Data which is infeasible for another company to acquire or replicate.<p>Special people. People who will give your startup an edge in creating all of the above.</div><br/><div id="37776356" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37776356" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">inductive_magic</span><span>|</span><a href="#37776274">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37776356">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37776356">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;There’s nothing stopping Jian Yang from creating newpipeline.ai<p>After leading a product team which &quot;only calls apis&quot; in this context: this is a <i>very</i> premature take.

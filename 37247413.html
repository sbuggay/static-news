Not everyone has a family they can lean on for support, and we tend to lose friends as we get older rather than make new ones. So, yes, of course people will resort to eliciting support from the internet, and when it works even once people will start to learn and game the dynamics. Framing it in these terms may make it sound malicious and disingenuous, but it needn&#x27;t be either. Given functional kinship bonds, humans are generally good at eliciting support from the people around them and learning what needs to be done to get the support we need. This is just a generalization to strangers.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that there aren&#x27;t disingenuous people lying to game these mechanics, of course there are. But for the sake of those that aren&#x27;t, maybe let&#x27;s leave them be and not raze to the ground what&#x27;s emerged as a stand-in for actual social support and strong kinship ties?</div><br/><div id="37280169" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37280169" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">username332211</span><span>|</span><a href="#37279691">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37280058">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37280169">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37280169">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; But for the sake of those that aren&#x27;t, maybe let&#x27;s leave them be and not raze to the ground what&#x27;s emerged as a stand-in for actual social support and strong kinship ties?<p>Who is that &quot;we&quot; that could raze social media pity to the ground? In places infested by fake beggars we don&#x27;t hold council meetings where we decide to stop giving them money.<p>When I see that my compassion is being taken advantage of, I become less compassionate.

No pity for individual situations. I absolutely cannot and will not trust someone&#x27;s claims and I absolutely cannot judge their worthiness for charity.<p>I give generously to charitable organizations that do the most good. This is my religious obligation, and it&#x27;s also the best way to maximize my bucks. Any suitably large charitable organization will have policies and guidelines for determining who is in need, and how much they deserve. It&#x27;s simply a matter of trusting that they know how to vet people&#x27;s needs, and how to distribute aid most effectively in the region that they serve.<p>I have seen it myself first-hand. I volunteered for a charity that serves the poor, and right in the middle of downtown. It was my job to interview people to find out their immediate needs: socks, bag lunch, shower, bus ticket. And we had intricate and firm rules for how much they could get, and how often they could get it. Some people even received a bicycle, if their needs could be matched with its availability. But obviously, we only had so much to give, and needy people are, unfortunately, experts at squeezing free stuff out of everyone they could. So, we had rate limits and daily&#x2F;weekly limits on everything. No bus passes without proof of need; that sort of stuff.<p>So it&#x27;s the same with all the other charities I support, and they are often organizations I&#x27;ve worked with directly, and I know their reputation for service, and I trust their ability to manage money that I give them.

This is such an original take. I think it&#x27;s utterly fascinating and borderline genius - no joke - to tie this alleged impulse for pity&#x2F;sympathy to the abandonment of family bonds in western culture. <i>That abandonment</i> is what allows individuals to pursue all these artistic and footloose paths without having to care for their elders, but it&#x27;s also what alienates them from a framework of people who would care about what they do.<p>In my experience, so much of what you do for kinship is based on <i>guilt</i>, that I find it hard to trust that my kin actually care for anything <i>I</i> ever did. (This could just be because I&#x27;m Jewish, but go with me here for a second). My first and last fans have always been my brother and my mom, since I was 12 years old strumming a guitar, all the way through sort-of-rock touring status with a few hundred people per show, up til I&#x27;m no longer playing music but for late night solo demos to a few people. One has to ask: Are my kin only kind to my efforts out of some sense of mutual support rooted in guilt if they don&#x27;t respond?<p>I think that question kind of answers itself.<p>So then, what about people who <i>don&#x27;t</i> have anyone who they can email music to at 3am who has to pretend to like it? What becomes of those people?<p>It all jives. I think you nailed it. The public pity party is directly related to lacking a family who&#x27;ll bullshit and pacify you for your own good.</div><br/><div id="37280076" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37280076" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">danmaz74</span><span>|</span><a href="#37279691">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37280038">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37280139">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37280076">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37280076">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This might surprise you, but as a parent, I can tell you that seeing my daughter happy makes me happy.

Already the article is extremely light on details for this story, and the story itself doesn&#x27;t seem as important as the author&#x27;s segue into their point about &quot;sob stories&quot;; I read this as a trite example to vault to a larger point that I don&#x27;t think the author ever makes, but their opening sentence is quite revealing:<p>&gt; &quot;There are few behaviours considered more unflattering than actively seeking pity.&quot;<p>This premise is too much for me to accept without further elaboration from the author, as it introduces a lot of questions on this view point that I don&#x27;t think the article even tries to answer. The focus on how failure should be something we don&#x27;t show is very unusual, since there are so many fields where failures are part of the expected process, and you&#x27;re supposed to learn and discuss failures, not hide from them.<p>I can&#x27;t really get what the article is meaning to express except a general rant about &quot;sob stories&quot;, but the rest of the text just seems to go on regarding something about social media, and while I&#x27;m not quite sure what I&#x27;m supposed to understand from it, what I did understand was the author maybe just doesn&#x27;t like the format of discussion on social media and common habits on social media.<p>That is fine, I am not big on the social media format as well, and I just choose not to use it a ton as a result. So there is something about &#x27;sob stories&#x27; and social media we&#x27;re supposed to understand, but I&#x27;m not really sure what it is. Tying it to an artist that &quot;used their sob story to fill seats&quot; and implying that this was a scam with extremely light details is not convincing to me.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37279883" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37279883" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xboxnolifes</span><span>|</span><a href="#37278670">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37279398">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37279576">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37279426">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37279883">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37279883">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Fishing for compliments&#x2F;reassurance.

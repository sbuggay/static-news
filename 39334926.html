We work with bikes like these, covering them with sensors and loadcells (we&#x27;ve had something like 20 ARM processors on a bike at a time, communicating wirelessly), and while the bike is part of the equation most of the drag comes from the rider&#x27;s body. So a lot of effort also goes into comfort and fit, in order to get the rider into an aero position that they can hold for a period of time (the most aero position may not be possible to hold for very long) so it rapidly becomes an area-under-the-curve thing. We spend a lot of time in the lab, in wind tunnels and in velodromes sorting it all out (now with AI, vision systems, rider position tracking - it&#x27;s getting really complicated).<p>Also these bikes are not generally roadworthy - every so often we hear a multi-thousand-dollar &#x27;crack!&#x27; indicating another frame has had enough.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39342226" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39342226" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ideasphere</span><span>|</span><a href="#39342776">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39342480">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39342226">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39342226">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Trick question, all tri bikes look weird.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39342480" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39342480" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kazinator</span><span>|</span><a href="#39342226">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39335565">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39342480">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39342480">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">These frames have to be exceptionally well engineered and built not to be death traps.

The reason being because the more effort you spend on the bike the more gassed you are on the run coming up after.  (also see below there&#x27;s no pelotons in tris&#x2F;TT)<p>Because of the square law of wind resistance basically bike times haven&#x27;t gotten faster but run times have because riders are conserving more energy while riding at the same speed because of efficiencies in the bike designs.<p>Also you are never allowed to draft in triathlons and must maintain a certain distance behind the rider in front of you unless you are passing on the side unlike</div><br/></div></div><div id="39342125" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39342125" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scott_w</span><span>|</span><a href="#39335565">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39342733">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39342163">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39342125">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39342125">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To a point, weight is less of a concern in the modern era because aerodynamics dominate at almost all speeds.<p>I’ve always found NDD bikes interesting but I suspect the advantages are overstated given the top pros are moving away from them.

These aliens are doing 25-27mph, if you have the inevitable sway from the lack of the triangle, you&#x27;ll lose power to the drivetrain.<p>The Pros might get to piggyback on some of the wind tunnel testers here or there for reasonable amounts, and the &quot;NDD&quot; bikes might not really stack up much in the &quot;total system&quot; aero testing.<p>One might think that ultraskinny 18mm tires would be more aero, but 1) they have bad rolling resistance and 2) they actually aren&#x27;t, at least for a while the pro teams were using 25mm tires because aero testing said it was better + lower rolling resistance. Point is, aero is weird.<p>But I haven&#x27;t followed the state of the art of the last three or four years.<p>Finally, modern tri bikes shape themselves for onboard nutrition transport and integrated fluids, sometimes in the tubes. They also have storage boxes for the flat kit. Ironman triathletes care a lot about that.<p>The article makes it seem like these are all fresh off the design board, but these have been around for, what 5-7 years now? I was kind of hoping for more designs in the article, but these are basically what was the cutting edge back then. I would hope the 10,000$ price tags would have come down, but I doubt it.<p>And the other laughable thing is the wheels in those bikes. Where are the disc wheels? A disc wheel is often more important than the frame and helmet.<p>It&#x27;s funny. You spend 200$ for an aero helmet, that&#x27;s 1&#x2F;3 of the gain, another $2000 for aero wheels, that&#x27;s 1&#x2F;3 of the gain, and then 10,000$ for a frame, and that&#x27;s the last 1&#x2F;3 of the gain.<p>BTW.

A lot of these bikes have aspects that once were legal by UCI rules at some point (although not sure about the &quot;boom&quot; bikes with no seat tube, but bikes like that were made by trek in the 1990s).<p>The UCI is kind of like the Navy: there&#x27;s a right way to design a racing bike, a wrong way, and then there&#x27;s the UCI way. It has conservatism and history to be concerned about (bike racing is pretty old in Europe), keeping costs down for the lower run of even UCI pro teams (the female UCI teams can&#x27;t even field a TT bike for all their teammates in TTTs), and there are durability concerns so bikes don&#x27;t break and cause crashes in pelotons and the like, because there are already plenty of crashes.<p>Triathlon isn&#x27;t a big enough sport to have its own weird cogsets, wheel standards, etc, so they generally have to piggyback off what Shimano&#x2F;SRAM&#x2F;Campy make for the protour and general bike public.<p>Now, I will say that my P3C with a disc and a trispoke front looks like an amazingly awesome back back when I did serious triathlons.

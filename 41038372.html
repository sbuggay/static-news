If you’re a designer, or even if you’re just interested in design, you probably feel the need to be original, too.<p>I&#x27;ve been a professional designer since 2006, and I got over that thinking pretty quickly. A designer trying to be strikingly original is rarely acting in service of the design. If you want to be strikingly original, you probably want to be an artist instead of a designer. What a designer fundamentally does is communicate the best solution to a problem, given the requirements, goals, and constraints of that problem. Originality is subordinate to that at best.</div><br/><div id="41039697" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41039697" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">burningChrome</span><span>|</span><a href="#41039276">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41043907">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41039697">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41039697">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This.<p>I was a UI&#x2F;UX guy for about 5 years and worked for a company that pumped out thousands of sites a year. A bunch of their designs won awards and I saw their model and thought I could do that, it seemed easy.<p>The hitch was that I was going to design really cool sites, with all kinds of animations, huge text, have really cool navigation menus, etc. In short, I had a very romantic idea that I would dictate some incredible design to my clients. I thought I was like the Frank Lloyd Wright of design and whatever I showed people they would swoon and then go with whatever uber cool thing I showed them.<p>Reality set in with my first client. Same thing, they didn&#x27;t want cool shit, they just wanted their potential clients to find information about their work and contact them to hire them. After another 4-5 clients, I suddenly realized that web designers aren&#x27;t some artist creating ultra cool, ultra rare stuff that your clients must absolutely have like a Banksy piece, they have more fundamental problems they&#x27;re trying to solve and want you to solve them for them.<p>I got my ego checked in a hurry, but it was a good lesson to learn.

Before the digital age, people would go out to see touring DJs specifically for their collection of rare records that no one else had and you couldn&#x27;t hear anywhere else.

That approach is anathema to every other UI designer or UX person I encountered in that field. The core of UI design is 100% about clarity-- letting the user focus on exactly what they need to solve their problem. The core guiding principle of UX work is designing based on empirical research, and then iterating based on user testing... even if it doesn&#x27;t work out like that in practice, it&#x27;s still laser-focused on helping the user achieve what they need.<p>Did you transfer into the field from a non-web-design background? The people I&#x27;ve seen approach web design with the intent of making some sexy website that&#x27;s flashy for its own sake were a) front-end developers that thought the technical know-how was the hard part, b) branding and identity designers, or maybe print designers that never had to consider designs that people actually had to do stuff with, and c) small-org IT people that were sick of IT and were charged with maintaining the organization&#x27;s website so they figured it would be an easy switch.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41042001" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41042001" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DigiEggz</span><span>|</span><a href="#41039276">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41039697">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41042599">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41043907">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41042001">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41042001">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Do you have any examples of some &quot;cool&quot; sites that you designed, even prototypes?

While I was busy separating my shoulder patting myself on the back - we realized a few months in, the engagement was horrendous. The leads from their contact form dried up to almost nothing. Analytics showed an insane drop off from the home page. None of the internal pages were getting any traffic. We quickly realized that nobody could find any content on the site, they couldn&#x27;t get to the contact page very easily, the content was hard to find and or read because of the motion and animation that constantly took your focus off of what you, as a user, were trying to do.<p>We had up for four months before having to pull it and put up their old site, then re-design <i>another</i> simple, more refined site that would work better for their users. It was a great lesson to learn about solving problems or trying to create something cool that nobody could use.<p>We also designed a site for a local event to support a women&#x27;s shelter and used parallax again to tell a story of how women are shuffled through a system that does little to protect them from their ex-husbands or violent abusers.<p>It used the same techniques in this, where you had both horizontal and vertical scrolling in both directions to show a timeline and story with illustrations and infographics.

This worked out much better because if people were able to digest the story and the points you were trying to make, it had a better impact than new clients trying to find specific content and the contact page.<p>Hope that helps!</div><br/><div id="41043218" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41043218" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">carlmr</span><span>|</span><a href="#41039276">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41042562">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41043907">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41043218">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41043218">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;When parallax scrolling was cool and different, I designed an architecture site for a local architect using the effect.<p>A friend of mine designed such a site with his web design company.

I don&#x27;t recall whether Windows had been announced, or we were just concerned about it, but Steve was trying to convince Bill that having a &quot;Chinese wall between the Windows implementers and the Mac implementors wasn&#x27;t sufficient for us to work well together.

He said, &quot;It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t trust you, but my team doesn&#x27;t trust you. It&#x27;s kind of like if your brother was beating up on my brother, people wouldn&#x27;t say it was just your brother against my brother, they would say the Gates are fighting with the Jobs.&quot; Bill responded that &quot;No Steve, I think it&#x27;s more like we both had this rich neighbor named Xerox, and you went in to steal the TV, and found that somebody else had stolen it.

While patents are framed as protecting inventors, he wrote, that’s seldom how they’re used. Smart programmers working on hard problems tend to come up with the same solutions.<p>I find this happens in UI&#x2F;UX design too. When you&#x27;re trying to come with the best interface for a problem, there&#x27;s only so many directions that make sense once you&#x27;ve explored the design space and understood all the constraints.<p>With desktop and mobile interfaces for example, all operating systems and devices have converged on a lot of similar patterns and visuals. I don&#x27;t think this is because people are unoriginal, but given the constraints, there&#x27;s only so many decent options to pick from so many designers will  inevitably converge on the same solution.<p>&gt; I’m a designer. As a designer, I feel the need to be original.<p>I&#x27;ll often come up with a solution on my own after immersing myself in a problem for a while, then after looking at existing work more later, find it&#x27;s already been done.

My opinion at the time was that trends that weren&#x27;t thought out from a position of UX principles were an anti-pattern to follow. As I matured more as a designer, I now think nearly the opposite - not following trends is an anti-pattern, since that&#x27;s what your users will be used to.<p>Pull down to refresh is a great example of this. Not visible or discoverable at all, but was all the hype when Tweetie first released it. On paper it&#x27;s an anti-pattern, but now it&#x27;s so ingrained as a trend and pattern that it became expected, and is now muscle memory for many users.<p>The same goes with flat buttons - I used to be quite opposed to them since there was no visual elevation off the page designating it as a button. Now if you create a button with a bevel, users will think it&#x27;s an ad, not part of the page itself.<p>Copying leads to harmony in the wider ecosystem, and it creates a defined agreement on what things are are how they work.

Design is a lot about functionality and how information is organized visually. These two core design points can only be copied <i>if</i> the underlying project is exactly the same in terms of underlying information. But even for two blogs about different topics the question which information needs to be presented how would be different — even if both blogs were using the browser&#x27;s default CSS. This is the core of design.<p>Styling is finding colors, shapes proportions etc. All of this of course overlaps with the functional question and the question of organization of information — bigger buttons get more attention and all that — but ultimately you can slap more or less any style on any content.

writers, scraps of Holinshed, Lives by Plutarch, or excerpts 
from the Gesta Romanorum; that Handel copied out into his 
own works whole movements by Arne; that the Scherzo of Beethoven’s C minor Symphony begins by reproducing

One of my first ideological shifts happened when Napster was released. Bits flowing freely without being bounded by rules of the physical world deeply changed me and while later I do understand artists need to get paid and make a living, piracy and the pirating community is still very close to my heart. The amount of innovation which comes out of that space, is tremendous. The fact that zuckerberg could create trillions of dollar on free projects such as php and apache is not cherished enough.<p>I think we still haven&#x27;t found a proper economy for the digital world.

Creative industry is composed of both labor (artists) and capital (publishers). I file artists under labor because their valuable economic resource is time. They make money when people pay them to make art. Unauthorized copying <i>has harms</i>, but the primary effect is that artists have to expect to be paid money up-front, since the only way they get profit participation on the sale of copies is if there&#x27;s a strictly enforced set of laws to grant a monopoly on copying. That being said, money up-front is still a very common way for artists to get paid, so &quot;artists need to make a living&quot; is a half-truth.<p>Paying per-copy <i>and agreeing not to copy for some fixed period</i> is more consumer friendly than, say, everyone pooling their money into a giant one-and-done Kickstarter and just trusting that the end result will be good. If your work can be published serially, then something like Patreon <i>might</i> work, but that&#x27;s impractical for a lot of larger projects. The consumer unfriendliness manifests in the form of risk: who is out the money if something turns out to <i>suck</i>, or worse, doesn&#x27;t even get made. The traditional &quot;sell copies with a monopoly&quot; model means that if I don&#x27;t like a work, I just don&#x27;t buy it. We have reviews to inform people if a thing is good or not, but you can&#x27;t review a finished work based off the Kickstart campaign. This results in a market dominated by scams of varying degrees, customers who are hesitant to put money into campaigns that might not produce, and artists that can only really make the business model work if they have a lot of social capital and reputation to stake.<p>I mentioned fancy capitalist words like &quot;risk&quot; and &quot;market&quot;, so let&#x27;s talk about the capitalist side of the business: the publishers. Or &quot;managerial types&quot;, as it were. They do not make their money from selling the service of creating art, they make money from selling art that has already been made, which is capital. When Napster was telling people to stop paying for music and just steal it, the publishers shat their pants. An embarrassingly large part of the music business at the time was reissuing old acts on CD[0][1], and even new acts had to sell albums, which is why 90s listeners had to deal with a flood of albums with one good song and 10 terrible ones.<p>It&#x27;s specifically the capitalist side of the business that got screwed over the hardest by Napster. What screwed over artists was Spotify, which made music profitable again for the capitalists by turning it into a subscription. A music Boomer[2] accurately summed this up as a faucet pouring water straight into a drain. This is the best way to devalue artists, because it doesn&#x27;t matter what songs the artists make - just that the publishers control the flow of the songs.<p>The Spotify mentality has percolated into basically every other form of media over the last decade. It&#x27;s why you will own nothing and be &#x27;happy&#x27;, and why every publisher CEO has a boner for generative AI, even as their artists are screaming their heads off about being scraped. Publishers have nominally been stolen from as well, but they don&#x27;t care, because the theft is in their benefit[3]. It&#x27;s the exact opposite of the Napster situation. What matters is not what will benefit the artists, nor what the law says. What matters is what will make <i>them</i> richer.<p>[0] This is also why the SPARS code was a thing for a few years - to distinguish between new recordings made for CD and reissues riding the hype of digital music.<p>[1] Metallica <i>also</i> found themselves caught on the back foot, mainly because they found out Napster users were trading pre-release soundtracks they&#x27;d made. Their reaction made them look like suits for a while, because Metallica had gotten popular through unlicensed copying, though I don&#x27;t think this read was entirely fair.<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1bZ0OSEViyo?t=485" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1bZ0OSEViyo?t=485</a><p>[3] I don&#x27;t think generative AI will replace real artists, but it doesn&#x27;t matter so long as publishers believe it can.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41040001" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41040001" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">m3kw9</span><span>|</span><a href="#41038705">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41040001">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41040001">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You sorta want to use affordance, when Apple creates a new type of UI, it’s usually because the introduced new tech.

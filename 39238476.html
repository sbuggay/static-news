Think it might be fun to experiment with it a bit in vr, but I wonder if games are not more suitable then comics.

The productivity applications of the AVP are obviously not aimed at a single full screen terminal user like me. I stare out my office window often as I consider code. Clearly I’m not the target market for the AVP’s ability to run Keynote or whatever.<p>However truly native VR applications do excite me a lot, and I think that’s what the author is getting at too. When you take advantage of VR’s immersive capabilities in unique ways it gets a lot more exciting than just a virtual floating monitor.<p>The resolution comment and bugs do make me realize just how early this tech still is. VR seems as hard as the moon landing and we’re on like Apollo 10… maybe?</div><br/><div id="39248050" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39248050" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crooked-v</span><span>|</span><a href="#39247982">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39248050">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39248050">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The productivity applications of the AVP are obviously not aimed at a single full screen terminal user like me.<p>From initial playing around with mine, I would say the strength of the device (which the OS doesn&#x27;t completely lean into yet, but I would bet improvements are in the works for visionOS 2) is the &quot;spatial&quot; part, and I suspect that&#x27;s the whole reason for its emphasis in the marketing.<p>That is to say, imagine your terminal as a floating window, but you&#x27;ve also got other windows arranged around your home and office, not just clustered at a desk. Reminders floating near your fridge or break room, weather forecasts near the coatrack, calendar with upcoming events on a wall, Kindle or Books.app floating next to your couch...<p>Obviously it&#x27;s a really, really expensive device (and a somewhat uncomfortable one) just to do that kind of thing with, but if you cross your eyes and stare into the future I think you can see the path towards much more refined devices that fill the role of letting you have &quot;virtual stuff&quot; in the same way that you might hang a clock on your wall today.</div><br/><div id="39248642" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39248642" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hmottestad</span><span>|</span><a href="#39247982">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39248050">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39248088">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39248642">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39248642">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In the Wall Street Journal review, Joanna Stern managed to put two timers on top of two different pots while she was cooking with the headset on.

As a teenager, I noticed my mother being extremely difficult. Even more so now. My father is no walk in the park either. But I believe they have a deep rooted love from decades and went through every event and basically adult stage in life together.<p>I&#x27;m 38. I date in my age group. Which means both of us are dating people that have been sleeping with others for two decades. Each of us has been overseas with countless friends and exs. Many women have been engaged, some married, and we&#x27;ve all had our hearts broken. We&#x27;ve all gained a few lbs. My hair is starting to grey.<p>Can I find someone that enjoys being with me? Sure.<p>Can I find someone that doesn&#x27;t just say &quot;wtf am I doing here&quot; if times get tough for health or financial or just plain old age? I&#x27;m not sure.<p>I&#x27;ve heard many long time married old men say that when they look at their partner, they still see the beauty glimmering through that they saw at 19.<p>If I meet a partner at 40, when we start really getting old and annoyed, what am I going to hold on to? How lucky I am to be her 23rd partner?<p>I know this is a judgemental view, but I think it&#x27;s human nature.<p>Edit: for those that think this is just some personal issue, you should look up divorce stats by number of previous sexual partners. There is a clear rise in divorce rate per increase in partners, and at about 7 it&#x27;s 50%+.</div><br/><div id="36996645" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36996645" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ookblah</span><span>|</span><a href="#36991149">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36996746">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36996645">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36996645">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;How lucky I am to be her 23rd partner?&quot;<p>No offense, but think this honestly says a lot more about your own views and what your project on others than some kind of generalized statement.<p>I personally would view going through the wringer of life relationships as a good thing, and if I was 40+ and met someone who hadn&#x27;t experienced that in this day and page it&#x27;s probably more likely they had also had some social hang up that you just haven&#x27;t learned about.   This also isn&#x27;t to endorse the opposite of dating a person on their 5th divorce who&#x27;s out hooking up every week or something.<p>Anecdotally among those I know, whether someone had one vs. multiple partners had little bearing on the quality of their relationships. Those that had more, while they had their own issues related to that also had a more &quot;realistic&quot; view of sex and relationships IMO.<p>Some of them felt glad to &quot;get it out of their system&quot; so to speak.   If anything, those with just one partner maybe you could argue experienced something different (you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know), but they are still not immune to relationship issues.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36996746" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36996746" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bawolff</span><span>|</span><a href="#36991149">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36996645">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36997246">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36996746">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36996746">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I&#x27;ve heard many long time married old men say that when they look at their partner, they still see the beauty glimmering through that they saw at 19.<p>Presumably people who think their partner is now ugly either have enough sense to stfu or dont have a partner anymore.

Avoiding things like the silent treatment.</div><br/><div id="36996682" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36996682" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">drekipus</span><span>|</span><a href="#36991149">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36992704">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36992888">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36996682">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36996682">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I say that for every house plant that died in my care. &quot;You&#x27;re the special one, #237, it&#x27;s you and me bud.&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="36992888" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36992888" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">distant_hat</span><span>|</span><a href="#36991149">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36992704">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36996682">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36996735">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36992888">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36992888">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Knowing many women who had north of 50-100 partners, &#x27;extra special&#x27; certainly isn&#x27;t the case.

It’s not uncommon to come into contact with people in their late 20’s or early thirties that are still virgins (both genders).

How lucky I am to be her 23rd partner?<p>Why would you jump straight to that conclusion?<p>At 40, it is entirely possible for a prospective wife to have had at most ~3-5 partners in her lifetime. She would have been in long-term relationships for most of her adult life. Anyone with a history of long-term relationships is a pretty good bet that when trouble hits, they&#x27;ll be there for it.<p>23 partners behind anybody is a red flag, but these days a bigger red flag would be any kind of vague abuse story surfacing early on (same goes for prospective friends or employees). Anyone who starts new relationships with strangers by defaming the previous one is going to be trouble (never hire a whistleblower). You will also forever be kept in check through fear of inadvertent &quot;triggering&quot; of vague traumas from past vague abuses you&#x27;ll never fully understand, and when they leave they&#x27;ll shake you down while telling the next partner how abusive you were to them. I&#x27;d say this is a gen-z thing but the worst two cases I&#x27;ve seen were perpetrated by the 38-50 age group, and &#x2F;r&#x2F;divorce has no shortage of these sorts of histrionic scam artists.<p>For the same reason, I would also recommend coming to terms early on vis-a-vis porn. This was by far the single most cringeworthy post I&#x27;ve ever seen on Reddit (the OP deleted it, but the comments retain context):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Divorce&#x2F;comments&#x2F;15b79d6&#x2F;recording_a_woman_without_her_consent_from&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Divorce&#x2F;comments&#x2F;15b79d6&#x2F;recording_...</a><p>The OP comes in claiming she caught her husband taking upskirt videos of strangers at a music festival 8 years ago. Except what she describes isn&#x27;t an upskirt video by any interpretation, yet she continues to use all sorts of lurid language to frame him as a liar, a criminal, a porn-addicted sex addict, a sexual predator, and a voyeur-- and she was quick to change the story (then it became &quot;he secretly filmed <i>me</i> during sex&quot;) and insult anyone who challenged her narrative. If it applies to you, settle the porn question early on so you don&#x27;t have someone later trying to publicly humiliate you by litigating what you do on the toilet. (And for fuck&#x27;s sake never claim to be a sex addict to explain away porn use, much less document that by agreeing to <i>go to counseling for it</i>. Just own it then and there-- divorcing over porn makes <i>her</i> look petty, but divorcing because you&#x27;re a documented sex addict who bailed on therapy makes <i>you</i> look like a monster.)</div><br/><div id="36996085" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36996085" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nextaccountic</span><span>|</span><a href="#36991149">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36992920">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36996127">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36996085">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36996085">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So, what should abuse survivors do, never date again?</div><br/></div></div><div id="36996127" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36996127" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tbossanova</span><span>|</span><a href="#36991149">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36992920">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36996085">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36991285">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36996127">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36996127">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why is 23 partners a red flag?</div><br/><div id="36996292" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36996292" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dusted</span><span>|</span><a href="#36991149">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36996127">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36991285">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36996292">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36996292">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I won&#x27;t comment on some moral thing, having 23 partners can be entirely fine, but I think it depends on the intentionality..<p>Like, having 23 partners because, excuse my french &quot;Elle voulait simplement baiser à tout va&quot; is just fine (tm), they did what they want, and that tells nothing else about them that the fact they did what they enjoyed doing.<p>On the other hand, if they were looking for the one true love and thought they&#x27;d find it in 23 different people, it may reveal something else about them..<p>That they prefer a type of partner which does not align with their goal.<p>Or that they are a terrible judge of character.<p>Or that they are easily manipulated in general.<p>Those may be red flags in their own right, if those traits are undesirable to you.</div><br/><div id="36997218" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36997218" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Cthulhu_</span><span>|</span><a href="#36991149">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36996292">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36991285">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36997218">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36997218">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But you&#x27;re making assumptions about the intent already.

These scenes didn’t shock us when we first saw them. Of course there’s sex in a movie. Isn’t there always?<p>&gt; The answer, of course, is not anymore—at least not when it comes to modern blockbusters<p>&gt; We’re told that Tony Stark and Pepper Potts are an item, but no actual romantic or sexual chemistry between them is shown in the films. Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor utterly lack the sexual chemistry to convince us that either of them would be thirsty enough to commandeer a coma victim’s body (as they do in Wonder Woman 1984) so they can enjoy a posthumous hookup.

Why? One argument is the making of movies for export to China and India, with their censorship, encourages making a sort of internationally compliant pre-censored film.<p>But the argument doesn&#x27;t hinge on graphicness; you don&#x27;t have to be R-rated to imply sexual chemistry. It&#x27;s one of the things that &quot;pre-code&quot; 1930s movies were good at - and of course got slapped down by American &quot;voluntary&quot; censors for. You don&#x27;t have to _show_ anything to imply that two characters had sex offscreen, or even that they desire one another.<p>I would argue that something similar has happened to the Hays code slapdown. The 1980s movies were particularly &quot;objectifying&quot; in their treatment of sex. It was very much a time when female characters were often (not always!) only there for their bodies to be a reward for the male hero and the (male) audience.<p>(big exception for Sarah Connor in Terminator, of course)<p>So in the 21st century we&#x27;ve internalised that that was a bad, reductive way to handle sexual relations.

After all so much of the money comes from toy sales).<p>i think a more fair historical comparison would be original star wars trilogy to current marvel movies.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36996982" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36996982" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">metaphor</span><span>|</span><a href="#36996196">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36996295">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36996705">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36996498">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36996982">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36996982">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To be sure, the PG-13 rating[1] wasn&#x27;t introduced until shortly after the 1984 film[2] was released.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system#Addition_of_the_PG-13_rating" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Motion_Picture_Association_fil...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ghostbusters" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ghostbusters</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36996498" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36996498" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rlayton2</span><span>|</span><a href="#36996196">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36996295">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36996982">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36996802">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36996498">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36996498">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And Terminator was M (in Australia), which means &quot;recommended&quot; for 15 years and older, but not restricted.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36996802" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36996802" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">darkclouds</span><span>|</span><a href="#36996196">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36996295">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36997147">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36996802">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36996802">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Of course there’s sex in a movie.

BMI tends to make your population look healthier than it really is, whereas most people who say BMI is flawed are making the opposite argument.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36996831" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36996831" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lmm</span><span>|</span><a href="#36990688">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36995794">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36996812">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36992720">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36996831">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36996831">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I think due to its generalized nature there are exceptions where it doesn&#x27;t even apply (like people who are weight training, pregnant women etc).<p>All models are false, some are useful. BMI is imperfect, but arguing we should ignore it because it has exceptions is like arguing we should ignore that the Earth is round because it isn&#x27;t perfectly spherical. Looking at BMI alone is occasionally misleading, but it&#x27;s a hell of a lot better than not looking at anything, which is the realistic alternative.<p>&gt; So maybe it is the best that institutions can do to gauge the health of a population with the data given, but I think it could be improved drastically with extra metrics (I&#x27;ve heard of measurements around the body being used).<p>No-one has identified any such drastic improvements. Measuring body fat percentage gives you a small improvement over BMI alone, but it&#x27;s hard to do at home and only really matters for people with very high muscle mass (who are most likely already using more advanced measurements than BMI alone).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36992720" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36992720" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nonameiguess</span><span>|</span><a href="#36990688">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36992634">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36995794">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36991242">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36992720">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36992720">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This needs to become more widely known.

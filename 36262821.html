Now, you can simply join almost any online community using baseline skills that an enormous fraction of Earth&#x27;s population already has.<p>Artificially constructing a similar level of friction&#x2F;gatekeeping would have major downsides that might not be worth it, but it could theoretically achieve a community that behaves as that past one did, if that&#x27;s the goal. Sort of a CAPTCHA to prove you&#x27;re not just a human, but a leet one. As others have said, HN achieves this in a way. Perhaps non-tech communities can do a similar thing.

Before EHLO and reverse lookups and server identification and SPF and DKIM and DMARC and spam filters and universal skepticism, email was simple to spoof.<p>Now, the readers of USENET at the time were also pretty savvy, and there were other noneditable headers attached to your message that might betray your malfeasance. If you were posting to a newsgroup that didn&#x27;t permit such activity (there were some that encouraged&#x2F;required it!), you might earn an angry email sent to your news administrator, who was generally connected to the authority structure (university or employer) and had little patience for your juvenile behaviour.<p>It worked <i>really well</i>.<p>...until it didn&#x27;t!

Either way, it gets scrubbed immediately, for secrecy. Essentially, it&#x27;s just to let listserv moderators send to a list without having to spend time using the queue for their own messages, or automation of any sort such as custom smtp client apps.</div><br/><div id="36268234" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36268234" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">quesera</span><span>|</span><a href="#36263261">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36267955">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36268097">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36268234">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36268234">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ah, I&#x27;d forgotten about the similarity to Mailman&#x27;s moderation. Right, that works because there&#x27;s a centralized approval gateway (the mailman code on the mail server) which can also strip out the secret before distributing the message to the list members.<p>Since NetNews had no central authority, every news server had to judge the validity of posts for themselves. And obviously they couldn&#x27;t all know the moderator secret without it leaking immediately. Nowadays we&#x27;d have a moderator cryptographically sign the message contents. Actually this should have been possible back then too (RSA in 1977 plus a public key published in the newsgroup definition which already held the moderator email address?), but it was not used.<p>Newsreaders did not show the Approved header. People often stuck fun or funny stuff in there, like easter eggs for those who knew to look.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36268097" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36268097" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">forgetfreeman</span><span>|</span><a href="#36263261">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36266422">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36266592">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36264286">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36268097">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36268097">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Man you&#x27;re asking a lot here.

They could choose which newsgroups to provide access to as part of their USENET access service.<p>2. USENET or a modern-day like-service as a separate billable item would not necessarily be subject to the same common carrier provisions that broadband service providers were subject to when they were regulated under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act.<p>3. This rule was also repealed under the Trump administration and broadband service providers are once again regulated under Title I, which is to say they are not classified as common carriers. Even if it hadn’t been or if they were to be reclassified under Title II, see point 2. I did try to see if this did change under the Biden administration but I have not heard of such a change nor could I find one.<p>4. ISPs previously did not have the same incentive structure, and were dealing with a different market <i>and</i> legal environment prior to 2002. The truth is, USENET at the scale of Reddit could not exist without good moderation. It would be untenable for all the reasons unmoderated forums are untenable, and also too unappealing to develop a Reddit-sized mass. The mods, for all the issues with Reddit’s mod community, are what make Reddit possible to continue to exist. You would need similar for any Internet social forum of a similar size, scope and user base and if that’s not the goal, plenty of niche forums already exist that you don’t need to get through your ISP.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m billed monthly for internet access and have had this arrangement with multiple companies over the last 30 years. That bill used to include a ISP email account and usenet access. Now it doesn&#x27;t.<p>Perhaps you misunderstood me. I don’t have an issue with the billing arrangements I have with my ISP. I have an issue with the idea of getting billed for non-internet access services (read: content) through my ISP as a means of paying for them. In an age of pervasive payment tech <i>like</i> Apple Pay, I want a direct billing relationship with my service providers, not a stack of line items on my internet bill. Put another way, I’m saying it is simply an unappealing arrangement when there are superior alternatives.<p>I do still have the ISP-provided email address though, completely unused for the last 15 years and if they ever billed me separately for it, it would be terminated instantly.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36265556" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36265556" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throw0101b</span><span>|</span><a href="#36263261">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36264580">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36265075">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36265183">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36265556">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36265556">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>The costs of transporting Usenet weren&#x27;t zero</i> […]<p>How expensive was Usenet if you took out storage&#x2F;bandwidth for alt.binaries.*?</div><br/><div id="36266063" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36266063" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dsr_</span><span>|</span><a href="#36263261">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36265556">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36266045">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36266063">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36266063">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Cheap.<p>I mean, expensive by the standards of 1994, but -- inevitable comparison inbound -- a Raspberry Pi 4 has more CPU, more IOPS, more storage, and more RAM than many a 1994 small-ISP Usenet server.

I remember a system called STUMP though I don&#x27;t remember what it stood for.  Basically posts had to be approved by moderators using PGP signatures, and I think there might have been a CA-like scheme for moderators to delegate moderation authority.  It seemed well designed and generalizeable, but it was near the tail end of Usenet&#x27;s heyday, so it didn&#x27;t catch on much.<p>Added: to expand, Usenet was and is mostly unmoderated.  There were a few groups that wanted or needed moderation, and for those, workable methods came into existence.<p>Mostly, anonymity is good: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wakaba.c3.cx&#x2F;shii&#x2F;shiichan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wakaba.c3.cx&#x2F;shii&#x2F;shiichan</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36263443" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36263443" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dragontamer</span><span>|</span><a href="#36263261">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36267157">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36265979">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36263443">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36263443">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Except Reddit moderators deal with these spam issues all the time.<p>Hacker News is run by herculean efforts by the moderation team here, and I appreciate it. I&#x27;m ignorant of what their tools are, but I don&#x27;t think that scales either. Its good for our community, but Hacker News will never be Reddit or Twitter scale.<p>Reddit&#x27;s model is that moderators basically complain to the Admins that tools are insufficient, then admins mostly ignore those complaints. Moderators write bots that automatically surf traffic and try to automate... then the Admins come back and increase the price of API-access by 1000%, and then change the API and overall become hostile to this behavior. This cannot work either.<p>----------<p>At least in Usenet days, we could run our own programs in an open source model for these moderation issues.<p>I don&#x27;t think Usenet would work. We need a way to rewind time (Usenet: once you post or once something passes moderation, it is forever more sent to everyone else&#x27;s inbox). USENET was POP model, to put into email terms... while Reddit is IMAP&#x2F;JMAP model, where the true state of the information is centralized to the server.<p>So yes, I agree with you that USENET will fail today. But the nuances of why it will fail are important to understand.<p>In particular: Reddit was never very good about these moderation issues. But with enough work and grit, the community came together anyway. That&#x27;s good enough. I expect that USENET&#x27;s moderation model is sufficient, albeit decades old. Its all the other USENET crap that won&#x27;t work today (being a &quot;POP&quot;-like message distribution platform without any &quot;takebacks&quot;, so no editing posts, no deleting porn that got past the spam filter, etc. etc.)<p>----------<p>Or maybe... USENET works with regards to API access. The *ARCHIVE* (ie: Google Groups, or Deja News if you&#x27;re old enough to remember that) is where takebacks &#x2F; edits can live instead.<p>So maybe Usenet can work, but with changes to our workflow to be more akin to 2023-level of features. By separating concerns over USENET (ie: how messages are distributed among a decentralized list of servers), and &quot;The Archive&quot; (which needs to be run by a trusted set of administrators), and a system where moderators will have access to &quot;The Archive&quot; for their own moderation purposes, we can rebuild Reddit through USENET??<p>Hmmm... it could work.

Usenet servers act as common carriers but they are not legally common carriers (in my opinion) which means if I am right, the experiment will end as soon as someone decides to litigate against a server operator for passing on material that someone felt offended by. Not even copyright violations, just something they were offended by. For example, it is illegal to insult Ergodan (really) and while that law isn&#x27;t enforceable here, it was elsewhere until recently in places like Germany which still had laws on the books saying it wasn&#x27;t legal to insult foreign heads of state, etc. So it&#x27;s just a big litigious mess now.

Allowing unrelated moderators on one subreddit indirectly-help moderate on other subreddits.<p>Shared global identity across the network is key. We can&#x27;t have sockpuppets spamming one subreddit (or USENET group), and then have to be individually dealt with group-by-group. These sorts of moderation efforts must be shared.<p>Mastodon&#x27;s model is to have servers responsible for their users. I&#x27;m not convinced that this model scales well, especially into the future as servers grow less trusting of each other.<p>---------------<p>IMO, what is needed is a DNS-like solution for identities, and proving your identity. Not a real identity mind you, but a pseudo-anonymous identity that has enough trust that people know you&#x27;re not a spammer.<p>Yes, modern sockpuppets can pay a 3rd-world country to create innocuous accounts en masse and get around this, but we need to be at this level (or better). Without this level, we&#x27;re back to just automated account creation bots spamming our servers with spam.<p>----------------<p>This DNS-like identity management server needs moderation decisions to be shared. Not necessarily trusted mind you, but shared enough so that &quot;Moderators over in X-location believe this identity to be spam&quot;. Or &quot;Moderators over in Y-location believe this identity to be a troll&quot;.<p>EDIT: Other messages, like &quot;Starting on June 2023, it appears that X-identity has been compromised and is now a spammer. Ban messages after this. Starting in July 2023, it appears X-identity has regained control of their identifier and we can stop banning their messages.&quot; Lots of useful moderation messages that need to be shared.<p>Maybe its up to individual communities whether or not &quot;troll&quot; or &quot;spam&quot; classifications of identities (or if the moderators at Y-server should be trusted at all: maybe a hostile group of moderators start putting up fake complaints about masses of users that they don&#x27;t like). Etc. etc.<p>-----------------<p>But the overall goal is to create a mechanism where moderators are sharing effort and working together.

With as many people as there are on the internet now, it&#x27;s surpassed the ability of a handful of moderators anywhere to deal with. AI is too expensive and the first solutions are just going to involve everyone piping every comment, post and submission through OpenAI for free training anyway. At some level OpenAI will be perversely incentivized to hire spammers to drive business for themselves by pushing sites past free-tier usage.<p>Collateral damage may well be the solution to curtailing abuse in the future. For IPv4 for the most part, only individual users&#x27; IPs should be affected unless they&#x27;re part of a botnet, but when nobody can use any site because trolls have gotten entire telcos&#x27; IPv4 space banned, at some point the trolls are going to have to accept what their impact is and change their behavior because other trolls are impacting their own ability to enjoy anything. Socialize the abuse and crowdsource punishment (not normally my thing, but we&#x27;ve tried everything else). If you shit where you eat, expect shit in your next bite. When someone brags about pointless mischief, rather than being cheered on as some kind of rebel, they will get a lesson in socialization. They will be outed as the reason why nobody in their country can access 4chan anymore and be dealt with.<p>This doesn&#x27;t work while we exempt M247&#x27;s address space because &quot;normal&quot; users insist on using the same infrastructure as trolls and cybercriminals, exempt all of Tor because there might be a gay user in Iran who can&#x27;t keep their mouth shut, or refuse to block the IP of a problem user in the Philippines because it&#x27;s shared by everyone in Malaysia. Accommodating exceptional people (no sarcasm, in the kindest terms) has made things exceptionally insufferable for everyone else.<p>This will drive fragmentation. It is a good thing. If one person can get all of Malaysia banned from Reddit 2.0 or whatever, after everyone is denied for long enough it will drive creation of smaller, local communities instead of massive, centralized ones. This is what we want, right? The most dedicated troll would have to do actual <i>work</i> to find, infiltrate and harass every single offshoot community that develops as a result. The cost of trolling is now borne by the troll, not the responders. It also increases the cost and effort involved in surveillance. Right now, if you want to track anyone, start with a FAANG product and work outward.<p>Within a generation, we became afraid of punishing anybody for any reason, so small wonder the lunatics are running the asylum. The internet fucking sucks these days. It <i>feels</i> like a mental hospital-- sterile, boring, with crazies everywhere screaming all the time threatening to kill everyone or themselves.

Those who remember brought many lessons from those times, but something to consider is that the vast majority of the user-base of nowadays&#x27; services never had to deal with a fax modem, P2P connections, and nothing out of the &#x27;really basic&#x27;. A lot of the same people who are now calling to &#x27;decentralize&#x27; things uses a proprietary OS on their phone that probably listen to them and they do not care about it. They do care about their life online, about the void it would left in their lives if it was all over. Those users want comfort, babysitting, somebody to take care of spam and bad people from their line of sight.<p>Decentralized services will not work for the masses anymore simple because they learned to be in the comfort, and they will always prefer the service who offer the most of it. I really wish to be wrong, but i do not see this being possible on such decentralized services where people have to take care of themselves and actually learn a bit to use some services.<p>The solution for this issue is very complex, and would require a complete reeducation of those users for a new way of interacting online, in my opinion, or else it would be for nothing. The mess has been made already, backup everything and let it die. New services should still be created, but to cater to new users and people who actually knows the importance of this move, trying to recreate what already exists is a waste of time.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36263989" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36263989" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AmenBreak</span><span>|</span><a href="#36265680">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36263932">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36263989">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36263989">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Naaaah, Usenet still works great.

The biggest takeaway in my explorations is: you could probably never really get mass adoption of a Usenet-esque system these days. Oh well. Anyway:<p>I&#x27;d start with the basic idea that identities matter. For any given message, you should know what user posted it and from which server. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the user is Robert Smith posting from smith-family-server.net, or Leet Hakkerman posting on darkweb.io, every message should be signed by the author (&quot;the person who owns this public key wrote this) and counter-signed by the server (&quot;my user, who owns this public key, did indeed submit this message to me&quot;). Separating out individual identities (user&#x27;s key pair) from the server means you can switch to another server and say &quot;hey, it&#x27;s me, i&#x27;m over here now&quot; and it&#x27;s verifiable -- but of course requiring people to manage key pairs is a tall ask.<p>Once you&#x27;ve got that, you can start doing things like setting up <i>your</i> server to just drop any messages from a server you consider abusive, or configuring your newsreader to drop messages signed by a particular user. &quot;Nymshifting&quot; is still possible, but it takes the cooperation of a server owner to do it, and it means the server might find others unwilling to peer with it.<p>Ideally, as people proposed with Mastodon, servers should be small; the admin should never answer &quot;who??&quot; when you mention a user on their system. But like a lot of decentralization&#x2F;federation ideas (see Mastodon), these schemes fall apart quickly as soon as the usual thing happens: one server goes up which makes registration easy &amp; anonymous, thousands of users flock there, and everybody else has to decide if they want to drop the server which generates 50% of traffic on the network.<p>edit: part of the idea of making it look a lot like Usenet except that your servers are verifying signatures throughout is that you can just use regular existing newsreaders to read it. The servers might exchange messages in the &quot;native&quot; format via a slightly modified IHAVE command, but when a newsreader connects and asks for an article via the ARTICLE command, the server can parse &amp; rewrite the article to present it in RFC1036-compliant format.</div><br/><div id="36264055" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36264055" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Misdicorl</span><span>|</span><a href="#36263932">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36266952">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36264055">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36264055">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Could you solve&#x2F;mitigate it with curation? Let the users be anonymous or pseudo-anonymous and keep the server signing, but add another signing field called the curator.<p>At first blush the curation signer looks the same as the server, but I think its subtly different in a way that is maybe effective?<p>A) You can re-curate or multi-curate a message, but you should (probably) keep the source community constant<p>B) It separates moderation concerns from on-topic concerns which is a constant struggle. Easy for a server to host many different communities&#x2F;topics&#x2F;communication mores and import the content stream in different ways from different curators<p>Who does the curation? I guess its as simple as the upvote button, but perhaps you can improve that model substantially</div><br/></div></div><div id="36266952" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36266952" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">topspin</span><span>|</span><a href="#36263932">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36264055">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36266952">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36266952">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; given modern concerns (primarily spam and spoofing)<p>&quot;modern concerns&quot; go way past spam and spoofing.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

Isn&#x27;t it all just the meme of prestige?<p>I feel most comments here, certainly yours, have more thought and ideas behind them in a shorter format than a lot of important books.<p>Why is the behaviour of analyzing art, for all it&#x27;s endless self deconstructions, still limited by the museum space or the book&#x2F;movie&#x2F;game format and more importantly it&#x27;s social expectation to do so?<p>There&#x27;s a quote from a Netflix series called Sense8 that I love:<p>&quot;Art is like religion. For the believers, it&#x27;s everything. For anyone else, it&#x27;s just a pile of bullshit&quot;.</div><br/><div id="36938949" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36938949" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SamPatt</span><span>|</span><a href="#36935310">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36936872">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36940012">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36938949">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36938949">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Video games aren&#x27;t considered art yet (by most people) for a few reasons.<p>1.

Video games didn&#x27;t emerge from high society.<p>I think number 2 was valid for the longest. But all of them are slowly crumbling.

It&#x27;s cheating of course, but it is the fun sort of cheating. I always thought of it like being a monk or wizard, journeying forth armed with the hidden secrets of the world.<p>I never did beat the game, but My most memorable experience was once when I was messing around in wizard mode(a sort debug&#x2F;creative mode to try things out in) and summoned a high level demon for grins and giggles, which promptly killed me. I did not think much of it at the time. but nethack, when you die, writes a bones file with what you had on what level and what killed you. it normally lets you find what killed you and a chance to get your stuff back. But now my nethack install is tainted with Juiblex, the faceless evil, on dungeon level level 2. I probable could have fixed it but it made the game hilarious, every play through containing a mad dash through level 2 and fervent usually unanswered prayers that the infernal thing would not follow you to the next level.</div><br/><div id="36636894" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36636894" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">flyinghamster</span><span>|</span><a href="#36636630">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36637788">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36636894">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36636894">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In my opinion, source diving and using spoilers aren&#x27;t cheating, if only because the games are so thoroughly randomized.

I played Nethack locally, and save-scumming was the only way that I could make meaningful progress beyond the noob levels. Yeah, I knew all the spoilers by heart, I knew the secrets, I had access to the rumors and the Wiki, but I had some bad habits that led to YASD every time, such as hoarding everything in inventory, melee attacks when ranged would be better, not making much use of spells or magic, and I would often forget that I was carrying a particular item that would be perfect for a particular situation, so I&#x27;d die with it still unused.<p>So save-scumming was my solution. Sometimes I played in Wizard mode, but I enjoyed save-scumming immensely, and it allowed me to get quite far, especially to the Castle and drawbridge level, and even sometimes down to Gehennom.<p>I did reach the Astral Plane a few times, but I never actually ascended as far as I can recall, but frankly, after the Castle level, the game gets kind of boring and unfair for me. I never liked the Wizard&#x27;s harrassment as you climb back up the dungeon, level by level. Also all the curses really got me down. Save-scumming can really only take you so far if you&#x27;re not an expert at planning and execution too.<p>I quit playing Nethack entirely a few years ago. I have moral objections to worshipping false gods, even if it&#x27;s &quot;just a game&quot;. But I bow to the genius of the Developers Who Think of Everything, especially Ken Arromdee, who&#x27;s played the same MUDs&#x2F;MUCKs as me, and is also an occasional Wikipedia editor.</div><br/><div id="36638818" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36638818" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">runesofdoom</span><span>|</span><a href="#36638100">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36637011">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36638818">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36638818">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Curses can be addressed by:

4) knowing the remove curse spell
5) certain Artifacts and armor will reduce the effect of curses on your inventory
6) carrying a lot of lightweight junk as a curse &quot;buffer&quot; so that curses will have a lower chance of hitting something critical

(Also, omitting any mention of Free software is a little odd.) We do have a mix, but it&#x27;s neither the best nor the worst to be had. The proprietary mindset has infected the &quot;programmers with free time&quot; community, to the extent that one reason why you don&#x27;t see ambitious user-facing projects is because the profit motive has drained away enough energy and talent that the engine of open source development just kind of sputters along until things start to risk taking off, at which point someone will come up with an idea for monetization. And monetization kills the &quot;true&quot; open source spirit dead.<p>On a related note, pointing fingers at open source games for lackluster design and poor user centric thinking is a little ironic, given that <i>the exact same thing</i> ails today&#x27;s commercial game scene. Loot boxes and more subtle forms of the same thing have largely destroyed the freedom and original thinking that used to create interestingly novel experiences. We had a period where the indie scene carried that torch, but it has now been subverted in much the same way as the open source scene.<p>There are plenty of individuals or small groups out there who still have the fire, but it seems like getting any traction (whether by growing a community or gaining users&#x2F;players) brings those people in too close of contact with the poisonous influence of profit or fame or whatever, and it takes a strong character and quite a bit of privilege to resist those influences.

Anyway, as long as one has not enough money to live on passive income, time is money. So one has to somehow monetize on one&#x27;s one time and skill. This is not poisonous. Earning money is just a matter of life, because one needs money to live from (or someone else has to pay the bills).<p>I had a quite popular open source project about two decades ago. A lot of people used it (there were more than 300 people on the projects mailing list alone), and many of them also for commercial purposes. There was an option to donate to the project; but when I remember it correctly, I recieved only a single donation in all the years. However, I considered my open source work as a kind of quid pro quo for all the free software I use. But when the project ended, I had no motivation to invest any more time in another open source project, because I considered my &quot;debt&quot; repaid and moved on to other kinds of social engagement.</div><br/><div id="36639032" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36639032" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sfink</span><span>|</span><a href="#36637011">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36638677">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36638436">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36639032">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36639032">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Having been involved in at least some degree over that period, yes there is a large difference. Not a simple one; there are both good and bad differences. (I would guess that the raw amount of open source code produced today is rather larger, for example.)<p>&gt; So one has to somehow monetize on one&#x27;s one time and skill. This is not poisonous.<p>It is not poisonous in general. I get paid for programming, and don&#x27;t have a problem with others getting paid for programming. But the &quot;monetize all the things&quot; mindset is indeed poisonous to the original heart of the open source community, where people are motivated by the desire to share and are making decisions that are consciously aligned with growing the strength and health of this open source community.<p>They can coexist, but there is tension and cannibalization between them[1]. It&#x27;s more of an ecosystem. Two populations are living side by side with blurred edges between them. Some rate of defections from one to the other. An environment that encourages one and not the other can hugely alter the size and health of one of the populations, and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve seen happen: many aspects of the environment have shifted to encourage the profit-driven crowd, to the point where the share and share alike crowd are looking anemic. It&#x27;s not about one being good and the other bad, it&#x27;s more like an invasive species lowering biodiversity and making all of us worse off.<p>Think of it as value creation vs value capture, if that works better for you. My claim is that the community has swung too far in the value capture direction. Most work these days that looks like the older model is actually being funded by massive value-capturing organizations; they&#x27;re just capturing the value from somewhere else. I applaud such contributions, but don&#x27;t pretend that they&#x27;re passion projects of civic-minded individuals anymore.<p>I&#x27;m not going to look down on someone who works for money. It&#x27;s not a bad thing to do, and there are good reasons why they might even want to do things differently but cannot. It&#x27;s just that they&#x27;re not part of the particular community I care about, and I am interested in the health of <i>that</i> community.<p>[1] Ok, monetization generally cannibalizes open source and not the other way around.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36638436" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36638436" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">handwarmers</span><span>|</span><a href="#36637011">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36638677">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36641534">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36638436">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36638436">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The criticism of open source software the author presented is a lot more nuanced, and I for one agree with it.

I lived through that time. There were a lot of other things going on that paint a different picture. Not that the description is definitively wrong or anything, it&#x27;s just that it is very like the fable of the blind men and the elephant. It&#x27;s not wrong to say an elephant is like a rope, but it is incomplete to the point of being deceptive.<p>The odd rant about open source makes quite a tenuous leap to the meat of the article, which I enjoyed much more and didn&#x27;t have any particular issues with. &quot;An elephant is like a rope, now let&#x27;s talk about the fascinating physiology and ecology of the hippopotamus, a roughly elephant-shaped animal.&quot;<p>Ok, that&#x27;s unfair, the opening and the Rogue history are more related than that. But note that the latter is explicitly called out as an &quot;exception that proves the rule&quot; of the former. Yet &quot;most A are B, so now let&#x27;s look at a rare example of a not-B that is an A&quot; only supports the opening thesis insofar as you explain or at least make the point that `A &amp; not(B)` is uncommon and illustrate it with your example. Simply giving an example of where your argument doesn&#x27;t hold, well... it just undercuts the argument.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s not the author&#x27;s responsibility to write an article in a way that works for me. And I certainly don&#x27;t want something complete or wikipedia-like. It&#x27;s just... odd. It talks about how open source failed to live up to its expectations. That relies on an overly literal acceptance of those expectations, because in my mind it has vastly exceeded those expectations. People were indeed overenthusiastic, but even then not many were claiming it would take over everything.<p>Is a developer scratching their own itch a fundamentally flawed approach that will never produce software that takes its users&#x27; actual needs into account? I would argue that they are reasonably independent from each other. Someone scratching an itch may very well be able to maintain a coherent design, or something may start with itch-scratching but then attract the involvement of designer-architects, or the reverse: itch-scratchers may join in a more &quot;designed&quot; project once it starts to show promise and be useful enough to trigger its own itching. On a related note, the purist &quot;cathedral vs bazaar&quot; interpretation is largely a myth. The bazaar pretty much always evolves some level of organization, and cathedrals are staffed with people, people who are often motivated by itch-scratching no matter what the high priests ordain.<p>I am sympathetic to the argument that programmers tend to produce things to be consumed by other programmers. I am also sympathetic to the argument that once a program gets to the point where it is useful to other people, it has a strong tendency to get absorbed into an organization that makes it usable by a broader audience. Is that a failure of open source or a success? It depends where you draw the finish line.<p>Blender, Godot, Firefox, GNOME, WordPress, GnuCash... it&#x27;s not like there aren&#x27;t counterexamples out there.<p>And the plain fact that nearly <i>everything</i> is now built off of an open source base, and that base is steadily moving up the stack, makes me suspect the &quot;open source can never handle X&quot; argument has a limited shelf life.</div><br/><div id="36641816" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36641816" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ido</span><span>|</span><a href="#36637011">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36641742">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36637095">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36641816">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36641816">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree that the open source section was a bit strange and not really necessary for the article&#x27;s actual focus - when I read it I immediately thought this will create a completely avoidable flame-war.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36637095" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36637095" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dopu</span><span>|</span><a href="#36637011">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36634861">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36637095">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36637095">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Have been really enjoying Brogue lately.

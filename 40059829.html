In that case the employees can be taxed for having access to that canteen, even if they don’t eat there. This access is considered a taxable income.<p>I actually fail to see what is logical here. And I would go further by saying it is neither logical, nor fair.<p>First the basic point. Why should an employee be taxed for a service he is not making use of. That&#x27;s a government trying to get more tax income than what they are entitled to, hidden under the guise of simplification.  We are equal under the law, and therefore, theoretically, we are equal under taxes. It is irrelevant that someone has, or does not have access to such a canteen, if they are not making use of the facility, the net outcome is the same, and therefore, the taxation should be the same.<p>And then a point could be made about the relevancy of taxation in the canteen example. (Although it should not be forgotten that it was just a randomly quantified example for the sake of argument).  But let&#x27;s say that company A decides to provide a canteen, with food sold at cost price to its employees.  This turns out to be 20% cheaper than eating in a random other canteen &quot;at market price&quot; (i.e. charging you for cost price + company B profit).<p>Now you are actually taxing the fact that company A decided to make the effort to setup a canteen, hire cooks&#x2F;canteen employees, probably make a qualitative effort to offer better food, and not seek profit on the effort, when compared to company B, offering food at a higher price as it includes profit.<p>Congratulations, in a context of decreasing food quality offered by catering services world-wide, your taxation approach just further de-incentivized potential quality over taxation income.  Further fully disregarding the fact that to offer a catering service, company A had to make investments, is employing personnel, buying food, etc, and is, therefore, already contributing more to global tax revenues for the state.<p>Furthermore, you are also unfairly putting non-profit catering services at a disadvantage, as, they too will be taxed more, as they are also offering their food below &quot;market price&quot;. (Not too far-fetched, as such efforts are being set-up, with success, for school canteens, focusing on local, organic food, at operating cost-price)</div><br/></div></div><div id="40061474" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40061474" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kazinator</span><span>|</span><a href="#40060844">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40061188">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40062007">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40061270">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40061474">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40061474">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just because it happens in Sweden and you&#x27;re a Swede doesn&#x27;t have to make it logical to you.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40061270" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40061270" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mdekkers</span><span>|</span><a href="#40060844">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40061188">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40061474">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40060964">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40061270">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40061270">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; This access is considered a taxable income.<p>Sounds like this meets the definition of racketeering</div><br/><div id="40061904" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40061904" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tux3</span><span>|</span><a href="#40060844">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40061270">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40060964">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40061904">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40061904">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is no coercion or deception in this situation, so it can&#x27;t be racketeering.

You always get to pay sales taxes on the $25 amount.<p>If it is your employer giving you the pizza, there is a different story. I can&#x27;t tell you how it would work in USA, but I&#x27;ll tell you how it would work in Sweden. In a few cases, which include you being an employee of United Nations, you wouldn&#x27;t pay taxes on the pizza (hurray!). But if you don&#x27;t qualify for the exceptions, your employer would have to account for the $25 as if it were salary and tax it accordingly. Just for amusement purposes I&#x27;ve computed that for you: 33% in income tax, 31.4% in payroll tax, 20% in state tax if you earn over $4500&#x2F;month, and 12% in VAT (but that one your employer gets to zero in this particular example). The 31.4% is not subtracted from your payout but just paid by your employer (or yourself, if you are self-employed). All in all, you eat your free pizza worth $25 and your employer deducts from your salary $13.3 to pay in taxes, and in addition to that pays $8 in payroll taxes. That gives the tax office a neat $21 for that $25 pizza you ate for &quot;free&quot;. Your employer also has to pay for the pizza, of course, but they can deduce whatever VAT was in its price.</div><br/><div id="40061462" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40061462" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kazinator</span><span>|</span><a href="#40060877">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40061135">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40061109">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40061462">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40061462">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>You always get to pay sales taxes on the $25 amount.</i><p>But that $12.5 per pizza is below market value, so you got a gift, which is income.</div><br/><div id="40061869" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40061869" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">robertlagrant</span><span>|</span><a href="#40060877">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40061462">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40061109">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40061869">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40061869">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s not below market value if the market sells you it for that amount.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40061109" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40061109" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">snotrockets</span><span>|</span><a href="#40060877">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40061135">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40061081">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40061109">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40061109">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That is considered a sales discount (you wouldn’t get a free pizza without buying another one), and as such not taxable.

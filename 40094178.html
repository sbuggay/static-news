    Indeed, Panovska found that the average production rate of beryllium-10 during the Laschamps excursion was two times higher than present-day production, implying very low magnetic field intensity and lots of cosmic rays reaching Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.
</code></pre>
Specifically, I&#x27;d guess, that twice as many cosmic rays reached the surface, at that location, than the mean present day average that reach the surface. *<p>The location hedging is due to:<p><pre><code>    magnetic field excursions, brief periods in which the intensity of the magnetic field wanes and the dipole (or two magnetic poles) that we&#x27;re familiar with can disappear, replaced with multiple magnetic poles. The Laschamps excursion that occurred around 41,000 years ago is among the best studied. It features a low magnetic field intensity that implies less protection for Earth&#x27;s surface from harmful space rays.

So the magnetic sheilding in the upper atmosphere and further out &quot;in space&quot; had &#x27;holes&#x27; and was not like the &#x27;modern&#x27; IGRF.<p>The Earth still had a denser lower atmosphere, though, which also provides protection from cosmic rays - geophysical air surveys for ground radiometrics have to calibrate for cosmic rays by running &quot;stacks&quot; .. survey lines high up in the air and prgressivel closer to the ground in order to estimate the cosmic falloff with atmospheric density for the duration of the ground survey.<p>* &quot;twice as many* is also a hand wave, cosmic ray energy has a spectrum and the changed geomag field would bend the pass through spectrum and likely allowed more high energy gamma&#x27;s through .. the end result was the doubling of the creation of a proxy indicator.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40095407" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40095407" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">euroderf</span><span>|</span><a href="#40094594">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40094682">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40095407">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40095407">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In the 60s I read a (crackpot?) theory that the Old Testament was not kidding when it says people lived hundreds of years, and that a sudden influx of cosmic rays could explain a nexus of Biblical events - the dispersion of a persistent global cloud cover that had existed until then, the rain &amp; flooding event that Noah rode out, and the subsequent reduction (thanks for nothin&#x27;, cosmic rays) in human lifetimes.</div><br/><div id="40095784" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40095784" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">beAbU</span><span>|</span><a href="#40095407">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40095626">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40095784">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40095784">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The OT is 1000s of years of pre-Christian history that was mostly told by word of mouth, all captured on parchment 1000s of years after it happened. Then it was all selectively collected and copy edited into a single volume another 1300 years after the period of the old testament ended.<p>Sure, some events in the OT probably happened, but if I go by how much I exaggerate sometimes when telling a story, the Great Flood probably was just a dam that broke it&#x27;s banks or something.

The oldest surviving Akkadian and Sumerian references to the flood precede and are pretty close in time to the Aryan expansion to the Indian subcontinent, and the Mesopotamian cities had long-lasting trade, cultural and military links to the peoples living in the Iranian plateau.<p>I love speculating on the origin of the flood myths. My personal favorites are long-lasting oral traditions about the Black Sea flood and the Persian Gulf flood, both of which were rapid, catastrophic large-scale floods of large areas that were previously settled by humans. Sadly, the true origin is probably a lot more banal -- the oldest surviving fragmentary literary evidence refers to the specific city that flooded, Shuruppak, or modern Tell Fara. There is indeed a significant flood layer there (60cm of alluvial sand!) at about the right time (2900BC), but this was left by a normal river avulsion that created a violent but local flood.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40095471" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40095471" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xattt</span><span>|</span><a href="#40095407">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40095626">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40094682">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40095471">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40095471">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If anything, cosmic rays would (stochastically) seed clouds.

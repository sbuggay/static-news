This is rough.  I was a student who really struggled with some courses during uni.  I would estimate that 75% of professors that I visited were incredibly unwelcoming, no matter how much prep I had done before the visit.  It really turned me off from asking for help.  That said, I do believe that most of my uni professors were not passionate about teaching -- they wanted to do research, and a modicum of teaching was required for their role.</div><br/><div id="41243993" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41243993" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">maxmalkav</span><span>|</span><a href="#41242811">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41243677">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41243993">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41243993">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Reflecting on my own experience on both sides, I can tell a generational difference.<p>As student, research-focused professors and  some old timers made you feel unwelcome in office hours, a mixture of “you are wasting my time” and “you should have put more work on this, I’ll just give you some hints so I can send you away quick”. Many had in common being from a generation and country where university access was not so normalized and accessible to all social strata, just graduating came many times with some sense of entitlement.<p>Some years later and I’m the one assisting students during office hours. I could already sense some generational change, with younger professors and assistants treating students more like equals. They were exceptions of course, we had younger assistants cargo culting the worst attitude parts of old timers (fun enough they were usually from kind of privileged background, families with ties to the field or even de same department). The result was students from other groups kind-of&#x2F;secretly attending my office hours and the ones from other nice colleagues.<p>Academia is its own kind of hell :-)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41243677" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41243677" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cjs_ac</span><span>|</span><a href="#41242811">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41243096">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41243677">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41243677">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The lecture-tutorial pedagogical model used in universities is called <i>scholasticism</i> and dates back to the middle ages. Books were very expensive, so in the lectures, the lecturer would just read out the relevant text for students to copy down, word for word. (In the more prestigious English universities, lecturers are still called &#x27;Readers&#x27;, and students say that they&#x27;re &#x27;reading&#x27; History or Computer Science rather than &#x27;studying&#x27; it.) Once the students had their copies of the text, they would go away and read them, and then go to a tutorial where they would discuss what they&#x27;d read. This is where the real learning - and the creation of new knowledge - would happen.<p>The author mentions &#x27;flipped learning&#x27;: this is the modern equivalent of scholasticism. Read the text in your own time, and then have an in-person discussion or practical or workshop, depending on the nature of the subject matter.</div><br/><div id="41243757" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41243757" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">n4r9</span><span>|</span><a href="#41243677">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41243096">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41243757">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41243757">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; In the more prestigious English universities, lecturers are still called &#x27;Readers&#x27;<p>At least in the University of Cambridge, a Reader is a specific academic role that is distinct from a lectureship and typically has very few teaching duties.

Having tried this, I think that this is just not the future of education. This mode of teaching is designed mostly for the lecturer&#x27;s convenience, but it&#x27;s a terrible way to foster student understanding.<p>In this section I wish you would have mentioned the cost of teaching. Lectures might not be the best option for engaging students, but it’s quite effective when considering you can teach hundreds of students with one teacher. If 50% learns, that’s a good outcome.<p>I believe the fallout from lectures and university in general are just a part of the design. Not all people have the right motivation and opportunity to succeed at the university. One should work out how to maximize opportunities.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41244079" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41244079" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">red_admiral</span><span>|</span><a href="#41243096">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41242448">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41244079">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41244079">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great article! From my own teaching experience,<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not a hundred percent certain of the exact mechanisms of how, yet. In my experience, I learn the most when I struggle; if a student can shortcut through all the hard parts on, for example, and assignment, they&#x27;re not going to learn very much. On the flip side, when most students struggle, they just give up. Somehow I need to make assignments which thread the needle between being too hard to solve and too easy to learn anything.<p>The academic theory is that for each learner, there are three concentric circles - the way I was taught them, they were called the comfort zone, the growth zone, and the danger zone. (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commonslibrary.org&#x2F;the-learning-zone-model&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commonslibrary.org&#x2F;the-learning-zone-model&#x2F;</a> calls them comfort, learning and alarm zones) Learning happens best when you push people beyond their comfort zone, but not into the danger zone (where the amount retained rapidly converges to zero). Of course, this is easier said than done, especially with a class of students with varying abilities, though I like your approach to the problem. It&#x27;s even harder when you&#x27;re teaching a 200-student introductory class and there&#x27;s no way to really set individual assignments.<p>&gt; [Lecturing] is designed for the lecturer&#x27;s convenience ...<p>I personally really liked most of my lectures I sat in as a student - yes there was one guy who just read out from the textbook he&#x27;d published, so I skipped those lectures and just read the book. But overall, I liked most of my lectures; I might be the exception to the rule. I think the important thing is to make a lecture interesting with some of the same storytelling ideas that writers and TV&#x2F;film scriptwriters use, and to throw in jokes and asides every now and then. Be a human being with personality. Worked examples, live-coding, experiments etc. are also useful, depending on the topic. (For more examples and scientific background, see Willingham&#x27;s book &quot;Why don&#x27;t students like school?&quot;) Of course, that&#x27;s a lot more work for the lecturer than designing for their own convenience.  I&#x27;ve lectured like this myself before and students loved it. I&#x27;ve also heard from students at various places that, now the pandemic has died down mostly, &quot;We&#x27;re not paying fees just to watch some videos. We can do that on youtube. We want real lectures back.&quot;<p>The most important part, which one of my professors told me in the first week and was some of the best advice I ever got at university, was that you don&#x27;t actually learn anything in lectures. That&#x27;s not the point. You learn things by doing the exercises, and by studying in your own time. Lectures are just there to prepare you for the learning, because without the prep you wouldn&#x27;t know what to do in the exercises.<p>&gt; If you&#x27;re on the fence about teaching, you should definitely give it a try, if only because interacting with students is such a rewarding experience.<p>Definitely!</div><br/></div></div><div id="41242448" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41242448" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">claytonwramsey</span><span>|</span><a href="#41244079">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41242812">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41242448">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41242448">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">funny to see this surface again!

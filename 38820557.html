I tried to do it with squeak and I realised that I should go in depth of cmake and c for configuration of generated vm and it’s kind of ruins the purpose because this is exactly what I’ve been trying to avoid (by all means) in the first place. I went through all of the trouble of generating vm just to face reality in which instead of smalltalk I had to deal with depths of c in all of it’s beautiful cmake complications because vm has failed to compile and even when it did it didn’t work on the target hardware because of some problem with sound. I didn’t need sound at all but I found it too time consuming to turn sound module if I recall it correctly.  I was looking for absolutely minimalistic system  like bare  minimum to study it and I found it hard to achieve. I am curious how cuis different or the same in that regard? Where to get help in compiling one for a new hardware?

As I understand it classes just use other classes in the image and it is very difficult to track dependencies. It is a topic revisited often in the Pharo community. Strongtalk and its successor newspeak tried to address that and I think also introduced or experimented with optional static typing. Our modern experience with operating systems has the notion of processes that are relatively isolated from the system, sys calls and wot not. Smalltalk doesn’t have this separation which is a boon and a curse. I’d love to see a smalltalk within a microkernel system like l4 where it retains its all source code is available, debugable, editable, but there is proper process isolation and some sort of security model. Modern systems are so complicated that it would take a vast army, and then maybe half the os stuff has to be written in c++&#x2F;rust anyway cause gc is too slow for gpu, disks, and networks.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38822429" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38822429" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blihp</span><span>|</span><a href="#38821145">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38822233">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38822430">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38822429">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38822429">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; well that is true, except one case when vm doesn’t run on the desired hardware&#x2F;software combination.

For 32-bit you might have to go back to a slightly older release (I&#x27;m not sure if 32-bit has been deprecated yet or not) but you&#x27;ll still get 99.9% of the experience.  I think Windows is fully supported but not sure about OS X since the move to ARM as I&#x27;ve heard some grumbling about issues on that platform.<p>If you&#x27;re on a non-x86&#x2F;ARM system, you would have to build from source but won&#x27;t be able to use the &#x27;fast&#x27; VM (i.e. cog&#x2F;spur) and would have to fall back to the interpreter VM.  I managed to get it running on a couple&#x2F;few ARM-based systems back before there was official support for ARM as a platform and it wasn&#x27;t too difficult.  IIRC, it took a couple&#x2F;few #define&#x27;s to shut the compiler up and things <i>mostly</i> worked on Linux.

I paid the extra fee to have them mailed to me, but eventually that went away. Printed emails are not the same.<p>I eventually figured out how to make the most realistic replica ticket stubs possible to add to my ticket stub album. I spent several thousands dollars on professional printers and real stock as well as months building my own software to customize and print tickets, all to scratch my own itch. Now my collection continues to grow with the 20 or so shows I go to every year and I&#x27;ve helped over 16,000+ people do the same with my website <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stubforge.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stubforge.com</a>, which I&#x27;m now lucky enough to run full time.<p>A lot of people don&#x27;t get it, and that&#x27;s ok, but for those that do, they really get it.<p>People buy our tickets to give as gifts (because it&#x27;s not easy to do anymore in a non-awkward or non-art project fashion), to add to their collections, to frame with posters, to use as surprise proposals, to invite people to their weddings, to announce their pregnancies and more things I never would have imagined when I started.<p>There are people that do miss ephemera. Even if you don&#x27;t look at it that often, it&#x27;s something precious to you. It doesn&#x27;t matter if your kids will get it or just chuck it, it&#x27;s there for you to enjoy and remember in the fashion that you want to.</div><br/><div id="42105018" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42105018" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sho_hn</span><span>|</span><a href="#42104605">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42105329">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42105018">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42105018">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I definitely do get it, as someone with a (loose and not organized) physical ticket collection.

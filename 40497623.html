An intermediate step called the pilot plant is necessary to give experience in scaling quantities up and in operating in nonprotective environments. For example, a laboratory process for desalting water will be tested in a pilot plant of 10,000 gallon&#x2F;day capacity before being used for a 2,000,000 gallon&#x2F;day community water system.<p>Programming system builders have also been exposed to this lesson, but it seems to have not yet been learned. Project after project designs a set of algorithms and then plunges into construction of customer-deliverable software on a schedule that demands delivery of the first thing built.<p>In most projects, the first system built is barely usable. It may be too slow, too big, awkward to use, or all three. There is no alternative but to start again, smarting but smarter, and build a redesigned version in which these problems are solved. The discard and redesign may be done in one lump, or it may be done piece-by-piece. But all large-system experience shows that it will be done.[ Where a new system concept or new technology is used, one has to build a system to throw away, for even the best planning is not so omniscient as to get it right the first time.<p>The management question, therefore, is not whether to build a pilot system and throw it away. You will do that. The only question is whether to plan in advance to build a throwaway, or to promise to deliver the throwaway to customers. Seen this way, the answer is much clearer. Delivering that throwaway to customers buys time, but it does so only at the cost of agony for the user, distraction for the builders while they do the redesign, and a bad reputation for the product that the best redesign will find hard to live down.<p>Hence plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.<p>You know the source.</div><br/><div id="40498276" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40498276" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BigglesB</span><span>|</span><a href="#40498243">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40498614">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40498276">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40498276">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hadn’t thought of it in this context before but in game development a “vertical slice” could potentially be thought of as akin to the “pilot plant” in that it’s about proving out the _processes_ for creating game content (and working out how long each piece of content should take to make) before committing to “scaling up” said content production to deliver the full game…</div><br/></div></div><div id="40498614" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40498614" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">piva00</span><span>|</span><a href="#40498243">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40498276">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40498750">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40498614">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40498614">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Fred Brooks as usual stands the test of time.

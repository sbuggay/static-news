Now the internet simply explains that this was due to the author of the original novel being dissatisfied with Kubrik&#x27;s adaptation.  So much for mystery.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Shining_(miniseries)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Shining_(miniseries)</a></div><br/><div id="42386003" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42386003" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lqet</span><span>|</span><a href="#42385898">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42385915">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42386003">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42386003">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have read King&#x27;s novel, and I have watched Kubrick&#x27;s movie (many, many times). I am not usually a friend of novel adaptations, but the movie simply is in another league than the book. It is much, much better. King&#x27;s novel is a relatively straightforward horror story &#x2F; thriller, with some elements that go a little bit over the top. Kubrick&#x27;s movie is a postmodern masterpiece, with layers upon layers upon layers of meaning. After 20 years of re-watching both of them I have come to the conclusion that Shining cuts even deeper than 2001. And it <i>also</i> works as an entertaining (and frightening) horror movie. In my opinion, it is Kubrick&#x27;s singular masterpiece. And, above all, it is still quite faithful to the original novel. Many dialogues from the book appear virtually unchanged in the screenplay.<p>That being said, I understand why King the author doesn&#x27;t like it. Kubrick carved something out of this novel which really wasn&#x27;t there in the first place. To King, this may have appeared as an arrogant (or even condescending) abuse of his story.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42385915" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42385915" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jumping_frog</span><span>|</span><a href="#42385898">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42385915">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42385915">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Shining and the Power of Narrative<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=EBFnZu-VYlQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=EBFnZu-VYlQ</a><p>Summary and comparison of the article and youtube video analysis by Claude.<p>This analysis focuses on the narrative elements and symbolism in &quot;The Shining,&quot; particularly the role of stories and storytelling, which interestingly complements the previous analysis about spatial impossibilities. Let me summarize the key points and connect them:<p>Key Points from This Analysis:
1. The Scrapbook&#x27;s Significance
- Though barely acknowledged in the film (unlike King&#x27;s novel), the scrapbook represents the hotel&#x27;s history and narrative power
- Its subtle presence aligns with the film&#x27;s broader theme of stories consuming their readers&#x2F;viewers<p>2. Narrative Consumption
- The film is filled with references to stories and storytelling (Donner Party, TV shows, ghost stories)
- Characters are portrayed as both readers and writers of narratives
- Wendy is specifically characterized as a horror film fan (Kubrick&#x27;s addition)<p>3. Native American Subtext
- The hotel&#x27;s location on Native burial grounds
- Connection to the Wendigo myth and colonial violence
- The film opens with tribal music and landscape shots, suggesting a larger historical narrative<p>4. Power of Narrative Control
- The hotel&#x27;s ghosts (Lloyd, Grady) move from being subjects of Jack&#x27;s writing to controlling him
- Jack becomes trapped within the hotel&#x27;s narrative rather than writing his own
- The hotel itself becomes the true storyteller, consuming its characters<p>Connections to Previous Analysis:
1. Intentional Disorientation
- The spatial impossibilities from the first analysis mirror this analysis&#x27;s focus on narrative confusion
- Both create a sense of being lost (physically and narratively)
- The maze serves as a metaphor in both: physically impossible spaces and narrative labyrinth<p>2. Kubrick&#x27;s Control
- First analysis showed how Kubrick deliberately created impossible spaces
- This analysis reveals how he deliberately subverted King&#x27;s original narrative
- Both demonstrate Kubrick&#x27;s meticulous manipulation of the viewer&#x27;s experience<p>3. Layers of Reality
- The spatial analysis showed how rooms and corridors couldn&#x27;t physically exist as shown
- This analysis reveals how narratives within the film similarly overlap and contradict
- Both aspects contribute to the film&#x27;s unsettling atmosphere<p>4. Movement Patterns
- First analysis noted how Kubrick moves &quot;laterally&quot; through the hotel rather than vertically
- This analysis connects that to storytelling, noting how the narrative similarly moves sideways through different stories rather than deeper into any one tale<p>The combination of these analyses suggests that Kubrick was creating a deliberately disorienting experience on multiple levels - both spatial and narrative - to reinforce the hotel&#x27;s supernatural power and its ability to trap and consume its inhabitants. The impossible architecture serves the same purpose as the overlapping narratives: to create a sense of being lost in a space that operates outside normal rules of reality.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

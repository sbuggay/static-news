They don&#x27;t much like competition that can easily undercut them on price, so they want to veto it somehow and lean on their go-to of accusing anybody who competes with them of theft.<p>The problem in this case is that it doesn&#x27;t matter. The AI stuff is going to exist, and compete with them, whether the AI companies have to pay some pittance for training data or not.<p>But the chorus is made worse by two major factors.<p>First, many of the AI companies themselves are closed-source profiteers. &quot;OpenAI&quot; stepping all over themselves to be the opposite of their own name etc. If all the models got trained and then <i>published</i>, people would be much more inclined to say &quot;oh, this is neat, I can use this myself and it knows my own work&quot;. But when you have companies hoovering everything up for free and then trying to keep the result proprietary, they look like scumbags and that pisses people off.<p>Second, then you get <i>other</i> opportunistic scumbags who try to turn that legitimate ire into their own profit by claiming that training for free should be prohibited so that <i>only</i> proprietary models can be created.<p>Whereas the solution you actually want is that anybody can train a model on public data but then they have to publish the model&#x2F;weights. Which is probably not going to happen because in practice the law is likely to end up being what favors one of the scumbags.</div><br/><div id="42583033" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42583033" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dend</span><span>|</span><a href="#42582306">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42582932">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42582055">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42583033">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42583033">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think that&#x27;s an overly reductive way of looking at it. Artists, are by their definition, creators of art. AI-generated &quot;art&quot; (it&#x27;s not art at all in my eyes) is effectively a machine-based reproduction of actual art, but doesn&#x27;t take the same skill level, time, and passion for the craft for a user to be able to generate an output, and certainly generates large profits for those that created the models.<p>So, imagine the scenario where you, an artist, trained for years to develop a specific technique and style, only for a massively funded company to swoop in, train a model on your art, make bank off of your skill while you get nothing, and now some rando can also create look-alikes (and also potentially profit from them - I&#x27;ve seen AI-generated images for sale at physical print stores and Etsy that mimic art styles of modern artists), potentially destroying your livelihood. Very little to be happy about here, to be frank.<p>It&#x27;s less about competition and more about the ethical way to do it. If another artist would learn the same techniques and then managed to produce similar art, do you think there would be just as visceral of a reaction to them publishing their art? Likely not, because it still required skill to achieve what they did. Someone with a model and a prompt is nowhere near that same skill level, yet they now get to reap the benefits of the artist&#x27;s developed craft. Is this &quot;gatekeeping what&#x27;s art&quot;? I don&#x27;t think so. Is this fair in any capacity? I don&#x27;t think so either. Because we&#x27;re comparing apples to pinecones.<p>All that being said, I do agree that the ship has sailed - the models are there, the trend of training on art AND written content shared openly will continue, and we&#x27;re yet to see what the consequences of that will be. Their presence certainly won&#x27;t stop me from continuously writing, perfecting my craft, and sharing it with the world. My job is to help others with it.<p>My hunch is that in the near-term we&#x27;ll see a major devaluing of both written and image material, while a premium will be put on exceptional human skill. That is, would you pay to read a blog post written and thoroughly researched by Molly White (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mastodon.social&#x2F;@molly0xfff@hachyderm.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mastodon.social&#x2F;@molly0xfff@hachyderm.io</a>) or Cory Doctorow (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pluralistic.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pluralistic.net&#x2F;</a>), or some AI slop generated by an automated aggregator? My hunch is you&#x27;d pick the former. I know I would. As an anecdotal data point, and speaking just for myself, if I see now that someone uses AI-generated images in their blog post or site, I almost instantly close the tab. Same applies to videos on YouTube that have an AI-generated thumbnail or static art. It somehow carries a very negative connotation to me.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42582055" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42582055" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xyzzy_plugh</span><span>|</span><a href="#42582306">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42583712">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42582055">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42582055">[25 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This all sounds like renting to me.

Internet is a utility, and everyone should have the right to the same type of access, regardless of their need (those who do not need&#x2F;want, can simply chose not to use it, but ISPs should not be allowed to differentiate).<p>I&#x27;ve hosted my own web, and other servers on my own hardware since I was 13 years old, when I bought my first domain, I had to use a fax machine for the first time in my life, and fax my request form, along with my passport, to the agency responsible for the top level domain of my country. It was kind of convoluted back then, but everyone were helpful, and it was not that difficult, the technology was well understood, supporters were competent, and it was expected that people were going to use the internet for internet things.
Today is my 39th birthday, and while the server hosting my stuff is mostly still located 3 meters from me, the path to having it online has nothing but degenerated, it&#x27;s an uphill battle just to be on the internet these days.. The mail stuff is the easier part (dkim, dmarc, spf, certificates).. But the simple act of getting your f..king computer connected to the f..king internet like it was 1999, that&#x27;s the real hassle..

And if you have a domain and can manage DNS records, then in the future that doesn&#x27;t preclude you from &quot;graduating&quot; to your own hardware, if you so desire. The goal here is more or less self-sufficiency with web properties rather than a pure interpretation of &quot;rent&quot; vs. &quot;own.&quot; Because at some point you have to rent something from someone (say, you&#x27;re not running your own domain registry and registrar).</div><br/><div id="42583704" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42583704" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dusted</span><span>|</span><a href="#42583528">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42583689">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42583619">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42583704">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42583704">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t want to gatekeep, I want to gate-unkeep!

There is a better way than be a sharecropper on someone else&#x27;s land.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42583178" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42583178" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">veltas</span><span>|</span><a href="#42582282">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42583694">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42583178">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42583178">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This article recommends .eu domains.<p>There is a caveat to this, in the unlikely event your state leaves the EU you will be forced off, this happened to many UK entities after Brexit, they were forced to stop using their .eu domains.</div><br/><div id="42583219" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42583219" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dend</span><span>|</span><a href="#42583178">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42583694">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42583219">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42583219">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Fair point - I will add that as a clarification, thank you for calling it out.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42583694" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42583694" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Almondsetat</span><span>|</span><a href="#42583178">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42582813">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42583694">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42583694">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A bit funny to see &quot;owner&quot; and &quot;buying a domain&quot; next to each other</div><br/><div id="42583876" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42583876" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dend</span><span>|</span><a href="#42583694">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42583746">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42583876">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42583876">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah, unfortunately, c&#x27;est la vie.

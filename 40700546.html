It is stellar for controlling all kind of Blade Runner&#x2F;Vangelis-style pad sounds and there are some things where nothing compares.<p>E.g. I played a gig last week where each key on the left split was an individual drum loop (e.g. bassdrum beating on one key, snare on another, hihat on yet another) and the pressure controlled the level of each individual loop. This way you can create very organic, reactive, structures with one hand.<p>Another thing it is great at is when you play with multiple fingers into a arppeggiated synth that reacts to the channel pressure and the timbre, as you can still emphazise or de-emphasize single notes within the arpeggio organically.<p>It certainly still holds up for me at least. In a way it has become even better, as MPE support has developed.<p>One thing however is: most synthesizer presets work fine on the Linnstrumment, but you will have to make your own if you&#x27;re willing to unlock the full potential of the thing, as the emphasis is so much more on pressure than on velocity&#x2F;envelopes.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40701696" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40701696" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">elihu</span><span>|</span><a href="#40700893">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40701526">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40702940">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40701819">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40701696">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40701696">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t own a Linnstrument, but I know a couple people who have them and they all seem pretty impressed with it.<p>If you want something less expensive, you might take a look at the Roli Lightpad Block.

I find it more fun and usable than the Seaboard Block.<p>I&#x27;m a little hesitant to recommend it though, because Roli is awfully controlling.  To configure the device you have to use their software (which runs on Mac and Windows only), and it won&#x27;t talk to the device unless it&#x27;s registered to you.  So if, like myself, you bought it second hand, you have to file a support ticket and have it de-registered from the previous owner before you can register it to yourself and actually use it.<p>(To their credit, the process was pretty quick.)<p>The Linnstrument is the complete opposite -- the device firmware is Apache 2.0 and available on github.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40701819" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40701819" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mikelevins</span><span>|</span><a href="#40700893">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40701526">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40701696">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40701513">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40701819">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40701819">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I got one a year or two ago from Detroit Modular for about $1500. I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.<p>I&#x27;m primarily a guitar player with some ability to muddle through on piano on simple parts if I have to. The Linnstrument feels to me like a cross between a guitar and a piano. The notes are all laid out side-by-side like a piano, but in parallel rows like a guitar, and it respnds like a string instrument to wiggling your finger for tremolo or sliding it along the row for portamento.<p>In the default tuning the &quot;strings&quot; are tuned a fourth apart, like the lower 4 strings on a guitar, which helps a guitarist adapt quickly.<p>The sensors are quite sensitive, with very quick response, which makes it feel alive and responsive. It came with access to downloadable content that included MPE instruments for Logic Pro. I&#x27;ve used Logic for years, so I just made a reference project with all the supplied instruments in it and use that as a starting point for new projects that use the Linnstrument.<p>I quite happy with it and don&#x27;t regret the price paid one bit.<p>Here&#x27;s a little thing I made with it:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mic11.net&#x2F;assets&#x2F;audio&#x2F;Ribbon.mp3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mic11.net&#x2F;assets&#x2F;audio&#x2F;Ribbon.mp3</a><p>I did all the parts on the Linnstrument with Logic and my reference project.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40701513" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40701513" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zxv</span><span>|</span><a href="#40700893">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40701526">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40701743">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40701513">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40701513">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah, Roger is awesome.

It&#x27;s taken me months and years and lots of manual-reading, 3rd party manuals and numerous videos to understand what is basically just a daw.<p>Just start from the two buttons: &quot;Main&quot; and &quot;Menu&quot;:  Main should really be called &quot;editor&quot; and &quot;menu&quot; should be called &quot;main.&quot;  Good for you if you memorized what functions are behind which button.  +5 pts if you can find the hidden multitrack level viewer.  Hint: behind the tiny Autobot shield on the sampler page.  Quick: what key combo gets you to the track mixer?  I believe it depends on what screen you&#x27;re coming from?<p>It&#x27;s rarely clear what entity you&#x27;re saving or loading... is it the effects patch or the song or project or drum program, etc?<p>And oof! How abt that onscreen keyboard?!?! somehow worse response than a 1999 cell phone keyboard?!  Needs buddha-like patience.  Numerous upgrades over the years and examples within the app of better response, but they can&#x27;t get an intern to spend a sprint cleaning that up?!<p>Notice how Roger edits out all of the menu traversion...<p>Also the drum program is so massively flexible... high ceiling but also very high floor.  The mix of pad&#x2F;sample editor functions tucked behind menus is like an under water maze.<p>And the MPC Live swaps the drum pads to the left... whereas on the classic MPC 2k they&#x27;re in the right.  Great for lefties tho lol!<p>And the main&#x2F;menu&#x2F;record buttons are so big and need so much force it&#x27;s hard to get the timing right.  I don&#x27;t even like pressing undo bc it feels like shifting my 88 Cabriolet with its worn synchro on 1st gear.<p>Switching between tools in the piano roll editor and sample editor is so tedious...  It requires infinite patience compared to bandlab, cool edit pro, audacity, reaper, and flstudio.  One mode for zoom, one for select, one for delete, one more to add notes...etc.<p>No page has both save and load on it.  Save is actually a disk so it&#x27;s not clear if it saves or loads.  &quot;Load&quot; is actually labelled &quot;browser.&quot;<p>The file system layout tries to be both abstract and literal with &quot;Places&quot; and probably useful shortcuts but i can&#x27;t always see how to simply traverse up one folder...  which I often need to do bc I go too low bc of the bad response time of the screen-to-folder traversal.<p>Randomly an annoying modal &quot;save progress window&quot; blocks my flow.<p>The hierarchy of &quot;tracks,&quot; sequences, and programs is tricky to remember.<p>It took me weeks before I realized it will never simply show more than one audio track waveform at a time.  So lining things up across tracks is way harder than necessary.<p>In short, I hate this machine even though I want to love it so badly.  I think it rewards deep hyperfocus and committment over spontaneity and flexibility.  I only use it for its excellent fx chain.  Probably a good choice if you can <i>only</i> have one machine and dedicate a monk-like existence to it.<p>I find it sus that Roger mentions <i>none</i> of the above criticisms.  We&#x27;re conditioned to respect soft-spoken elderly heroes like him, but it reeks of submarining by the struggling InMusic organization.  Just listen to him gush about the features...I mean what are the stakes here for Roger?  Is he on any kind of time or monetary budget for studio customers?  Or is he simply validating how well others have kept his original ideas intact?  Plus he only records a few bars of a loop... no serious editing, song-making , or sample-editing.<p>Not to mention the role of reciprocity in persuasion.   Sure he can say anything he pleases, but they gave him a nice fancy unit for free.  He&#x27;s psychologically bound to return the favor.<p>Anyway lots of people do love this machine, especially those fond of the rest of the series.  It&#x27;s just certainly not for me.</div><br/><div id="40702822" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40702822" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">khazhoux</span><span>|</span><a href="#40701707">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40702356">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40702822">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40702822">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I can&#x27;t fathom how he thinks it&#x27;s so intuitive. It&#x27;s taken me months and years and lots of manual-reading, 3rd party manuals and numerous videos to understand what is basically just a daw.<p>I bought an MPC 1 about 3 weeks into covid lockdown (strange memories).  But I found that it was awesome for laying down simple and pretty awesome sounding beats, compared to my Logic + Launchpad setup.  I have Ableton too but have never gotten around to learning it.  On MPC, I ramped up pretty quickly on simple beats -- especially once I figured out I had to stop treating it like a DAW.<p>The record-while-looping is fantastic, and the MPC sample kits are nearly &quot;production ready&quot; (I mean, from my hobbyist perspective, who also owns a zillion drum libraries which never sound as good as in the demo tracks).<p>Over a couple of months I laid down 100 projects, and some turned out not terrible.  A lot of fun.  So in that sense it was definitely intuitive.<p><i>On the other hand</i>, I found it excruciating when I wanted to learn deeper features.  The MPC Bible is not a fun read.  And the whole business of copying sequences never really fit me, compared to in logic being able to quick copy different pieces of tracks around and tweak and go back and edit curves, etc.  I think it must be that to really make the most out of MPC, your mindset has to be: lay something down, commit, and move on.<p>I&#x27;m inspired to pick it up again though.  It&#x27;s a lot of fun every time I do.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40702356" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40702356" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sivers</span><span>|</span><a href="#40701707">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40702822">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40702438">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40702356">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40702356">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For what it&#x27;s worth, it&#x27;s not just you.

I found it very easy to learn from watching a youtube video series.<p>Are you a sample based musician? That what it was designed around. Perfect for hipho.<p>The OS does feel out of date, this current version of MPC OS came out when iPhone 6 was out, and there has long been talk of an MPC 3.0 upgrade coming soon. So it&#x27;s hard to judge it entirely given its age.<p>A huge part of it is that many serious professional musicians use this as a daily driver for production and they are VERY set on workflow patterns dating to the 90s. So reorganizing stuff would come with big customer pushback.<p>Learning the MPC workflow and developing our own templates+flows is really critical to understanding it. Your experience with it is seemingly quite shallow but a bit understandable.<p>&gt; Main should really be called &quot;editor&quot; and &quot;menu&quot; should be called &quot;main.&quot;<p>Not really, Main is the mainscreen like your primary app view. Menu is like the start menu or a sidebar in a webapp.<p>Editor would be confusing because there&#x27;s the midi screen.

Just use proper backup protocols.<p>&gt; And the main&#x2F;menu&#x2F;record buttons are so big and need so much force it&#x27;s hard to get the timing right.<p>a lot of these critiques are quite bizarre I have to say... they are normal soft buttons on Live 2 (and shallower plastic ones on One)? Not hard push but at the same time I&#x27;d rather not hit rec and overwrite stuff accidentally either.</div><br/><div id="40702596" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40702596" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sivers</span><span>|</span><a href="#40701707">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40702438">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40702711">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40702596">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40702596">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Maybe DAW workflows are like programming languages.<p>Some say language X is elegant and productive, while language Y is awful.<p>Some say language Y is the great one, while language X is unusuable.<p>Some workflows just make more sense to some brains than others.</div><br/><div id="40702682" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40702682" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hammyhavoc</span><span>|</span><a href="#40701707">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40702596">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40702711">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40702682">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40702682">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Really depends what you&#x27;re doing too.<p>Need to score picture or work on games via middleware? Screwed in Bitwig as there&#x27;s no video or middleware support.<p>Need to quickly and easily do sound design with external synths, mixing control voltage, MIDI and audio? Bitwig is where it&#x27;s at.<p>Need to do surround or spatial audio? Damned in a lot of DAWs.<p>Need to export a seamless loop for a video game? Screwed if you use Cubase or Nuendo instead of Reaper or Live. Yes, you can copy-paste tails, but it&#x27;s really not the same as second-pass rendering, and if you need to export several hundred files for games at regular intervals for progress updates, it ain&#x27;t happening.<p>Prefer to jam with real instruments, work in loops and layers without interruption? Without a paddle really unless you&#x27;re using Live or Bitwig.<p>Pros and cons to all of them. Tried them all, and think it&#x27;s a tragedy that ReWire is dead, because that really did solve most problems by being able to use a linear DAW and a non-linear DAW, especially within the realms of scoring picture and working with video game middleware. Exporting cues, loops, layers and sfx in most DAWs is terrible as they&#x27;re geared towards traditional linear songs.<p>The solution is obvious: a ReWire successor that&#x27;s an open standard. Inter-app audio and MIDI with sample-accurate clock is extremely important.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40701824" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40701824" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">speed_spread</span><span>|</span><a href="#40701707">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40701824">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40701824">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Roger Linn is a nice guy but this is a puff piece for the MPC.

Others quietly stopped posting after numbers flatlined or declined. This includes a lot of people whose projects were “Ramen profitable” and then showing huge month over month growth, which was supposed to be the start of something bigger.<p>A disappointing number of them have pivoted into personal brand building and selling courses. It’s a lot of “follow me&#x2F;subscribe to my newsletter for more advice” which turns into “sign up now for an exclusive spot in my new course” after a half a year.

It doesn&#x27;t have to be novel, or world-changing, unless your goal is to create a multi-billion dollar monopoly on day 1. There is space for more than one thing in the world.<p>The difference between a successful business and a failed startup is how much effort you put into it, considering that a solo or a startup is exponentially <i>more</i> nimble than an established player at identifying and focusing on a novel approach to an old problem.<p>The classic Silicon Valley&#x2F;Paul Graham advice of &quot;validate an idea and don&#x27;t write a line of code until you have signed 10 clients&quot; is a good approach only iff your job is creating ideas and putting the least possible effort in each one. This is the Twitter indiehacker approach. But if you only have one good idea that you believe in, that scratches <i>your own</i> itch, just build it. Don&#x27;t spend ages to build it, try to market it ASAP, but how much effort you put into it is more important than how game changing your idea is.<p>This is my plan at least, and no successful business just yet to say if this approach is valid, but it agrees with my reading of the business, indie hacker and startup world.<p>Just don&#x27;t create another productivity app. That&#x27;s the most saturated field in the entire space, and for some reason 90% of indie hackers have built yet another calendar&#x2F;todo hybrid, wondering why no one cares.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37785129" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37785129" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">actionfromafar</span><span>|</span><a href="#37784062">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37784933">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37787189">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37784621">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37785129">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37785129">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You probably already heard this, but if you are doing a product, not “research”, that something has been already done, needn’t be a deterrent.<p>It just as well may indicate there’s room in the market for yet another twist on a similar thing.</div><br/><div id="37785872" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37785872" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SoftTalker</span><span>|</span><a href="#37784062">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37785129">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37784621">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37785872">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37785872">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In fact if something like it is already in the market, that&#x27;s a very good sign.

I don&#x27;t think any of the comments here <i>directly</i> put their finger upon it.<p>Some possibly unimportant background: my wife used to suffer from depression, but in the last 10 years that has subsided, mostly through self-guided philosophy and practical stuff. What remains is social anxiety and a life-long history of avoiding working for&#x2F;with people. For reasons I won&#x27;t go into she has a huge problem with authority figures, so early jobs with unfair or idiotic bosses lasted a &quot;tableflip&quot; amount of time. She&#x27;s run a solo business for most of her adult life &quot;to avoid dealing with people&quot;. The double-irony is:<p>1. There&#x27;s almost no such thing as &quot;working alone&quot;. A successful business requires interaction, and if you&#x27;re solo, you need to do <i>all of it</i>.<p>2. She realized that without <i>having</i> to do something <i>for someone</i> she has zero motivation to do anything at all even though she loves what she actually does.<p>Without a client she thinks &quot;why bother?&quot;. As soon as a client contacts her, off she goes like a bee. And even though she consciously realizes this, she has never found a way to trick her brain into doing work for herself. Sometimes I feel like faking a client just so she can work, because once she&#x27;s going, her work is amazing and she loves what she does. She&#x27;s even done free&#x2F;low cost work for cash-strapped clients just so that she can work.<p>So what I&#x27;m saying is that she needs her work to matter to <i>someone specific</i>, but it doesn&#x27;t matter who.<p>I thought she was nuts, but after 20+ years of working for various companies I took a 6 month break from work. I had all sorts of plans for things I&#x27;d hack on. I finished <i>nothing</i>, except for the raspberry pi arcade cabinet for my nephews.<p>We all know that startups need to get their product into customer hands. We think that the client&#x27;s excellent feedback will knock the product into shape. But I think it might just be the fact that you have a customer who needs you to deliver. Having worked for a few early stages startups that had no clients yet, this effect is visible.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37784491" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37784491" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thewizardofaus</span><span>|</span><a href="#37788317">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37784759">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37784491">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37784491">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A crucial point the post misses is the distinction between motivation and discipline.<p>Ultimately it&#x27;s easy to work on things when they are fun and exciting; but motivation will only last for so long... once that happens it&#x27;s the discipline that needs to take over for you to keep progressing forward.</div><br/><div id="37786115" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37786115" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">polishdude20</span><span>|</span><a href="#37784491">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37785904">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37786115">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37786115">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Discipline is another way of saying habit.

For one, my income is somewhat tied to my productivity, and my productivity highly correlates to my state of mind.<p>Since going back to being primarily a maker after organizing my days around being a manager[1], and being an avid runner, I&#x27;ve redefined my relationship with &quot;motivation&quot; in a way that can be summed up succinctly by author Brad Stulberg: &quot;You don&#x27;t need to feel good to get going. <i>You need to get going to feel good.</i>&quot; I know that I am long-term <i>very motivated</i>, but day to day or hour to hour, &quot;motivation&quot; is a tricky word, because my energy and creativity waxes&#x2F;wanes.<p>Agree with the author that structure is the most important thing for me to work around this. Even though makers dream of an open schedule, on the days where I&#x27;m off my usual routine, it&#x27;s really tough to prioritize all the many things always on my plate. It&#x27;s even tougher trying to decide to peel myself away from work to go for a run that I know will help me focus better after. Making the decision can be emotionally and mentally taxing, whereas if I rely on the default that I just go out for a run as soon as I wake up, the rest of the day just flows from that without the decision fatigue. Time-blocking or even just very simple structure like the OP has has been really effective for me. This includes a hard stop time each day even if it feels like I&#x27;m on a roll— my younger self would often borrow against my future energy, and that seemed to rarely work out in the medium-to-long term.<p>&gt; This is combined with a lack of co-workers. Comrades in the trenches, if you will. And finally there&#x27;s the ability to not do anything, which can be quite nebulous and dangerous if not managed.<p>For anyone who is a solo-creator struggling with this, &quot;body-doubling&quot; is a term from the ADHD&#x2F;neurodivergent community that simply means &quot;doing a task in the presence of another person&quot;. Surprisingly, they don&#x27;t have to be working on the same task to help you feel like you have &quot;comrades in the trenches&quot;.

Then I get to relax a little and balance adding features and reducing debt.  And finally I reach a maintenance and support phase which typically requires very little time and effort.

For example, I work in a midsized consulting firm at a fairly senior level.  While I have a line manager, he’s only there to give me corporate news and policy.  He not only doesn’t tell me what to do, he often doesn’t know what I’m doing.<p>What happens is there are a pool of account executives who I have grown to know over the years.  We talk regularly, and if there is something I could work on (pre-sales or a project), we talk and figure if I’m a good fit and have bandwidth.  Unless I have almost no work I can be choosy about what to work on.  Yes, clients and the account guys can mold my deliverables, but I have a lot of sway in that as well.<p>This also lets me figure out my own hours, within constraints if engagements of course.

They often have events, probably socialized most on their Instagram account. From expert talks, to hackathons - go to the next event. While there, tell the organizer what type of community you’re looking for, and ask if there is a group chat.<p>For example, I’m in a city, and there are at least 2 or 3 very active WhatsApp groups - a mix of tech devs, creative entrepreneurs (one of those groups has 800+ members). Every day - there are 2-3 events posted, talks, seminars, workshops, code jams, pitch workshops, digital marketing how-tos.<p>Idea: Co--working spaces often have a formal or informal group chat (often WhatsApp). You could take a tour and ask around.<p>Business incubators - Business incubators, often have a Slack channel (with channels like #dev, #design, #3d-printing). They often have a networking site where you can book free office hours with vetted experts &#x2F; founders &#x2F; engineers &#x2F; executives &#x2F; angel investors). The one I participate in has a Slack group containing 2,800 creative entrepreneurs, founders, investors, etc. At the co-working space, they host events, social mixers, etc. You’ll aways find some interesting people there. Find the group chat, get on it. Eventually you’ll get “dragged” into an interesting social group of startup &#x2F; entrepreneurship &#x2F; growth minded people. I jokingly say dragged, but what I mean is - if you go to an interesting talk on CNC routers, you’ll likely meet someone interesting there, they’ll tell you about a cool upcoming event, you book it - over time, you’re just spending more time per week with interesting people.<p>I know you just asked about WhatsApp groups, but I wanted to just share some of what I’ve learned, within 1 year of moving to a new city.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37785446" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37785446" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aeolun</span><span>|</span><a href="#37784654">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37786741">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37784977">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37785446">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37785446">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In the absence of any good ones you start one?</div><br/><div id="37786459" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37786459" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">langsoul-com</span><span>|</span><a href="#37784654">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37785446">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37784977">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37786459">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37786459">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Joining and starting a meetup are two completely different things.

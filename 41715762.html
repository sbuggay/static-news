My kid used to enjoy math in school, and love talking about math problems (&quot;can you help me set up that triangle pyramid thing with the sums again&quot;), but now is seemingly disillusioned and finds the school exercises boring. Combine that with, well, teen-age, and I fear it&#x27;s going to be hard to get back the spark.

most important thing was not raw intelligence or knowledge (Americans tend
to lag behind in the latter compared to all international students). What
mattered was passion. The way to become successful in mathematics, like
almost every endeavor, is to care about it, to love it, to obsess over it. And in
this, Eastern Europeans had a clear superiority, a cultural advantage. They
had been trained, from an early age, to love mathematics more intensely.<p>IMHO this is what drove American superiority in software engineering for several decades.

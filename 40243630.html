Private car ownership is at all time high and not slowing down, there are visibly more and more cars on the roads every year.<p>Self-driving may change that, once it comes.

A billion seems like a lot of money but at the volume of cars that Hyundai produces (millions), it&#x27;s not a lot per vehicle and as a percentage of their revenue it&#x27;s also pretty modest (about 1%). This stuff could add a lot of value to their cars.<p>2) Fear of missing out if somebody else manages. The nightmare scenario for Hyundai would be Tesla or some other competitor managing to launch something that actually works and then having to license their solution just to keep up; probably at great cost.<p>There are a lot of nay-sayers out there proclaiming at length how all this is a mission impossible. But the reason these investments are happening is that there are by now quite a wide range of autonomous taxis driving in a growing number of cities in the world. And they mostly seem to get their passengers from A to B without a driver. So, it&#x27;s clearly not that impossible for this to work. Going from hundreds of bespoke cars operating for the likes of Waymo to millions of autonomously driving cars is the game here. Somebody is going to get there eventually. But not without a lot of investments.<p>Hyundai is opting to hedge their bets here. They are investing a lot more conservatively than e.g. Tesla. But they are not completely ignoring it either.</div><br/><div id="40245361" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40245361" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">disgruntledphd2</span><span>|</span><a href="#40244662">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40245140">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40244771">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40245361">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40245361">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Somebody is going to get there eventually.

1. Their solution requires detailed mapping for all areas before it works

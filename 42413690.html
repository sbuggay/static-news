In short, outside the government you can do whatever you need as long as it’s not explicitly forbidden while public servants can only do what’s explicitly permitted.<p>Governments are not designed (nor should they be) for efficiency. They are designed for safety, accountability, transparency, and universality.<p>Finally, I must say that I started working with government agencies with the misconception they are lazy, underqualified, people, and nothing is further from what I encountered. The people I worked with were smart, well educated, intelligent, and had an unparalleled sense of public duty I’ve never seen elsewhere.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42427332" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42427332" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scythe</span><span>|</span><a href="#42429242">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42426840">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42427332">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42427332">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The first comment on the blog is also illuminating:<p>&gt; <i>But I would urge you to take seriously the role of the courts in creating this mess. There are bad lawyers. But the good ones often are warning the agency about real hazards that can waste enormous amounts of agency effort. Go read a regulatory preamble from the 1970s. It’s a hoot. The agencies often took a few pages to say “here’s what we’re doing”, offered a minimal justification, and that was it. Now, a rulemaking is a multiyear saga, as the agencies jump through every hoop, and know the courts are at the end of the gauntlet. A lawyer who doesn’t warn the program staff what can happen if, say, you end up in front of a judge in ND Tex, is not doing their job. If you don’t document everything to the nth degree you are going to have to do it again. Period. An agency can spend hundreds of pages documenting its reasons, but if the court doesn’t like the way it handled a few comments? Do it over.</i><p>It&#x27;s one thing to reform regulatory agencies, but it&#x27;s another to reform the courts. It seems like we now play racquetball with the courts, with each opposing administration appointing judges who are sympathetic to its viewpoints. This leaves the underlying system untouched and just points it back and forth, while the judges themselves are left with the same wicked problem of applying ambiguous laws to specific situations.<p>But I don&#x27;t know if DOGE is really about analyzing government operations and producing recommendations for reform. For one thing, we already have the Government Accountability Office, and also the Congressional Budget Office. For another, personnel is policy. Musk and Ramaswamy aren&#x27;t accountants. They&#x27;re pundits. I would expect the primary difference between DOGE and previous attempts at government reform will be its strategy in engaging with the public.</div><br/><div id="42428510" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42428510" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fastball</span><span>|</span><a href="#42427332">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42427841">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42426840">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42428510">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42428510">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Musk is certainly not just a pundit.

(I can see how it&#x27;s reflective.)<p>The last time the Dems controlled the Presidency and both houses of congress was the first two years of Obama&#x27;s first term (Jan 2009 - Jan 2011). And prior to that the first two years of Clinton&#x27;s first term (Jan 1993 - Jan 1995; which had limited success, for the same reason this will have limited success: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;National_Partnership_for_Reinventing_Government" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;National_Partnership_for_Reinv...</a> ).<p>The last time the Reps controlled both houses and the Presidency was the first two years of Trump&#x27;s last term (Jan 2017 - Jan 2019).

This person is looking at government from one limited perspective, as someone who has worked with people who&#x27;ve tried to work in it and reform it in the past. The fundamental barrier to government reform is in Congress, nowhere else. There&#x27;s nothing special about Musk&#x27;s ability to convince Congress to do things it doesn&#x27;t want to do. Even if he threatens to primary them. Most of these people are in relatively safe districts. They have the name recognition in their districts. They can point to the things they&#x27;ve done for their districts. Most of them are not in any danger from a Musk-funded primary opponent.<p>The only thing that would truly reform government in more than bits and pieces would be enough Congress people, in both houses, who are not only of the same party, but are basically also of the same sub-caucus within that party. Fat chance getting that.

If Republicans were what they said they were, I’d still hate their rhetoric and a lot of their preferred social policies but I could put all of that aside if it meant reigning in the size, scope, budget (zeroing out the deficit and chopping away at the debt to bring it down over time rather than explosively growing it) of the Federal government and call myself a card-carrying member of the Republican Party.

I’m not holding my breath though, and in anticipation of Trump being sworn in and taking the Oval Office for himself once again and all the “crazy” things Musk says he wants to do with DOGE, real or not, I think people have just kind of forgotten that during his first term, Trump was very much a “what have you done for me lately” kind of boss who would fire people who weren’t performing at the level he wanted at the drop of a hat and sometimes in very inglorious and humiliating ways that came out of nowhere, even people who had bent over backwards to prove their loyalty to him during their time working for him.<p>I don’t think Musk is immune to that either; he has a lot of money and that money can be leveraged into power, but the Office of the Presidency has real power that Trump doesn’t need to spend any of his own money or Musk’s money leveraging because it is paid for by taxpayers with the Executive power vested wholly in him post-Noon on January 20th 2025.</div><br/><div id="42427860" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42427860" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rayiner</span><span>|</span><a href="#42426848">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42427688">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42427628">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42427860">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42427860">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It is structurally impossible to reform the government.

The author tries to make out as if Elon Musk is nothing more than a crony capitalist, pointing out that SpaceX has $15B in govt contracts. This conveniently ignores the reason SpaceX has those contracts in the first place, which is because they have consistently been the best available supplier to NASA&#x2F;DoD&#x2F;etc.<p>You can contrast what SpaceX has been delivering with Falcon and Starship vs what Boeing has been delivering with Starliner to get a tiny glimpse into how silly a claim it is that Musk is doing this to gift himself government contracts. Or compare how little the other billionaire-funded space company (Blue Origin) has delivered, even though they were actually founded before SpaceX. Musk doesn&#x27;t need to (somehow) give his company a leg up via DOGE, his company is already the best provider available by a huge margin.<p>From there, the author says:<p>&gt; consider the track record of Musk’s Boring Company, which is responsible for several of the worst municipal infrastructure boondoggles of the past few years.<p>In what sense is that true, even a tiny bit? TBC delivered the Las Vegas loop first phase for a cost of $31M per mile, which is <i>significantly</i> cheaper than what anyone else is digging tunnels for. A significant portion of that is station cost, which obviously becomes much less of the overall cost if you build longer tunnels. They completed this project in about 15 months. This was their first real project, before they had much opportunity to iterate on TBM designs (which if you look at the history of SpaceX, iteration speed is clearly a strong point in favor of Musk-led companies).<p>You can compare that to Cali&#x27;s high speed rail project, which has a Phase 1 projected cost of $106.2B for 494 miles of track, which works out to $215M per mile, and that&#x27;s not even a tunnel.

How many fully accessible stations integrated with existing transport infrastructure are to be built on the high-speed rail project? The  Vegas tunnel is currently unidirectional isn’t it? That would be less useful for the high speed rail project. It’s a bit different to consider a largely pleasure route which can largely be routed anyway from a transport project which is much less restricted in where it can be routed.  A rail project has additional costs and complexities like laying track and signalling. I’ll assume your argument is that these are unnecessary, we can just use existing autonomous cars to solve this.

What is a reasonable price to pay for a training exercise where Marines actually get to deploy a anti ship missile battery onto a lonely Pacific Island? Is the incremental cost of 3 versus 2 of these exercises a year worth while? Valuing many of things the military does, both in terms of what their positive value is, as well as what their costs -should- be is difficult, since we have so little analogous scenarios to draw on.<p>Without confident and broadly consensus (or at least with sufficient top level cover and firepower) valuations on benefits and costs, any attempt to reduce spending just slams into resistance (both truly well meaning, as well as reflexive and self-serving).<p>Another major DoD challenge is that outside of the IT field, the DoD asks for industrial competency and competitiveness that frankly the overall US industrial base looks to barely be able to meet.

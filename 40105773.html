The difference is perhaps that professions like truck drivers and a lot of tradeskills are compensated very well because there is a general lack of people in those professions. We also have very strong unions (and legislation because of it) in those areas, so it’s not easy to “displace” (is this the right English word?) truck drivers with cheap foreign labour in a lot of EU countries.<p>Unlike professions like plumbers, however, IT personal is becoming increasingly easy to come by. And since they never really formed unions, the so called golden days are over for a lot of IT professionals. Maybe excluding hardcore IT operations, networking and at least for now developers.<p>I wouldn’t be able to earn what I do as a truck driver though. Maybe half with more hours?

It&#x27;s possibly a different chair, desk, keyboard, and monitor setup could help with this but I&#x27;m self-employed right now and not able to shell that out for what would amount to experiments which I don&#x27;t expect to be particularly fruitful.<p>I have worked in a number of offices and with a variety of setups when employers were footing the bill, and have yet to find one that was significantly more comfortable than my current setup.<p>When driving I&#x27;m in much more of a relaxed reclining position and just steering. Long distances I can add cruise control to the mix. Making minor adjustments to the steering wheel is completely different from the wrist&#x2F;fingertip stress of typing, and good posture when working at a desk requires being more upright, which in my experience ends up putting more stress on my back and neck also.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40107296" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40107296" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Swizec</span><span>|</span><a href="#40106972">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40107068">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40107720">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40107286">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40107296">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40107296">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To share an opposite anecdata: After many years of coding side projects and work projects, I no longer get a kick out of side projects.

This causes soot and cokes the intake valves, grid heater, etc.<p>- DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) which collects soot until it’s restricted, then burns fuel in the exhaust to cook the soot into ash.<p>- Catalytic converters &amp; SCR (selective catalytic conversion) which injects corrosive DEF (Diesel Exhaust Fluid&#x2F; cow piss) into the exhaust.<p>If you remove these systems from your vehicle, it won’t run, because the OEMs engine controls say if the DEF tank is empty or it’s throwing codes for EGR or DPF, it won’t get full power.<p>These shops sell a way to get around that, so you can take all these systems off your engine that kill longevity and efficiency, while not caring about the soot and NOx you’re emitting. A pre-emissions diesel will easily go for 300-400k miles without a rebuild, the modern ones break in really really expensive ways right about the time your warranty ends (60k)<p>I drive a modern diesel, I race motorcycles and I’ve got a heavy rig to tow to the track, and I’ve left my emissions in place. I don’t love the trade off, it does seem like the manufacturers took the easy way out and tuned their components for timed obsolescence just like the incandescent lightbulb. What these shops are doing is filling a request from owners in states that don’t emissions control these engines, but I guess federally they are breaking the law. Seems grey to me. The manufacturers are only selling the emissions controlled engines to comply with CA and MA and others, while the middle of the country doesn’t control these things.</div><br/><div id="41553750" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41553750" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">arghwhat</span><span>|</span><a href="#41553474">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41553675">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41553750">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41553750">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One thing that is quite important to note is that the EGR is a necessary combustion temperature regulator, and removing it isn’t good for anything, including fuel economy.

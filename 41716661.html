With some exceptions, the general pattern seems to be power users hanging out and answering questions on the company&#x27;s behalf. Who are these people?<p>Another support anti-pattern is an untrained offshore support team whose entire mission seems to be to close the case and move on. There is little in life more enraging than a support rep who refuses to engage logical brain and escalate based on clear evidence of a technology issue.<p>At my most successful startup, we had an extremely smart guy in the support seat; he was eager to learn from the dev team how to triage, and so we&#x27;d get bug reports complete with network tab screenshots, api paths which had caused an error, etc. He could easily have been a skilled programmer had he chosen to pursue it. When we were acquired, he was merged into a larger team that had much less autonomy, and his morale tanked over time.<p>The zendesk (&quot;here are articles that might be appropriate&quot;) approach sucks too, as do chatbots.<p>Perhaps fear of hallucinations is holding people back, but it seems like an LLM based product could take over the &quot;keep it cheap&quot; support vertical. 1) Have people file a report in their own words; 2) synthesize an answer for them, but only if the LLM identifies with high confidence that their report as being a known problem that has an answer; 3) cluster reports from users based on salient features and escalate new clusters to the tech team; 4) and if the company can afford it, route everything else to a human team who can categorize, click a few buttons, and send the LLM back with an answer, or escalate.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41748570" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41748570" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">echoangle</span><span>|</span><a href="#41748604">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41748216">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41748570">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41748570">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don’t even get the point, are Facebook developers supposed to deal with 500k support emails per day because grandma forgot her login?

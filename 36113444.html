Being a blind person, I rely on a website to be coded well enough to present all of its content to me. So I&#x27;m using the down arrow, using NVDA, or Caps lock + Right Arrow on Voiceover for Mac, going through the items. And I noticed that some items were surely being skipped. And sure enough, when I went back and navigated with the Tab key, there they were, all the <i>other</i> drinks that McDonald&#x27;s offers. I mean, it&#x27;s better than on the iPhone, where DoorDash is so awful that it sucks Kaiju dung, but goodness I wish UX folks would just leave stuff alone, or shoot just ask people &quot;Hey, is this what you want?&quot; or &quot;How can we actually improve this thing?&quot; or &quot;Hey, would this break things for you?&quot; I think the only reason why it works so well on Android is because no one has messed with it yet. No, don&#x27;t do it, please. I mean, Door dash is far from the only mess I&#x27;ve come across in my like 15 years using tech as a blind person, But some services, like InstaCart, Door dash, Uber, stuff like that, are a bit more important to be accessible than someone&#x27;s cat picture gallery. I mean, I wouldn&#x27;t mind awesome descriptions of cats either, don&#x27;t get me wrong. And honestly, I don&#x27;t know if the fault is with Voiceover and its rather bad web support, or NVDA, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s Door dash. And it didn&#x27;t used to do this. It used to be fine on web browsers on a computer.

They see that UXR has become disconnected from the business. Their belief is that understanding users isn&#x27;t necessary for making a good product, and that UX Researchers enjoy answering abstract questions around the user that are only marginally useful. They conclude that UX Research needs to to perform low-level user interviews, focus on non-user strategy(?), talk in executive-friendly terms, and prioritize the business above users-- in order to be relevant once again.<p>Ironically, the author is quick to provide answers that please executives, and slow to offer dangerous questions that would displease them.  Questions like how the company&#x27;s short-term optimization was causing a long-term loss on user retention. Or how certain executive-sponsored beliefs were hurting user trust. Researchers who ask those questions tend not to stick around too long, even before 2021. Those who remain self-select into safer &quot;middle&quot; research; they and their department have been pummeled into submission by the organization.<p>The author turns a blind eye to this corruption; the author points the finger at researchers, not executives. The author also forgets the history that users made the business successful [1]. Today, however, the internal hierarchies and forward momentum of many tech companies depends on a selective understanding of users [2]. Good research slows down that momentum, it aims for good-enough understanding, it asks important questions. And when important questions collide with the status quo, they are not tolerated.<p>Or to put in simple terms, from a chief of staff to a middle manager: &quot;Nevermind you &#x27;why&#x27;, why ain&#x27;t in your repertoire no more&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;before.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;before.html</a> &quot;Mark Zuckerberg didn&#x27;t succeed because he was an expert on startups.

But there is software where it is okay to have a little hurdle in the start if it means you are going to be so much more productive later. Ideally you will have both a low entrance barrier <i>and</i> a good usability when you use it day in, day out.

It almost sounds like user testing, which shouldn&#x27;t require a different hat. That&#x27;s just something you do to evaluate the product. Designers and developers do that anyway (hopefully).<p>What I did when I put on the &quot;researcher&quot; hat was (I guess, after reading this article) more akin to market research, but within the existing market.<p>For example, while working with a big holiday&#x2F;vacation company (operating flights + resorts), we uncovered that a significant portion of the customers staying at their &quot;family friendly&quot; resorts didn&#x27;t want to be there. They were typically couples who had done fairly adventurous trips when younger, then they&#x27;d married, and had kids. They hated the enclosed, catered, walled feeling of these resorts, but thought it&#x27;d be the best they could do with a newborn on their hands.<p>Awareness of this group of people might feel obvious today, but at the time it was a genuine discovery that lead to development of both services and marketing. While you might argue that the company gets their custom anyway, so what does it matter, the fact was that these people left the resort with low ratings, and a low opinion of the company, which they would announce to their peers in $important-demographic on social media and verbally. I.e., long-term damage to brand and customer retention. They freely chose to stay at the resort, and then felt resentment towards the company for it not being a mountain climbing holiday or whatever. It&#x27;s illogical, but that&#x27;s what they did.<p>Secondly, these types of discoveries can&#x27;t be produced predictably. Either there is something you don&#x27;t know about your customers or competitors, or there isn&#x27;t. Initial efforts might yield a lot, but perhaps there is a saturation point along the way, where more research of the same nature at that particular point in time will yield diminishing results? Well, that doesn&#x27;t matter, because these people have been hired to do research, so they will keep doing it, whether it&#x27;s useful or not.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the separation of design and research into different roles. To me, a designer should be able to go off and do research if it&#x27;s warranted. Maybe I&#x27;m old school, but separating it feels like separating a developer into two people: one whose only job is to find new libraries and read documentation, and one whose only job it is to type into an editor.<p>Thirdly, to those griping about &quot;UX ruined UI&quot;: it did not. UX is what got it to the point you&#x27;re imagining as &quot;good old days&quot;. What damages UX in the long run is shifting incentives (resulting in dark patterns) and a variation of the above, but on the design side: you needed a UX team of a certain size to get to the design you have, but you don&#x27;t need an engine of that size to maintain it. If your UX department is oversized, I suspect that they will start inventing tasks for themselves and do things that aren&#x27;t strictly benificial.<p>This goes for all roles, arguably. More people doesn&#x27;t equal more productivity, and at some ratio of number of people vs. real problems for them to tackle, the productivity becomes negative.<p>Also, a UX department as some kind of &quot;other entity&quot; is not a good setup either, in my opinion. In my experience, UX has worked best when it&#x27;s a cross-disciplinary focus rather than an isolated group of individuals imposing their will and &quot;owning&quot; the UI.<p>As a UX designer, your most important job is to get people who don&#x27;t regularly talk to each other into the same room. You don&#x27;t have to be the cleverest person in the room wrt UI, but you do have to be the person who can bring the user&#x27;s point of view into a room where other, equally important points of view, are represented. UX can&#x27;t be effectively done in isolation.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36114480" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36114480" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">m0llusk</span><span>|</span><a href="#36121791">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36114177">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36114480">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36114480">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Internationalization may contribute to this as it is increasingly necessary for businesses to seek clients globally, but ideas about what makes for simple, clear, easy processes varies hugely between countries.

When a department has served its useful purpose to the very specific goals of the business then the department gets discarded. When a company needs a design for a website, it pays for a UX designer. When the designs are finished, they fire the designer. Does that mean the business never needed a designer? No, instead, they believe that they _no longer_ need a designer, and continue to profit off of the work that the designer did for them.

In the 80s and 90s computers were marketed at professionals working in offices. Software was sold shrink-wrapped on disks. It was very costly to change software later (send disks?), you better tested it really, really carefully. The promise was often to make experts more efficient at their tasks: Software was customizable, had macro recorders and had a familiar interface of buttons, menus and docking sub-windows. Computers were used with keyboards and (finally!) mouse: Two very efficient input devices. People (including me) are nostalgic for that time, and that makes memory very selective: We probably remember the best software created by large companies with great teams. We also remember software created for specifically for professionals working with computers, many HN readers will be that people. And, last but not least, there were a lot of terrible UIs too, that we gladly forgot and for every fondly remembered non-standard, fun UI (bryce?) there are sooooo many terrible ones.<p>A lot of what irks people can be explained with shifts in how software got made, for which audience and for which devices: Having many small teams working independently makes a coherent vision for a product more difficult (but has other advantages), user customization became less important since products were more targeted to non-experts and it also can mess with your automated testing; moving to the web as main way to deliver software meant that some types of interactions (drag and drop, using large amounts of data directly) were harder to create than others; on the web, advertisement and subscription models became popular, leading to very different ways to advertise software in contrast to the former &quot;buy the bi-yearly upgrade in a big box&quot; and the web was more OS independent so the old one-system, one UI-standard did not match anymore.<p>So, a lot of what &quot;got worse&quot; can be explained by changes in the ecosystem that software-creation and software-use happens in and by the position of people that assume it &quot;got worse&quot;.<p>There are many things that I find worse now than in the 90s but this perspective can help to see if software got worse just for people similar to me and it can also help to find ways to make sustainable changes that fit the ecosystem that exists today.</div><br/><div id="36121764" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36121764" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">systemvoltage</span><span>|</span><a href="#36113839">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36115494">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36115102">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36121764">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36121764">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree, good things still exist when it is B2B or only designed for a highly trained or professional users.

Most of it tends to be ignored nowadays. Try teaching an old person how to use a smart phone some time. Just some bullet points:<p>* Apps feel generally disorganized. Buttons are unlabled. Many things are hidden somewhere between layers of unlabled buttons. In the past you could count on the menu bar giving you quick access to anything.<p>* Lack of functionality &#x2F; composability. Avoidance of the file system. Tunnel menus that you have to take one step at a time.<p>* Every program has UI that works and looks differently, made worse because even the same programs redesign their own UI periodically.<p>* Flat design. Lack of &#x27;affordances&#x27;. Buttons don&#x27;t look like buttons, draggable things don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re draggable. E.g. scroll bars in the past had this serration to suggest interaction. This leads to hidden features and surprises, where things that seem like static images suddenly hide important functionality.<p>* Lack of configurability. Configurable Toolbars, arrangeable view panes, tabs etc. And unnecessary limits even when you can configure things. Like, Firefox only has a list of preset zoom levels, to get finer zoom levels you have to go into about:config. Or the fact that it limits the size of tabs to a rather large minimum. For no reason at all.<p>* Lack of consistent (or even discoverable) keyboard navigation. Rebinding short cuts is not a thing anyone seems to care about anymore.<p>* Readability, use of space. This applies more to the web, but grey text, ultra-narrow columns, inconsistent scaling.</div><br/><div id="36115128" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36115128" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">amluto</span><span>|</span><a href="#36113839">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36114255">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36114792">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36115128">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36115128">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Buttons are unlabled.

I can say as a UI&#x2F;UX specialist myself, a lot of terrible design is due to not putting enough thought into the design and&#x2F;or not allowing UI&#x2F;UX engineers to do their jobs. I will also say that UI&#x2F;UX is very much an art as opposed to a science, and even the best designers can get it wrong or the final product will frustrate someone due to unexpected edge cases or accidental dark patterns. Some observations over the past two or so decades:<p>- Not engaging enough with the customer, i.e., finding out what they actually and truly need as opposed to pandering to their egos because they’re SMEs or whatnot
- Engaging too much with the customer by allowing them to have too much say in the design. I’ve seen it go so far as to allow the customer to actually make their own designs (wireframes or mockups, etc.) and then handing that off to the devs to implement, no questions asked, which ended up in a ton of rework for obvious reasons 
- Relying too heavily on frameworks  by allowing yourself to believe that you MUST use one of their built-in widgets or patterns and not create a custom solution that makes sense for the use case
- Somewhat contrary to the above, not relying enough on a given framework’s widgets or patterns which can lead to inconsistent design and UX and unnecessary reinventing the wheel
- The use of so-called no-code or low-code solutions: Not that these are bad per se, but it leads to the fallacy that a non-engineer (usually mid-level IT manager or “system analyst”) can use these tools to create a complete or even somewhat viable solution (I speak from experience)
- Sacrificing a good design for any reason, e.g., ad space requirements, various types of compliance (including even the virtuous ones such as Section 508)
- Relying on a framework to
do the UX for you, leading to another fallacy that you
don&#x27;t need a UX specialist<p>UX research still very much needs
to be a thing, and I don&#x27;t say
that because it benefits me (it
does), but because I wholeheartedly believe in the need for it. I wouldn&#x27;t design a house or even a
pool without the expertise of an architect, so why would an entire dev team build a multi-million dollar UI without a UI&#x2F;UX engineer?</div><br/></div></div><div id="36114365" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36114365" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lmeyerov</span><span>|</span><a href="#36114870">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36121510">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36114365">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36114365">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I find it interesting they cast data science as some sort of inherently wrong Other<p>When your profession views math on user &amp; business data as the enemy, and it&#x27;s for a business...</div><br/></div></div><div id="36121510" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36121510" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">graycat</span><span>|</span><a href="#36114365">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36114146">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36121510">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36121510">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What does UXR (user experience research) think of the user interface of, say, Hacker News or Google?</div><br/></div></div><div id="36114146" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36114146" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tootie</span><span>|</span><a href="#36121510">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36113884">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36114146">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36114146">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Macro research is to help determine what products to build and what users to target.

Or even a rarely-seen word like &quot;scabbard&quot; or &quot;ragamuffin&quot;? I was once at a luncheon with three Ph.D. students in the Chinese Department at Peking University, all native Chinese (one from Hong Kong). I happened to have a cold that day, and was trying to write a brief note to a friend canceling an appointment that day. I found that I couldn&#x27;t remember how to write the character 嚔, as in da penti 打喷嚔 &quot;to sneeze&quot;. I asked my three friends how to write the character, and to my surprise, all three of them simply shrugged in sheepish embarrassment. Not one of them could correctly produce the character. Now, Peking University is usually considered the &quot;Harvard of China&quot;.

I am no exception among Japanese native speakers. While the author seems to interpret this problem as something crucial, I question whether it truly is.<p>The orthography of Mandarin and Japanese includes an alphabet consisting of thousands of characters, the majority of which comprise dozens of strokes. Although East Asian people have higher IQ scores on average, we are not superhuman - our memory capacity is bound by human limits, and the decreased frequency of actually writing kanji on paper has naturally resulted in our forgetting how to write many of them. Is this surprising?<p>Furthermore, orthography is not part of language in a fundamental sense - it&#x27;s merely a useful tool that accompanies a language. Therefore, I do not see the writing system becoming less stable as a significant issue. Consider Korea as an example: they used to use kanji in their orthography but have almost completely eliminated it with virtually no adverse effects. While laypeople often assume orthography is an integral part of a language, this is just not the case from the linguistic perspective.</div><br/><div id="41965796" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41965796" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cedws</span><span>|</span><a href="#41965613">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41967101">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41965796">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41965796">[24 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m studying Japanese at the moment and what struck me is how important context is, particularly in reading.

Usually, when in a multi-kanji word, kanji are pronounced with (a time-changed version of) Chinese pronunciation. For example, 文法 is &quot;bun-pou&quot;, not &quot;fumi-nori&quot; or something else. However, the first character of the article title (fukurokoubunji), 袋, is &quot;fukuro&quot; here despite being in a four-kanji word. Further, 小 is &quot;kou&quot; here, which is nonstandard enough that its dictionary entry does not even list it as a possible pronunciation! [1] Then 路文 are both in Chinese pronunciation (ji-bun), but this does not necessarily make sense because the word is not split in two down the middle, but instead as 袋-小路-文 (bag-lane-sentence, where bag-lane is English cul-de-sac &#x2F; blind alley). [2]<p>Now fukurokoubunji is a bit of a specialised word, so it might not be a great example. But in the rest of the sentence, we find 文, which is always pronounced &quot;bun&quot; (sentence) here, even when appearing separately, but could also (though more rarely) have been &quot;fumi&quot; (letter) — nothing but semantical context helps distinguish. Then we have 正しい &quot;tada-shi-i&quot;, where 正 could have been &quot;sei&quot; as in 正確 &quot;sei-kaku&quot; (accurate) or &quot;shou&quot; as in 正直 &quot;shou-jiki&quot; (honest), but it isn&#x27;t just because しい come after. Similarly, 生 in 生じやすい is &quot;shou&quot;(-ji-ya-su-i), which is conjugated from the base form 生じる &quot;shou-ji-ru&quot; and could have been &quot;u&quot; (生まれる &quot;u-ma-re-ru&quot;) or &quot;sei&quot; (先生 &quot;sen-sei&quot;) or &quot;i&quot; (生きる &quot;i-ki-ru&quot;) or more (生 is somewhat infamous for having many readings). And I could go on: 書 could be &quot;syo&quot; (文書 &quot;bun-syo&quot;) but is &quot;ka&quot; (書き出して &quot;ka-ki-da-shi-te&quot; conjugated from 書く &quot;ka-ku&quot;).<p>This is a bit like the comments elsewhere here noting that the Chinese word for &quot;sneeze&quot; is a bad example because it happens to have so uncommon characters in it — and then people point to examples like &quot;onomatopoeia&quot; and &quot;diarrhoea&quot; as similar tricky examples in English.

Furthermore, vocational students are viewed as &quot;bad students&quot; and good faculty prefer to join academic high schools or private high schools due to a better salary and social standing. Furthermore, even SOE factories (the traditional hirer of vocational students) in China now prefer hiring college graduates instead of vocational students because of a glut of college graduates due to cultural shifts in the 2000s-2010s, anti-vocational student bias, and college graduates trying to get a stable &quot;iron rice bowl&quot; (to use the Korean term) government job.<p>&gt; I think you describe that it is very similar today in China after they banned the private tutoring a couple of years back. So, we are somehow back to “work hard on not to unequal grounds and your personal merit&#x2F;luck will determine your future”<p>I think that was the aim of the legislation, but in action it didn&#x27;t help social mobility much, because upper income households just resorted to private or online tutoring, and everyone ignores it.<p>It&#x27;s not like legislators send their kids to vocational schools - they also prefer to send them to academic or top private schools so that they can then attend university (either domestically or abroad).<p>&gt; but it does not seem to be “instrumented in a way to keep certain groups out of academia based on income or social standing”.<p>In face value it doesn&#x27;t, but in action urban academic high schools and primary schools get the lions share of funding, and until recently those are gatekept to people holding a hukou for that city.<p>This meant that urban migrants who weren&#x27;t able to convert their rural hukou to an urban hukuo (because that meant losing their rural landholdings which is the only asset of worth they have), and their kids were stuck either in underfunded rural schools or crappy private primary schools in an urban area.<p>This has a significant impact on social mobility to this day, and is a major reason why China&#x27;s median household income remains very low. Urban China&#x27;s median household income is $6,000, but rural China&#x27;s is around $3,000. This means the bottom half of urban society in China and much of rural China&#x27;s society does not have much of a chance of upward mobility because they can&#x27;t pay for private tutoring nor can they afford a good private high school if their kid fails the Zhongkao.</div><br/><div id="41962846" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41962846" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">looping__lui</span><span>|</span><a href="#41959717">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41962810">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41962483">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41962846">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41962846">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks!

As someone with experience using the Heisig method, I would strongly disagree.  Yes, it is a helpful system to ease the burden of memorization, but it does not permanently embed this knowledge into your memory after &quot;a handful of reviews over the following weeks&quot;.

It is likely that a great part of the traditional radicals would be suitable to be retained as classifiers, with perhaps a part of them omitted if redundant and a few other symbols added, if necessary.<p>Then the writing could be phonetic, but with classifier symbols attached to words, wherever the ambiguity makes them necessary.<p>This is not a new method. The oldest writing systems, like those of Egypt or Mesopotamia, also used classifier symbols (with meanings like: &quot;a kind of human&quot;, &quot;a kind of god&quot;, &quot;a kind of animal&quot;, &quot;a kind of stone&quot;, &quot;a kind of wood&quot;, &quot;a body part&quot;, &quot;a kind of tool&quot; and so on) attached to the words written phonetically, to avoid ambiguities.<p>If one would have to learn only 200 classifier symbols and with lower stroke counts than most symbols used now, that would be a great simplification.<p>Many of the Chinese characters are actually intended to be composed of two parts, a semantic classifier and a phonetic symbol, but this principle is applied too inconsistently and with too many variants, so the system can be greatly simplified by using a simple phonetic writing like Pinyin together with semantic classifiers inserted in the text only if they are necessary.</div><br/><div id="41967155" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41967155" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">latentsea</span><span>|</span><a href="#41962765">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41965924">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41963225">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41967155">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41967155">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think ambiguous homophones aren&#x27;t actually much of a problem.

However, with character sets the cycle is broken, and the speaker has to learn 3 different memorization techniques.<p>Regarding your question, there is a difference between not knowing how to write a word and not knowing how to spell a word. If someone in English doesn&#x27;t know how to spell &#x27;sneeze&#x27; or any other word, they can at least come close enough and convey information &#x27;fuzzily&#x27; via text using an incorrect spelling. Now that I&#x27;m writing this, though, I suppose with character sets like Chinese if you know characters that are close enough you potentially could use other characters to convey the information, like mouth-fart for sneeze or something along these lines.

First, they have 46 characters (each), not 56, though there are another 36 combination characters like ちゃ.  Regardless, the problem here is that number comes from the total number of allowed sounds in the entire language.  Japanese has an extremely small number of total possible sounds in the language compared to most other languages, particular western ones, and almost all syllables are of the form consonant+vowel: there&#x27;s basically no way to write, for instance, a word ending in a hard &quot;t&quot; sound, so when Japanese adopts such words, it adds a vowel ending like &quot;tu&quot;, and does this for every syllable with a hard consonant without a following vowel.  Because of this, loanwords can be really hard to recognize even if you&#x27;re a speaker of the language that word was adopted from (usually English these days), because the sounds don&#x27;t map over very well.<p>And because there&#x27;s so few total possible syllables, there&#x27;s a huge number of homophones.  The main reason kanji is still around is because it resolves ambiguity and makes it much, much easier to read Japanese text: trying to read text that&#x27;s all in hiragana (or katakana) is cumbersome, even if spaces are added (Japanese text doesn&#x27;t normally have spaces).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41966272" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41966272" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">w0de0</span><span>|</span><a href="#41965905">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41966569">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41966294">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41966272">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41966272">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I believe you mean the Ugarites, Phoenicians, &amp; other northwest Semitic peoples.

The Phoenician alphabet came later, around 1050 BCE, evolving from Proto-Sinaitic. It became a widely used script with 22 consonantal characters and was highly influential, serving as a foundation for both the Paleo-Hebrew and Greek alphabet. The Etruskan alphabet was adapted from the Greek alphabet in the 8th centry BCE and the Roman alfabet was adapted from the Etruskan alphabet in the 7th century.<p>Alphabets with 20–30 letters seem to be close to a neurolinguistic optimum for balancing simplicity with expressiveness.

The Khmer alphabet with 74 characters evolved from the ancient Pallava script, which was developed in Southern India around the 4th century CE. 
By the 7th century CE, the Khmer people had adapted the Pallava script, creating an early form of the Khmer script.

I&#x27;m a native Vietnamese, and I believe the language is perfectly phonetic.<p>If I hear a word, I can write it. If I see a word, I can pronounce it, regardless of whether I understand the meaning.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that among the 4 countries (China&#x2F;Japan&#x2F;Korea&#x2F;Vietnam), it&#x27;s the only one that completely reinvented the language into Latin based. I think that refactor addressed the phonetic issue well enough. When I was there, there was also no TV program for &quot;spelling bees&quot; or something like that. Even a third grader could read&#x2F;write almost any word (even when they don&#x27;t understand the text yet)<p>Edit: adding to this original post to reply a common theme people brought up in multiple posts.<p>I think bringing up dialects and provincial accents is not convincing. There is one official way &quot;gia đình&quot; should be pronounced. It&#x27;s taught in school, even in the South. Pronouncing it as &quot;da đình&quot; can still be understood, and it doesn&#x27;t retract from the point that the language is phonetic.<p>In other words, assuming I know nothing about the meaning of the word, if I hear &quot;da đình&quot; I can correctly write down it as so. I wouldn&#x27;t know that in Saigon that also means &quot;gia đình&quot;. But I definitely can write it down exactly.<p>I don&#x27;t think using provincial speaking accent is a good line of argument here. Otherwise, no language in the world can satisfy the phonetic requirements. Any group of people can have different accents, different tones, different sound length and pauses.</div><br/><div id="41967027" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41967027" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">maianhvu</span><span>|</span><a href="#41966901">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41967367">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41967027">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41967027">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; If I hear a word, I can write it.<p>Not if you account for variations of pronunciation in dialects. Not even the most phonetically accurate accent, the Hanoian Northern accent which I am a native speaker of, is perfect.<p>For example, you could hear Northern Vietnamese people say &quot;dổ&quot;, &quot;dá&quot; instead of &quot;rổ&quot;, &quot;rá&quot;. Morning dew is pronounced &quot;xương&quot; but is written as &quot;sương&quot;. These characters are pronounced with greater clarity in the Central and Southern regions, but they have their own peculiarities too. Til&#x27; this day I still find it iffy they call someone named &quot;Diễm&quot; as &quot;Yỉm&quot;. Unless you have seen the correct way to spell those words before, you can&#x27;t say for sure. Even now as a working adult I find myself referring to the dictionary to make sure my accent doesn&#x27;t embarrass me in official emails.<p>In a perfect world, we can have one single Vietnamese accent that aims to pronoun all these words true to the intended way of the alphabet, but it isn&#x27;t practical.

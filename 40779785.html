In that story, her husband ultimately breaks his wedding vows, forcing Undine to kill him, and losing her chance of going to heaven.<p>Andersen explicitly wrote that he found <i>that</i> ending too depressing, which is why he made up his whole bit about Ariel refusing to kill Prince Erik, and instead of dying, she turned into a spirit of the air, where if she does good deeds for 300 years, she&#x27;s eventually allowed to go to heaven after all.<p>Even as a child, it felt like a cop-out to me. But my point was: “The Little Mermaid” is itself a sanitized version of the original novella, adapted to the author&#x27;s modern sensibilities.</div><br/><div id="40784912" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40784912" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dirkt</span><span>|</span><a href="#40782285">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40784364">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40784912">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40784912">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; But Andersen&#x27;s story was itself a sanitized version of Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué&#x27;s “Undine”<p>Now I got curious.

Basically the only similarity is that it is about a mermaid and a prince&#x2F;knight, and the (potential) death of the prince&#x2F;knight at the end.

The original is more an allegory about how changing everything about yourself is actually <i>bad</i> than the fairy tale romance that Disney pitches, which is not AT ALL what I expected.<p>There&#x27;s real benefit to exposing kids to darker themes (my eldest loves a book that kills its main character&#x27;s father on the second page, and after she recovered from being a little weepy about it, it became one of her favorites), but there&#x27;s also merit to letting the kids choose to hit pause on scary&#x2F;disturbing&#x2F;whatever themes until they&#x27;re in a place to deal with it.<p>Showing your kids The Two Towers might have a really positive impact on them at the right time, but only if they&#x27;re mature enough that it doesn&#x27;t lead to e.g. bed-wetting levels of dis-regulation.</div><br/><div id="40784636" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40784636" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tpmoney</span><span>|</span><a href="#40781945">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40784416">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40784636">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40784636">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; chiefly, the subtext seems to be &quot;it&#x27;s totally ok to change everything about yourself to win the affection of a boy you literally just met&quot;<p>I <i>really</i> object to this relatively modern interpretation of the Disney movie. For all the perfectly valid flaws in Disney movies, this one is far off the mark that I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s become so popular, or why even Disney themselves leaned into it.<p>Ariel in the Disney movie is obsessed with &quot;land culture&quot; long before she ever meets Eric or &quot;falls in love&quot;. She has a massive collection of trinkets and artifacts, of which she only has as surface level understanding at best, and a flawed mistranslated one at worst. She&#x27;s missing family functions for her obsession. She is basically a &quot;weeb&quot; for human culture. Yes, she gets herself love struck when she goes to the surface, but she already wanted to be up there. Her &quot;I want&quot; song comes before she&#x27;s ever laid eyes on Eric. She&#x27;s got plans to move, and she&#x27;s already chafing under her father. Falling &quot;in love&quot; with Eric might be the instigating incident, but she already wants to make a change and get up there. Also bear in mind that she doesn&#x27;t know anything about Eric at all, she&#x27;s not &quot;changing herself to win the affections of a boy she just met&quot;, they haven&#x27;t met at all. She&#x27;s obsessed and made up a fantasy in her head. Again to continue with the weeb analogy, this is like a hypothetical weeb going to an &quot;Atarashii Gakko&quot; concert and deciding they&#x27;re in love with one of the singers and they&#x27;re moving to Japan to be with them. It has nothing to do with &quot;love&quot; or &quot;affection&quot; and it&#x27;s all about the obsession.<p>Ursula leverages this and the recent fights Ariel has had with Triton to trick her into signing the contract, but again this is about fueling an unrequited (and unknown) obsession, not about trying to do something that she has any reason to believe Eric would be asking of her. And then the ENTIRE rest of the movie drives home the point that she doesn&#x27;t need to change anything about herself. Remember, Eric is obsessed, with a girl with a pretty voice. He doesn&#x27;t think Ariel is the girl he&#x27;s interested in at all. But he falls &quot;in love&quot; with her, the person she is, no changes required. Her lack of voice isn&#x27;t whats appealing to him. Her legs aren&#x27;t what&#x27;s appealing to him. It&#x27;s her personality, her whole self and she&#x27;s limited to only being able to express herself as herself via her personality because her captivating voice (and the thing Eric supposedly was in love with) she&#x27;d given up. In the end the message isn&#x27;t &quot;change yourself to win affection&quot; it&#x27;s quite literally &quot;you are good enough as you are for the right person, even when&#x2F;if your &#x27;love at first sight&#x27; attributes (like your singing voice) are lost&quot;<p>If one&#x27;s kids come away from Little Mermaid believing it&#x27;s ok to change themselves for someone else&#x27;s affections, one needs to make sure those kids are getting more critical media analysis practice, and maybe also a few sit down talks on their feelings of inadequacy.</div><br/><div id="40785646" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40785646" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sgift</span><span>|</span><a href="#40781945">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40784636">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40784416">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40785646">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40785646">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for spelling this out.

Takes parental guidance of course.<p>I also grew up on the version of Little Red Riding Hood where they actually get eaten and the hunter has to cut them out of the wolf after killing it. It was one of my favorite stories growing up because bad things happen but they get rescued.<p>Anyway I think my argument is that bad stuff exists and you can&#x27;t hide it from kids, but you have to guide them in how to process and have some uncomfortable conversations sometimes.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40785802" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40785802" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">trustno2</span><span>|</span><a href="#40781125">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40780644">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40785802">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40785802">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just read them Leviticus and Deuteronomy</div><br/><div id="40785804" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40785804" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Vecr</span><span>|</span><a href="#40785802">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40780644">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40785804">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40785804">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Numbers too?</div><br/><div id="40786131" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40786131" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">trustno2</span><span>|</span><a href="#40785802">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40785804">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40780644">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40786131">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40786131">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s just to make them fall asleep</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40780644" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40780644" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ChrisMarshallNY</span><span>|</span><a href="#40785802">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40781033">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40780644">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40780644">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was always partial to the Looney Tunes&#x27; Hansel and Gretel.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uCwas_GPBxU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uCwas_GPBxU</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40781033" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40781033" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wonder_er</span><span>|</span><a href="#40780644">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40781049">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40781033">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40781033">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve been reading the original brother&#x27;s grimm to kids for _years_ and the stories are always gripping.

Besides, I don&#x27;t know if I would trust historical stats for suicide, but whatever.<p>Also the GP comment was arguably more about sanitized childhood in general, which is a more gradual trend than starting at the 1900s exactly.</div><br/><div id="40781010" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40781010" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tptacek</span><span>|</span><a href="#40780460">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40780956">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40780899">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40781010">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40781010">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The reason you look at suicide and violent crime is that they&#x27;re clear indicators. Diagnosis of mental illness is not: definitions, diagnostic techniques, and access to diagnoses have changed radically over the last 100 years. It&#x27;s similar (though less rigorous, for several reasons) to homicide being the gold standard crime statistic.<p>I&#x27;m not making a claim that mental health doesn&#x27;t matter if it doesn&#x27;t result in suicide or incarceration. I&#x27;m saying: those are two sets of numbers you can find going back to the intervention (the sanitization of fairy tales) and trace since then.<p>The story those numbers tells doesn&#x27;t match the just-so story the comment provides. Maybe there&#x27;s more going on than those numbers represents! But I think you&#x27;ll have a tough time supporting that argument with facts. For instance: the claim was made across the thread that suicide levels were artificially suppressed in 1900 because of religious norms, which works against the story; moreover: you can see in the actual charts what suicide tracks with (it&#x27;s not a smooth line).</div><br/><div id="40781153" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40781153" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jackpirate</span><span>|</span><a href="#40780460">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40781010">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40781130">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40781153">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40781153">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think you&#x27;re wrong.<p>Suicide does not have stable reporting rates.

The first edition wasn&#x27;t even available in English until relatively recently, and they went through continuous change. The first editions weren&#x27;t even meant to be suitable for children <i>at the time</i>, so it&#x27;s kind of weird to insist that that&#x27;s the version that kids need today.<p>This recent translation means English readers probably have <i>better</i> access to the original Grimm tales than they ever had before! Which is of course a good thing.

Even in the 19th century people thought these stories were too dark for kids, which is why there was commercial success in selling shorter, lighter, more family-friendly versions, which the Grimms did. I don&#x27;t think these stories would be awful for a bright 12 year old to read or anything, but the implication throughout is that these were considered kid-friendly in the past, which they weren&#x27;t, at least in their original versions.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;2014&#x2F;nov&#x2F;12&#x2F;grimm-brothers-fairytales-horror-new-translation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;2014&#x2F;nov&#x2F;12&#x2F;grimm-brothers...</a></div><br/><div id="40785565" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40785565" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">peoplefromibiza</span><span>|</span><a href="#40780858">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40782296">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40780992">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40785565">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40785565">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The first edition wasn&#x27;t even available in English<p>Does it even matter?<p>The Grimm brothers were German, the books in German do exist.<p>Pinocchio is an Italian work, in Italy it&#x27;s always been available and a huge success, does it matter if the english version came out much later?<p>To me the fact that they have become available, shows that the interest among the English readers has grown.<p>&gt; &quot;actually the original Grimms&#x27; stories were pretty dark&quot;<p>&gt; kids should be exposed to the earliest, least expurgated versions of the story possible, which is very odd.<p>I read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as a kid, it&#x27;s pretty dark too, but I loved it.

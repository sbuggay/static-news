Both in what points to survey, and in how to treat the points. The reference term here is TIN or Triangulated Irregular Network. Automated software does a fair job of building TINs, but the resulting contour lines can in some areas represent detail or features that don&#x27;t really exist.<p>For example in the author&#x27;s contour maps under the &quot;Finally, The Mapping&quot; section, much of the leftmost half is particularly sparse in measured points and as a result, the contour lines have interpolated some wacky humps-and-hollows across that half of the land, at least some of which probably don&#x27;t exist in reality. (Technically speaking, long skinny triangles = not ideal, particularly at large scale; and separately, another key word or concept to look into is that of topographical &quot;breaklines&quot;)<p>Ultimately, the specific arrangement of triangles in the TIN defines how the contour lines will be drawn. Good starting data is half the equation, and the other half is how you TIN it.</div><br/><div id="38829700" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38829700" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bendauphinee</span><span>|</span><a href="#38829618">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38830044">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38829700">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38829700">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yup! And the TIN Mesh Creation in QGIS was the first way I played with to model the terrain too, though I was less happy with how it looked. It&#x27;s useful for me to see where the data is too sparse, but not a great view of the land itself.<p>You&#x27;re correct, my data is still too sparse in some areas to give a good set of contours. It&#x27;s been fun to see how the contours change as I add more data to the survey. It&#x27;s part of the reason I decided to buy my own gear, because then I can spend as much time collecting data as I want without more cost.</div><br/><div id="38830014" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38830014" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crtified</span><span>|</span><a href="#38829618">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38829700">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38830044">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38830014">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38830014">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This old forum thread details a similar project I did (on the data side) for somebody about 10 years ago.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.overclockers.com.au&#x2F;threads&#x2F;calling-all-sketchup-pro-users.1109279&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.overclockers.com.au&#x2F;threads&#x2F;calling-all-sketc...</a><p>Quite outdated now in many respects - and using work software worth thousands, at the time!

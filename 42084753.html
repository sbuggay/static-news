The truth is, everyone needs to be organized somehow, and this is why we invent methodologies, frameworks, processes - call it whatever you want - but we all need some form of organization.<p>The problem is that some methodologies (Scrum, etc.) are heavily abused and transformed into management frameworks, which is the opposite of why they were created in the first place. But do you know how Agile was invented? It was a group of software developers, tired of heavy management processes, who came together to decide how to make their processes lightweight. Less is more.<p>Just as one example: 
&gt; &quot;We don’t do Figma mocks. We don’t write PRDs. We don’t really have a design system. We don’t do agile.&quot;.
Well, right from the Agile manifesto:
&gt; &quot;Working software over pointless documentation.&quot;<p>So it sounds like we&#x27;ve come full circle. That&#x27;s really a pity. I wonder how we can break the cycle. I also think we should take a look at the original ideas in the old-school methodologies (Agile, etc.) because they’re not bad, just abused. They were created 20 years ago by people who were in the same situation we are in now, so there&#x27;s a lot of wisdom there that shouldn&#x27;t be outright rejected.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42085025" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42085025" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hahahacorn</span><span>|</span><a href="#42085390">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42085265">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42085025">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42085025">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Good stuff in here, but be cautioned that the author doesn’t mention their customers are engineers until a bit later in.

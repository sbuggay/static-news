However I don&#x27;t think the comparison to the music industry is necessarily correct.<p>A lot of managers in tech got there because they are technically strong. We can argue about whether that&#x27;s correct or not but I think that&#x27;s typically the case. People who perform well as engineers are the ones who are given leadership opportunities. People who do not are not.<p>So first challenge is given you were maybe one of the smarter hires, of some smart people that tried to hire people smarter than themselves (let&#x27;s assume), how do <i>you</i> hire people smarter than yourself? at scale?<p>Where we end up typically in successful tech companies is with some degree of a mix of trying to make &quot;folks at the pointy end successful&quot; and some degree of &quot;telling the folks at the pointy end what to do&quot;. Usually managers and directors are very strong technically and quite sharp, though more distant from the actual work because they don&#x27;t do it any more. The precise mix depends on culture and circumstances but it&#x27;s almost never this ideal environment of servant leaders surrounded by immense talent and just facilitating that talent doing great things.<p>I&#x27;ve been in places that are very close to the &quot;good&quot; end of this spectrum and there&#x27;s still going to be some pause in giving feedback to leadership that they&#x27;ve done something wrong. Maybe you have a great relationship with your lieutenants where they can be openly critical of you and you reinforce that. I think that&#x27;s highly unusual in a social environment. It&#x27;s a lot more likely there are certain things they won&#x27;t share with you because they estimate the damage to the relationship is larger than the utility of being open.<p>EDIT: I misread your statement about hiring people smarter than yourself, so I think we agree there. The problem is still that if you&#x27;re the smartest person there&#x27;s a bit of tension between that and creating conditions for the people under you to be successful. Btw, I still think you should try and hire people smarter than yourself ;) it&#x27;s just hard to impossible to scale that - as you point out.</div><br/><div id="42224961" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42224961" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">inopinatus</span><span>|</span><a href="#42223920">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42224884">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42224672">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42224961">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42224961">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t want to rebut anything you say, but I will add one observation.<p>&gt; I think that&#x27;s highly unusual in a social environment<p>Agreed, but in my experience of startups particularly, this becomes more commonplace with older founders.

And also people may switch from one category to the other transiently, because of other pressures etc. In summary, in my own practice, while I am opinionated, I have never given negative feedback either to managers or subordinates. Not that they were all perfect, but I found it is usually up to me to work with the people and their strengths and weaknesses and by focusing on strengths I have not corrected any weakness, but have often made them irrelevant to me. Some may say this is a weakness for a leader, and I would agree but still focus on my other strengths.<p>Edit: an additional consideration as I am digesting my response. People are more open to discussing how to improve a process or a system rather than a person or even more so themselves. Feedback is sometimes personal, that&#x27;s why things like post mortems, process reviews etc. can work miracles when we manage to keep them about the process or framework rather than the people who are assigned to them.<p>An additional slightly cynical point on feedback received as a subordinate (no matter how high up you most probably report to someone unless you are at the top). If someone gives you feedback about what you should do to get promoted&#x2F;a raise etc , you are 90% not going to get those even if you heed to the feedback. These things happen for things you do, and the broader perception of yourself not on the basis of a checklist, and if they use a checklist against you, they don&#x27;t really care about You. If someone mentors you, you will get it.

Not in an environment of trust and respect.<p>Or with an enterprise customer, where &quot;business politeness&quot; is expected, trying to gain advantage is expected, and no one expects you to be very honest.<p>(Exception: In some cultures, it might be outright rude and mutually awkward to ever say anything critical-sounding upwards, or to offend someone by not going through the politeness motions, which would just be disrespectful.  The article seems to be coming from some kind of environment or social expectations like that.  I&#x27;m not talking about that here.  I&#x27;m talking about, say, a US tech business environment that at least thinks it values speaking up with honest assessments.)<p>Ideally, management welcomes straight talk, and will do the right thing with it.<p>For example, if you&#x27;ve not been given reason to think the person above you is dishonest or unreasonable, and they haven&#x27;t been given reason to think that about you, but you don&#x27;t yet know them well, here&#x27;s an example:<p>&quot;The team is having some serious difficulty.

First, I think that people are feeling that they don&#x27;t have a good understanding of what the goals are, and how they&#x27;re supposed to be prioritizing, on a daily basis.  The other thing that seems to be bothering people is that onboarding is rough, and people immediately feel like they&#x27;re not doing well, and then they aren&#x27;t getting out of that feeling.&quot;<p>Note that this might sound a bit like some of the diplomatic framing of the article, in that it&#x27;s not accusatory, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m doing.

Also one that I cherrypicked because I was actually right. I’ve had plenty of managers who were good at listening, however, I think most have been great. I have also worked management a few years myself and taken education in that direction before figuring out it wasn’t for me, so I certainly understand the financial and political parts of management and that you as an employee never have the full picture.<p>That being said, I have also had managers that I’ve played board games with on our free time who I haven’t actually given my opinion on certain issues with because they weren’t very good at taking that advice. Sometimes I’ve also not done it because I knew managers of my manager wouldn’t take it well if it made I up the chain. I view this more as an issue between me and the organisation I work for. If I’m not invested I’m not going to help it beyond what they pay me to do because it rarely comes back to me in a positive way.<p>There are many aspect to it. I’ve also had a manager who was a total waste of space as a manager, only caring about the “good story” whether it was true or not to push their own career. Who was also rather cold in regards to management employee duties since they really didn’t like the negative sides of it. Who was then the warmest nicest person in their personal life.<p>So it’s a very complex situation as you pointed out, but it’s also one where it’s perfectly reasonable to not try to lead upwards if you don’t want the hassle.

And remember that everything is a trade off. For example, perhaps they&#x27;re incredibly busy, and would like to spend more time with new hires, but are struggling to find time because they aren&#x27;t getting enough blocks of concentration time to work out clear priorities and they have been told they need to give their trusted colleague more opportunities to grow so they delegated it to someone.<p>Most likely, if you think something is a problem then they do too.

They knew that this course of action would cause problems.  The reason that they went ahead anyway was because they believed that the problems caused by the other courses of action available to them would be worse.<p>Of course, there are situations this advice does not apply, maybe the leader genuinely is clueless or evil or mistaken about the severity of a problem, but a good leader when presented with a problem elsewhere needs to start from a position of respect and learning and if you want to give advice to a leader you should start by trying to model good leadership yourself.</div><br/><div id="42224506" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42224506" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cdavid</span><span>|</span><a href="#42223980">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42224576">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42224506">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42224506">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Imagine the difference between &quot;I want to give you feedback that you aren&#x27;t spending enough time with new hires&quot; vs &quot;I know you&#x27;ve been wanting to spend more time with the new hires, why don&#x27;t you take them for lunch and send me to your status meeting over Tuesday lunch time this week.&quot;<p>This is the proper answer.

This is due to the inherent power dynamics in organizations and the potential negative consequences. Here&#x27;s why:<p>- <i>Power Differentials</i>: Organizations have vertical structures where bosses have more power, authority, and responsibility [1-3]. This means that certain behaviors, like giving feedback, are reserved for those in higher positions [3].<p>- <i>Risk of Negative Reaction</i>: Even if a boss claims to be open to feedback, they might react negatively, consciously or subconsciously, to criticism from their subordinates [4-6]. This can lead to:<p>- <i>Damaged Relationships</i>: The boss may view the feedback as insubordination or a lack of respect, straining the relationship [7].
Stalled Career Progress: The boss may hold a grudge, potentially impacting future promotions or opportunities [7].<p>- <i>Job Security</i>: In extreme cases, giving unsolicited feedback could even lead to termination [8].<p>- <i>Misinterpretation and Misunderstanding</i>: Bosses often interpret upward feedback as a challenge to their authority or a lack of understanding of the complexities of their role [9, 10]. They might feel that the direct is overstepping their boundaries or does not have enough experience to offer valid criticisms [11].<p>- <i>Breakdown of Hierarchy</i>: Allowing upward feedback can blur the lines of authority and lead to a situation where directs feel empowered to dictate their boss&#x27;s actions [9]. This can create chaos and undermine the effectiveness of the team.<p>- <i>False Sense of Openness</i>: Many bosses want to believe they are open to feedback, but in reality, very few are truly capable of handling it maturely and constructively [12, 13]. Their initial openness might just be a facade that crumbles when faced with actual criticism [14].<p>The sources highlight that while it&#x27;s tempting to give upward feedback, especially with good intentions, it&#x27;s generally unproductive and carries significant risks. They advocate for focusing on alternative approaches like offering suggestions during brainstorming sessions or providing input through formalized channels like 360 reviews, while exercising extreme caution even in those situations.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42224133" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42224133" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fny</span><span>|</span><a href="#42223921">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42224435">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42224133">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42224133">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">These are all rhetorical techniques to make your idea <i>their</i> idea.

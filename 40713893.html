The treatment for depression is kind of &quot;throw stuff against the wall and see what works&quot;, because while different treatments target different parts of the brain, if someone comes in with depression we often don&#x27;t know what the underlying etiology of that depression is.<p>I suffer(ed) from chronic depression, and I&#x27;d get &quot;bouts&quot; of severe episodes every 5-6 years or so. I was very fortunate in that ketamine infusion therapy was a complete and amazing godsend for me - it was like it fixed a switch in my head. But I know other people with chronic depression that did ketamine therapy that got no benefit (but at least in one case they did get a lot of benefit from a different treatment, TMS, transcranial magnetic stimulation). My point is that basically everyone in the field of psychiatry knows that some interventions work great for some people while having no effect on others.

In fact, they note that stimulant use was vastly higher in the ADHD group, because obviously you need an ADHD diagnosis to receive ongoing stimulant prescriptions. It&#x27;s a delicate topic, but we know that stimulant use in some cases is associated with changes in brain structure and blood flow. It&#x27;s a huge variable that is hard to control for in a study like this.<p>Overall, I don&#x27;t find a study with 31 ADHD patients that tested dozens and dozens of different variables to be all that conclusive.

Even where the physical cause is unknown, there&#x27;s still this symptom-cause distinction.<p>In the case of mental disorders, they&#x27;re essentially defined by the symptoms. To have depression is to be depressed. To have anxiety is to be anxious.

There&#x27;s no &#x27;objective&#x27; line between being sad and being depressed so while we clearly can and should treat depression, it seems to be very different from other diseases.<p>None of this is to take away from the real suffering people undergo with these disorders.

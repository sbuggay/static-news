While US has excellent education, and immigrant children in America do better than their counterparts in their countries of origin, they don’t do as well as the modal group of white Americans, so as the composition changes, and the whites become less of a statistically dominating factor, the scores are expected to go down, even as the education quality improves.</div><br/><div id="42380475" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42380475" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hervature</span><span>|</span><a href="#42380067">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42380190">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42380475">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42380475">[119 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you for the high quality comment.

Like so many things, schools are a public commons &#x2F; good &#x2F; investment in functioning society that a given goal should be determined, books kept, waste prosecuted (criminally), and services provided according to a defined standard.  Then whatever that costs rolls into the next budget as the base tax rate for that year.<p>Which is entirely not how things are run right now.

As a long-serving business owner I accept that some level of waste is a cost of doing business.<p>There are several problems with the concept of &quot;waste&quot;.<p>firstly it&#x27;s most obvious in hindsight. It&#x27;s much less obvious in foresight. We spend money with an objective in mind, and in some number of times we fail to meet that objective.<p>Take marketing as an example. It costs money to attend an event. Will we get a return? sometimes no.<p>Of course the easiest way to avoid waste is simply not to take risks, not to spend anything. If we prioritize &quot;avoid waste&quot; we create an environment where &quot;nothing is attempted&quot;.<p>Your suggestion to criminalize this with personal accountability makes things worse. What you&#x27;ll get is no money spent at all, because the risk of spending -any- money could see you in jail.<p>Secondly, in order to criminalize waste you need to detect it, measure it, prosecute it, defend it, and so on. None of that comes cheap. So you spend money to save money?<p>Of course we already do this to some extent. We keep books. We have audits. If we detect waste we might examine it, consider alternatives, learn lessons to avoid it. But that&#x27;s a long long way from the costs of criminal prosecution.<p>Thirdly you create perverse incentives for bad actors. Don&#x27;t like a teacher? Accuse them of waste. You can probably find some cause. Your competitor got a contract at a local school? Be sure to loudly proclaim that as waste because you &quot;would have done it cheaper&quot;. Sure you would do a crap job that may have failed in 2 years instead of 20, but who&#x27;s to say?<p>Send a few teachers to jail - does that increase or decrease the likelihood of people growing up wanting to be teachers?<p>So yeah, I dislike waste. But preventing waste comes with a price, not just in money. Be careful in what you choose to optimize.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42384234" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42384234" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rahimnathwani</span><span>|</span><a href="#42380067">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42384129">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42384208">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42384830">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42384234">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42384234">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">GP talked about charter schools as being non-secular.

They may get a lot of <i>practice</i> with fractions or multiple-digit arithmetic, but the basic procedures are not <i>new</i> to them in 4th grade.  It seems to me that the U.S. educational system is underserving these kids quite significantly by not catering to their potential and actual skills for mathematical reasoning, which while not fully developed (and very much tied to &quot;concrete&quot; skillsets, as opposed to a real capacity for abstraction) are still quite substantial.</div><br/><div id="42385428" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42385428" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seanmcdirmid</span><span>|</span><a href="#42380067">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42382794">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42383143">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42385428">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42385428">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is a strong push in many districts to delay algebra until high school, since many students are ready for it much earlier but would get an advantage over students who aren’t ready for it.

Just look at the environment and global warming and what we are doing as a species to stop that.
You also have to consider how covid lockdowns further split class divides. Since we didn’t produce as many things for 3 years there are less things to go around which causes the price of things to go up, hence inflation. Those who belong to unions and have higher leverage (tech workers, MBAs, etc) can push for higher wages to keep up for inflation but those who do not have that leverage are left behind and become poorer.<p>Im a little bit worried about the reverberations of covid which are causing global instability, and possibly war.

My original point that in order to answer this question, you have to distinguish between these groups so that you don’t fall victim to composition fallacy, is largely  orthogonal to any discussion about the causes of these disparities, because it still stands regardless of whether the causes are 100% biological or 100% cultural or 100% result of systemic discrimination or whatever.<p>&gt; Unless you make the racist claim that math skills biologically depend on race, there is no reason to compare some Americans with people in Africa because they have similar skin color - it&#x27;s absurd.<p>You are creating a really weird straw man, because I don’t think that even extreme KKK-style racists have much of an issue with skin color per se.

The previous estimate of heritability of things like intelligence are entirely unaffected by GWAS results.

Pre-GWAS tools would in that case find something like 0.9 heritability (due to attenuation because of measurement error). Now imagine you run a GWAS that includes only 1% of SNPs of the entire genome, and your intelligence proxy is “has any university diploma”, instead of more accurate measures like eg IQ. In that scenario, you would never expect the GWASes to get even close to actual heritability.<p>This is where we are today: our genome coverage is relatively low (especially around rare variants), while the metrics we have are crude. Of course we are not even close to heritability estimates!

I guess nothing is wrong with this approach, as indeed only a small percentage of people would use maths harder than Common Core day in and day out.

Apparently it&#x27;s now an Android tablet?<p>It was a pretty huge failure. They couldn&#x27;t produce a laptop as cheap as they initially wanted, power infrastructure to recharge them was just not there, and most importantly, the prime belief of &quot;just give everyone a computer and education will magically improve&quot; of technologists has not born out at all.<p>The vast majority of &quot;technology&quot; that got injected into classrooms has had zero impact. Your average teacher is not given the time, material, money, or experience to leverage the technology in a way that multiplies their ability to educate.<p>My mother is a renowned teacher in the state, since about the late 80s, and lived through both the proliferation of technology in education in general, and specifically the &quot;MLTI&quot; program that gave every single Maine middle school student a personal iBook laptop to use. In the 80s, she learned how to program BASIC in school. In the 90s, she used the nascent internet, before Google, to research my sister&#x27;s medical condition to discover treatments and support and resources despite literal poverty and living 500 miles from the nearest hospital that even had familiarity with the problem. In the 2000s, she digitized her gradebook and started to keep in touch with parents through regular email, and learned how to use digital tools to build tests and homework assignments. During the 2010s, she had an entire corpus of digital test systems that could autogenerate completely new and distinct tests from a single click. Over COVID, she attempted to teach herself OBS to improve the production quality of her remote lessons. Despite her empirical experience with tech in education, despite her outright buy-in of new techniques to improve her teaching, despite her willingness to learn new methods, none of it really improved her ability to teach a body of students a lesson.<p>The vast majority of teachers in all the schools in northern Maine had <i>less</i> aptitude with tech than she did and barely used any of the tech, and NONE of their lessons were less useful for it. The best use of &quot;tech&quot; I experienced during education was ONE teacher using a shared notebook application to digitize their entire lesson into digital notes that were automatically distributed to the class in a nice way that could be referenced, and that did not educate students better than a Xerox&#x27;d handout.<p>Tech is simply not a force multiplier in education. It&#x27;s almost entirely a farce in fact. Khan academy has probably helped a few people improve their understanding on a few topics, but it&#x27;s been two decades since Ivy League colleges first offered massively open online classes, and they have not moved any needle on education, as this very article shows.<p>The reality is that motivated people who <i>want to learn</i> haven&#x27;t been hurting for information access since the proliferation of public libraries. Even in my shithole, dead end rural town, we had a Carnegie library that could borrow a book on any topic from most other libraries across the country. Any book that existed could be yours within a week or so. By the 90s, digital encyclopedias were in vogue and also pretty good.<p>The primary difficulty in teaching children anything is motivation. You can&#x27;t really teach a child that doesn&#x27;t want to learn. Kids in the US want to learn less than they previously did. Part of this is that education is no longer seen as an easy way to money, with those kids instead thinking they&#x27;ll just become fortnite streamers or influencers or grifters. The large cohort of children of evangelical and fundamentalist families have never had it easier to deny things taught to children either, as we are seeing an outright anti-intellectualism we haven&#x27;t seen since the scopes-monkey trial. Kids see their parents diss education. Kids don&#x27;t think education is important.</div><br/><div id="42384403" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42384403" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">threatofrain</span><span>|</span><a href="#42379745">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42381916">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42382617">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42384403">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42384403">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I just want to say that Khan Academy can&#x27;t be compared to major universities releasing <i>some</i> of their content in a spotty way.

The popularity of YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and casual games is a <i>consequence</i> of declining literacy, not a cause.  The real cause was the abandonment of phonics in favor of whole-word approaches to teaching reading in the early 2000s.

Based on the latest numbers I could find, funding per pupil was $15,591 in 2022. Because of &quot;cost disease&quot;, I would hypothesis that it makes sense to adjust for GDP per capita (a teacher in Poland might be just as good as a teacher in America but paid but be paid ~4x less and the primary cost in education is labor). GDP per capita in 2022 was $77,246. So per pupil we spend ~(15,591&#x2F;77,246) people worth of labor on their education or .201 of a person.<p>I notice Norway is on the list ahead of us and I often see them being called out as a country with policies and outcomes that are more close to ideal (although to be honest Asian countries dominate the list!) so let&#x27;s look at their ration..<p>In 2023 Norway spend $18,207 per pupil while gdp was 87,961 so the ratio there was (18,207&#x2F;87,961) or .206 of a person. You might say this is higher and it&#x27;s true but.. it&#x27;s very close to us and if you use 2022 numbers Norway comes in dramatically below .201.<p>---<p>Another way to analyze things would be by US state while hoping that states would have more in common than countries and knowing that states have dramatically different spending budgets per pupil (see here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;worldpopulationreview.com&#x2F;state-rankings&#x2F;per-pupil-spending-by-state" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;worldpopulationreview.com&#x2F;state-rankings&#x2F;per-pupil-s...</a> the difference is three fold from top to bottom). <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;best-states&#x2F;rankings&#x2F;education&#x2F;prek-12&#x2F;naep-math-scores" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;best-states&#x2F;rankings&#x2F;education&#x2F;p...</a> shows math attainment by state.<p>Right off the bat you will notice that Utah spends the least amount of money per pupil and has the second highest average score while New York has the highest spend and comes in 23rd place.<p>---<p>I recognize that the data I found is not in any way comprehensive, but do you have any data which indicate that I&#x27;m wrong and the issue really does have to do with underfunding?</div><br/><div id="42382425" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42382425" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bvirb</span><span>|</span><a href="#42379745">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42380251">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42380164">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42382425">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42382425">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think it&#x27;s possible that your numbers of amount spent per pupil don&#x27;t take into account the total benefit to that pupil towards their education.

The HCOL city I currently live in has (supposedly) poor public schools and one of the issues I hear is that teachers can&#x27;t afford to live anywhere near them and don&#x27;t want to commute hours to work, so they have high turnover.

Students don&#x27;t know what those frameworks are doing - it&#x27;s all just magic incantations. The frameworks are massively inefficient, and bring in zillions of dependencies, because they are such generic &quot;do anything&quot; tools.<p>Looking at a browser app: putting a character on the screen requires an insane amount of computing power: server side running Spring (or whatever), client side running React (or whatever), plus the browser interpreting insanely complicated CSS.<p>The benefit of frameworks is that they enable low-ability developers to create stuff without understanding the nuts-and-bolts of what they&#x27;re doing. Eliminate the frameworks, and you eliminate probably 90% of the developers out there.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41151885" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41151885" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TheAceOfHearts</span><span>|</span><a href="#41151964">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41151832">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41151885">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41151885">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m sympathetic to the goal of making software less terrible, but there&#x27;s no actionable content here.<p>Personally a lot of the code I&#x27;ve written has turned out to be pretty terrible because I didn&#x27;t know any better.

My first task was to add some XDR to our RPC code to ensure big-endian and little-endian machines could talk to each other. This was in the C language. As in, tiny standard library, manual memory management, etc. No type safety. I wrote a UI using X&#x2F;Motif. It was a pretty simple UI with a File menu for loading and saving, and some other edit menus etc. It took ages. No type safety meant that accidentally passing a pointer to a button to a Motif library function that expected a pointer to a label caused a segmentation fault. I still love C but not if I&#x27;m building an actual application. I absolutely do use C if I&#x27;m curious how well llvm can optimise a loop for counting prime numbers or calculating pi.<p>Then along came C++. Now I had some actual data structures and algorithms. Memory management was easier but still error prone. But the compiler we were using was very slow when using a lot of STL code (Standard Template Library) so once our codebase was big enough, building and linking would take over an hour. There were some workarounds but they were clunky and caused their own issues.<p>I didn&#x27;t like Java when it came along because I thought the whole idea of compiling to JVM bytecode and running a JVM in production rather than a compiled executable was obviously slow and wrong.<p>Java has been around for years and lots of mistakes have been made along the way but it&#x27;s a really solid environment with access to a HUGE number of libraries and frameworks.<p>Web apps used to be simple - there was only so much you could do. But then javascript and the infamous XMLHttpRequest came along and people could suddenly make really nice interactive sites. That kicked off another years-long period of trying to figure out how best to write large, complex applications with web technologies. But don&#x27;t kid yourself. The benefits of web apps far outweigh the complexities and &quot;slowness&quot;.<p>Other developers would have experienced other journeys. A modern word processor is vastly more complex than early word processors. I used to really like word perfect 5.1 because it was responsive and very capable and never crashed but when Microsoft Word came along, people obviously preferred it, even if it was slow and crashed all the time.<p>So I&#x27;d say modern software is complex and has problems that come with complexity but the slowness isn&#x27;t really it. I used to edit code in vi. It was pretty responsive. You can bet your bottom dollar that it&#x27;s really fast still. But I prefer JetBrains IDEs. Sometimes they&#x27;re slow or a little buggy but the trade off is worth it.</div><br/><div id="41152034" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41152034" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anonzzzies</span><span>|</span><a href="#41151670">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41151722">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41152034">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41152034">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;I wrote a UI using X&#x2F;Motif.<p>Tcl&#x2F;Tk would&#x27;ve saved you. Would&#x27;ve taken you a few minutes. We built all kinds of touchscreen hardware for factories, entertainment, PoS etc with Tcl&#x2F;Tk, Perl and C in those days. It was lovely, without the rose coloured glasses; it is still rock solid and fast, just no-one accepts that type of UI anymore. Many of these still run without updates for decades.<p>We developed with Turbo Pascal in the second half of 80s for 50+ b2b applications which later were ported to Delphi and grew to 100+ b2b applications. It was excellent. Many of them still run, updated and recompiled with Lazarus.<p>When Java and the web came, things went a bit crappy imho. I made good money out of Java by starting a company immediately when the beta was released, but resource hogging on client and server and sluggishness became normal then, at around the same time that, first because of Applets I think, people started to want non-standard UIs.<p>&gt; Sometimes they&#x27;re slow or a little buggy but the trade off is worth it.<p>Exactly that. You want the features, so you take the slow and buggy with it. I refuse (mostly because the 1995-2005 java ptsd period I had), which means I have to write <i>many</i> things myself but at least it&#x27;s fast and does what I want; when there are bugs, I fix them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41151722" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41151722" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Bluestein</span><span>|</span><a href="#41151670">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41152034">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41151795">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41151722">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41151722">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; when Microsoft Word came along, people obviously preferred it, even if it was slow and crashed all the time<p>I am sure it&#x27;s &quot;overdetermined&quot; but <i>why</i> -is- that?<p>I&#x27;d call it the &quot;tragedy of the losing better option&quot;: When two alternatives exist and, often, the lesser&#x2F;worse&#x2F;worst wins.

As soon as data collection, tracking, and user metrics enter the picture, the simplicity of static content goes out the window (one more reason to dislike these things).<p>The problem with opinion pieces like this awful article just goes to show once again that way too many developers these days lack the fundamentals, e.g. mathematics.<p>A naive programmer will look at a problem and categorise is as &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;simple&quot; if it&#x27;s already been solved and they now how to do it. Actual simplicity, however, isn&#x27;t always obvious: No three positive integers satisfy a^n + b^n = c^n for n&gt;2. Simple to show, right? So simple in fact, that many folks tried to use high-school maths to tackle it. Yet it took 358 years and over 110 pages (&quot;bloat&quot;!) of dense, advanced mathematical concepts (&quot;layers of abstractions&quot;!) and reasoning to prove it.<p>There are many other seemingly innocent questions of the same nature, like the Goldbach Conjecture or the Collatz Problem that may take centuries and breakthroughs in various areas of maths to finally be solved.<p>It&#x27;s the similar with software; only that, unlike in mathematics, problems are often poorly defined, constantly changing, and developers aren&#x27;t given decades to ponder them.<p>To go back to your very first observation<p><pre><code>  &gt; If you actually use software intended for users it is slow.

</code></pre>
you&#x27;ll find it doesn&#x27;t hold much water upon closer inspection. You basically missed the mark entirely. Why and where do these layers exist? Your CPU executes undisclosed Âµ-ops instead of opcodes specified by the architecture and emitted by compilers. Every memory access goes through an MMU instead of directly to RAM on all processors but the most basic microcontrollers. Hardware access is mediated by BIOS, drivers, and OS kernels.<p>In short: &quot;close to metal&quot; is a vague and relative term in the 21st century and if your target platform is the browser, then yes, JavaScript <i>is</i> &quot;close to the metal&quot;, because the &quot;metal&quot; in this case would be a W3C-compliant browser engine.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s economics. Better is the enemy of good and especially of good enough. Back in &quot;the good ol&#x27; days&quot; programmers were cheap and the iron was expensive. Today it&#x27;s the other way around and the way modern software is built reflects that. Optimising for a myriad of diverse hardware and software platforms is tedious and expensive. The ones that win the competition aren&#x27;t always the &quot;best&quot; solutions, but the ones that are first to market, deliver features quickly, or offer added value (support, documentation, user-friendly interfaces, etc.).</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41151824" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41151824" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jonatron</span><span>|</span><a href="#41151670">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41151824">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41151824">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;computers today can do things we hardly dreamed of twenty years ago.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s 25 years since Bill Gates got shot in South Park because Windows 98 crashed so much.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

Movies went down because other studios pulled their movie content. But it also shows that TV shows <i>quadrupled</i> from 530 to 2,108. That&#x27;s big-time long tail <i>increase</i>.<p>The next example is about more sequels in theaters, but theaters have never exhibited long-tail characteristics to begin with, so that&#x27;s irrelevant.<p>Then it goes on to Spotify and admits that it <i>hasn&#x27;t</i> reduced its long tail, but says he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be surprised&quot;. That&#x27;s not evidence -- that&#x27;s nothing. Then he claims that long-tail artists can&#x27;t make a living on Spotify -- but the long tail has <i>never</i> been about content creators making money, that would be nonsensical in the long tail. It&#x27;s always been about the <i>platform</i> making money from it.<p>Then he finally moves to a fast-food restaurant and discovers that loyal customers make up most of revenue. Which, once again, has nothing to do with &quot;long tail&quot; because the long tail is about <i>products</i>, not <i>customers</i>.<p>He finally concludes:<p>&gt; <i>We live in a Short Tail society.

The author is cherry-picking also-not-relative-distribution numbers from a relatively small time frame and extrapolating wildly.<p>Let&#x27;s look at the longer timeframe.<p>From Wikipedia for I Love Lucy:<p>&quot;The episode &quot;Lucy Goes to the Hospital&quot;, which first aired on Monday, January 19, 1953, garnered a then-record rating of 71.7, meaning that 71.7% of all households with television sets were tuned to the program, the equivalent of some 44 million viewers.[71] That record is surpassed only by Elvis Presley&#x27;s first of three appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show, which aired on September 9, 1956 (82.6% share, 60.710 million viewers and a 57.1 rating ).[71] The overall rating of 67.3 for the entire 1952 season of I Love Lucy continues to be the highest average rating for any single season of a TV show.[72]&quot;<p>MASH: &quot;The series premiered in the US on September 17, 1972, and ended on February 28, 1983, with the finale, showcased as a television film, titled &quot;Goodbye, Farewell and Amen&quot;, becoming the most-watched and highest-rated single television episode in US television history at the time, with a record-breaking 125 million viewers (60.2 rating and 77 share)&quot;<p>By the time we get to something like Friends we&#x27;re down to 52M live viewers for its finale, and it&#x27;s only shrunk since then. Netflix doesn&#x27;t give equivalent counts or US-only ones, as far as I can find, just &quot;at least two minutes within N weeks&quot; type stuff and similar; I believe if they had that level of cultural ubiquity, they&#x27;d be shouting it to the rooftops more explicitly.<p>And if they did, the linked article would be citing it. But instead, they&#x27;re just speculating that all the numbers and trends we <i>do</i> have better measured are wrong.<p>If you look at ticket sales counts instead of box office for movies you&#x27;ll see a similar large representation of older stuff, and that&#x27;s a quantity comparison even with a smaller population to boot .</div><br/></div></div><div id="36336703" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36336703" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">potatolicious</span><span>|</span><a href="#36333495">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36333962">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36334049">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36333932">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36336703">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36336703">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But this is pretty observably true - TV viewership spread is wider than ever before.<p>Remember that we started with a ~dozen TV networks showing one show at a time.

Same for high-volume producers - some of the market will shift to lower-volume competitors. And that&#x27;s exactly what we see happening: incumbents have had to respond to markets moving away from them. A film or TV show has to compete with entire new worlds of types of video content, so those incumbents go broad. But that&#x27;s because the long tail is thriving on its own, and <i>doesn&#x27;t need them</i>, not because the production or consumption worlds are short-tail.<p>You can&#x27;t monopolize and extract rent from the long tail the same way you used to from the short tail because the barriers of entry for producing long-tail culture products have gotten so much lower. The struggles of the former kings and incumbents shows that their relative market share is being eaten into by cheaper-to-produce alternatives that their business model <i>simply can&#x27;t sustain itself by competing with</i>. If demand was short-tail then the biggest incumbent players would face far fewer barriers to raking in profit. Relative demand for short tail stuff goes up -&gt; ability to charge a higher price for short tail stuff goes up. But that&#x27;s not happening. (Disney is the closest thing we have to this, they have a pretty firm grip on tons of non-free family TV and film, but that&#x27;s one of the few areas (along with live sports) that have been less vulnerable.)</div><br/><div id="36335277" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36335277" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">coldtea</span><span>|</span><a href="#36333377">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36334963">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36335450">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36335277">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36335277">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;<i>Was it only ever claimed that it would eliminate the head?</i><p>Did I say &quot;eliminate&quot;?<p>The &quot;long tail&quot; concept however is not that &quot;some smaller percentage would still buy less popular items if only they were made available&quot;.

Netflix then tries to find more big hits to maintain big incumbent winnings. And incumbents have been in many cases doubling down. But that’s exactly because the long tail is eating the “medium tail” that incumbents used to profit off of alive.<p>But that doesn’t mean you can’t use the long tail to bring in money. Though a competitive long tail will restrict just how high your margins can be.<p>The long tail threatens Netflix now (if only to an extent: something like Squid Game becoming a hit in the US would blow the mind of someone in 2006 and seem like a perfect example of long tail content being able to not just be economically viable but  potentially turn into a huge winner).<p>But it threatens Spotify much less! They thrive off of it! The music world isn’t a bunch of services with exclusives trying to be winner take all, most content is across services.<p>Similarly it threatens Amazon, AliExpress, Etsy, etc, much less than Netflix.<p>The money in a “produce content for a small niche” was never going to be big for an individual producer, the money in that was going to be in being a successful aggregator, but in a competitive market you can only squeeze that so far.<p>But if the long tail was dead in terms of people being able to get exposure and views and listens then the YouTube and Spotifys of the world and the big labels would be raking in cash like they used to. They’d have a product without much competition and they could charge more for it from all sides, and take more off the top from artists too. Instead they’re in a pickle because it’s hard to compete with free and the free long-tail is getting bigger and bigger and bigger in terms of popular appeal (like things like youtube videos of people playing video games, which simply didn’t used to take ANY viewership away from TV shows).</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36311184" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36311184" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PaulHoule</span><span>|</span><a href="#36332919">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36333914">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36311184">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36311184">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One trouble w&#x2F; the long tail as a business is that people who are interested in the “long tail” have a huge amount of old content that they can enjoy.

Maybe you believe the 80&#x2F;20 split the author here posits is a good reason to discard the 20%... I think that&#x27;s dumb and I think that both Amazon and Spotify are constantly cited somehow in this article as doing something <i>wrong</i> demonstrates as much.<p>But... the article spends most of its time moralizing about a very very different idea: a frustrating claim that anyone who believes in the long tail ever promised that if someone allocates their effort to making a product for a niche audience that <i>they</i> will make a bunch of money because &quot;the blockbuster is in decline&quot; not merely in total sales volume (due to the relatively new accessibility of the long tail) but is somehow a <i>worse bet</i> than making a niche product for a small audience.<p>That is not only not the case in practice it is actually trivially not the case from the very idea of the long tail: every product on the long tail isn&#x27;t making many sales by definition of where they are in the distribution. At one point this author finally states as much... but somehow it is <i>against</i> the long tail people, as this idea that people should go out of their way to <i>make</i> content for this segment was attributed to them as the most disingenuous form of strawman throughout the rest of the article :&#x2F;.<p>The long tail argument is merely that if you sell a bunch of stuff that a non-negligible amount of your sales comes from the long tail, not that the long tail is somehow itself fat and that the people making those products are going to ever manage to pull off a bunch of sales. If it is wrong, it is because people might want it to be a majority and not just &quot;a lot&quot;, but FWIW in my experience 20% is &quot;worth it&quot;, and if I went to a supermarket that only stocked the 10 most popular foods I&#x27;d find a better supermarket even if 80% of my purchases and 80% of their sales are from those 10 foods: it is really hard to run a business that only serves blockbusters.<p>But... is it sane to allocate a bunch of time and money to making something that isn&#x27;t a blockbuster if your goal is to maximize profit? Of course not, and no long tail advocate ever claimed as much! If you&#x27;re concerned about where all that content comes from--and I can tell you this as someone who ran a very popular and even culturally-relevant content marketplace--it is largely people working on low <i>or even negative</i> budgets and for whom even a single sale is a life-altering moment.<p>But like, if you take a percent of that person&#x27;s one sale and you add it to the numerous other peoples&#x27; one sales, does it add up to &quot;a lot&quot; of money? Without even having to chime in with my own experience, we can actually note that even this author seems to claim--by their assertion in 80&#x2F;20 or (later) 75&#x2F;25--you could increase your revenue by 25-33% by bothering to open up your catalog... and that&#x27;s even more the &quot;I don&#x27;t bother to shop at a supermarket where I can only find 90% of what I want&quot;!<p>The author thereby needs to stretch pretty far to explain away why markets like Spotify and Amazon disagree with the article, claiming that Spotify is I guess just wrong and will likely change their strategy in the future once they realize this author is smarter than them and that Amazon makes most of their money on AWS and so (supposedly) isn&#x27;t a relevant data point... maybe it would surprise the author, then, to learn that Apple iTunes also allows pretty much everyone to list their tracks (and thereby contains an <i>extremely</i> long tail that certainly doesn&#x27;t make people a lot of money but which absolutely helps cement them as a go-to destination to buy and collect music) and that, while Walmart has to make some tough decisions on shelf space, they have an extremely expansive online-only catalog.<p>The only example they have of a <i>marketplace</i> (as the idea that a movie producer concentrates on blockbusters is not relevant to the premise) shrinking their content catalog is Netflix, and that&#x27;s not at all Netflix&#x27;s conscious strategic decision: they only were able to have all of that content for so long because the people who owned it didn&#x27;t want to directly compete with Netflix and were willing to license it &quot;on the cheap&quot;... now that they all want their own streaming service, they are clawing back their interests region by region, and it frankly isn&#x27;t clear that the gutted separate services are going to manage to sustain their users as well as the unified market could (which I will claim is in no small part due to long tail effects; their best strategy will likely be to re-form the old cable market by joining forces under a single subscription).<p>I&#x27;m honestly not sure why this article has managed to captivate so many people given how mixed up it is in the premise, but I hope that readers spend some time really thinking about not only whether the points made in this article resonate in the order presented but whether they manage to correctly lead to the moral and economic conclusions they purport to before anyone ascribes to &quot;the long tail&quot; something only this author incorrectly understood and start--as I have seen many do--using it to justify actively shrinking a catalog or the idea that a large catalog isn&#x27;t somehow a powerful moat (which someone tried to use against me once to claim how easy they thought it would be for just anyone to compete with Spotify).</div><br/></div></div><div id="36333055" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36333055" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">WeylandYutani</span><span>|</span><a href="#36333339">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36334509">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36333055">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36333055">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It happens in videogames.

I don&#x27;t know anyone who was doing particularly well, including those working (heck, people at my job at the time were struggling pretty badly with mental health to the point where they started reaching out to us.)<p>I&#x27;m not even saying this as a person that has a strong opinion on UBI, and I am sure some people sincerely believe not having a job was a major detriment for them. I absolutely think it did help me, but the way I see it, it helped because it was something to cling onto for a bit of normalcy, and of course, a bit of social interaction. Outside of the pandemic, a job is not nearly as critical for those two things.<p>I also do personally think that I still broadly like having a job, and I have had almost no gaps in employment since I started working professionally. That said, if money were no object, I would absolutely take breaks off of professional work for months at a time. For me, I find both professional work and hobby work important in very different ways, and wish I had dedicated time for both. Anecdotally I&#x27;ve definitely known engineers who periodically take months or even a year off of work when they get the opportunity and it seems to be a very healthy thing for them.<p>The existence of UBI would maybe tempt people to rely on it even if it is detrimental to their lives, but I think it&#x27;s wrong to draw the conclusion that it&#x27;s bad because jobs can be a source of fulfillment for many. In the future it&#x27;s very possible we&#x27;re going to need to approach the problem from another angle anyways, since there&#x27;s simply no guarantee there will be meaningful work for us all in the future.

It definitely sucked, but I didn&#x27;t get depressed by it. I think it comes down to expectations in life. If you go through life thinking &quot;people in their 30s aren&#x27;t supposed to die&quot;, then yes, I can see it being depressing. If you go through life with &quot;one can die any time - be it from disease or a car accident&quot;, then a pandemic isn&#x27;t much of a shock.<p>To give a different perspective: Long before the pandemic, people I knew died in places like Palestine and Iraq due to conflicts. Yet the whole world lived a happy life despite it. Is this all that different?<p>And go back a century or more, and people around you dying from disease was the norm (think tuberculosis, etc). That didn&#x27;t prevent people from having a happy life, and did not make them depressed. It&#x27;s not (primarily) the circumstances that lead to the depression, but the narrative one has around them.<p>&gt; there were shortages of basically everything<p>I got lucky. We happened to accidentally buy an extra set of Clorox wipes just prior to the pandemic. We were going to return them and then the pandemic hit. I was never short.<p>Hand sanitizer shortages sucked. We certainly conserved our use, and were fortunate never to run out.<p>As for everything else, I didn&#x27;t deal with any serious shortages. Somehow always found paper towels, bathroom rolls, soap, etc. And things like cars&#x2F;appliance shortages - these are not meaningful quality of life things for me.<p>&gt; and the news cycle was full of panic and anger<p>If this caused you depression, I say this with the utmost sincerity: I hope you learned the lesson not to waste much time with the news. I was a news junkie for many years, and had cured myself of it years before the pandemic hit (and thankfully never jumped on the social media bandwagon). Video news is the worst, and has almost no redeeming value.

The post above says &quot;you can get 600€&#x2F;month + many other welfare stuff by not working&quot;; if you lose that welfare by starting to work, this hugely incentivizes not working! Worse still, it incentivizes black market labour - money earned under the table isn&#x27;t going to be counted against your means-testing. This is at best productive but untaxed, at worst actively destructive or criminal.<p>The other is, as you&#x27;ve pointed out, high taxation. I believe the UBI advocate&#x27;s response to this would be some combination of: 1) UBI will supersede a multitude of complex, means-tested welfare programs and will be cheaper to administer as well, so the increase to taxation won&#x27;t be as substantial as you might imagine; 2) giving people freedom to pursue education&#x2F;creativity&#x2F;entrepeneurship, UBI will spur on economic growth that will help it pay for itself (as would disincentivizing black market labour, as described above); and 3) the extent to which taxation disincentivizes productivity is overstated, or is perhaps contingent on the particular taxation scheme, and they support one that they think won&#x27;t have deleterious effects.<p>FWIW I personally suspect UBI would be a pretty good idea, but I&#x27;m at least a little skeptical about some of these arguments as I understand them; nevertheless, various people who&#x27;ve studied the issue extensively and with a stronger background in economics buy them, so I accept that they&#x27;re at least worth taking seriously.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41641059" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41641059" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jonhohle</span><span>|</span><a href="#41638103">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41640384">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41641255">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41639970">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41641059">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41641059">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No true Scotsman</div><br/><div id="41641161" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41641161" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wk_end</span><span>|</span><a href="#41638103">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41641059">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41639970">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41641161">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41641161">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; No true Scotsman or appeal to purity is an informal fallacy in which one attempts to protect an a posteriori claim from a falsifying counterexample by covertly modifying the initial claim.<p>No one has covertly modified the initial claim.

It might just be that minimum wage has stagnated while COL has skyrocketed. If the point of minimum wage is that it provides people with a guaranteed dignified life as long as they are employed, that needs to keep up with the cost of living a normal life in order to keep its effectiveness. That is one reason it might be &quot;failing&quot; although I don&#x27;t know exactly what you mean by that.<p>&gt; get us from the service economy to agency and self-actualization<p>This is the thing I think most people have a hard time connecting to &quot;measurable utility&quot; but will probably be the most sweeping effect of UBI or similar. Think about your typical gig worker, minimum wage worker in some high-turnover environment etc. This person probably does not have the financial safety net to pursue something meaningful, or to take the risk reskilling, or to otherwise improve their emotional and financial well-being.<p>You will probably always have free-riders or people who just want to consume without producing. But is it better to have a society of exhausted, frustrated, barely-hanging-on people, or a society of people with the _potential_ to to be creative, passionate, and exploratory?<p>Conversely to you, I find it hard to imagine that a society with surplus wealth would be more effective if it chose to subject its people to precarity and emotional strife instead of empowering as many of its people as possible.<p>Some references:

It&#x27;s common that the effective tax rate for low-paying jobs is 80-90%, if you count lost benefits in addition to taxes. Sometime the rate exceeds 100%. In order to get unemployed people back to work against their own interests, unemployment benefits often come with strict time limits, a lot of surveillance and bureaucracy, and a general loss of dignity.<p>The &quot;basic&quot; in UBI aims to solve that by changing benefits and taxes. Everyone from the homeless to the billionaires gets the same benefits, while income taxes will make sure that most people won&#x27;t see any additional money. The differences are only seen by people with low incomes. While the benefits may be a little lower, taking a low-paying job makes much more sense, as your tax rate may be as low as 40%.<p>Many old-school unions oppose UBI because it makes low-paying jobs more viable. They consider it morally wrong.

I dug a lot through old books, comp.sys.mac.programmer posts, and the source code from Soft Dorothy and others (like the GliderPro source).<p>It’s a trip seeing this old code through new eyes. I can see why the old Macs crashed so much (beyond the basic “they had no memory protection” explanation). I’m also fond of the 1-bit art, like the author mentions, and I curate a list of accounts on Twitter which post 1-but artwork (if you know anybody who’s missing from the list, let me know): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;i&#x2F;lists&#x2F;1578111923324944397" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;i&#x2F;lists&#x2F;1578111923324944397</a><p>The nice thing about programming for a limited system is that it limits your options. It’s a nice break from the more modern experience where you can do <i>anything</i> by pulling in the right library. I sometimes imagine a world where computational power is frozen, and we simple get better and better software for systems that are well-understood. The thing about these old systems like the Mac 68K machines is that the pace of hardware development was so fast it made you dizzy. If a new processor came out like the 68020 or 80386, then you had maybe a couple years at most to make something that really used it to its full potential. If you waited too long, you’d be competing against a new generation of software written for a new generation of hardware.</div><br/><div id="41643342" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41643342" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">msephton</span><span>|</span><a href="#41639177">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41642373">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41643342">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41643342">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I do 1-bit art for a limited platform (Playdate, so not quite Macintosh Plus limited) I&#x27;m @gingerbeardman on Twitter.

It helped me develop the skill of finishing things, which is a separate skill that&#x27;s hard to learn, because it only happens at the end of a process so long and hard you almost never make it there. All my friends who are making video games start by writing their own engine, and get burnt out somewhere around the point where they&#x27;re making a level editor. They learn a lot about things like tooling (which, coincidentally, is a lot like what they already knew how to do), but never actually make the game.

We have to change the design based on results of running real code. In other words, when the first draft doesn&#x27;t work quite right, you don&#x27;t ignore it (Agile) or try to shoehorn it into the existing design (Waterfall) - you change the design and try again. &quot;Throwing stuff away&quot; could be reframed as the scientific method.

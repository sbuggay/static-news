Known as Photograph 51, this image is treated as the philosopher’s stone of molecular biology, the key to the ‘secret of life’ (not to mention a Nobel prize). In this telling, Franklin, who died of ovarian cancer in 1958 at just 37, is portrayed as a brilliant scientist, but one who was ultimately unable to decipher what her own data were telling her about DNA. She supposedly sat on the image for months without realizing its significance, only for Watson to understand it at a glance.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is what Watson wrote in The Double Helix. He wrote that Crick, with his background in math and physics, could understand the image produced by Franklin but that he -- Watson -- could not.<p>Watson does write that Franklin thought DNA wasn&#x27;t helical. The linked article provides an interesting explanation for why she thought that (at least at one time). As far as I can tell, that backs up Watson&#x27;s narrative rather than undermining it.<p>One interesting takeaway from The Double Helix was that Watson and Crick cracked the problem with guess-and-check model building (the article mentions this). Sure, they had some vague idea that DNA was a helix and that A-T, C-G relatinoship, but they basically played with tinker toys until they got something that looked good. Watson claims that they decided on a double helix because of his intuition that &quot;in biology, important things occur in pairs&quot;.</div><br/><div id="35708373" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35708373" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mjfl</span><span>|</span><a href="#35705790">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35707725">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35708373">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35708373">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I believe that Franklin thought the DNA would be a triple helix like Pauling, not a double helix.

I personally know of a very highly rated individual who despite their astronomical IQ, is introverted to the point of being a hermit, and who’s prodigious intellect has never been applied to any external endeavour. What value then such intelligence if it produces nothing, changes nothing, and affects nothing? IQ is to general intelligence as height is to beauty. A single factor among many.

It is, of course, primarily and famously the specter of the erasure of women from scientifically and socially significant developments, the thematic subject that this article addresses.<p>There is another aspect of this significance, however, in the way that James Watson&#x27;s impropriety - in his work, and in his telling of the story of his work - reflects on, and is reflected by, his later racist and sexist intellectual misadventures. The myth of a singular - well, dual - genius who moves humanity forward lends credence to his bigotry - how can the father of genetic science be wrong about the influence of genetics on society? - while the truth dashes that credibility (without necessarily undoing the significance of his actual contributions). And it is a controversy that gets re-litigated perennially not because people truly care that much about the discovery or discovers, but because our understanding of these events underpin beliefs, our understanding of the world, that are as sharply relevant today as a shard of glass.<p>To retreat to attempting an exhaustive reconstruction of events might be comfortable, but it is also a bit dangerous - it assumes a totality of understanding that may be found wanting - and, more importantly, it misses the core of why the controversy exists in the first place.

Which may or may not be genetic, but is definitely not the same thing as intelligence.<p>I could not find that data, but I found this which is also interesting:<p><pre><code>  Richard Nisbett, a professor of psychology who has written an excellent book about intelligence, cites a study that followed a pool of Chinese-American children and a pool of white children into adulthood. The two groups started out with the same scores on I.Q. tests, but in the end 55 percent of the Asian-Americans entered high-status occupations, compared with one-third of the whites. To succeed as a manager, whites needed an I.Q. of 100, while Chinese-Americans needed an I.Q. of only 93.

  So the Asian advantage, Nisbett argues, isn’t intellectual firepower as such, but how it is harnessed.

It is the environment which selects the traits in a population. There is no adaptive advantage to investing in intelligence if your environment does not require it.

It is likely true that deep conceptual shifts within twentieth-century science have undermined what&#x27;s commonly referred to as Cartesian-Newtonian metaphysics.

A lot of the post-structuralist way of thinking comes down to a couple of obvious claims:
- &quot;Scientists were part of a society that did Bad Things(tm) like genocide, slavery etc.&quot; Yes, indeed they were. Thanks for pointing out. This is not as profound a revelation as you might think.  
- &quot;Physical reality is just another discourse among many. There&#x27;s no objective truth.&quot; This applies equally to just about any claim, including this second point denying privileged narratives. So why bother having a conversation? It&#x27;s obviously a self-immolating belief system. There&#x27;s in fact physical truth and reality. The phenomenon we describe as gravity will be around long after humans are no longer around to contemplate it. Also  I&#x27;d argue that the post-modern argument is nihilistic. Just because you don&#x27;t believe in my existence or choose not to articulate it in your &quot;text&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t exist. If we deny the power of language to represent and communicate reality, all we&#x27;re left with is raw destructive brute force to decide what is real and who actually exists. Kind of like the USA we are slowly converging upon.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

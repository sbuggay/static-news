Ask your manager for help is often the nuclear option, because there&#x27;s such a wide-range of outcomes when a manager tries to intervene -- maybe they misunderstand your message, maybe they fumble the delivery, maybe they forgot, etc. Even if the manager does intervene it could be neutral or negative &quot;Hey I got you some &#x27;resources&#x27; who know nothing about the project that&#x27;s due this month to help out.&quot; Miscommunication is particularly common when there&#x27;s a language and culture barrier at play.<p>Also, what? IIRC most engineering teams miss most goals most of the time. I guess if it&#x27;s agreed in advance something is a &quot;hard commitment&quot; then yes let the manager know early you&#x27;re not going to make it happen. But also the manager should be even more responsible and should be asking for periodic updates on all goals if not receiving them.<p>Also there&#x27;s something really offputting about the &quot;get it done&quot; phrase&#x2F;mentality for public companies. Delivering faster is not one of Meta&#x27;s (or google&#x27;s) top 50 priorities. Their priorities all need to be &quot;This time, build a product that&#x27;s going to be around in 10 years that will reflect well on our brand.&quot; Hustling is not only not a part of that equation, constantly feeling &quot;under the gun&quot; is antithetical to the kind of &quot;Let&#x27;s take a step back and do it right, even if it&#x27;s twice as expensive and takes twice as long&quot; approach they need.</div><br/><div id="36385512" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36385512" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">charlie0</span><span>|</span><a href="#36384382">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36384964">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36385512">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36385512">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Also there&#x27;s something really offputting about the &#x27;get it done&#x27; phrase&#x2F;mentality for public companies.&quot; This really resonates with me.

Same thing if you can tell you are going to be late in your delivery and need something specific done to help especially if you do it with a lot of time left.<p>Also I have a pro-tip. Managers intentionally ask people they view as competent and trustworthy to do the thorny things that need to get done.

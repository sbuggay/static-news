It&#x27;s obvious reading the originals that it they were more a collection of tales with no particular moral, some unspeakable brutality, and a ton of hallucinatory weirdness. Why does an anthropomorphic needle go down the road? Heck if I know! The later versions, as explained in the preface of the above book, were sanitized and Christianized for popular consumption.</div><br/><div id="40250120" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40250120" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hodgesrm</span><span>|</span><a href="#40249844">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40250468">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40250120">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40250120">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think there are morals in Grimms Fairy Tales even in the earliest versions. What is striking to me when I read them is that many of the stories come from people at the bottom level of society and reflected their struggle for survival. These include terrifying consequences for misbehavior and that violating group norms (including those imposed from above) is a big no-no. A lot of the stories feature tricksters who cleverly got around these restrictions.<p>These patterns don&#x27;t show up clearly in individual stories. But it&#x27;s pretty strong if you read them from end to end.</div><br/><div id="40250372" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40250372" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">octopoc</span><span>|</span><a href="#40249844">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40250120">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40250468">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40250372">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40250372">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah, this is definitely the case IME. It&#x27;s easy to read these stories and go away thinking &quot;WTF.&quot; But it&#x27;s important to remember that these stories come from oral societies, which means 90% of the communication is lost since it&#x27;s only written on paper. But that communication can be reconstructed by a charitable mind.<p>For example, in the first story in Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tales (at least the version I read), there&#x27;s a mouse and a cat that are friends. The cat and mouse find some delicious food and they hide it somewhere far away from their house. The cat then proceeds to go &quot;visiting relatives&quot; (in reality he is eating up the delicious food) and the mouse is gullible and believes the cat. After a while the mouse discovers the cat ate up all the food and angrily accuses the cat of being deceitful. The cat then proceeds to eat the mouse. The end.<p>I think this is a profound story on not ignoring the fact that the cat is the natural predator and the mouse is the natural prey in the relationship. The mouse has convinced itself that this time will be different. This has relevance for e.g. not dismissing signs of abuse.<p>But it&#x27;s so easy to read that story and be like, &quot;Well, I guess the point is that gullible people get screwed, so don&#x27;t be gullible.&quot; Or even, &quot;It&#x27;s a dog-eat-dog world.&quot; It&#x27;s a good story to tell a friend who&#x27;s trying to rationalize being passive in an abusive relationship.</div><br/><div id="40250730" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40250730" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wongarsu</span><span>|</span><a href="#40249844">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40250372">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40250573">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40250730">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40250730">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To me that story reads like thinly veiled political commentary. Peasants and feudal lords&#x2F;nobility&#x2F;local government working towards a common goal (e.g. paying taxes to fund defense against bandits, building grain stores for times of famine, etc). A person in power misappropriates the funds for personal gain, and any peasant who complains loses their head.<p>Telling a story about a mouse and a cat allowed you to keep your head, and the situation was probably common enough for the fable to become widely known before it was picked up by the Bothers Grimm.<p>It&#x27;s not that different from Gulliver&#x27;s Travels complaining about pointless religious wars under the guise of talking about far-away islands of tiny humans, or Star Trek criticizing the Vietnam War under the guise of talking about a primitive planet light-years away centuries in the future.</div><br/><div id="40251266" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40251266" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mewpmewp2</span><span>|</span><a href="#40249844">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40250730">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40250573">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40251266">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40251266">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My thoughts were this might also be on the World politics level. E.g. a case where a stronger country during wartime will co operate with weaker country, and then slowly infiltrate because it&#x27;s easier than to do full on invasion.<p>Then finally when weaker country starts to complain they will completely take over. The stronger country in theory could at any time swallow the weaker, it&#x27;s just that it might be more beneficial for stronger country to do it in a slower, methodical, deceiving manner, until it can. Or when it actually needs to.<p>In this case it seems to me it was strategic behavior by the cat to not immediately eat the mouse, but instead consume the fat first. Eating the mouse was a fallback in this scenario.<p>But overall this specific scenario happens on so many levels of relationships including, but not limited to interpersonal, business, country level, World level, etc.<p>The main key points in my view are that it is a cat, and cat always will want to eat the mouse in what you would think is pscyhopathic mannerism if it was between people, but it&#x27;s most easily explainable on level of countries. Because ultimately countries as entities have to act in psychopathic ways with each other, because territories, resources are all  clearly limited.<p>Due to the complexity of World politics you have to co operate with your enemies as well. Both sides are lying to each other, keeping secrets, but at the same time co operating, because they have to or they otherwise will fall behind other countries.</div><br/><div id="40254185" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40254185" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wolfi1</span><span>|</span><a href="#40249844">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40251266">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40250573">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40254185">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40254185">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I hate to break it to you but this is ahistorical, as this story is several hundred years old the peasants at that time had no concerns for world politics nor were they concerned by whom they were governed, the circumstances for them wouldn&#x27;t change</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40250573" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40250573" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ReleaseCandidat</span><span>|</span><a href="#40249844">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40250372">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40250730">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40253421">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40250573">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40250573">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; in the first story in Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tales<p>It&#x27;s the second story.

This book collection, comprising rare prints and unique editions, is more than just a series of items of significant material of bibliophile value. It is particularly valuable primarily as a source of knowledge on the research methods used by the two researchers.  In  the  footnotes  and  indexes  to  their  publications  of  fairy  tales  or  folk  legends,  both  Jakob and Wilhelm were very meticulous in providing their written source material, i.e. the sources that they held in their book collection, the items of which had purposefully been acquired by the duo to preserve for subsequent editions of old relics European and German literature.  Equally  important  for  the  research  on  the  literary  output  and  research  activity  of the Grimm Brothers is the analysis of hand-written underlining, notes and annotations that the texts were typographically enhanced by during the reading. The volumes from the portion of the working collection of the Brothers Grimm found in the Poznań University Library were long though to had been lost during the WWII, and now can be of significant value in their contribution to the development of modern research on the Brothers’ literary and scientific output. The very fact that they have been found allows us to believe that the book collections at the Library can hold other volumes that belonged to the private book collection of Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm still to be discovered.</i><p>So it&#x27;s not about books written by the Brothers Grimm, but books which they used in their research.</div><br/><div id="40249435" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40249435" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ikari_pl</span><span>|</span><a href="#40248373">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40248223">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40249435">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40249435">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">best part about

Royalty also ruled Bohemia, Hungary, Wallonia (modern Romania), Sweden, almost got there in Moscow during &quot;the Troubles&quot;, while at other times the German &#x2F; Central European Wettin (Saxony) or Luxemburg (Bohemia) families also held the Polish Crown. Nevermind military alliances (Jan Sobieski&#x27;s contributions to to lifting the Turkish Siege of Vienna in 1683 got him a memorial in the sky to this day ... the constellation of Scutum).<p>The way to become King of Poland was not quite as elaborately ritualized as the German electorate, but not generally&#x2F;universally hereditary either. But neither did Poland isolate itself from its neighbours, on the contrary. Up until internal strife and the great Nordic War, it involved itself a lot with both central and eastern Europe. And while one may look at the partitions as predatory, let&#x27;s also remember that for 80 years before the Polish Duma flogged the crown to the highest bidder (August the nth of Saxony, for three generations), which, and realize it&#x27;s a strong word, also sold the country. Let&#x27;s remember &quot;predatory&quot; territorial expansions also a little in context; Turkey overrunning the Balkans and Hungary between 1300..1526 eradicated a dozen countries. Louis XIV&#x27;s wars of reunion were very predatory and gained France territory the size of Switzerland. The Austria-Turkey wars after 1683 &quot;undid&quot; 200 years of Turkish rule in Hungary within two decades, as did Russia taking over the Cossack Hetmanates, Crimea; the wars of the Spanish and Austrian succession changed territorial &quot;ownership&quot; on a large scale as well. What Napoleon, in league with quite a few of the German states, did to &quot;countries&quot; in Germany was neither less disruptive nor, territory-wise, smaller in scale than the partitions of Poland.<p>That doesn&#x27;t make them &quot;right&quot;. I would contest though that they were a &quot;uniquely polish&quot; sort of doom. Other countries lost their independence for centuries as well (Serbia, Hungary, Bohemia&#x2F;Czechy, Lithuania if you like ...).<p>The difference &quot;then&quot; was that such changes in overlordship only began to be associated with forceful removals of population - ethical cleansing - after the rise of nationalism post Napoleon. My country (Germany) did rather evil there, and can&#x27;t blame others for having taken retribution. No need for &quot;love lost&quot;. It&#x27;s not deserved.<p>The real evil was less the partitions and the &quot;ganging up&quot; on Poland, but the nationalism in the 19th century. The idea that within your country&#x27;s boundaries, there shall be one language, one culture. It&#x27;d have been considered very odd up to ~1700 for sure. And it created
all the evil between 1780 and 1945.

Marion Gräfin Dönhof talks about this, a descendant of both Prussian and newly turned &quot;Polish&quot; political elite and aristocracy. Some of her german ancestors adopted polish names and became thus polish. Before the rise of nationalism, there was not really such a gap between nations as today. Germans sometimes even ruled parts of Poland with no issues. There were also special laws and leaders in Poland exclusively for Germans, in other words, the Germans in Poland ruled themselves, living side by side respectfully with the Polish people. All of this makes one ask what nations really are and what national identity really is in the end, beyond political propaganda. National coherence was forced onto people everywhere, with dramatic consequences and suffering.<p>People have lived hundreds or even thousands of years without the need for unified nations, often many different cultures coexisting with each other under a banner of a &quot;nation&quot;, which was mostly just the culture of a given ruling aristocracy at that time.</div><br/><div id="40254685" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40254685" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dzink</span><span>|</span><a href="#40248223">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40252211">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40252521">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40254685">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40254685">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It’s money - taxes and tax collection a then the power of those with bigger coffers.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40252521" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40252521" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">surfingdino</span><span>|</span><a href="#40248223">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40252211">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40254685">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40252477">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40252521">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40252521">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It seems that creation of nation states was a way of scaling up tribalism.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40252477" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40252477" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">surfingdino</span><span>|</span><a href="#40248223">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40251068">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40252211">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40248946">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40252477">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40252477">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s a very good summary.

So, here&#x27;s a few facts for you:<p>&gt; Most likely on October 12-13, 1944, the Brandkommando of the Wehrmacht (Nazi German army) burned collections of the most valuable literary monuments from the National Library in one of the greatest losses to Polish culture in its history, and one of the greatest losses to written culture in history of the world. The National Library lost at least 39,000 manuscripts – and most likely more, perhaps as many as 50,000 – along with some 80,000 books from the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries, 100,000 books from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, 60,000 drawings and engravings, 25,000 musical scores and 10,000 maps. The great family libraries were almost wiped out, such as the famous collection of manuscripts of the Krasiński Library, of which just 78 volumes survived out of more than 7,000.¹<p>¹ <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bn.org.pl&#x2F;en&#x2F;news&#x2F;3855-75-years-ago-the-germans-set-fire-to-the-national-library-in-warsaw.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bn.org.pl&#x2F;en&#x2F;news&#x2F;3855-75-years-ago-the-germans-...</a></div><br/><div id="40252767" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40252767" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">michael9423</span><span>|</span><a href="#40248223">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40252417">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40248712">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40252767">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40252767">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Mr. Garber, the Second World War was also an inferno for German book and library culture. Do we now know more or less exactly what damage and losses occurred at which collection locations in Germany?<p>&gt; Yes, most of the damage is known and extends across the entire old German Reich, from Karlsruhe to Kiel, from Munich to Königsberg. The largest German library in the Reich was hit most spectacularly. In July 1943, the Hamburg City Library alone lost 700,000 volumes in “Aktion Gomorrha”. As far as the individual titles themselves are concerned, the relevant data is often still missing - unfortunately. There is no large and accurate work on the books and libraries that once existed and were lost or not returned during the Second World War.<p>&gt; How do you assess the historical and intellectual damage caused to our cultural memory by the absence of German books?<p>&gt; I will answer this question with a quote from the first expert on the subject from 1947: “It is a catastrophe that has no comparison in the history of libraries and in the history of science” (Georg Leyh). We have no account of the demise of German libraries. Germany has lost significant parts of its cultural memory forever. But who knows about it? Conversely, the greatest crime committed by Germany has led to an irretrievable loss of urban silhouettes and cultural witnesses. The answer?

That intent is not inherent to war in a universal sense – for one, it is a war crime, for which Alfred Rosenberg was convicted during the Nürnberg Trials – and it looks like you are generally convinced the conduct of the German army in WWII was that like of any other, and that war as carried out by Germany in 1939-1945 was war like any other.

Much the same way as forests were cleared to create farmland, native populations were cleared to create &quot;living space&quot; for settlers. Much like natural resources were exploited and brought back home, natives were used for manual labor until they were used up.<p>Nationalism allowed leaders to use a national identity to rally their subjects against their neighbors. In an act of massive hubris and severe underestimation of technological advancements this nationalist fervor led to the mass death event that was WW1. WW2 in turn built on this but also brought colonialism home with the explicit goal of not only redrawing borders but also repurposing the land and eliminating any natives standing in the way.<p>I.e. Poland may have engaged in nationalist assimilation in the form of Polonizing Lithuania but Germany explicitly wanted to remove anyone not part of the &quot;volk&quot;, at the barrel of a gun if necessary.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40249015" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40249015" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Amezarak</span><span>|</span><a href="#40248223">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40248712">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40250944">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40252065">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40249015">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40249015">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re quite right about that, but it is true that the post-WW borders of Germany viz.

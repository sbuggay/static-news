Never mind regulate app stores and hosting services.</div><br/><div id="40165484" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40165484" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">_heimdall</span><span>|</span><a href="#40164411">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40164657">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40160829">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40165484">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40165484">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wasn&#x27;t actually proposing that the FCC would have the power to remove apps from the app store, only that they could force ISPs to block specific servers.<p>I was thinking the FCC regulations would have that power to implement such a ban based on national security, though I could be wrong.

A lot of people seem to have gotten ideas that the long realignment period from 1930s to the 1990s when the salient political divides were not along the same axis as the divide between the major parties (though they were approaching alignment at the end of the period) was a norm and not an aberration, and thus have fetishized bipartisanship which was simply a result of <i>ideological</i> factions crossing partisan boundaries rather than generally being contained within major parties. When that applies, you don&#x27;t need to build bridges between parties, the factions inherently provide it; when it doesn&#x27;t, you don&#x27;t have a commonality to build on.<p>And, in any case, this is the fallacy of argument to the consequences of belief – you are justifying a belief in a fact claim <i>not</i> by any evidence that it represents the actual facts, but by the notionally desirable consequences of believing it independent of its truth.
&gt;  Without that belief, it will be near impossible to form agreements across the aisle.<p>I actually think that its a lot easier to achieve agreements across the aisle, where there is utility in doings so, by observing the actual things that the <i>specific</i> goals the other side has in concrete terms and appealing to them, rather than fantasizing a distant abstraction like “serving the neighbors and their country”. The latter is only useful once you determine a concrete operationalization that comports with the actual behavior of the individuals involved, but that offers nothing between a low-level concrete model of interests that avoids any high-level abstractions.<p>Now, to the extent that its often a concrete low-level interest that they want to be <i>seen</i> as motivated by the desire to serve their neighbors and their country, <i>that</i> may be useful, but that’s different than believing that that is their <i>actual</i> motivation.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40162606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40162606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aloha</span><span>|</span><a href="#40162006">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40162521">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40165007">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40162749">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40162606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40162606">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">it is cynical - but its not wrong either.<p>Nothing will change until average Americans are fed up with the status quo, and force change - that goes for basic things like making the parties work together.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40162749" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40162749" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">a_wild_dandan</span><span>|</span><a href="#40162006">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40162521">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40162606">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40162793">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40162749">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40162749">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s a wonderful perspective, and largely shared by one party!

Conservative opposition to LGBT rights and similar have <i>nothing</i> to do with wanting to see people suffer, they have to do with their deep-seated belief that some things are simply wrong because something greater than us has said so.<p>They can be wrong in that deep-seated belief, but it&#x27;s unfair of OP to characterize it as sadism.</div><br/><div id="40162477" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40162477" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">whatshisface</span><span>|</span><a href="#40162006">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40162392">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40162753">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40162477">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40162477">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Part of the reason liberals hate conservatives and vice versa is that they think the government is actually representing their opponents.

This is how you roll back the country 160 years. And it&#x27;s not just that this particular law is literally from 1864, it&#x27;s that even new laws are mirroring these 160 year old laws. Many have no exception for rape, incest, or the life of the mother [1]. That&#x27;s barbaric.<p>The reason that Democrats find all of this unacceptable is that Republicans have either failed to anticipate the chaotic consequences of their actions, or -- as they argue in court in support for jail terms for people who have abortions, and that doctors should not have exception in the case of life of the mother or rape -- that they <i>intend</i> the chaos and resulting harm to women. As people suffer and die due to their actions, it&#x27;s not hard to see why rolling back laws to 1864 is objectionable to Democrats.<p>I appreciate you bringing up EU countries, but if we are striving to emulate them, we should strive to match their maternal mortality rates by providing adequate healthcare to pregnant people [2].

These are merely tools for an end.<p>The Democrats are almost as bad, but also are beholden to some level of will of the working class, but generally default to the whims of the capital owning class as much as practically possible. The Dems need to get the working class on its side to continue to exist. The pure capital owner party is the GOP and they can&#x27;t compete against them without this rhetoric. Hence, a lot of Dem ideology being lip service for populist worker issues and actual change from Dems is very rare, and when it happens, its under the approval of the many&#x2F;most capital owners (see Obamacare being a mandatory private insurance program instead of a Euro-style socialized medicine program.)<p>The better governing of the dems is by accident. If the dems govern better its only by accident due to the strong influence of the middle-class dependent on good government to survive, and if the dems could maintain power with more corrupt governing, they would.<p>This is your classic conservative vs liberal divide that defines nearly all modern capitalist nations.<p>The difference between the two parties isn&#x27;t that strong. Under capitalism, the government is a capitalist government and is nearly fully corrupted by it, regardless of party. The only real fix is to replace capitalism with socialism, but neither party will allow that, so here we are with the usual back and forth and hiding issues with workers class and capitalism under whatever social issues of the day best distract.</div><br/><div id="40164260" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40164260" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Sohcahtoa82</span><span>|</span><a href="#40162006">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40162435">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40162501">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40164260">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40164260">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The GOP caters a bit to the workers class but not a lot and is actively radicalizing them to believe they have the same interests as the capital owning class.<p>They don&#x27;t cater to them as much as they convince them that they could one day be a member of the capital owning class.<p>The whole &quot;temporarily embarrassed millionaire&quot; line.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40162501" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40162501" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smallerfish</span><span>|</span><a href="#40162006">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40162435">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40164260">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40162952">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40162501">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40162501">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The difference between the two parties isn&#x27;t that strong.<p>That&#x27;s the kind of thinking that led to Bush in 2000.

We can see stark difference between Democratic and Republican controlled states, especially when looking at the South. In terms of women&#x27;s rights, they are second class citizens in the South while their rights are protected in states with Democrats leading the charge. In states where Republicans have complete control, they&#x27;ve asserted full control over women. That&#x27;s a real difference between Democrats and Republicans that I hope you can appreciate.<p>In the South they are banning DEI, queer books, and trans participation in public life. This is not happening in Democratic controlled places, and that&#x27;s not just lip service, that&#x27;s for real. People&#x27;s jobs are being impacted by this, teachers are fleeing Republican controlled states.<p>You look at rate of infant mortality, pregnancy complications, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, opioid addiction, childhood poverty, poverty in general, and it all looks better in Blue versus Red states. That&#x27;s real data we can look at which tells us the parties are different. Under Democratic administrations, access to healthcare is expanded. Under Republican control, it contracts. I know it&#x27;s not your preferred solution, and I&#x27;d like a better one too, but when it comes time to vote I&#x27;m damn for sure voting for the party that causes healthcare access to expand.<p>And Trump&#x27;s problem isn&#x27;t that he has poor diction or vocabulary, it&#x27;s that what he says is literally insane and psychopathic. The SC case today was evidence of that, where he argued in court that he deserves the power to assassinate his rivals and to order the military to stage a coup without fear of prosecution. Democrats are not arguing this position in court.<p>Yes both will not address the fundamental problems of capitalism, and the working class will continue to suffer under both, but the data say they will suffer more under Republicans compared to Democrats.<p>We are not talking about window dressing we are talking about measurably less suffering. I understand that&#x27;s not the &quot;no suffering&quot; benchmark you&#x27;d like to achieve, but how about we not let perfect be the enemy of better?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40162952" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40162952" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">whacko_quacko</span><span>|</span><a href="#40162006">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40162435">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40162501">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40162506">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40162952">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40162952">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;The only real fix is [...] socialism<p>And that would be a first, because no one has tried &quot;real socialism&quot;(tm) before, right?</div><br/><div id="40163013" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40163013" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">elteto</span><span>|</span><a href="#40162006">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40162952">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40162506">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40163013">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40163013">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This time around it will work!

If we are going by a jury trial, then it&#x27;s &quot;sexual abuse&quot;.  If we are not going by a jury trial, then it&#x27;s made up, cooked up, porn star and Democrat Party political dirt to &quot;get Trump&quot; -- Trump with a &quot;porn star&quot;.  Naa ....  While married to Melania??? Naa!!  While planning to run for POTUS, take a risk of being extorted???  Whatever Trump is, he&#x27;s NOT bonkers, brain-dead stupid.

So, likely we can never know for sure about such things.<p>As I recall, there is a document signed by Carroll that no rape ever happened.<p>Uh, maybe Trump was guilty of the bad judgment of being in the women&#x27;s department of a high end NYC department store ....<p>Or, maybe it&#x27;s about &quot;defamation&quot; of a porn star?<p>Maybe it&#x27;s about getting $130,000 to keep quiet.<p>&gt; Arizona<p>Seems to have to do with Kelli Ward and nothing directly with Trump.

(A) From watching Trump&#x27;s J6 speech, I don&#x27;t believe he did anything wrong on J6 -- he didn&#x27;t even have an opportunity to do anything wrong.  (B) The J6 committee looked like a kangaroo court, not at all objective, just to sow doubt about Trump.  It was not a real court and was just a committee of Congress, and apparently they are permitted to do whatever they want.  So, they wanted to dump on Trump -- we can believe that.<p>&gt; Federal<p>That&#x27;s a bunch of DC stuff saying that, yes, Trump has rights, e.g., 1st rights, but still from his words within those rights did something illegal.  Nonsense.  On troops for J6, there are claims that (a) that decision is up to the Speaker, Pelosi, (b) within plenty of time Trump offered a big force from the military, (c) the Mayor of DC also turned down both Trump and the DC Chief of Police.  Besides, what I saw of J6 was (a) US citizens legally petitioning Congress for redress of grievances, (b) some guy in a Buffalo costume, (c) a police officer assuming his &quot;tactical stance&quot; and killing some citizen for no good reason, (d) some small fraction of the people misbehaving in ways that should get them arrested.<p>As I saw the 2020 election, in some of the &quot;swing states&quot; (a) the local Democrats had a long standing, non-trivial, and effective <i>machine</i> to <i>create</i> votes, at least as mail-in ballots, as necessary and, in a close election, sufficient and (b) the state governments declined to exercise their authorities to investigate the situation.

That Trump raped was with his fingers does not make his rape any less rape.<p><pre><code>  The jury’s unanimous verdict in Carroll II was almost entirely in favor of Ms. Carroll. The only point on which Ms. Carroll did not prevail was whether she had proved that Mr. Trump had “raped” her within the narrow, technical meaning of a particular section of the New York Penal Law – a section that provides that the label “rape” as used in criminal prosecutions in New</code></pre>
York applies only to vaginal penetration by a penis. Forcible, unconsented-to penetration of the vagina or of other bodily orifices by fingers, other body parts, or other articles or materials is not called “rape” under the New York Penal Law. It instead is labeled “sexual abuse.”<p>Do I need to make this more clear? Putting a part of your body into another person&#x27;s body without their consent is rape. A court found Trump did that, and now people don&#x27;t want him to be president for that among other reasons. Not hard to understand.<p>&gt; maybe Trump was guilty of the bad judgment<p>No. The jury found he&#x27;s guilty of rape, not bad judgment. Trump is a rapist.<p>&gt; Seems to have to do with Kelli Ward and nothing directly with Trump<p>Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator in the indictment, so it relates directly to him. The acts under indictment are the various frauds the defendants underwent in service of Trump&#x27;s coup plot. They are also Trump campaign surrogates. This is another reason people don&#x27;t like Trump -- he surrounds himself with people willing to commit crimes, and asks people to commit crimes for him.<p>&gt; I would trust any homeless person<p>You don&#x27;t have to Trust the legal system, you have to trust Georgia&#x27;s Republican SoS and Republican Governor, who <i>felt</i> so pressured by Trump to overturn the election that they started recording and leaking calls with him doing exactly that. Another reason people don&#x27;t like him.<p>&gt; he didn&#x27;t even have an opportunity to do anything wrong. (B) The J6 committee looked like a kangaroo court, not at all objective, just to sow doubt about Trump.<p>See, this is how I know you didn&#x27;t read any of the information I linked to nor did you watch the hearings. Because if your had you would know the speech was not the coup. That you keep trying to deflect to it shows me you didn&#x27;t even consider the vast array of evidence laid out by the committee. They show the effort that went on months beforehand which <i>culminated</i> in the J6 insurrection was the coup attempt.<p>&gt; Besides, what I saw of J6 was...<p>This has been litigated in court for years. The opportunity to petition was prior to December 14, the date states certify their elections. Trump, appropriately, brought 60+ challenges in court and lost all but 1 due to lack of evidence. Since then, he has not brought any proof of fraud. He had none at the time, and after plenty of forensic audits in the intervening years, fraud at the alleged scale has not been found in any of the disputed states.<p>So it was all a lie at the time, and we know that now. By Dec 14, since Trump did not have that evidence, he should have dropped his challenge.<p>&gt; As I saw the 2020 election, in some of the &quot;swing states&quot; (a) the local Democrats had a long standing, non-trivial, and effective machine to create votes<p>This is not what happened at all. What really happened was that many states had affected CVOID emergency measures to allow people to vote by mail who wouldn&#x27;t usually have permission to. In my state, PA, it was <i>Republicans</i> who passed a measure allowing no excuse ballot access in 2019.<p>But either way, state governments have not in any way declined to exercise their authorities to investigate the situation. All elections have been audited several times by now with no anomalies on the scale alleged detected. Nevada results were even opened up to a third party, the Cyber Ninjas, who were a right wing group intent on proving that some ballots came from China by examining the paper they were printed on. They found nothing. Actually what they found through their audit was Biden had more votes on their recount.<p>Anyway, it seems you have a very cursory and surface-level understanding of these matters and of US politics generally. I linked you those sources so that you would read them, in the hope that you would become more informed. Since you can&#x27;t discuss these topics past your casual observations, I would suggest just read some actual primary sources before instead of spending hundreds of words replying to me with confident ignorance.</div><br/><div id="40165143" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40165143" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">graycat</span><span>|</span><a href="#40160755">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40164707">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40161346">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40165143">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40165143">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This rape stuff makes no sense:  Before seeing your quote, I saw it myself when I looked at the PDF, and it sounds like Trump was convicted of <i>finger</i> rape.

Instead, jurors opted for a second option: sexual abuse.&quot;<p>So, sounds like the jury didn&#x27;t say &quot;rape&quot;, with either penis or fingers and only &quot;sexual abuse&quot;.<p>Finally, the whole Carroll thing, I don&#x27;t believe it -- Trump is not that stupid.  What I believe is the $130,000.<p>For Georgia, sure, in principle and thankfully, it is up to the Georgia Secretary of State and the Governor, in principle.  But it sure looks like that hate Trump prosecutor and her boyfriend are 99% of the reality there.<p>For the Arizona case, right, there are the charges that somehow near the end of his term, he went around the country doing something illegal complaining about the <i>integrity</i> of the election.  So, he went around complaining.  And maybe he had some coffee with Kelli.  That should be no crime.  And, with the Judge Merchant and Bragg case, there is a lot of <i>lawfare</i> going on.  Trump did something illegal in Arizona????  Naw.<p>Again, the J6 committee was 99 44&#x2F;100% Democrat propaganda.<p>The <i>recounts</i>, etc. -- if it was just counting again some crooked ballots, then that doesn&#x27;t mean anything.  The Chinese paper thing, then the changes for Covid thing, all looks like maybe something valid.  I saw more accusations, e.g., trucks of fake mail-in ballots arriving late at night, but the information is too thin to take seriously.  So, if there was cheating, I don&#x27;t know how it was done.<p>Maybe the bottom line is &quot;Politics is dirty business&quot; and differs mostly only in how dirty.  At this point, with the lawfare, the Democrats look like the dirty ones and look especially dirty since 2020.<p>Thanks for your materials.  Apparently you believe those materials mean more than I do, but maybe they mean something.<p>For the 50:1 case outcome, looks like NO ONE in power wanted to open that possible Pandora&#x27;s Box.<p>With the current lawfare Florida to Maine, it looks like the Democrats are going after Trump any way they can.  That makes the legal cases you referenced questionable.  The Democrats have a lot of power and money, and they can file lots of lawfare cases, and it looks like that&#x27;s what they have been doing.  I expect that some judges will retire, some higher courts will jump in and hose out the crap,  some lawyers will be disbarred, and Trump will win all the cases.  Why?  In the lawfare, the main goal is not to convict Trump but just to tie him up in court, cost him a lot of time, money, and energy, sow doubt among some voters, and keep him off the campaign trail until 11&#x2F;5&#x2F;2024.  The Democrats are calling the fire trucks.  For that there doesn&#x27;t have to be a fire or even smoke, and there isn&#x27;t.<p>For 2024, Trump promises to have enough lawyers, poll watchers, etc. to have high election integrity.  Maybe we will get some more information on how the Democrats try to cheat.<p>Look, there is something in this whole mud wrestling ring more certain and wrong than any of the actual legal accusations against Trump -- the Democrat&#x27;s lawfare attack on Trump.<p>I was glad to get your references -- the DC one is a riot, a scream: As the PDF explains, he was fully within his rights to object to the 2020 election BUUUUUT:  They are going to charge him anyway with, what, confusing the politics, the public?????  Gads.

Firstly. The incentives for politicians, especially minor ones, are to avoid making enemies more than make friends --- they don&#x27;t want you to know how they feel. Secondly, and more importantly, they have zero incentive to consistently feel anything as the political landscape and space of compromises shape-shifts.<p>You talk about reaching across the aisle as an unvarnished good thing, but as a voter there some deals are really worth it, and some deals are not worth it --- not all deals&#x2F;compromises are good.<p>When individuals are fickle and nebulous, there is no way to vote on individuals that adequately conveys this sort of information.

Again, entirely by design. In the current term, there is an inocuous sounding case called Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo [1], which is expected to overturn a longstanding (~40 years) precedent called Chevron [2]. This would gut Federal agencies. Chevron set a precedent that in areas of ambiguity courts would give deference to Federal agencies. The argument for this is that Congress has to be explicit but Congress cannot possibly explicitly regulate, for example, salmon quotas and inspections. The goal here is deregulation for profit. That&#x27;s it.<p>For the last 30+ years, every president issues an executive order on day 1 either banning or allowing recipients of foreign aid to provide counselling on abortion, depending on the party.<p>The real question here is why did this take 3 years into Biden&#x27;s regime for the FCC to act?

That is not an issue with methodology though, just political opinion about the specific policies.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40165557" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40165557" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lenerdenator</span><span>|</span><a href="#40160547">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40160962">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40161113">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40160647">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40165557">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40165557">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">People with this viewpoint seem to forget that Congress often granted these agencies these powers, or at least, were vague enough in their definition to allow it to plausibly happen.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that many of the people who demand that Congress do these things instead of bureaucrats are saying that in bad faith; that is, they don&#x27;t want it done <i>at all</i> and know Congress can&#x27;t possibly come to an agreement on it because they&#x27;re the same people funding the campaigns of representatives who go out of their way to sink the legislative process.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40160647" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40160647" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sigzero</span><span>|</span><a href="#40160547">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40160583">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40160962">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40160661">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40160647">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40160647">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">100%</div><br/></div></div><div id="40160661" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40160661" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MrZongle2</span><span>|</span><a href="#40160547">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40160583">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40160647">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40161629">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40160661">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40160661">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Exactly this.<p>Regardless of the winners of said election, expect a return to business as usual afterward.</div><br/><div id="40160896" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40160896" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">llamaimperative</span><span>|</span><a href="#40160547">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40160661">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40160898">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40160896">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40160896">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not really.

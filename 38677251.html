Whether or not they actually fund you, they always want you to <i>think</i> that they are going to fund you because that way they hedge their bets in two ways.  First, if they learn new information (like if you suddenly start to get traction) they can change their minds without losing face.  Second, and more importantly, as long as the answer is actually no you are potential competition for some other company that is actually in their portfolio, so they want you to think that you have a shot with them so you won&#x27;t pursue other opportunities as aggressively.<p>The only thing that actually means &quot;yes&quot; in VC land is when the check clears.</div><br/><div id="38678681" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38678681" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aurornis</span><span>|</span><a href="#38677352">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38677447">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38678681">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38678681">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Top tier VCs will definitely tell you “no” and they’ll often get there quickly.<p>It’s more often the small funds, the inexperienced family offices, and the junior associates that don’t have authority who string companies along forever.

Here&#x27;s why. (E.g. not believing in the space, issues with customer background or another part of due diligence.)<p>3. We make mistakes <i>all the time</i> and hope you prove us wrong. (I&#x27;ve pitched the partner at Sequoia who invested in FTX. His name&#x27;s Alfred, super nice guy and fully aware that screwing up is part of his job. &quot;No&quot; isn&#x27;t a value judgment.)<p>4. Happy to talk again for the next round. (If they&#x27;re a multistage fund, e.g. you won&#x27;t hear this from First Round.)<p>It&#x27;s all very predictable. The one real &quot;why&quot; you won&#x27;t typically hear back on is strength of the founding team. They won&#x27;t tell you when they think you&#x27;re the problem. But product, space, GTM, basically anything else they&#x27;re happy to dissect.<p>This is true for all of the firms that people have heard of. Of course there&#x27;s a long tail of bad VCs, too, generally podunk firms few people ever encounter anyway.

The problem is that most people who get funded are technical and do not know marketing and growing organically. However, there are lots of businesses that grow extremely well simply due to the cofounders having previous experience with marketing, often in a professional capacity.<p>My go-to example is Lemlist (and their &quot;Lempire&quot; of related products). The founders built their own cold email agency, grew that to millions just through sheer labor, then built software to automate that process and now they&#x27;re at a 200 million dollar valuation from more than 10 to 15 million dollars in annual recurring revenue. They have lots of marketing channels: organic SEO via content marketing, Facebook group with frequent events like interviews with other agency owners and salespeople, YouTube videos that are then recut and repurposed to TikTok&#x2F;Instagram&#x2F;Facebook videos, partnering with influencers, paid advertising, and of course, cold messaging other salespeople and agencies via LinkedIn and email. Most technical founders do not know or have the patience to do any of this. If they do, though, they could similarly grow to such an ARR in a few short years, as Lemlist started only in 2018. Similar examples include GoHighLevel and ClickFunnels which are almost at or over a 1 billion dollar valuation each, both bootstrapped. The ClickFunnels founder for example sold his software via live demos (both webinars and in person events) where you got X% off but only if you booked right at the end of the demo, which apparently drove quite a high percentage of their initial sales.<p>I&#x27;d highly advise founders to start a marketing agency if only to understand marketing in a real capacity and how to deliver results to paying clients. I have done so via a cold email and paid ads agency for various niches before and I believe it&#x27;s helped me immensely with future products. Best of all, you learn to be truly aligned with your customers and providing them direct value because they are paying you every month. If you make a mistake, you <i>must</i> fix it, you have no backup fund of venture capital previously raised in order to skate BY, especially now that ZIRP (zero-interest-rate phenomenon) is over.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38677527" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38677527" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">caesil</span><span>|</span><a href="#38677799">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38679876">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38677527">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38677527">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;“Talk to us again when you have traction.”<p>&gt;In our first-time founder naïveté, we took this to heart.

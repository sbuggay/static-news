It was the _combination_ of all of those things _with_ a challenging environment and mechanics that _motivate_ you to explore those features!<p>Without exploring, crafting and building, you can&#x27;t survive the dangerous creatures or you starve.<p>And people stupidly harp on the low-fidelity graphics without realizing how well Persson absolutely nailed the core requirements of game design and execution of his concept. The graphics were secondary to all of the other things I mentioned and it was very smart to simplify them, with so much new ground and working  mainly alone at first.<p>Pulling off the procedural generation and motivating the creativity is what made this masterful. Those were difficult features to program all at the same time and it took a strong understanding of game design. Persson wasn&#x27;t just lucky. He mastered programming and game design and created a novel experience.</div><br/><div id="41090492" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41090492" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">npunt</span><span>|</span><a href="#41090315">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41090716">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41090492">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41090492">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Totally agree. You can&#x27;t reduce an experience like Minecraft to any one thing, it&#x27;s the formula that makes it so enduring.<p>re: harping on Minecrafts graphics, there&#x27;s a lot of people that completely misunderstand the purpose of graphics in games and just think greater fidelity = better. Sure, in AAA games especially, graphics are there to sell the game, and that&#x27;s certainly one part of the creative ensemble that the medium is known for.<p>However, graphics also <i>enable</i> game designs. These include creating a sense of grandeur or plausibility (high fidelity), making fast feedback loops easier to see (high contrast effects), allowing for visual challenges (hidden items), freeing resources (low fidelity), and probably most importantly, drawing attention to relevant parts of play.<p>The best creative decisions are those that tend to check a lot of boxes with a single decision, and Minecraft&#x27;s lo-fi style really did that. It enabled complexity within performance constraints, drew attention to the resource game and away from the visuals, defined it&#x27;s own aesthetic reminiscent of older games, and allowed the game to be built with a very small team without a lot of art skill. Basically notch took lemons and made lemonade, and it <i>worked</i>.<p>My favorite part of the Minecraft aesthetic though is that it <i>implies you can create</i>, making the whole world creatively legible with big blocks. Other creation games in 2d &amp; 3d just don&#x27;t have this degree of creative suggestiveness, they look too much like other read-only games to make you feel like you&#x27;re an equal participant in play.</div><br/><div id="41090509" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41090509" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">p0w3n3d</span><span>|</span><a href="#41090315">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41090492">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41090716">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41090509">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41090509">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For me pixel graphics is often more appealing than badly done 3d.

Notch was screwing around cloning infiniminer in Java and Minecraft is kind of what popped out.<p>Obviously he wasn’t as interested in the PVP combat mechanics that Zach built, so he ended up leaning into survival, and had some ideas about how to extend the procedural generation ideas to make an infinite world, so… he ran into a slightly different spot in the game design universe.</div><br/><div id="41091101" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41091101" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xyzzy_plugh</span><span>|</span><a href="#41090315">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41090716">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41091164">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41091101">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41091101">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I certainly agree that Notch was standing on the shoulders of giant, brilliant Barth, and without Infiniminer we would never have gotten Minecraft. Zach&#x27;s game design is <i>so good</i> that it makes you want to build, or build better games. You can clearly see the inspiration that took hold and the potential that Infiniminer and all Barth&#x27;s other games absolutely exude. His games are worth playing not to sink time into but to simply breathe in. There&#x27;s little else quite like it.<p>But I think even then this unfairly discredits Notch. Regardless of what you think of the man, he certainly did nail it all on his own. He didn&#x27;t just clone Infiniminer -- there&#x27;s surprisingly little left in common at this point -- he used it as a springboard to <i>invent</i> what is essentially <i>a new genre</i>. You see the same sort of ingenuity in Fortnite and Roblox, who certainly have Minecraft and by lineage Infiniminer DNA in them, among others.<p>The difference is that, for a very long time, Minecraft <i>was</i> Notch, and what he did with it is still arguably unparalleled today. It&#x27;s staggeringly good for a single person. The simple core loop was incredibly ripe for iteration. But the ingenuity the game is absolutely littered with, dozens of little things, tiny decisions made between pre-alpha point releases, is all Notch. In so many ways the game made itself, like a chain reaction of features, but Notch himself is just totally engrained in the whole thing. It&#x27;s nuts.<p>To say he didn&#x27;t nail it all on his own, I simply cannot agree with. Zach Barth <i>and</i> Notch <i>both</i> made something incredible. The shame is that no one ever gave Zach Barth the comically oversized sack full of money he deserves. I will surely never fire up Infiniminer again, but I could fire up Minecraft at any time and instant fall back into the engrossing loop of the game. Though it&#x27;s been many years since I last played, I inevitably will again.<p>I&#x27;ve struggled to think of an analogy here... perhaps the closest I can come up with is Quake and Half-Life, which are even more closely related. Did Valve stand on the shoulders of giants? Absolutely. But they definitely nailed it all on their own.<p>We all build atop the works of others.</div><br/><div id="41091799" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41091799" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">iforgotpassword</span><span>|</span><a href="#41090315">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41091101">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41091164">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41091799">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41091799">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But maybe a bit of happy coincidence, or luck?

At the time of the creation of Minecraft, &quot;ugly&quot; voxel graphics were a necessary technical evil in order to allow the world to be fully editable.<p>And then, when you start from that, the only aesthetically consistent choice for textures is to stick to retro-style low resolution. photo-realistic high-res textures don&#x27;t feel entirely right.<p>&gt; Pulling off the procedural generation and motivating the creativity is what made this masterful. Those were difficult features to program<p>I don&#x27;t think they are; it&#x27;s a matter of knowing that algorithms for noise generation that are both suitable for landscapes&#x2F;caves and computationally efficient (perlin&#x2F;simplex noise) do exist. The procgen trick itself exited for a long time before MC; Elite is famously known to have taken advantage of it, and roguelikes were using it before that.<p>&gt; It was the _combination_ of all of those things with a challenging environment and mechanics that motivate you to explore those features!<p>To me the holy grail in not-goal-oriented true-open-world sandbox games such as MC is to ascend to the <i>infinite game</i> (which remembers that one source of inspiration for MC was Infiniminer). A low-hanging fruit are the &quot;creative&quot; players, that is players that are satisfied with building huge cities (as one of the screenshots in TFA shows) or replicas of the Enterprise, Star Destroyers etc. Those tasks can in practice be infinite. If that&#x27;s not enough, you can add other infinite axis, like &quot;red stone&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s more difficult to achieve it with RPG-oriented players, because traditional MMORPG have a leveling mechanic that necessary has a maximum; lore and stories are also finite by default (this could change with generative AIs). Unless you let players create them. But you have to move to &quot;true&quot; role-playing to achieve that, like you see in also decades-old MUD games - MUD games that somewhat share with MC the property of being easily extendable because text is a much cheaper asset than audio&#x2F;video&#x2F;3d models. But role-playing somewhat assumes multi-player.<p>In single-player, a possible way out is to horizontal progression - that is, rather than having a higher and higher level <i>up</i> path, you have players to choose between mutually-exclusive options (the choice between tank&#x2F;mage&#x2F;dps in MOBAs is an example of this). In a game like MC you can have players choose between attributes that helps with farming&#x2F;fighting&#x2F;mining&#x2F;building. If you pile up those attributes, you can get a lot of player character diversity for cheap thanks to combination explosion - much like you get a lot of different-looking characters with a relatively small amount of textures for clothing. With this device players are encouraged to play multiple characters specialized in various tasks. It at least should create some form of trade between them.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Multi-user_dungeon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Multi-user_dungeon</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mudconnect.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mudconnect.com&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41088670" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41088670" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rootforce</span><span>|</span><a href="#41090315">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41089996">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41088670">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41088670">[35 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’ve been playing Minecraft off and on since beta, and I’ve been able to introduce each of my kids as they’ve gotten old enough to play.<p>It is pretty amazing, they all started in creative running around punching random things and now each one has their own way they like to play.

It was, in other words, a multi-player physics sanbox. Also, the use of the word &quot;place&quot; instead of &quot;game&quot; is interesting to note; as a child, it felt like they could really be anything, with no particular expectations.<p>I don&#x27;t remember when Lua scripting was added - I think it was around 2008-2009 or somethng - but it allowed you to perform simple event-based programming, registering clicks&#x2F;deaths&#x2F;collisions&#x2F;etc and manipulating the game world. As a child I saw this as a form of magic. What would otherwise be a physics sandbox with inanimate objects interacting in a strictly mechanistic fashion became one in which anything could happen. You know, magic. Maybe that sounds stupid, but that was my thinking.<p>So I became a programmer because I wanted to be a wizard. I am still pursuing this goal. Also, RIP Erik Cassel.

But it&#x27;s not at all clear how your complaints about servers have any bearing on the modding, which is still very much there. The Minecraft Forge docs are better than ever [0], there are 3000+ mods on Curseforge already compatible with 1.21 and 5000+ compatible with 1.20.

Obviously your average kid isn&#x27;t going to be able to move that quickly in the terminal, but there was no authentication step.)<p>&gt; It&#x27;s nice that they&#x27;ve added a bunch of functionality, but the pessimistic view is that MS spent $1.6B to force the world&#x27;s schoolchildren to make office.com logins.<p>Microsoft bought Minecraft in 2014, 3 years after it was officially released and 10 years before now. What you&#x27;re offering is a very pessimistic view given that history, especially so given that it seems to be entirely based on a single account migration from bespoke Minecraft accounts to Microsoft accounts. You can be cynical about that all you want, but speaking is a developer in a company that currently has 3 account systems I&#x27;m going to venture that that move was exactly what they claimed it was: an effort to simplify things and increase security.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.minecraftforge.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;gettingstarted&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.minecraftforge.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;gettingstarted&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.minecraft.net&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;360058525452-How-to-Setup-a-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Server" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.minecraft.net&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;360058525452-Ho...</a></div><br/><div id="41090037" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41090037" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ineptech</span><span>|</span><a href="#41088670">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41089910">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41089901">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41090037">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41090037">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not super knowledgeable about it so I should just let someone else answer; but to clarify what I was saying, I&#x27;m not talking about the account migration, I&#x27;m talking about the fact that the new version (&quot;education&quot; edition, the one most kids use because of the steep discounts to schools) client can&#x27;t connect to the old (&quot;java edition&quot;) servers.  The old server is still easy to run and hack on, but none of your friends will be able to connect to it, and while I don&#x27;t know too much about the new server, all of the how-tos I looked at start with &quot;go sign up for your free $100 worth of Azure student credits&quot;.<p>Maybe a clearer way to say it is, I&#x27;m not saying modding itself is harder, but I think that back when this article was written, if a teenager bragged that they run their own server with mods they usually meant they have a shell open on their home computer with &quot;java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M something.jar&quot; in it and a mod directory with downloaded-and-hand-edited-textfiles, and nowadays they mean they pay for a cloud server and selected mods from a list.

I still occasionally break out an old version of Java Edition and play some of the old mods that I liked back in the day. Many of those aren&#x27;t maintained any more because the creators have moved on, but many have stuck around (Biomes O&#x27; Plenty and Iron Chests have a 1.21 release, and Applied Energistics has one for 1.20 that was last updated <i>today</i>). Plus we still get amazing new mods like Create.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that the old Minecraft has really gone anywhere, it&#x27;s that, like the internet as a whole, it got so popular that geeks and nerds stopped being the majority.

Some people, myself included, consider it to be the last good version of the game. It came before the adventure update, beta 1.8, in 2011.<p>To put it simply, 1.8 is the inflection point where Minecraft stopped being a sandbox and started being, as I once saw someone call it, a &quot;pseudo-RPG&quot;. Obviously, this view is not common (EDIT: judging by some responses, maybe it is, at least on Hacker News). If people enjoy newer versions I&#x27;m not going to stop them.<p>For me, though, the main disadvantage of modern Minecraft is its complexity. I enjoyed beta 1.7.3 because I had pretty much a complete encyclopedic knowledge of it. This is much harder for modern Minecraft. I get the feeling that most people don&#x27;t enjoy that game for the same reasons I did.</div><br/><div id="41090225" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41090225" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cole-k</span><span>|</span><a href="#41089996">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41090378">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41090225">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41090225">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve played a lot of Minecraft and I still remember beta 1.7.3 very fondly -- albeit for different reasons -- but I want to offer a differing perspective.<p>I have always struggled with balancing my desire to create with my capability to create, in and out of Minecraft. I would get so inspired by all the awesome things people built, that I could never graduate from my barebones cave-with-chests because my desire to make something great made any attempt feel crummy in comparison. The most I would accomplish was making redstone contraptions because -- to be a little reductionist -- those either work or they don&#x27;t.<p>I hope you will pardon my digression, but the point I&#x27;m getting to is that in beta 1.7.3, the goals you set for yourself, and therefore the reasons for you to keep playing, were largely creative in nature, like building a cool house. Updates past this point gave players the opportunity to make simpler, game-directed goals. It used to be that you reach resource satiation quickly, but now it will take hours to obtain a fully enchanted set of diamond armor, kill the ender dragon, explore all the new generated structures, etc. In later years they&#x27;ve codified these goals in achievements, including crazy ones like getting every positive and negative effect at the same time or exploring every biome. With these updates, the people who enjoy building cool things also got more cool things to build with, but this has in my opinion been a little more secondary.<p>I understand why people might be disappointed, or at least confused, by Minecraft&#x27;s updates now pushing it toward &quot;pesudo-RPG&quot; status, but I have at least welcomed these changes because they gave me and my friends a reason to reboot our server every few years to try out the new stuff.<p>Although I will add that if your gripe is regarding combat&#x2F;pvp changes (e.g. shields) then yeah I have nothing to add to that discussion.<p>EDIT: I also agree with sibling comments about more content = more enjoyment, at least for me.

If &quot;resource satiation&quot; means &quot;having enough resources&quot;, then for some people it is impossible by nature. There&#x27;s always a temptation to do more and build more.<p>For me, I think this temptation was independent of the game itself. Looking back at my childhood, I don&#x27;t feel like there was any sharp distinction between my creations in Minecraft and any of my other creative pursuits, including programming; it all sort of blended together.

OK, let me be honest here, I don&#x27;t play any MMOs but my understanding is that after you &quot;beat&quot; the game and max your level, one thing that might bring you back outside of new content is obtaining all the best gear, different skins, whatever you might want to collect. In the same vein, in Minecraft you could imagine wanting to obtain the best armor, weapons, food, etc. In some of the servers I played on, there were players who lived in a ramshackle hut and spent most of their time mining to get enough diamonds for gear -- and after a certain point they ran out of things to improve upon for their player character so they started looking for rare items in dungeons (remember when mossy cobble was a rare item?). At some point, they had gotten enough, and saw no further reason to keep playing. An extreme case, but not completely dissimilar to my own.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41090378" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41090378" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">joelkoen</span><span>|</span><a href="#41089996">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41090225">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41090502">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41090378">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41090378">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Have you tried Better than Adventure[0]?

Both have very rich wikis you can read for hours that will give you a much better understanding of game mechanics. I&#x27;ve also gotten into the habit of keeping a txt file for a game open in vim with notes on what I&#x27;m working on or what to work on next time I play. For Stardew it&#x27;s stuff like &quot;Kent&#x27;s birthday is coming up, give him x item&quot;, or &quot;catch&#x2F;grow this before season ends&quot;. A lot of it gets deleted as I finish it, but I&#x27;ve also been thinking I should maybe flesh out a basic skeleton of important things to do on a new run so that I can get a refresher if I don&#x27;t play for a long time.<p>I think I plan less with Terraria than Stardew since the passing of time doesn&#x27;t matter much at all comparatively, but I still consult the wiki constantly to see where to get an item or what a monster drops and so on. I&#x27;ve got over 1000 hours in Terraria, but some of this stuff is just a bit much to remember, plus it can change slightly from game updates.<p>Both games have a lot of informational YouTube videos as well. All the videos of beginner tips are what finally got Stardew to click for me after owning it for years but failing to get into it. I went from taking months or years away from the game within the first Spring to finally getting sucked in enough to finish the rest of my first year within a few weeks IRL time.<p>While some people probably think it&#x27;s a chore to do all this work outside the game, I see it similarly to the author in the article, I think it enriches the experience. It also gives you a way to think about the game and get better at it while it&#x27;s not even open. I don&#x27;t like to open Stardew unless I&#x27;m prepared to play multiple hours in a row, but I can read the wiki and jot down some notes for a few minutes at any time.</div><br/><div id="41088547" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41088547" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ethbr1</span><span>|</span><a href="#41088530">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41088785">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41088547">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41088547">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not to ick anyone&#x27;s yum, but when games begin to approach the same parts of my brain that I use for work, I question why I&#x27;m not just using them to make more money instead.<p>But said as an ex-EVE player, so color comment to taste.</div><br/><div id="41088833" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41088833" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scubbo</span><span>|</span><a href="#41088530">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41088547">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41088994">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41088833">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41088833">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve heard it said that there are two kinds of Software Engineers when it comes to Factorio.<p>There&#x27;s one category who say &quot;this is just like work, but I&#x27;m not getting paid to do it; why would I do this?&quot;<p>Then there&#x27;s the other who say &quot;this is all the bits I enjoy of work, with a faster and more direct feedback loop and without all the admin&#x2F;management&#x2F;other-people bullshit; I want to do this for the rest of my life&quot;<p>I am very much in the latter camp, but I can absolutely understand the former.</div><br/><div id="41089598" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41089598" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Terr_</span><span>|</span><a href="#41088530">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41088833">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41088994">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41089598">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41089598">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Option 3: &quot;Solving these problems would be fun except they are too reminiscent of all the broken buggy real-world products that I came here to temporarily forget.&quot;</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41088994" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41088994" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">awelxtr</span><span>|</span><a href="#41088530">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41088547">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41088833">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41088674">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41088994">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41088994">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">With games there less negative repercussions if you fail.

Stuff like Minecraft: Story Mode added a richness to the franchise that you could completely ignore if you wanted to, or dive into if it appealed to you.<p>Microsoft grew Minecraft because it still had a lot of growth in it.

I was more focusing on the creative development that Minecraft saw under Microsoft.<p>Fandoms are often extremely nervous when a large corporation buys the rights to a beloved media ip, largely because this has gone wrong so many times, with poor adaptions or obvious cashgrabs milking a property until the fanbase turns away.<p>This really hasn&#x27;t happened to Minecraft. It grew further in popularity, even though it was already massively popular at the time and it did it mostly without driving away the existing fans. That in itself is quite unusual (I think) and definitely not what I would have expected. At the time I really thought that the sale would mark the beginning of Minecraft&#x27;s slow descent into irrelevancy and I definitely remember that being a fairly common sentiment.<p>But I fully understand people being mad at the license issues you mention. They should be.

Not because he couldn&#x27;t afford it, but because he didn&#x27;t have the skill (or interest) in leading a Studio that&#x27;s much bigger than ~20 people. From everything I&#x27;ve read about him it seems like he never liked any of the additional responsibilities that came with Minecrafts growing success and there are some accounts from some early members of the team that seem to corroborate this.<p>So I really don&#x27;t think he sold out. I think he realized that he couldn&#x27;t be the person to manage Minecrafts generational success and that he&#x27;d rather have 2 billion dollars in exchange for giving another company a shot at that, versus not having that money and then seeing himself fail to bring his ideas to fruition.<p>In the end that&#x27;s of course just speculation. It could just as well be that he never had any of those thoughts and just fucked off, laughing all the way to the bank and then to the biggest hollywood mansion that money can buy.
In that case I&#x27;m still glad that he got the bag from Microsoft, because I can imagine much worse ways that this could&#x27;ve gone.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41088680" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41088680" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hoten</span><span>|</span><a href="#41088439">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41088641">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41088684">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41088680">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41088680">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hardly anyone interacted with the crafting system via &quot;discovery mode&quot;.

Yes, the things &quot;Better Than Wolves&quot; did are better than what Minecraft itself delivered in that timeframe (Wolves, duh) but often what Minecraft&#x27;s devs are doing is fundamental, infrastructure work. Mojang and then Microsoft make two kinds of ore, and then add a third, boring - but modders couldn&#x27;t have added six hundred more kinds of ore without that. The built-in biomes are fine but they&#x27;re not as radical as anything modders have done - but modders couldn&#x27;t have added new biomes without that infrastructure.<p>I think Mojang and Microsoft have been very good at sketching in new ideas, enriching the concept rather than refining all the details.<p>They&#x27;ve also been good, because it&#x27;s easier for a corporation, at completion. Anybody still waiting for Jaded&#x27;s Agrarian Skies 2 ? How about for a meaningful end to Twilight Forest ?

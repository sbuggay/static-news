Absent the specification work that just wasn&#x27;t possible - it took years to get webkit to the level that you could reliably expect all pages to work, even when spoofing the user agent (sites used to user agent gate access to only Firefox and IE, nowadays they just block every that isn&#x27;t chrome[1]). The specification work helps everyone - without it you have to spend immense amounts of time reverse engineering whatever features other browsers ship if sites start using it, and similarly you don&#x27;t have to worry as much that if you ship some feature some other browser will implement it slightly differently and then you have to reverse engineer what they did in the feature you shipped without specifying. That used to happen a lot. Similarly producing a specification and going through the standards groups can help identify issues and prevent them becoming a problem before the feature is shipped. It&#x27;s super easy to go &quot;I have a problem&quot; and then make a feature that solves your specific problem rather than the more general issue you&#x27;re working with. Back while I worked on webkit, Google engineers were chronic for this, and the problem is they would then frame any pushback as being &quot;you hate the web&quot; rather than &quot;oh yeah, maybe we should have one complete spec instead of dozens of slightly different overlapping ones&quot;.<p>Overall I&#x27;d say the bulk of folk I worked with from pretty much every company I interacted with cared specifically about the web as platform independently of whatever their employer might be doing (Google, Microsoft, Apple, Mozilla, Opera, Yahoo, Facebook, are all companies I recall having significant amounts of communication with, as well as various academics, oss projects, etc and there are very few times I encountered bad faith behavior).<p>[1] Commercial site developers, especially &quot;enterprise&quot; ones, are absolutely abysmal developers.

What I didn’t know is if Kling recognized what he was doing, and was just not taking it very seriously, or if he was way over his head and was kind of oblivious.<p>I enjoyed reading this interview because it makes it very clear that Kling has a lot of experience doing this, and understands that’s it’s difficult, and is doing it because he enjoys it.<p>The reason I don’t think Ladybird will ever really get to the point where it can render an arbitrary site perfectly, is based on my experience as a web developer. I haven’t been doing web development for very long, but there have been a couple times in the last couple of years where I’ve stumbled upon browser layout bugs where Chrome&#x2F;Firefox&#x2F;Safari render something different. These are normally not issues where a browser completely misses something (ie, every browser supports flexbox these days). Rather, there are edge-case bugs that appear just by combining simple web components in simple ways. Chrome and Firefox handle a table with percentage height differently. Or a margin on a child which is larger than the parent’s width. And these are bugs that have existed for years. And for every edge-case like that where Chrome and Firefox differ, there are 10 more where the behavior is unintuitive or not defined by the spec but Firefox and Chrome have standardized.<p>But maybe, since Ladybird doesn’t have an existing buggy implementation, they’ll be able to implement the spec properly quickly the first time. I think that’s an interesting perspective that Kling brings up in this interview.<p>The other thing I want to comment on is that it’s really hard to tell how much progress they’re making.<p>&gt; We&#x27;ve taken a very vertical slice approach to adding functionality to the browser… We tend to find a webpage that we want to improve for whatever reason. Maybe it&#x27;s cool to get the New York Times to render, and then we just spend a bunch of time fixing as many issues as we can for that site… And that might not be the most structured approach to it, but it has been very, very good at keeping people motivated and excited and engaged in the work<p>This means that Ladybird “supports” a ton of features. They support flexbox! They support grid! But pretty much all of these features are only partial implementations. Kling says in the interview they support svg, and then later explains that they’re going to have to re-write the text-rendering system to get text-on-curves working. Well, to me, “supports svg” means “we have implemented the entire svg specification.” When Kling is using it to mean “we have some portion of svg’s work. We don’t crash when we see an svg element.” I’m not saying Kling’s definition is wrong, but it’s another factor that makes it difficult to judge where the project is.<p>To start to wrap up this (long) comment, let me restate the four claims I’m making. (This is not the conclusion, this is the summary before the conclusion, hang on.)<p>* Ladybird is developed differently in two ways: vertical slices, and being implemented from scratch in modern times.<p>* there are people who are misled by the vertical-slices and Kling’s use of “support” to believe that Ladybird development is a lot farther along than it is.<p>* There are people like me who think that Ladybird will never complete with existing browser engines (we also have a hard time judging Ladybird’s progress for the reasons stated above).<p>* These same reasons may allow Ladybird to reach compatibility with other browsers.<p>I have a lot of respect for Kling, and I think it’s cool that they’ve been able to accomplish so much “for the fun of it”. As mentioned in the interview, this will have short-term positive impact even if it never matches Chrome. If it wasn’t clear from how long this was, I’m actually really enthusiastic about the project, and I’ll be looking at ways to contribute in the future.</div><br/><div id="36623529" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36623529" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">_gabe_</span><span>|</span><a href="#36623117">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36623449">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36623529">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36623529">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The reason I don’t think Ladybird will ever really get to the point where it can render an arbitrary site perfectly, is based on my experience as a web developer.

Who&#x27;s right, Chrome, Firefox, or Safari?<p>I 100% believe Ladybird will eventually be able to render arbitrary sites in an acceptable format at some point (potentially within the next year or two). It&#x27;s pretty remarkable how many sites look very close to acceptable already. Any weird edge cases where Ladybird renders stuff differently from a big browser won&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s rendering the site &quot;imperfectly&quot;; just like how when Firefox and Chrome do different things, it doesn&#x27;t mean either one is &quot;correct&quot;.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36623449" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36623449" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seti0Cha</span><span>|</span><a href="#36623117">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36623529">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36628076">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36623449">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36623449">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You should check out his browser hacking videos.

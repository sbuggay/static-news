I think this market is tremendously huge - from hobbyists on Reels, to enterprise creating employee trainings, to SMBs needing TikTok content, to information businesses working with mostly long-form video (which is the niche we are after).<p>But because the market is so big, you need to be clear who can make the most from your tool, so that they can find you. This will also guide your feature set and your UX (e.g. we decided to never ever have a timeline, which is the opposite of everything else that was in the market at the time). There are a bunch of counter-intuitive contrarian moves ahead of you if you want to reach PMF, and I believe you can&#x27;t figure those out without talking to a narrow type of user.<p>Just my two cents. I wish you a super successful launch!</div><br/><div id="41176900" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41176900" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bithavoc</span><span>|</span><a href="#41175984">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41176261">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41176900">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41176900">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m looking at your website, where did you get this idea?

&gt; Some of our key advantages are:
&gt;    Direct access to the C-Level of the company - meaning you can request features and we&#x27;ll tend to it
&gt;    Good free tier so you can get started without having to commit

I would say something like &quot;Save hours on every video you edit using our features like text-based editing and quick import and export.&quot; and if you want to show you are open to feedback, I would again talk about speed along the lines of &quot;If you know of ways how we can save you even more time creating great video content, you can directly discuss these feature request... etc&quot;</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41176170" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41176170" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nihey</span><span>|</span><a href="#41175898">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41177888">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41176122">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41176170">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41176170">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I get what you&#x27;re saying, personally, I prefer more slowly-paced videos.<p>This fast-paced editing with no breathing in between sentences is a trend that I believe will shift sometime in the future.<p>My tool allows the user to choose whether he would like to remove the silence and how much time between each cut.

Presumably when a video has a pause, it is a moment someone can think, and thus also think about perhaps not watching the video.

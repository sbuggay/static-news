Their trick is probably some combination of motivated passengers, asking people to put stuff under the seat in from, remote stands that need a bus and flight attendants constantly announcing „please don’t block the aisle”.</div><br/><div id="40186849" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40186849" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cryptonector</span><span>|</span><a href="#40186611">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40187024">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40186849">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40186849">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Having not one more carry-on&#x2F;roll-aboard than will fit in the overhead compartments is easily the most important thing to get right.

That&#x27;s how you do quick boarding. Southwest has always done it that way. They start boarding 30 minutes before departure. And stop 10 minutes before.<p>What the long boarding line accomplishes is that it forces people to wait in a long line, which you can charge them to skip.

Yet also what I do is an extreme oulier as everyone just focuses on their needs and fuck others. Also bonus for being  considerate, when the commotion finally settles and I reach to store my bags, there&#x27;s no room anymore because everyone brought not one but 5 bags each and stuffed them in the least optimum way, one layout occupying on average the space for three.<p>After several such experiences you fall back to the least common denominator: block everyone until you stuff your 7 handbags occupying 3 compartments and fuck the next people in line.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40186614" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40186614" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thriftwy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40186492">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40186614">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40186614">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why was it ever a problem?

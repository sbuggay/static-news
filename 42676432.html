So if you want&#x2F;need to swap between Python versions (3.11 to 3.12 for example), it doesn&#x27;t give you anything. Generally people use an additional tool such as pyenv to manage this. Tools like uv and Poetry do this as well as handling dependencies<p>- pip doesn&#x27;t resolve dependencies of dependencies. pip will only respect version pinning for dependencies you explicitly specify. So for example, say I am using pandas and I pin it to version X. If a dependency of pandas (say, numpy) isn&#x27;t pinned as well, the underlying version of numpy can still change when I reinstall dependencies. I&#x27;ve had many issues where my environment stopped working despite none of my specified dependencies changing, because underlying dependencies introduced breaking changes. To get around this with pip you would need an additional tool like pip-tools, which allows you to pin all dependencies, explicit and nested, to a lock file for true reproducibility. uv and poetry do this out of the box.<p>- Tool usage. Say there is a python package you want to use across many environments without installing in the environments themselves (such as a linting tool like ruff). With pip, you need to install another tool like pipx to install something that can be used across environments. uv can do this out of the box.<p>Plus there is a whole host of jobs that tools like uv and poetry aim to assist with that pip doesn&#x27;t, namely project creation and management. You can use uv to create a new Python project scaffolding for applications or python modules in a way that conforms with PEP standards with a single command. It also supports workspaces of multiple projects that have separate functionality but require dependencies to be in sync.<p>You can accomplish a lot&#x2F;all of this using pip with additional tooling, but its a lot more work. And not all use cases will require these.</div><br/><div id="42678209" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42678209" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">driggs</span><span>|</span><a href="#42676837">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42677048">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42677793">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42678209">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42678209">[19 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, generally people already use an additional tool for managing their Python executables, like their operating system&#x27;s package manager:<p><pre><code>  $&gt; sudo apt-get install python3.10 python3.11 python3.12

In fact the reason it gets stuck on resolution sometimes is <i>exactly because</i> it resolved transitive dependencies and found that they were mutually incompatible.<p>Here&#x27;s an example which will also help illustrate the rest of my reply. I make a venv for Python 3.8, and set up a new project with a deliberately poorly-thought-out pyproject.toml:<p><pre><code>  [project]
  name=&quot;example&quot;
  version=&quot;0.1.0&quot;
  dependencies=[&quot;pandas==2.0.3&quot;, &quot;numpy==1.17.3&quot;]
</code></pre>
I&#x27;ve specified the oldest version of Numpy that has a manylinux wheel for Python 3.8 and the newest version of Pandas similarly. These are both acceptable for the venv separately, but mutually incompatible on purpose.<p>When I try to `pip install -e .` in the venv, Pip happily explains (granted the first line is a bit strange):<p><pre><code>  ERROR: Cannot install example and example==0.1.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

  The conflict is caused by:
      example 0.1.0 depends on numpy==1.17.3
      pandas 2.0.3 depends on numpy&gt;=1.20.3; python_version &lt; &quot;3.10&quot;

  To fix this you could try to:
  1. loosen the range of package versions you&#x27;ve specified
  2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
</code></pre>
If I change the Numpy pin to 1.20.3, that&#x27;s the version that gets installed. (`python-dateutil`, `pytz`, `six` and `tzdata` are also installed.) If I remove the Numpy requirement completely and start over, Numpy 1.24.4 is installed instead - the latest version compatible with Pandas&#x27; transitive specification of the dependency. Similarly if I unpin Pandas and ask for any version - Pip will try to install the latest version it can, and it turns out that the latest Pandas version that declares compatibility with 3.8, indeed allows for fetching 3.8-compatible dependencies. (Good job not breaking it, Pandas maintainers! Although usually this is trivial, because your dependencies are also actively maintained.)<p>&gt; pip will only respect version pinning for dependencies you explicitly specify. So for example, say I am using pandas and I pin it to version X. If a dependency of pandas (say, numpy) isn&#x27;t pinned as well, the underlying version of numpy can still change when I reinstall dependencies.<p>Well, sure; Pip can&#x27;t respect a version pin that <i>doesn&#x27;t exist anywhere in your project</i>. If the specific version of Pandas you want says that it&#x27;s okay with a range of Numpy versions, then of course Pip has freedom to choose one of those versions. If that matters, you explicitly specify it. Other programs like uv can&#x27;t fix this. They can only choose different resolution strategies, such as &quot;don&#x27;t update the transitive dependency if the environment already contains a compatible version&quot;, versus &quot;try to use the most recent versions of everything that meet the specified compatibility requirements&quot;.<p>&gt; To get around this with pip you would need an additional tool like pip-tools, which allows you to pin all dependencies, explicit and nested, to a lock file for true reproducibility.<p>No, you just use Pip&#x27;s options to determine what&#x27;s already in the environment (`pip list`, `pip freeze` etc.) and pin everything that needs pinning (whether with a Pip requirements file or with `pyproject.toml`). Nothing prevents you from listing your transitive dependencies in e.g. the [project.dependencies] of your pyproject.toml, and if you pin them, Pip will take that constraint into consideration. Lock files are for when you need to care about alternate package sources, checking hashes etc.; or for when you want an explicit representation of your dependency graph in metadata for the sake of other tooling.<p>&gt; This assumes the Python version you need is available from your package manager&#x27;s repo. This won&#x27;t work if you want a Python version either newer or older than what is available.<p>I have built versions 3.5 through 3.13 inclusive from source and have them installed in &#x2F;opt and the binaries symlinked in &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin. It&#x27;s not difficult at all.<p>&gt; True, but it&#x27;s not best practice to do that because while the tool gets installed globally, it is not necessarily linked to a specific python version, and so it&#x27;s extremely brittle.<p>What brittleness are you talking about? There&#x27;s no reason why the tool needs to run in the same environment as the code it&#x27;s operating on. You can install it in its own virtual environment, too. Since tools generally are applications, I use Pipx for this (which really just wraps a bit of environment management around Pip). It works great; for example I always have the standard build-frontend `build` (as `pyproject-build`) and the uploader `twine` available. They run from a guaranteed-compatible Python.<p>And they would if they were installed for the system Python, too. (I just, you know, don&#x27;t want to do that because the system Python is the system package manager&#x27;s responsibility.) The separate environment don&#x27;t matter because the tool&#x27;s code and the operated-on project&#x27;s code <i>don&#x27;t even need to run at the same time</i>, let alone in the same process. In fact, it would make no sense to be running the code while actively trying to build or upload it.<p>&gt; And it gets even more complex if you need different tools that have different Python version requirements.<p>No, you just let each tool have the virtual environment it requires. And you can update them in-place in those environments, too.</div><br/><div id="42680097" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42680097" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jshen</span><span>|</span><a href="#42676837">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42679674">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42679235">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42680097">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42680097">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Well, sure; Pip can&#x27;t respect a version pin that doesn&#x27;t exist anywhere in your project.

But both Poetry and Uv go further beyond that as well, aiming to help with the rest of the development workflow (such as building your package for upload to PyPI).<p>If you like Pipx, you might be interested in some tips in my recent blog post (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zahlman.github.io&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2025&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;python-packaging-2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zahlman.github.io&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2025&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;python-packaging-...</a>). In particular, if you do need to install libraries, you can expose Pipx&#x27;s internal copy of Pip for arbitrary use instead of just for updating the venvs that Pipx created.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42677793" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42677793" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kiddico</span><span>|</span><a href="#42676837">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42677048">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42678209">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42677924">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42677793">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42677793">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sometimes I feel like my up vote doesn&#x27;t adequately express my gratitude.<p>I appreciate how thorough this was.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42677924" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42677924" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stavros</span><span>|</span><a href="#42676837">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42677048">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42677793">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42679117">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42677924">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42677924">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh wow, it actually <i>can</i> handle the Python executable?

Of course, that doesn&#x27;t solve the issues you had with Pip, but it demonstrates that &quot;maintaining its own stable Python environment&quot; is just not a problem.<p>&gt;Writing uv in Rust was genius because it eliminates that problem of the system having a stable surface to stand on instead of pipping itself into oblivion, never mind that it is much faster than my system would have been.<p>From what I can tell, the speed mainly comes from algorithmic issues, caching etc. Pip is just slow above and beyond anything Python forces on it.<p>An example. On my system, creating a new venv from scratch with Pip included (which loads Pip from within its own vendored wheel, which then runs in order to bootstrap itself into the venv) takes just over 3 seconds. Making a new venv <i>without</i> Pip, then asking a separate copy of Pip to install an already downloaded Pip wheel would be about 1.7 seconds. But making that venv and using the actual internal installation logic of Pip (which has been extracted by Pip developer Pradyun Gedam as <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pypa&#x2F;installer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pypa&#x2F;installer</a> ) would take about 0.25 seconds. (There&#x27;s no command-line API for this; in my test environment I just put the `installer` code side by side with a driver script, which is copied from my development work on Paper.) It presumably could be faster still.<p>I honestly have no idea what Pip is doing the rest of that time. It only needs to unzip an archive and move some files around and perform trivial edits to others.<p>&gt; (My system had the extra feature that it used http range requests to extract the metadata from wheel files before pypi started letting you download the metadata directly.)<p>Pip has had this feature for a long time (and it&#x27;s still there - I think to support legacy projects without wheels, because I think the JSON API won&#x27;t be able to provide the data since PyPI doesn&#x27;t build the source packages). It&#x27;s why the PyPI server supports range requests in the first place.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d worked on plenty of projects where I was right about the technology and wrong about the politics and I am so happy that uv has saved the Python community from itself.<p>The community&#x27;s politics are indeed awful.

The dependency management and installation is lightning quick.
It deals with all of the python versioning<p>and I think a killer feature is the ability to inline dependencies in your Python source code, then use: uv tool run &lt;scriptname&gt;<p>Your script code would like:<p>#!&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;env -S uv run --script
# &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; script

# dependencies = [
#     &quot;...&quot;,
#     &quot;...&quot;
# ]
# &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F;<p>Then uv will make a new venv, install the dependencies, and execute the script faster than you think. The first run is a bit slower due to downloads and etc, but the second and subsequent runs are a bunch of internal symlink shuffling.<p>It is really interesting. You should at least take a look at a YT or something.

The ability to create venvs so fast, that it becomes a silent operation that the end user never thinks about anymore.<p>I might just blow your mind here:<p><pre><code>  $ time python -m venv with-pip

The thing that actually takes time is installing Pip into the venv. I already have local demonstrations that this installation can be an order of magnitude faster in native Python. But it&#x27;s also completely unnecessary to do that:<p><pre><code>  $ source without-pip&#x2F;bin&#x2F;activate
  (without-pip) $ ~&#x2F;.local&#x2F;bin&#x2F;pip --python `which python` install package-installation-test

I have wrappers for this, of course (and I&#x27;m explicitly showing the path to a separate Pip that&#x27;s already on my path for demonstration purposes).<p>&gt; a killer feature is the ability to inline dependencies in your Python source code, then use: uv tool run &lt;scriptname&gt;<p>Yes, Uv implements PEP 723 &quot;Inline Script Metadata&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peps.python.org&#x2F;pep-0723&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peps.python.org&#x2F;pep-0723&#x2F;</a>) - originally the idea of Paul Moore from the Pip dev team, whose competing PEP 722 lost out (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discuss.python.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;_&#x2F;29905" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discuss.python.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;_&#x2F;29905</a>). He&#x27;s been talking about a feature like this for quite a while, although I can&#x27;t easily find the older discussion. He seems to consider it out of scope for Pip, but it&#x27;s also available in Pipx as of version 1.4.2 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pipx.pypa.io&#x2F;stable&#x2F;CHANGELOG&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pipx.pypa.io&#x2F;stable&#x2F;CHANGELOG&#x2F;</a>).<p>&gt; The first run is a bit slower due to downloads and etc, but the second and subsequent runs are a bunch of internal symlink shuffling.<p>Part of why Pip is slow at this is because it <i>insists</i> on checking PyPI for newer versions even if it has something cached, and because its internal cache is designed to simulate an Internet connection and go through all the usual metadata parsing etc. instead of just storing the wheels directly. But it&#x27;s also just slow at actually installing packages when it already has the wheel.<p>In principle, nothing prevents a Python program from doing caching sensibly and from shuffling symlinks around.</div><br/><div id="42680573" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42680573" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">matsemann</span><span>|</span><a href="#42676837">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42680126">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42676900">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42680573">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42680573">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s not the &quot;runtime&quot; that&#x27;s slow for me with pip, but all the steps needed.

In other languages with package managers you generally specify your requirements with ranges and get a lock file with exact versions of those and any transitive dependencies letting you easily recreate a known working environment. The only way to do that in pip is to make a *new* venue install then pip freeze. I think pip tools package is supposed to help but it&#x27;s a separate tool (one which I&#x27;ve also includes). 
Also putting stuff in pyproject.toml feels more solid then requirements files (and allows options to be set on requirements (like installing only one package that&#x27;s only on your company&#x27;s private python package index mirror while installing the others from the global python package index) and allows dev dependencies and other optional features dependency groups without multiple requirements files and having to update locks on those files.<p>It also automatically creates venvs if you delete them. And it automatically updates packages when you run something with uv run file.py (useful when somebody may have updated the requirements in git). It also lets you install self contained (installed in a virtualenv and linked to ~&#x2F;.local&#x2F;bin which is added to your path)python tools (replacing pipx). It installs self contained python builds letting you more easily pick python version and specify it in a .python-version file for your project (replacing pyenv and usually much nicer because pyenv compiles them locally)<p>Uv also makes it easier to explore and say start a ipython shell with 2 libraries
uv run --with ipython --with colorful --with https ipython<p>It caches downloads.

It&#x27;s a package <i>installer</i>, only. Of course it doesn&#x27;t handle the environment setup for you; it&#x27;s not intended for that. And of course it doesn&#x27;t keep track of what you&#x27;ve installed, or make lock files, or update your `pyproject.toml`, or...<p>What it <i>does</i> do is offer a hideously complex set of options for installing everything under the sun, from everywhere under the sun. (And that complexity has led to long-standing, seemingly unfixable issues, and there are a lot of design decisions made that I think are questionable at best.)<p>Ideas like &quot;welllll I use poetry but pyenv works or you could use conda too&quot; are incoherent. They&#x27;re for different purposes and different users, with varying bits of overlap. The reason people are unsatisfied is because any given tool might be missing one of the specific things they want, unless it&#x27;s <i>really</i> all-in-one like Uv seems like it intends to be eventually.<p>But once you have a truly all-in-one tool, you notice how little of it you&#x27;re using, and how big it is, and how useless it feels to have to put the tool name at the start of <i>every</i> command, and all the specific little things you don&#x27;t like about its implementation of whatever individual parts. Not to mention the feeling of &quot;vendor lock-in&quot;. Never mind that I didn&#x27;t pay money for it; I still don&#x27;t want to feel stuck with, say, your build back-end just because I&#x27;m using your lock-file updater.<p>In short, I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> a &quot;package manager&quot;.<p>I want a solid foundation (better than Pip) that handles installing (not managing) applications and packages, into either a specified virtual environment or a new one created (not managed, except to make it easy to determine the location, so other tools can manage it) for the purpose. In other words, something that fully covers the needs of <i>users</i> (making it possible to run the code), while providing only the bare minimum on top of that for developers - so that other developer tools can cooperate with that. And then I want specialized tools for all the individual things developers need to do.<p>The specialized tools I want for my own work all exist, and the tools others want mostly exist too. Twine uploads stuff to PyPI; `build` is a fine build front-end; Setuptools would do everything I need on the back-end (despite my annoyances with it). I don&#x27;t need a lockfile-driven workflow and don&#x27;t readily think in those terms. I use pytest from the command line for testing and I don&#x27;t want a &quot;package manager&quot; nor &quot;workflow tool&quot; to wrap that for me. If I needed any wrapping there I could do a few lines of shell script myself. If anything, the problem with <i>these</i> tools is doing too much, rather than too little.<p>The base I want doesn&#x27;t exist yet, so I&#x27;ve started making it myself. Pipx is a big step in the right direction, but it has some arbitrary limitations (I discuss these and some workarounds in my recent blog post <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zahlman.github.io&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2025&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;python-packaging-2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zahlman.github.io&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2025&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;python-packaging-...</a> ) and it&#x27;s built on Pip so it inherits those faults and is that much bigger. Uv is even bigger still for the compiled binary, and I would only be using the installation parts.</div><br/><div id="42680955" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42680955" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">botanical76</span><span>|</span><a href="#42676837">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42679317">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42681054">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42680955">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42680955">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Do you feel that Npm, mix, cargo went the wrong way, doing too much?

Meanwhile python has an entire tool with strange ideosyncracies that you have to pay attention to otherwise pip does the wrong thing by default.<p>It is as if python is pretending to be a special snowflake where installing libraries into a folder is this super hyper mega overcomplicated thing that necessitates a whole dedicated tool just to manage, when in reality in other programming languages nobody is really thinking about that the fact that the libraries end up in their build folders. It just works.<p>So again you&#x27;re pretending that this is such a big deal that it needs a whole other tool, when the problem in question is so trivial that another tool is adding mental overhead with regard to the microscopic problem at hand.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42679226" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42679226" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bityard</span><span>|</span><a href="#42676837">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42677101">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42679226">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42679226">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I usually stay away far FAR from shiny new tools but I&#x27;ve been experimenting with uv and I really like it.

This has nice benefits. For example, automated tests that include linting with ruff do not suddenly fail because the system-wide ruff was updated to a version that changes rules (or different versions are on different machines). Version pinning gets applied to tooling just as it does to packages. I can then upgrade tools when I know it&#x27;s a good time to deal with potentially breaking changes.

In fact, now I usually don&#x27;t even bother typing pip install, PyCharm does it for me.<p>This is of course bad practice. What I would like instead is what PHP&#x27;s composer does: installing stuff automatically changes pyprpject.toml (or whatever the standard will be with uv), automatically freezes the versions, and then it is on git diff to tell me what I did last night, I&#x27;ll remove a couple of lines from that file, run composer install and it will remove packages not explicitly added to my config from the environment.

But while you <i>can</i> list transitive dependencies, specify exact versions etc. in pyproject.toml, it&#x27;s not specifically designed as a lockfile - i.e., pyproject.toml is meant for <i>abstract</i> dependencies, where an installer figures out transitively what&#x27;s needed to support them and decides on exact versions to install.<p>The current work for specifying a lockfile standard is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peps.python.org&#x2F;pep-0751&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peps.python.org&#x2F;pep-0751&#x2F;</a> . As someone else pointed out, uv currently already uses a proprietary lockfile, but there has been community interest in trying to standardize this - it just has been hard to find agreement on exactly what it needs to contain. (In the past there have been proposals to expand the `pyproject.toml` spec to include other information that lockfiles often contain for other languages, such as hashes and supply-chain information. Some people are extremely against this, however.)<p>As far as I know, uv isn&#x27;t going to do things like analyzing your codebase to determine that you <i>no longer</i> need a certain dependency that&#x27;s currently in your environment and remove it (from the environment, lock file or `pyproject.toml`). You&#x27;ll still be on the hook for figuring out abstractly what your project needs, and this is important if you want to share your code with others.</div><br/><div id="42681091" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42681091" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">krick</span><span>|</span><a href="#42680387">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42680778">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42680821">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42681091">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42681091">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; uv isn&#x27;t going to do things like analyzing your codebase<p>Sure, that&#x27;s not what I meant (unless we call pyproject.toml a part of your codebase, which it kinda is, but that&#x27;s probably not what you meant).<p>In fact, as far as I can tell from your answer, Python does move in the direction I&#x27;d like it to move, but it&#x27;s unclear by how far it will miss and if how uv handles it is ergonomical.<p>As I&#x27;ve said, I think PHP&#x27;s composer does a very good job here, and to clarify, this is how it works. There are 2 files: composer.json (≈pyproject.toml) and composer.lock (≈ PEP751) (also json). The former is kinda editable by hand, the latter you ideally never really touch. However, for the most part composer is smart enough that it edits both files for you (with some exceptions, of course), so every time I run `composer require your&#x2F;awesomelib` it<p>1) checks the constraints in these files<p>2) finds latest appropriate version of your&#x2F;awesomelib (5.0.14) and all its dependencies<p>3) writes &quot;your&#x2F;awesomelib&quot;: &quot;^5.0&quot;<p>4) writes &quot;your&#x2F;awesomelib&quot;: &quot;5.0.14&quot; and all its dependencies to composer.lock (with hashsums, commit ids and such)<p>It is a good practice to keep both inside of version control, so when I say &quot;git diff tells me what I did last night&quot; it means that I&#x27;ll also see what I installed. If (as usual) most of it is some useless trash, I&#x27;ll manually remove &quot;your&#x2F;awesomelib&quot; from composer.json, run `composer install` and it will remove it and all its (now unneeded) dependencies. As the result, I never need to worry about bookkeeping, since composer does it for me, I just run `composer require &lt;stuff&gt;` and it does the rest (except for cases when &lt;stuff&gt; is a proprietary repo on company&#x27;s gitlab and such, then I&#x27;ll need slightly more manual work).<p>That is, what I hope to see in Python one day (10 years later than every other lang did it) is declarative package management, except I don&#x27;t want to have to modify pyproject.toml manually, I want my package manager do it for me, because it saves me 30 seconds of my life every time I install something.

Package managers are for keeping track of which pieces of code you need in your project&#x27;s environment. Build systems are for... building the code, so that it can actually be used in an environment.<p>Usually, you can directly make a pre-built wheel, and then an installer like Pip or uv can just unpack that into the environment. If it needs to be build on the user&#x27;s machine, then you offer an sdist, which <i>specifies</i> its build backend. The installer will act as a build frontend, by downloading and setting up the specified backend and asking it to make a wheel from the sdist, then installing the wheel.<p>Poetry&#x27;s build backend (`poetry.masonry`) doesn&#x27;t build your external dependencies unless a) you obtain an sdist and b) the sdist says to use that backend. And in these cases, it doesn&#x27;t matter what tools you&#x27;re using. Your installer (which could be Pip, which is <i>not</i> a package manager in any meaningful sense) can work with `poetry.masonry` just fine.<p>If you can give a <i>much more specific, simple, reproducible</i> example of a problem you encountered with external dependencies and uv, I&#x27;ll be happy to try to help.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42679094" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42679094" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cyrialize</span><span>|</span><a href="#42679580">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42677064">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42679094">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42679094">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For anyone that used rye, it&#x27;s worth noting that the creator of rye recommends using uv.

So far it&#x27;s worked out great, and I&#x27;ve created relationships with smart up and coming people in the field - they make meaningful money, I accelerate my learning. I ended up eventually hiring one, and another did consulting for me for some time. We had a routine where I&#x27;d ask them to read and summarize &#x2F; teach me ML papers that were of interest to me, which they in turn could use in their studies&#x2F;thesis&#x2F;youtube channels.<p>Tips on this: content creators tend to be more open to and better at explaining things, and you get to see their ability to explain before you pay them. If you can, overpay them - students need the money more than you do :-)</div><br/><div id="41386281" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41386281" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tomcam</span><span>|</span><a href="#41385534">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41385194">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41386281">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41386281">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I like it!

Follow people on the socials, read their code, show up at NeurIPS with actual good questions to ask people in person on the hallway track.<p>Without the _hard work up front to get good questions to ask_ you&#x27;re in danger of finding a good expert and them deciding you&#x27;re just another starry eyed kid that doesn&#x27;t know for just how many years longer you wouldn&#x27;t even pass the screening call for an interview.<p>Just my two cents, hope this helps!</div><br/><div id="41423738" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41423738" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ilaksh</span><span>|</span><a href="#41385194">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41385313">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41423738">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41423738">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is the exact same comment as in the previous thread from days ago.

The practical&#x2F;technical aspects of the platform is good. There is some basic quality checking (and guidance) of mentors - good without being onerous. And the 1-on-1 experiences I have had were good. But I found it difficult to get a reasonable amount of gig the few weeks I tried it more actively. Majority of the requests posted are very low effort, barely two coherent sentences about what they needed. For a subset of more serious requests, that fit my skill set, I wrote personalized messages describing how I could help. I also made clear I offered half price for students and early professionals. But the hitrate was extremely low, maybe 2%. Probably my rate was too high for those requests. But it is already set lower than what I charge for regular longer term engagements. Maybe it looks bad I only have 3 reviews, idk... Overall I have found that it is not good as an added income source (as someone in a high CoL, Norway) - but it is great as a low-friction offer for those that find me and really want a bit of my advice in particular.

From my anecdotal evidence, AI experts are the largest group there right now.<p>Irony aside, finding an expert for anything is difficult. Not because they don&#x27;t exist, but because there&#x27;s a lot of charlatans aiming to profit from the non-expert not really being able to tell. Do not underestimate their ability to BS even smart people, at least for a while.<p>My approach is usually to just ask around until I get a recommendation, a web of trust model if you will. I could for example recommend what I&#x27;d consider an AI expert to you. But you don&#x27;t trust me because you don&#x27;t know me, so by extension you have little reason to trust them. And that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d advise: Find someone you trust, directly or by proxy.<p>If that&#x27;s not a viable path, I would personally look around and try to figure out where relevant people hang out, write to one of them out of the blue. It appears people are more helpful to strangers than I previously assumed, though many do ghost. Many people have reached out to me this way, and I&#x27;ve sometimes ghosted them for embarrassing reasons like forgetting to answer, I&#x27;ve never once been annoyed by someone asking for my help.<p>I always offer payment, no matter how I found someome, based on the rate they name. I find that respectful, and some respectfully take it, others can&#x27;t be bothered to write an invoice, and prefer to just do it pro bono.

If you were a newbie, you&#x27;d mostly ask easy questions (say about the break statement) that intermediate level users could answer, so they would.  After a while, you&#x27;d become intermediate level yourself, and then you&#x27;d get to answer newbie questions, while more advanced users would answer your now intermediate-level questions, and so on.  Finally, the big time gurus were lurking about and they would mostly answer questions that really needed attention from experts.<p>I felt like I&#x27;d &quot;arrived&quot; when one day, Guido van Rossum himself answered one of my questions.  It wasn&#x27;t that great or advanced a question, but still.<p>So yeah, if you&#x27;re a beginner, maybe you can just post your questions or watch some videos, or take a class.<p>As for beginner AI stuff, I liked the fast.ai videos when I started watching them a few years ago, though I didn&#x27;t get through that many.  They have since been redone, so if I wanted to get into the subject, I&#x27;d start with them again at the beginning.

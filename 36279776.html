It&#x27;s more work but there&#x27;s a lot you can do to mitigate risk by doing appropriate due diligence.<p>I&#x27;d recommend at least hopping on a video call with the hosts and ask them basic things like how far away they live from the unit, who you should contact if there are issues, etc. It&#x27;s pretty easy to tell from a 10m phone call who has a hospitality mindset or not. It&#x27;s also possible to ask them for a video walkthrough of the apartment as it currently exists where you can inspect how close it is to the listed photos.<p>Especially for new hosts who desperately need credible reviews to increase their rankings, there&#x27;s a lot they are willing to do for a reasonable guest, including substantial discounts on the list price. They&#x27;re also desperate for feedback so tend to be fairly responsive to requests for missing things in the kitchen or upgrades to certain appliances as it&#x27;s a fairly small investment that will payback over a long period of time.<p>Overall, people have forgotten how to bargain and negotiate as the platforms ostensibly provide a neutral layer that obviates all that but it&#x27;s a very leaky abstraction and there&#x27;s still just humans on both sides of the transaction.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36290044" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36290044" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mysterypie</span><span>|</span><a href="#36290260">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36289867">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36290044">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36290044">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The problem with the Airbnb review system is that very few people are willing to leave a candid review because (1) it seems like bad manners when renting from an individual (as opposed to a large corporation like Hilton), (2) future Airbnb hosts can see your reviews and they might decide that you&#x27;re a troublemaker and not want to rent to you, (3) the host might leave a response to your review that makes you look petty, or demanding, or exaggerating, or just silly.<p>So what you get is a hundred 5-star reviews where &quot;everything was lovely&quot; and one 5-star review that sheepishly says that &quot;everything was lovely though it was a little noisy at night but I brought my earplugs so it was no problem after all&quot;.<p>But as an upside, I think it&#x27;s much harder to game or manipulate Airbnb reviews than Amazon reviews. It&#x27;s just that hardly anyone will list all the negatives; every property has some negatives <i>even if you loved your stay</i>. Many negatives won&#x27;t even matter to other renters: some might care about low ceilings, cluttered cabinets, low water pressure, or too few electrical outlets. Others couldn&#x27;t care less. But at least you could make selections based on things that would matter to you.<p>I don&#x27;t know what solution to propose. Maybe if Airbnb had unannounced professional reviewers stay a night at every property and do very comprehensive critiques?

I try to stay in places where the owner lives nearby, maybe they built another house on their land or split their apartment in 2 etc.<p>When I was traveling along the garden route in South Africa, the hosts would invite me over for a braai (BBQ) or have a beer together. When it&#x27;s a real host&#x2F;guest &quot;relationship&quot; people care more about their properties and the guest experience.

The host accused us of flushing baby wipes (we use reusable cotton ones), left us with a bath full of sewer water hoping we&#x27;d pay to fix it.<p>Then, when the lady in the apartment upstairs had her shower in the evening, the toilet overflowed, spilling out into the living area, into the toddler&#x27;s room, out the door, dripping down the stairs.<p>Not an ounce of help from AirBnB. Got a couple of callbacks from a call centre that sounded like it was in India, but there was no action of any kind. Got a negative review from the host (amongst many other things, she was upset that we weren&#x27;t grateful enough that someone came around to clean up the mess her negligence at the first report of backed up drainage had caused), and I closed my account.

To be ready to move with the punches and book farther ahead to get the best deals. Even a 2 week out reservation helps tons from filtering the last minute bad places that no one else wants.<p>Photography on Airbnb is everything. I’ve seen horrid pictures and the place was amazing and then it worked for me because of poor forecast I could book with the host cheaply, direct with no worry about guests booking.<p>I’ve also been fooled with amazing photos and “fantastic” reviews but the place was absolutely meh. The reviews on Airbnb are pretty worthless, people protect their rating at all cost and will not write bad things. I actually get better insight from new guests writing their first reviews vs “experienced” ones and fearfully I’ve just write reviews good and above - if I had a bad experience I won’t document it, the chilling effect is to strong and future hosts can see what reviews you leave.<p>I also use it as a host so that works a lot too - I’ve had many host say they had competing reservation requests and chose me because of more reviews and also being a “host.”<p>It is conflicting.

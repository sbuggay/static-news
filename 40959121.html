But password change and complexity rules are pointless precisely because they don’t increase the entropy of the passwords. From NIST:<p>&gt; As noted above, composition rules are commonly used in an attempt to increase the difficulty of guessing user-chosen passwords. Research has shown, however, that users respond in very predictable ways to the requirements imposed by composition rules [Policies]. For example, a user that might have chosen “password” as their password would be relatively likely to choose “Password1” if required to include an uppercase letter and a number, or “Password1!” if a symbol is also required.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pages.nist.gov&#x2F;800-63-3&#x2F;sp800-63b.html#appA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pages.nist.gov&#x2F;800-63-3&#x2F;sp800-63b.html#appA</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40962928" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40962928" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">marshray</span><span>|</span><a href="#40960740">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40962825">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40965733">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40962482">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40962928">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40962928">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s not crazy to want a system to be designed such that it tends to converge to a secure state over time.

I fail to see how short lived certs help since the old certs don&#x27;t magically disappear, they still exist and can be used in attacks even after being rotated.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40963806" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40963806" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Jerrrrrrry</span><span>|</span><a href="#40960740">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40963401">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40964425">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40962482">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40963806">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40963806">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">apple cider to apples<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leahneukirchen.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;ken-thompson-s-unix-password.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leahneukirchen.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;ken-thompson...</a><p>[previous hn discussion]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21202905">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21202905</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40962482" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40962482" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">raesene9</span><span>|</span><a href="#40960740">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40962597">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40966015">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40962482">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40962482">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">TBH where you see this kind of thing (mandatory periodic password rotation every month or two) being recommended, it&#x27;s people not keeping up with even regulators view of good security practice.<p>Both NIST in the US (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pages.nist.gov&#x2F;800-63-FAQ&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pages.nist.gov&#x2F;800-63-FAQ&#x2F;</a>) and NCSC in the UK (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncsc.gov.uk&#x2F;collection&#x2F;passwords&#x2F;updating-your-approach" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncsc.gov.uk&#x2F;collection&#x2F;passwords&#x2F;updating-your-a...</a>) have quite decent guidance that doesn&#x27;t have that kind of requirement.</div><br/><div id="40962604" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40962604" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crngefest</span><span>|</span><a href="#40960740">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40962482">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40966015">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40962604">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40962604">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well, my experience working in the industry is that almost no company uses good security practices or goes beyond some outdated checklists - a huge number wants to rotate passwords, disallow&#x2F;require special characters, lock out users after X attempts, or disallow users to choose a password they used previously (never understood that one).<p>I think the number of orgs that follow best practices from NIST etc is pretty low.</div><br/><div id="40962991" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40962991" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">8xeh</span><span>|</span><a href="#40960740">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40962604">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40964568">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40962991">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40962991">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s not necessarily the organization&#x27;s fault.

For example, since password generators basically make keys that can’t be remembered, this has led to the advent of password managers, all protected by a single password, so your single point of failure is now just ONE password, the consequences of which would be that an attacker would have access to all of your passwords.<p>The n-tries lockout rule is much more effective anyway, as it breaks the brute-force attack vector in most cases.

Or not log in at all and instead type the password from my phone screen.<p>I understand the conceptual risk of storing everything behind a single “door”. That’s not ideal. But in practice, circumstances force you to create passwords, expose passwords, reset passwords, so you cannot remember them all. You either write them down (where? how secure?) or resort to having only a few “that you usually use”.<p>Password managers solve the “where? how secure?” part.

Heck, when Microsoft added that confirmation, many considered it terrible design that made the software way more annoying to use.<p>&#x27;Default Permit&#x27;, &#x27;Enumerating Badness&#x27; and &#x27;Penetrate and Patch &#x27; are all unfortunately defaults because of this. Because people would rather make it easier&#x2F;more convenient to use their computer&#x2F;write software than do what would be best for security.<p>Personally I&#x27;d say that passwords in general are probably one of the dumbest ideas in security though. Like, the very definition of a good password likely means something that&#x27;s hard to remember, hard to enter on devices without a proper keyboard, and generally inconvenient for the user in almost every way. Is it any wonder that most people pick extremely weak passwords, reuse them for most sites and apps, etc?<p>But there&#x27;s no real alternative sadly. Sending links to email means that anyone with access to that compromises everything, though password resets usually mean the same thing anyway. Physical devices for authentication mean the user can&#x27;t log in from places outside of home that they might want to login from, or they have to carry another trinket around everywhere.

C# pointers == C pointers, C# generics with struct arguments == Rust generics with struct (i.e. not Box&lt;dyn Trait&gt;) arguments and are monomorphized in the same way.<p>All of the following works:<p><pre><code>    byte* stack = stackalloc byte[128];
    byte* malloc = (byte*)NativeMemory.Alloc(128);
    byte[] array = new byte[128];
    fixed (byte* gcheap = array)
    {
        &#x2F;&#x2F; work with pinned object memory
    }

Additionally, all of the above can be unified with (ReadOnly)Span&lt;byte&gt;:<p><pre><code>    var stack = (stackalloc byte[128]); &#x2F;&#x2F; Span&lt;byte&gt;
    var literal = &quot;Hello, World&quot;u8; &#x2F;&#x2F; ReadOnlySpan&lt;byte&gt;

    var gcheap = new byte[128].AsSpan(); &#x2F;&#x2F; Span&lt;byte&gt;
</code></pre>
Subsequently such span of bytes (or any other T) can be passed to pretty much anything e.g. int.Parse, Encoding.UTF8.GetString, socket.Send, RandomAccess.Write(fileHandle, buffer, offset), etc. It can also be sliced in a zero-cost way. Effectively, it is C#&#x27;s rendition of Rust&#x27;s &amp;[T], C++ has pretty much the same and names it std::span&lt;T&gt; as well.<p>Note that (ReadOnly)Span&lt;T&gt; internally is `ref T _reference` and `int _length`. `ref T` is a so-called &quot;byref&quot;, a special type of pointer GC is aware of, so that if it happens to point to object memory, it will be updated should that object be relocated by GC. At the same time, a byref can also point to any non-GC owned memory like stack or any unmanaged source (malloc, mmap, pinvoke regular or reverse - think function pointers or C exports with AOT). This allows to write code that uses byref arithmetics, same as with pointers, but without having to pin the object retaining the ability to implement algorithms that match hand-tuned C++ (e.g. with SIMD) while serving all sources of sequential data.<p>C# is a language with strong low-level capabilities :)</div><br/><div id="40965460" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40965460" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dartos</span><span>|</span><a href="#40960923">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40963672">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40961075">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40965460">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40965460">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was surprised to learn c# could do all that, honestly.<p>Though when you’re doing that much hacking, a lot of the security features and syntax of C# get in the way</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40961075" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40961075" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sulandor</span><span>|</span><a href="#40960923">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40960988">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40962609">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40961075">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40961075">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">though, frequent updates mainly serve to hide unfit engineering practices and encourage unfit products.<p>the world is not static, but most things have patterns that need to be identified and handled, which takes time that you don&#x27;t have if you sprint from quick-fix to quick-fix of your mvp.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40962609" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40962609" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Pannoniae</span><span>|</span><a href="#40960923">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40961075">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40962798">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40962609">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40962609">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">*Translation: If we didn&#x27;t just pile on dependencies upon dependencies, everything would be secure from the start.<p>Come on.

The appeal of cybersecurity lies in its “breadth” rather than its “depth.” In a specific area, a hacker might never be as proficient as a programmer, but hackers often possess a broad knowledge base across various fields.<p>A web security researcher might simultaneously discover vulnerabilities in “PHP, JSP, Servlet, ASP.NET, IIS, and Tomcat.” A binary researcher might have knowledge of “Windows, Android, and iOS.” A network protocol researcher might be well-versed in “TCP&#x2F;IP, HTTP, and FTP” protocols. More likely, a hacker often masters all these basic knowledge areas.<p>So, what I want to say is that the key is not the technology itself, nor the nitty-gritty of offense and defense in some vulnerabilities, but rather the ability to use the wide range of knowledge and the hacker’s reverse thinking to challenge seemingly sound systems. This is what our society needs and it is immensely enjoyable.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40965853" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40965853" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Jean-Papoulos</span><span>|</span><a href="#40964977">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40960776">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40965853">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40965853">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;As a younger generation of workers moves into the workforce, they will come pre-installed with a healthy skepticism about phishing and social engineering.<p>hahahahahaha</div><br/></div></div><div id="40960776" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40960776" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cwbrandsma</span><span>|</span><a href="#40965853">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40962139">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40960776">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40960776">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Penatrate and Patch: because if it doesn’t work the first time then throw everything away, fire the developers, hire new ones, and start over completely.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40962139" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40962139" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nottorp</span><span>|</span><a href="#40960776">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40964847">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40962139">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40962139">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; #4) Hacking is Cool<p>Hacking <i>is</i> cool.

It&#x27;s fascinating to read this now and recognize the wisdom coming from experience honed in the 90s and the explosion of the internet, but also the cultural gap from the web&#x2F;mobile generation, and how experience doesn&#x27;t always translate to new contexts.<p>For instance, the first bad idea, Default Permit, is clearly bad in the realm of networking.  I might quibble a bit and suggest Default Permit isn&#x27;t so much an idea as the natural state of when one invents computer networking.  But clearly Default Deny was a very very good idea and critical idea necessary for the internet&#x27;s growth.  It makes a lot of sense in the context of global networking, but it&#x27;s not quite as powerful in other security contexts.  For instance, SELinux has never really taken off, largely because it&#x27;s a colossal pain in the ass and the threat models don&#x27;t typically justify the overhead.<p>The other bad idea that stands out is &quot;Action is Better Than Inaction&quot;.  I think this one shows a very strong big company &#x2F; enterprise bias more than anything else—of course when you are big you have more to lose and should value prudence.  And yeah, good security in general is not based on shiny things, so I don&#x27;t totally fault the author.  That said though, there&#x27;s a reason that modern software companies tout principles like &quot;bias for action&quot; or &quot;move fast and break things&quot;—because software is malleable and as the entire world population shifted to carrying a smartphone on their person at all times, there was a huge land grab opportunity that was won by those who could move quickly enough to capitalize on it.  Granted, this created a lot of security risk and problems along the way, but in that type of environment, adopting a &quot;wait-and-see&quot; attitude can also be an existential threat to a company.  At the end of the day though, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any rule of thumb for whether action vs inaction is better, each decision must be made in context, and security is only one consideration of any given choice.</div><br/><div id="40962811" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40962811" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">worik</span><span>|</span><a href="#40962543">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40959135">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40962811">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40962811">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This true in a very small part of our business<p>Most of us are not involved in a &quot;land grab&quot;, in that metaphorical world most of us are past &quot;homesteading &quot; and are paving roads and I filling infrastructure<p>Even small companies should take care when building infrastructure<p>&quot;Go fast and break things&quot; is, was, an irresponsible bad idea.

Crazy, right?<p>Very different times for sure.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40962359" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40962359" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jrm4</span><span>|</span><a href="#40961212">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40962843">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40962359">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40962359">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Missed the most important.<p>&quot;You can have meaningful security without skin-in-the-game.&quot;<p>This is literally the beginning and end of the problem.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40962843" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40962843" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bawolff</span><span>|</span><a href="#40962359">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40964714">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40962843">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40962843">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; If  you&#x27;re a security practitioner, teaching yourself how to hack is also part of the &quot;Hacking is Cool&quot; dumb idea. Think about it for a couple of minutes: teaching yourself a bunch of exploits and how to use them means you&#x27;re investing your time in learning a bunch of tools and techniques that are going to go stale as soon as everyone has patched that particular hole.<p>I would strongly disagree with that.<p>You can&#x27;t defend against something you don&#x27;t understand.<p>You definitely shouldn&#x27;t spend time learning some script-kiddie tool, that is pointless. You should understand how exploits work from first principles. The principles mostly won&#x27;t change or at least not very fast, and you need to understand how they work to make systems resistant to them.<p>One of the worst ideas in computer security in my mind is cargo culting - where people just mindlessly repeat practises thinking it will improve security. Sometimes they don&#x27;t work because they have been taken out of their original context. Other times they never made sense in the first place. Understanding how exploits work stops this.</div><br/><div id="40963010" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40963010" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">strangecharm2</span><span>|</span><a href="#40962843">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40964714">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40963010">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40963010">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">True security can only come from understanding how your system works.

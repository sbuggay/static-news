She doesn&#x27;t share her actual thoughts and gets angry when asked about it. You might be reading this and thinking that there&#x27;s more to it, but sadly there isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s her life so I leave her alone, not my place to tell her what to do, and the emotional upheaval from her isn&#x27;t worth it either.<p>But it&#x27;s crazy that a person can get this lost in life and become completely devoid of purpose and meaning. It&#x27;s one thing to have an issue and work through it slowly, but it&#x27;s something else to isolate yourself and live your life through others - while those &quot;others&quot; prosper from your own ignorance.<p>I&#x27;m sure her past experiences are playing a role in this behavior, but the whole cosmetics things - I know for a fact there are a lot of influencers who peddle this crap, and if you lack self-awareness then I can see how easy it is to get stuck in this cycle.

In the 90s version of this hysteria, Congress passed a law that would have prevented access to education medical information, dirty curse words, and other filth from being published on the internet to protect the children. The federal government fought a case all the way to the Supreme Court to enforce it. If they had won that case, the internet would look very different today. But the Supreme Court got it right when they said it would squelch free speech.<p>You may not like FB, IG, TikTok, etc.. I certainly don&#x27;t care for any of these products. But these are communications platforms. Restricting the right to free speech does have negative consequences... from the development of critical thinking skills; development of technical skills; and limiting of educational information. Being exposed to shit on the internet teaches you there&#x27;s bullshit on the internet, and not to believe everything you see.<p>And just like the Supreme Court wrote 30 years ago, the answer is the same today: if you don&#x27;t like these products and feel they are negative, then don&#x27;t use them. Restrict your children&#x27;s access to these platforms.<p>I certainly dont believe anyone should be forced to use these platforms. I don&#x27;t use any of these products, and havent since they launched. That&#x27;s a freedom you and everyone else can take advantage of also. But those who advocate censorship aren&#x27;t advocating for freedom... they&#x27;re advocating for their personal parental decisions to the be decisions of the entire nation.</div><br/><div id="39987910" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39987910" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">raziel2p</span><span>|</span><a href="#39987266">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39987696">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39987910">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39987910">[33 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; if you don&#x27;t like these products and feel they are negative, then don&#x27;t use them<p>It&#x27;s really not that simple.

In fact, outside of a few things that causes physical dependence (which vary in length except they all, eventually at least, end), the concept of addiction as used by the government does not necessarily match up to how those in the particular field of research would. Government makes laws and laws prefer bright line rules. Something like &quot;did you, without authorization, use the credit card given to you by your company to make purchases unrelated to your work&quot;, for example, have concrete, definable, and answerable elements that are universal and more or less binary, provided that the statute has a definition section that makes sense. But &quot;so addictive&quot; or &quot;designed to be so engaging and as a result people are by and large struggling to exercise personal accountability and it is causing adverse health outcomes&quot; is pretty much the antithesis of that. The government would need to define &quot;addictive&quot;, &quot;designed&quot; would need to have an intent element (one designs the software, sure, but you&#x27;re asking for not what the software itself does but one step further - what its impact is on the population at large). How does the government prove that intent, especially since criminal law tends to define intent as intent to act which combined with the act itself, creates the crime. What counts as &quot;so engaging&quot; or even &quot;engaging&quot;? Does it require active engagement? Plenty of platforms do not require any active engagement to partake in the conventional sense, unless reading is engagement. How many people counts as &quot;by large&quot; (I assume that&#x27;s what you mean, feel free to  correct)? How would the government show that the product and any struggle is causatively linked and not merely correlative? How does one define struggle to exercise personal accountability? Where did the duty of exercising personal accountability even come from as to establish liability and would that criminalize those who are disabled or injured as to being unable to exercise such responsibility writ large? And what counts for adverse health outcomes? All these need to be worked out in legislation and likely argued over in court. Every single element needs to be worked on as to not to be overly inclusive or exclusive. And since it&#x27;s the government, the consequences for violation is without question enormous, and therefore, anything that can be misconstrued can result in the ruin of a  company or persons in a variety of ways, but do you really want to have the government determine who is an edge case that doesn&#x27;t count? Because the government have done that based on assumptions of potential harm and it has caused what today would be considered horrific abuses of human rights and very little positives beyond enriching those whose income derives from the enforcement of the government&#x27;s scheme.<p>Laws are lagging indicators but they also last a long time. the CFAA was passed before the advent of the WWW and it took until 2021 to even set a basic check on the part of the Supreme Court that effective set the ground rule that to access what amounts to a computer linked to some network beyond authorization, an authorization scheme needs to exist in the first place. Before that, one can easily be charged and even sent to prison or be assessed massive fines when there&#x27;s no meaningful distinction between what is authorized and unauthorized space. These were not problems in the early to mid 80s but when problems did arise, it still took a quarter century to resolve. To have one  future-proof goldilocks solution is already next to impossible, but you&#x27;re asking for five or six stringed together in order to have a sensible law that is well tailored enough so that it is effective without being oppressive. Not to mention that unless the behavior is generally abandoned by users, it creates black markets that are simply illegible to the state. The government then effectively loses control over what it purports to control to those with means, leaving only those without subject to the full force of the legislation.<p>That of course all predicates on the premise that there can be commonly agreed and sensible ways to define all those, and it is in the best interest of the government to do so and passes Constitutional muster not just on speech grounds but a host of other potential issues, like, is this a purely civil matter or a purely criminal matter or both? The federal government can treat this explicitly, or kick it off to an agency as part of its mandate, but which one? Do we need a new one? Are there checks and balances that would provide some sort of agility that keeps up with the times? What if new research comes out that shows the lack of a link, but by legislating it, you&#x27;ve effectively frozen the relevant conclusion in time. Enforcement creates constituencies who do not care about science or potential upsides. The DEA is on the record in the federal register that patient access to legitimate medication is secondary and effectively an afterthought to enforcement of supply, because the agency&#x27;s mandate presupposes that substances need controls and are presumed harmful and that enforcement, with the teeth provided for by the DOJ, will trump any study the FDA or our academic institutions can ever show. By the time that particular moral panic was given a name, the US government had been attempting repeatedly to use prohibition as a way of imposing a specific set of social mores that at first was a pretext to target specific racial minorities and when that became socially unacceptable (legally it was unacceptable under the 14th Amendment anyway, but they effectively smuggled the laws in through the Treasury Department and protectionist regimes by taxing the goods into oblivion, and avoiding the tax obviously is also a violation of the law).<p>In that sense, the government operates very much like a machine, whereas given a concrete goal to achieve and it can likely achieve it, but the manner by which it achieves it may create additional problems and convoluted interpretations that ripples through history in ways unimaginable. The loudest voices in the room, or those with existing financial resources or interests, can use the rent-seeking system known as lobbying to shape the laws to begin with. And where does the fines end up? Certainly in most cases they are not given back to the community, but end up enriching the enforcement agencies. Go to a police auction and see how much they&#x27;re raising from the sale of &quot;proceeds of crime&quot;, except not all of it are crimes that are proven in court, and much of it are crimes without specific victims and so, it becomes a regime of appropriation of private property to enrich a few in the public sector.<p>There&#x27;s usually an annoying gap between concept and reality. In isolation you want a policy that can solve problems in a targeted and fair way. In reality it almost never happens.</div><br/><div id="39988089" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39988089" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hgomersall</span><span>|</span><a href="#39987266">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39987808">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39988110">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39988089">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39988089">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Addiction is well defined in research and it certainly does not preclude things that don&#x27;t cause &quot;physical dependence&quot; by which I assume you use to mean psychoactive drugs.<p>Wikipedia has a better definition right at the top than I can offer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Addiction" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Addiction</a><p>The crucial point is it is characterised by neurological changes that lead to short circuited reward pathways.

No social media before 16 (as a norm, but one that would be much more effective if supported by laws such as the proposed update to COPPA, the Kids Online Safety Act, state-level age-appropriate design codes, and new social media bills like the bipartisan Protecting Kids on Social Media Act, or like the state level bills passed in Utah last year and in Florida last month).<p>3.

Maybe you could draw a correlation with smartphones or smartphone+social media? But the unspecificity of the claim is a red flag.

Even if we may not like it all the time, there is tons of data that show that personal interactions and relationships are good for mental health.

I recently went to a fast food restaurant and there were <i>no</i> customers inside at lunchtime, normally a busy time, and I ordered on a kiosk and everyone else just ordered at the drivethrough) it&#x27;s harder and harder to just see random people and our friends without explicit planning.<p>2.

As a chronically unemployed software dev who&#x27;s burnt out and crashed at least 3 times, I&#x27;ve spent a hell of a lot of time reflecting, and try my best to communicate these ideas to people who have the opposite problem; lots of work, but no new friends since highschool, and desperately single.<p>People tend to rely far too heavily on the easiest way to convince themselves they&#x27;re having valuable social interactions, whether it&#x27;s social media or betting that their work friends will still be there when they get laid off. They&#x27;ll rely on Tinder for sex and try to bridge that to something more meaningful out of thin air,  or they&#x27;ll buy a dog and hope that solves the problem. Some of these are uniquely millenial and onward, some others carry over from Gen X and boomer culture imo, whereby you isolate yourself from the rest of society in the suburbs or wherever and count on personal relationships you acquired for free.<p>Along with this, in many places we&#x27;ve let the catalysts for social growth get stripped away by commodity bullshit and simulated interaction. Costco is probably the closest thing many people have to bumping into someone, no shot are they going to do it at the adult version of the playground, because there often isn&#x27;t one and they won&#x27;t go. (obviously this is more true in some places and for some people than it is for people who&#x27;ve realized this or who innately direct their life this way).<p>My theory is that to meet a new person and have it be substantial, you basically need to spend a few hours, a few times per week, in the same space doing some arbitrarily interesting thing for a common  reason, without being too eager but with a signaled sense of openness.

So let&#x27;s take for example suicide, in some jurisdictions driving another individual toward suicide is a criminal matter. If evidence can be put forward in a court that they used a lot of social media and that the algorithm contributed to that suicide, well maybe the publisher should be getting prosecuted.<p>Do I expect that some social media companies are really going to struggle to continue to operate at their current scale because of these changes? Yes I 100% expect it and I think it&#x27;s great. It may lead to a smaller and more personal web. Your business model has no inherent right to exist if it harms people. Maybe, for example, you will need to hire more humans to handle moderation so that you stop killing people, and if humans don&#x27;t scale, well, too bad, you&#x27;re going to get smaller. We regulate gambling, tobacco etc. to limit the harm they do, I don&#x27;t see any difference with social media.<p>To have the biggest impact without stifling innovation we can start by applying this rule to platforms which are above a certain revenue level. There is likely a combination of legislative and judicial action here in that there may already be crimes on the books which these platforms are committing, but the judiciary has not traditionally thought of a corporation being the person who committed that crime, certainly not at scale against thousands of victims. In other cases we may need to amend laws to make it clear that just because you used an algorithm to harm people at scale, doesn&#x27;t make you immune to consequences from the harm you caused.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39987208" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39987208" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">willvarfar</span><span>|</span><a href="#39986973">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39987130">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39987204">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39987561">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39987208">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39987208">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree that we can&#x27;t effectively manipulate the environment to eliminate the hazard, but I also worry that we can&#x27;t effectively strengthen people to make them immune to the hazard either.<p>A common thread through all human history is people being misled on-mass.

Everyone is. I go to birthday parties with my kid, and sporting events, indoors and outdoors, and other kid activities, and the kids are for the most part jumping around having a ball, while the adults are huddled up by themselves, bathed in smartphone light, scrolling through their feeds getting their fix.

It&#x27;s seriously addictive, I feel it myself, and just letting people &quot;be free and choose what to do&quot; results in addicts in real life. If people and society is hurting because of this, it would be good to fix it.<p>I think that an easy start is to require every platform that has addictive endless scrolling, or endless suggestions for what to watch next, to have a soft limit. After some regular time, information is shown that &quot;you are on an addictive platform and taking breaks from it is good for your mental health&quot;. &quot;Algorithms are made to keep your attention, often by making you angry and upset. Remember that this is easily fixed by stepping off this platform&quot;. It is basically a version of &quot;smoking kills&quot;, or &quot;don&#x27;t drink and drive&quot;, but for the digital age. I think it is an easy thing to legislate (as easy as those things get), still allows people to be &quot;free&quot;, and that could actually have a positive effect on the world.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39986820" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39986820" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">WalterBright</span><span>|</span><a href="#39987607">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39986869">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39986820">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39986820">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I find sadly amusing the argument that kids need their phones in school in case of emergency.<p>If the kid has an emergency, the teacher can call the parents.

It was the apex of the mall experience. We saw the mall as a place to get away from our parents, hang out with our buds, run into other classmates and feel some sense of freedom while running amok playing video games in the arcade and chowing down tacos in the food court.<p>Then smartphones and the internet came and all the malls started closing up, dying off and there was an entire generation that just ignored or forgot about them. Most of the malls around where I live have all but closed.<p>There are still a few open and now? They&#x27;re thriving. My family now goes together on the weekends and its amazing. All the teenagers are in the food court, in their groups, talking, eating and socializing. You see groups of teens wondering in and out of the stores. I see a very similar cultural revolution happening and its really refreshing. The mall is truly a phoenix rising from its once former ashes. The major anchor stores are constantly busy no matter what night you go there. The movie theater is busy almost every night and its packed on the weekends. Its like an entire generation has re-discovered the mall again and its refreshing to see.<p>Sometimes I feel like I&#x27;m in a dream because so many other malls just north or south of us have either died and been leveled, or are in various forms of trying to reinvent themselves as something else before its too late.<p>Either way, what I saw in my experiences at our local mall gave me hope that the Zoomers are in some ways, taking a break from their phones and going out and having a different experience and returning to socializing with their friends and creating a new way of connecting with people they&#x27;re close to. My son said he still uses his phone when he&#x27;s at the mall, but just to make plans to meet his other buddies and coordinate where they&#x27;re all going to meet up. For the most part, once they meet up, they all stop using their phones.<p>So yes, there is hope yet.</div><br/><div id="39987799" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39987799" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zigman1</span><span>|</span><a href="#39986869">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39987772">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39987799">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39987799">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Its like an entire generation has re-discovered the mall again and its refreshing to see...

Have we all forgotten how weak and FP prone social studies are?<p>To Haidt&#x27;s credit he did at least try a rebuttal, which is better than most situations in modern academia where outside criticisms are just ignored entirely. But he lost that debate because his responses were bad, and in this article he doubles down on the bad arguments he made last time.<p>He attempts to suggest that the large number of studies he collected with Twenge means there must be something there. This argument fails because when Brown randomly spot checked some of his cited studies they were all of garbage quality. Often they had nothing to do with social media at all. Haidt&#x27;s response was the same as in this article: they can&#x27;t all be wrong! But yes, yes they can all be wrong and Brown has strongly shown that this is likely to be the case.<p>Then Haidt suggests that you can derive signal from a large pile of bad studies, because if the null hypothesis were true then you&#x27;d see random results. But you can&#x27;t assume that due to publishing biases, spurious correlations and other problems. For example he says that if social media didn&#x27;t affect mental health, then there&#x27;d be no gender signal. That doesn&#x27;t make sense. It&#x27;s possible for girls to have worse mental health, and spend more time on social media, and for social media to not be the cause.<p>After making spurious correlation&#x2F;causation arguments and denying he&#x27;s doing so, he moves on to an even worse problem making his entire theory is unfalsifiable:<p><i>&gt; much of my book is about the collective action traps that entire communities of adolescents fall into when they move their social lives onto these platforms, such that it becomes costly to abstain. It is at that point that collective mental health declines most sharply, and the individuals who try to quit find that they are socially isolated. The skeptics do not consider the ways that these network or group-level effects may obscure individual-level effects, and may be much larger than the individual-level effects.</i><p>In other words you can&#x27;t even attempt to establish causality by cutting out social media use and seeing if it affects depression, because he will just immediately change his claim to assert that it was the ambient social-media-ness of society causing the depression (a much harder hypothesis to prove), and thus individual interventions can&#x27;t help. And because this hypothesis is so vague, he can always fall back to claiming that whatever group intervention size is tried it wasn&#x27;t big enough.<p>His whole essay is full of problems like this. It&#x27;s basically a Gish Gallop. Vast reams of unusable paper is presented, along with panicked assertions that it&#x27;s unreasonable to request valid evidence or a testable hypothesis before making law, due to the nature of the (self declared) emergency: a classic circular argument of the sort that emerges way too often in public health spheres.<p>There&#x27;s actually a better supported alternative line of work that shows a completely different and much stronger correlation related to political ideology. But of course Haidt would rather not discuss that, as it&#x27;s not amenable to legislation.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39987288" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39987288" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Buttons840</span><span>|</span><a href="#39988246">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39987703">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39987288">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39987288">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The charts in this article are deceptive and cause me to not trust the author.<p>Look at long term teen suicide rates and you will see that suicide rates were quite high around 1990, and then rates dropped until about 2005, and are now on the rise again but have not yet reached 1990 levels (I think).<p>So, the author of this piece wants to make it look like suicides and self harm are on the rise <i>because of social media</i>, so where does he choose to start the charts? 2005.</div><br/><div id="39987295" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39987295" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">logicchains</span><span>|</span><a href="#39987288">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39987703">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39987295">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39987295">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They also don&#x27;t compare with other countries.

Having the device in your pocket at all times drastically changes how it&#x27;s used.</div><br/><div id="39986982" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39986982" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">spxneo</span><span>|</span><a href="#39984742">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39984855">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39984986">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39986982">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39986982">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">100% and the people who created Facebook, Instagram all know exactly what they were doing.

Watching TV, or playing console games…<p>The big difference was: At least the youth was at home <i>together with others</i> doing so. You went over to your neighbor to watch some TV show for example.<p>What changed quite lately are indeed the always online smartphones. You don&#x27;t need to go to your neighbor, even if you want to &quot;do something together&quot; (of course online, like everything nowadays).<p>Also people don&#x27;t even call each other. The default is chat, or very often voice messages. But no real talking.<p>So no, media and electronics aren&#x27;t the main driver here. It&#x27;s the always online devices everybody uses everywhere the whole time. Human minds likely aren&#x27;t constructed to be always connected (or one could argue, actually disconnected) in such a way.<p>It&#x27;s not primary the quantity, it&#x27;s the quality of media consumption that significantly changed. Also the media is the first time completely interactive <i>and personalized</i>. Compare to for example TV (which was back than &quot;the devil who destroys the morale of our youth&quot; according to some elder people). You didn&#x27;t get targeted personalized ads the whole day on your TV…<p>The psychological manipulation that the pre-smartphone media could possibly exercise on individuals was much more constrained compared to what&#x27;s possible (and actually gets executed) today. Smartphone apps are a great example as they&#x27;re now mostly <i>constructed</i> to induced addiction (the companies selling ads call it &quot;engagement&quot;).</div><br/><div id="39987370" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39987370" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bart_spoon</span><span>|</span><a href="#39984742">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39986734">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39984891">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39987370">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39987370">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree with you, but it goes beyond just smartphones.<p>TV shows were linear, so unless you had an interest in every single show being aired, your viewing was naturally limited to specific times.<p>Video games didn’t use to have online capabilities, nor did they provide endless matchmaking with completely strangers across the world, so if you wanted to play with other people, you had to do it in person. And games didn’t have endless streams of new content being released.<p>What changed is that everything became built around endless streams of content. Smartphones are a key enabler of that, but even legacy media like TV and video games have evolved to become bottomless content pits.

Most of these regulatory components are quite new and barely implemented, but I look forward to seeing them being used more over the next few years.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39987883" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39987883" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">astro-</span><span>|</span><a href="#39987748">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39987588">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39987883">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39987883">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; girls who spend five hours or more on social media per day are three times as likely to be depressed as girls who use social media only a little or not at all<p>I mean, I can&#x27;t possibly imagine the state I would be in if I spent 5 hours on Instagram every day for extended periods.

I&#x27;ve thought about this quite a bit, but never wrote my thoughts anywhere so I guess here and now is as a good time as any.<p>I think Haidt&#x27;s assertion that social media is to blame for the rise in teen mental illness is likely indirectly true, but from what I&#x27;ve observed personally even kids that don&#x27;t frequently use social networking apps still seem to have much higher rates of mental illness than I recall when I was younger.<p>My bet is that social media use itself isn&#x27;t that harmful (I understand this is a radical position), and that it&#x27;s actually far more related to the pathologisation of normal emotional states as mental illness which social media has exacerbated.<p>In recent years I&#x27;ve occasionally spoken about my own negative thoughts and struggles with depression, and almost without fail someone will try to encourage me to seek help, and more worryingly they will often recommend medicating. This has even been true when I&#x27;ve visited doctors in recent years where a couple of times now I&#x27;ve been asked if I&#x27;d like help for depression and anxiety after making passing comments.<p>Furthermore, in recent years whenever I have tried to suggest that someone probably isn&#x27;t mentally ill, but just a little more anxious &#x2F; depressive than the average person I&#x27;ve been attacked and told I&#x27;m causing harm by questioning their need to be on medication.<p>I&#x27;m writing this because just today an 8 year old boy in my family was put on ADHD medication. The school told his mum that he was struggling to remain quiet in class and has been distracting children at his table, so recommended he see a doctor. The mum took him to the doctor and within a single meeting the boy was put on ADHD medication. Notably, this mum has 3 children and all 3 are now on medication (the other 2 are being treated with anxiety and depression, both at a similar age).<p>The truth is I&#x27;m not convinced any of these children even have mental illnesses. I&#x27;m not a doctor, but they seem extremely similar to me and many of my friends growing up. But when I was growing up I didn&#x27;t know anyone on medication for anxiety or depression – certainly not any children.<p>The only evidence good evidence to suggest that there&#x27;s some difference between my generation and teens today seems to be the suicide rate. But I think we need to be careful here also. Something that has concerned me is how powerful some of these drugs we&#x27;re prescribing children are. I don&#x27;t know how common this is on SSRIs, but one boy in my family seems to have lost his ability to feel normal emotions after being prescribed what I understand to be a high dose of SSRIs. Shortly after starting medication he started to become increasingly physically violent and started to self-harm. Absurdly in light of this when taken back to the doctor they decided increase his SSRI dose because the kid said that he was still feeling unhappy. When I spoke to him to try to understand why he was being violent his answer was basically that he just didn&#x27;t care, which struck me as strange to hear from someone who was if anything an overly emotional and overly affectionate boy.<p>I&#x27;m bringing this up because teen suicide trends also seem to track very well with the increased prescription of SSRIs like Sertraline to children, and my understanding is that there is good evidence that these drugs can increase risk of suicide. So with more children taking these drugs we should assume that one of the outcomes of this will be increased teen suicide.<p>Finally, I&#x27;d also be interested in better understanding the role loneliness has on children and whether this is more likely to be part of the explanation. Children today are less likely to play outside with friends, and declining birth rates mean children also less likely to have siblings and cousins of a similar age and gender to play with. Even if they&#x27;re not on social media children today are far more likely to stay at home watching YouTube or playing XBox on their own, which probably doesn&#x27;t help with their mental health and their ability to deal with the real world and the social conflicts it brings their way.<p>It would be silly of me to suggest social media plays no role of course, but my guess is that the role it plays is more indirect and more related to the over-diagnosis and hyperawareness of mental illness. And also in its contribution to children spending too much time inside on their own.<p>That&#x27;s just my thoughts on this anyway. I&#x27;m obviously not a NYU professor who&#x27;s studied this in great detail so I&#x27;m probably talking nonsense. All I can say is that in my anecdotal experience doesn&#x27;t really align with this idea that social media is causing these problems.  worry those like Haidt who are quick blame social media are primarily getting attention not because they&#x27;re pointing to the correct cause, but because blaming social media for all societal problems is in fashion right now, while people like me suggest that we may be over-diagnosing mental illness in children attracts a lot of negativity in a world that increasingly wants to destigmatise mental illness.</div><br/><div id="39986850" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39986850" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Pannoniae</span><span>|</span><a href="#39985356">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39986899">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39986850">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39986850">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sorry for the short answer but the rest of us who weren&#x27;t glued to our phones were impacted too.

I could see the fixation on mental health exacerbating the issue.<p>On the Internet it&#x27;s easy to feel surrounded with people even though you&#x27;re not really socializing. Low-res text-based interactions that characterize most social media today don&#x27;t provide enough signal for people to develop their social skills adequately, and the asynchronicity doesn&#x27;t help either. Most people won&#x27;t just tell you how they feel about what you&#x27;re saying, but in real life that&#x27;s what body language and other indirect signals are for.

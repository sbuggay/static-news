As I write this I am debugging open source electronics I designed for our open source farming robot.<p>It seems like people see the growth in opaque proprietary electronics and they conclude that we should move back to old mechanical systems. But mechanical systems are not always more reliable.<p>What I really want more people to understand is that electronics are not the issue - proprietary designs are. Open source designs inherently have enough documentation that even if they don&#x27;t come with some nice service manual, the nerds on the user forum can dig through the schematics and code to sort out what&#x27;s what.<p>Unfortunately open source hardware just isn&#x27;t getting enough coverage for people to really see the value in it, despite the entire internet being built on open source software. We need to find ways to communicate the power of open source beyond software. We could have open source modules in cars with open standards. Sure the manufacturers need a rugged PCB that can control lights, read sensors, interact with CAN BUS, etc. But there is no need for that system to be proprietary. We need to build and demonstrate the value of open source hardware to help people understand what is really possible. Because the call to move back to mechanical systems is really just a call to move back to systems that are intuitively understandable, and today&#x27;s shadetree mechanics can read a forum post as well as anyone else. What we need are open, documented systems. Electronics are not the enemy, proprietary systems are.</div><br/><div id="38496680" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38496680" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hommelix</span><span>|</span><a href="#38496014">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38496920">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38496076">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38496680">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38496680">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You are right on openness.

But what I meant (and failed to explain, apparently) that for instance a gearbox can be paired to a particular ECU and that the manufacturer does that to stop the gearbox from being sold separately from the engine, which makes it harder for a chopshop to do its thing because and engine without a serial number is kind of suspect but a gearbox (which, especially for a larger car can be quite expensive) would often be overlooked during an inspection. By tying the two together it now becomes mandatory to not only swap out the gearbox but <i>also</i> the engine (or the ECU, but that&#x27;s not all that easy either).<p>I&#x27;ve had a VW van stolen right from in front of my house and to this day it&#x27;s a mystery to me how they did it, there was no glass so they must have had a key or a way to open the vehicle and those are fairly solid. You can&#x27;t start the car unless you have a key with the right transponder in it and that transponder is known to the ECU. So you&#x27;d have to bring a key that works on the door, open the door, teach that key to the ECU (or swap out the whole thing) and then drive off with the car.

You have a whole slew of stuff connected to that bus and if it shorts out then it can take other parties connected to the same bus with it depending on what is shorted out and how.<p>What you think of as a taillight is actually a couple of micro computers, a DC-DC converter and a whole bunch of LEDs, connectors and so on on it&#x27;s own circuit board with potentially a bunch of other IO for the safety features mentioned in TFA which could basically be anything. So all of that lives on the secondary can bus (which can have 10&#x27;s of clients). Short out that bus in a creative way and you may well end up creating a nasty cascade of issues that run from one end of the car to the other. <i>Normally</i> this shouldn&#x27;t happen. But the potential is there. In my car - fortunately - I just have regular lightbulbs. They&#x27;re a pain to change out because of how the front and the back of the car are constructed but the worst they can do is blow a fuse. I keep a very small socket and driver in the car just in case I have to do that on the road because without the right tools it is impossible.

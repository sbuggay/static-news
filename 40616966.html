I made the change in one place (and have some passing unit tests), but then I realized that I’d have to duplicate more code than I’d like. So I’ll take a couple days to pull all related functionality out into a shared library.<p>This refactoring could’ve been done ages ago — there’s already some messy and duplicate code there — but now’s the perfect time to do it because 1) I’m already touching and destabilizing that area of the product, and 2) the clearer, de-duplicated code will be easier to spot check.</div><br/><div id="40622448" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40622448" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">0xDEAFBEAD</span><span>|</span><a href="#40619610">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40621928">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40622038">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40622448">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40622448">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Makes sense.  I guess for any given refactoring, the advantage of doing it sooner is that you get residual recurring benefits sooner.  And the advantage of doing it later is you have more information about the requirements of your application and the &quot;correct&quot; way to do the refactor (or even if that code is going to be a long-lasting part of the app, cc Lindy effect).  So whenever you touch any given piece of code which could use a refactor, you could try to figure out which advantage is more important right now.<p>Of course, if the total effort of doing the refactor plus building the feature on top of the refactor is less than building the feature on top of the debt, you should always do the refactor first.  That&#x27;s pretty much a no-brainer.<p>Another idea I&#x27;ve thought about is informally keeping track of possible refactors, maybe give them an informal prioritization, and taking a glance at your list before each task.  Maybe there&#x27;s some value in letting a refactor stew in your brain a little bit before actually putting it in to action.  And continually maintaining a rough refactoring plan could help prevent your codebase from entering a state where it&#x27;s actually unrecoverable.</div><br/><div id="40622934" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40622934" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">0xDEAFBEAD</span><span>|</span><a href="#40619610">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40622448">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40622038">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40622934">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40622934">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Also, as you alluded to, if you&#x27;re changing related code which will require manual testing, then that decreases testing costs, if they&#x27;re shared across the refactor and the new code.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40622038" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40622038" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hnthr_w_y</span><span>|</span><a href="#40619610">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40621110">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40621928">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40620041">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40622038">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40622038">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m looking for a job where this is feasible.

So far, I’ve identified the following factors:<p>- We have more customers, and those customers are much more demanding (used to be b2c, now we’re b2b). The cost of making a mistake is much higher.<p>- It’s just a lot of code. Parts of it are fairly complex, as much as I try to keep it simple. When a core component is changed, multiple services might need refactoring.<p>- We have many more features, and they sometimes interact in surprising ways. I’ve been around longer than our product people, so we often have to spend time iterating when they come up with a design that doesn’t fit with what’s already there.<p>- It’s important to refactor your database from time to time as you learn more about the domain and find simpler ways to do things. But refactoring a database is terrifying. I spend a lot of time triple-checking my work.<p>Working on such a large code base for years is super satisfying though.

When developing a new product, we don&#x27;t know all the requirements. Part of the process of iterative development is <i>discovering</i> the requirements. Every waterfall project is secretly an iterative project because there&#x27;s always a Phase 2 where the requirements get updated (even &lt;especially&gt; when every stakeholder pinky-swore that the requirements were final before Phase 1 started).<p>- The optimum amount of tech debt is not zero. Tech debt is a product of changing the product plan&#x2F;vision&#x2F;design in reaction to learning from customers. If you&#x27;re not accruing tech debt then you&#x27;re not learning from your users.<p>- Changing the design to accommodate the new feature is great in theory, but in a lot of cases the new feature is an experiment itself. We&#x27;re optimising for customer learning: get the new feature in quickly with the minimum of effort, see if the users actually use it, and if not then roll back. If the users do like it, then refactor to tidy up any tech debt. Doing all the refactoring first is a complete waste of time if the feature ends up getting rolled back.<p>- Tech debt slows down development but only as a result of delivering early features quicker. It&#x27;s the sharpening the axe analogy - sooner or later you have to stop chopping the tree to sharpen the axe. Changing the way you chop the tree so you don&#x27;t have to sharpen the axe is not optimising for getting the most timber quickest. The trick here is communicating with stakeholders about what tech debt is and how it accumulates. They&#x27;re usually OK with feature pauses if they understand the situation correctly. In other words, like a lot of problems in this industry, this is a communication problem not actually a tech problem.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40621250" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40621250" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">m463</span><span>|</span><a href="#40622149">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40621020">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40621250">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40621250">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">realtime systems just prealloc everything at the beginnging.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40621020" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40621020" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">digger495</span><span>|</span><a href="#40621250">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40617066">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40621020">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40621020">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is one of the dumbest and most obvious journal articles I&#x27;ve ever read.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40617066" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40617066" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Rochus</span><span>|</span><a href="#40621020">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40621092">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40617066">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40617066">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It even rhymes ;-)</div><br/><div id="40619391" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40619391" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">oriel</span><span>|</span><a href="#40617066">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40621092">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40619391">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40619391">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Schoolhouse Rock for Coders?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40621092" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40621092" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bitwize</span><span>|</span><a href="#40617066">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40617216">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40621092">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40621092">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">RAII your technical debt: make a note of every time you slap something together the expedient way, and schedule a future time to refactor after the legitimacy of expediency goes &quot;out of scope&quot;, e.g., after a major product demo.<p>One could even add a CI&#x2F;CD task to remind the user of when refactorings are due (and refuse to successfully build until they are addressed).

Here is the abstract [1]:<p>The iterative process that a team follows is a bit like a garbage collection algorithm, and we can compare software development processes like we can any algorithm. A process can help developers do two things: clean up tech debt after it exists, or avoid creating it. When an iterative process does neither, tech debt buildup will lead to bankruptcy, so it is only suitable for projects with a short lifespan. A process that does both has the best chance at minimizing tech debt over a long lifespan.

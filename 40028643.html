It comes at an interesting time for me.<p>I&#x27;m in a full blown mid-life crisis where my state of mind fluctuates between full contentment and wishing I was doing more with life. This article made me think.<p>On the one hand, I&#x27;m content because I come from an unprivileged background. My family was abusive. Me and my brothers struggled with mental health. We ran away from home as soon as we could. Where I was born there were not any decent jobs, so the future was bleak.<p>Today, I have a decently-paid job in tech, good life&#x2F;work balance, a nice clean house, and self-caring habits. I have a great mental and physical health, good relationships and a decent financial position. I traveled the world and had incredible experiences. I&#x27;ve got everything I dreamed about when I struggled mentally, physically and financially.<p>On the other hand, achieving all my dreams took me to a place where my mind says &quot;I&#x27;ve done it all, let&#x27;s just enjoy what I&#x27;ve got. Let&#x27;s enjoy life&quot;. And that works for a while but then one day I resent being too complacent. I want to do more. Launch projects, earn more money, live more experiences. The voice of ambition says: &quot;you&#x27;re 45 years old, stop thinking like a 80 year old, move your ass and live more life&quot;<p>Still working to find that fine balance between contentment and ambition. As a human I&#x27;m skeptic I will find the right answer. We tend to work in cycles&#x2F;moods...</div><br/><div id="40030258" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40030258" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eggdaft</span><span>|</span><a href="#40029387">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40029618">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40030258">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40030258">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’ve achieved everything I set out to in life, at least everything I have control over and set out to do when I was in my 20s.<p>I’ve added a new ambition after some thought, not sure if I’ll manage to squeeze it in.<p>But I see the second half of my life now as predominantly about “service”. I think it’s important for everyone to have a life, to do the things they love, to follow some ambition or passion and take care of themselves. But we then need to ensure we help others do the same.<p>So my focus now is on my parents, family members, my partner, and society. I’m very grateful I had the health and opportunity to build and see what I wanted. Now it’s payback. I still do selfish things - I have to in order to stay sane - but the focus is on service.</div><br/><div id="40030787" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40030787" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JackMorgan</span><span>|</span><a href="#40029387">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40030258">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40030822">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40030787">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40030787">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I feel the same.

Now, I&#x27;ve got stability, so the last few years I&#x27;m focusing on service towards others.<p>I&#x27;ve been volunteering for the last two years as a firefighter, and yesterday just finished the required ride alongs to complete my EMT. It feels good to deeply integrate with my local community, caring for neighbors when they need help. Between emergency response and a software engineer apprenticeship program I run I am spending a significant amount of time each week on community service. I feel safer and more connected to my community than ever before.

Its an unnatural thing for the body to do, interacting with a computer or other digital device for that length of time. I&#x27;ve never walked away from using the computer feeling charged and rejuvenated, even when working on something I enjoy. Not mentally, I am referring to a whole body feeling.<p>I believe the vibrations emanating from digital devices is partly incompatible with human biology, so the body spends significant energy trying to maintain its default &quot;state&quot; so to speak, which is why it feels draining to use computer for long stretches of time. If you read a book for hours on end, it would not have the same effect so its not purely the sedentary nature of it.<p>In qi-gong practice, there is a concept known as &quot;drawing&quot; where you can increase your strength and vitality from being in proximity to  different objects. For example, if I put you in a room full of plants and natural sunlight, you WILL become physically stronger instantly. If I put you in a server computer room, you will become physically weaker instantly. The body is constantly adjusting its &quot;aura&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t know the science behind it, but it is easy to experiment with. Have someone resist a push while in a wide stance while holding in their left hand<p>1. a phone in their hand turned on<p>2. hold a living plant<p>3. glass of water<p>4. a battery<p>See if you can feel the difference in your ability to resist the push. It will change based on the object in your hand.<p>There is some challenges:<p>1. the pusher has to have correct form and measured strength. By correct form, it means you know how to correctly use your body to create an effective push (standing too close to not engage your legs, only using your arms to push, etc) Measured strength means similar force each time to have a base to compare to.<p>2. the pushee has to maintain a &quot;neutral&quot; state and provide the same amount of resistance on every push, to maintain the &quot;control&quot; group.<p>3. enough sensitivity as the pusher to feel the different levels of resistance provided by the pushee. On some pushes, the pushee might feel &quot;heavier&quot; or &quot;lighter&quot;<p>4. Patience. Whatever object you are holding has an effect on your body and most people cannot feel it initially. In fact, it takes years to cultivate enough sensitivity to feel subtle changes.<p>I think there has been some research on this topic in regards to wearing synthetic clothing made of nylon or polyester.</div><br/><div id="40032658" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40032658" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">beryilma</span><span>|</span><a href="#40029387">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40032532">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40032524">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40032658">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40032658">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is absolute nonsense.<p>Plants, nature, etc. will for sure make people feel better compared to sitting in front of a computer.

I spent most of the day coding in a cubicle. It was analytically satisfying but not what I truly wanted to do. It was also quite stressful, and the hours were long. I had chosen computer science because I was moderately good at it, and I hoped it would help me pay off my $50,000 in college loans.<p>In my first week of work, I realized I needed to find a way out. I had a hunch that the path I was on would not end well. I found an online group of people with similar thoughts. They were into &quot;simple living,&quot; inspired by a book called &quot;Your Money or Your Life.&quot; After reading it, I created a spreadsheet and started plotting numbers. I calculated that by continuously reducing my expenses and saving everything beyond a minimal lifestyle, and investing it in index funds, I could reach a point where my investments matched my spending.<p>For the next 25 years, I kept reducing my spending and invested the surplus into the S&amp;P 500. At the time, that was considered a very aggressive move, as a more conservative strategy was recommended. But, I decided to give it a try. I forwent a consumer lifestyle. I didn&#x27;t travel much and spent most of my free time reading. When I eventually started a family, I devoted time to them. I had to put on blinders, though. The cars, houses, lavish vacations, fancy dining, clothes, gadgets—I ignored all that. I bought houses in the poorest neighborhoods and fixed them up. I drove the cheapest cars that were reliable. I adopted a simple wardrobe. I bought second hand. I figured out how to make nutritious, delicious meals from the least expensive ingredients. Often, I felt like I was missing out compared to my peers, especially as wages in the industry grew. But, I endured and stuck to the plan.<p>These days, this movement seems to have evolved into FI&#x2F;RE. Although it&#x27;s not quite the same, it probably has similar goals.<p>I saw a few people make huge payoffs from startups and IPOs, so I tried that too. But it was terrible for my mental health, and I quickly learned that the board and the CEO were not on the side of the common worker—they had no intention of sharing their payouts. I worked for four failed startups with some more steady work in between. In hindsight, I don&#x27;t recommend it. It wasn&#x27;t worth it. I made less money than my peers, and I put too much of myself into the products I helped build. In the end, only those with money made more money. The rest of us got shafted.<p>But the moral of the story is, if you have 25 years, you might also be able to do it. Times have changed, though. But there&#x27;s still probably an intersection point. The opportunities are greater than they ever have been. Given today&#x27;s wages, I could have probably reached my goals 10 years earlier.<p>The transition to retiring early wasn&#x27;t without its pains. I hadn&#x27;t fully envisioned a future, and when I finally met my goals, I realized time had changed. In the years that followed, I experienced significant anguish because the dreams I once had (becoming an artist, going into academia) were no longer realistic. I needed over two years just to recover from burnout. But now, I&#x27;m finally somewhat satisfied but still quite lost and with anxiety. But, I feel the best I&#x27;ve felt since my 20s, and things get better every day.</div><br/><div id="40030619" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40030619" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Archelaos</span><span>|</span><a href="#40029387">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40030420">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40030097">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40030619">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40030619">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; it would help me pay off my $50,000 in college loans<p>If you have teenagers who want to go to university, consider encouraging them to learn German and then study in Germany.

The modern disease of setting money as a primary goal is missing the point of life. We use money for the things we want. Concentrate on the wants and consider <i>why</i> you want those things. Keep your eye on the ball.<p>&gt; generational wealth.<p>What do your kids want that means they need your money? To go to university and join the same treadmill as you? Personally I wanted to earn my own way in life - I didn&#x27;t want to live off my parents (although I probably could have). Independence is another modern goal. I have retired early, but money in itself brings many many unobvious problems. It doesn&#x27;t magically give me an obviously better life than my friends (who are on a <i>very</i> wide range of incomes).<p>We are all given approximately 70 years - be very very careful how you spend yours.

An average mind gets distracted by those activities and is dragged passively from one distraction to another. An enlightened mind watches these earthly activities with full attention, like you would watch colorful butterflies, but is not carried away from deep realisation that these butterflies come and go as simple decorations of the neutral state of mind, which is often called &quot;emptiness&quot;.

One thing that is working a lot for me is trying to become a professional fiction writer.<p>There is a lot a of ambition and uncertainty in it. I always enjoyed writing (whatever the context, not only fiction) and now I enjoy getting better at writing fiction. I enjoy being part of a group of other wanna-be writers with the same goals and challenges. I made real friends this way. I enjoy listening podcasts, videos, interviews from experienced authors. I am even enjoying more working on some software side-projects that are related to literature (in general or my own).<p>At the same, there is very little chance that this endeavor will have any financial return. In Brazil, where I live, you can count in the dozens the number of writers that live solely from the income of book royalties and in the hundreds the number of writers that live from literature (royalties + workshops, online courses, literary services, etc).<p>So, even some successful authors that have decent number of readers (for Brazil&#x27;s context) and some awards, have a day job.<p>This, interestingly for me, who has a well-paid job, removes the pressure of this project of mine. Since it is an art project, to not have the pressure of needing to earn money, actually makes my art better, I have more patience and time to reflect upon it (ironically, increasing my chances to earn money through my art).<p>But I still have the pressure to earn readers. It&#x27;s not like I am painting paintings that I am happy enough to complete and leave them on my house studio. I am not doing art for myself, but for others. That&#x27;s where the ambition part come from. Which I like.<p>I don&#x27;t think this comes from a mid-life crisis, as I write short stories since my twenties. It&#x27;s only now that I have the time, money, and, I might say, wisdom to be able to do it seriously. Writing is one form of art that benefits a lot from like experience.<p>Just to share what worked for me, and maybe you can find something for you that fits the bill of being an ambitious project that you hope to achieve something meaningful from, but that it&#x27;s not necessarily attached to financial outcomes. The privilege of being able to be professional about something that might not return more money, even if successful, is something that I treasure a lot.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40033061" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40033061" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">spxneo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40029387">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40031479">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40030775">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40033061">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40033061">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">1) change your environment temporarily<p>2) let new perspective come to you<p>3) implement what your own introspection tells you<p>I&#x27;ve seen successful people become addicted to drugs because they let their minds idle and they lost perspective.<p>Remember the devil doesn&#x27;t come with bulls and horns.

There&#x27;s a danger in the seductive whisper of &quot;you need more&quot;. Whether it&#x27;s material goods, power, fame, or whatever else, pursuing external things like these is a hole which can never be filled. It seems to me that true happiness is to be found inward. If you can learn to find happiness where you are right now, then you can have a good life regardless of your external circumstances.<p>I had two really powerful insights when I was a teenager. The first was when I got a Christmas gift I really wanted (a walkman iirc), and it struck me that actually having it didn&#x27;t fulfill me nearly as much as I had thought it would. The other was when my grandpa died, and I would have given anything to have him back (and I still would). These two experiences made me realize that <i>stuff</i> is hollow and unimportant, and what <i>truly</i> matters in this world are people.

To reach that state of contentment usually requires some mix of effort and satisfaction with the outcomes of that effort and ultimately your confidence in your ability to maintain and grow the things you value in life. If you worked hard but the outcome isn’t good - why? If you achieved a good outcome (like a solid degree, a good job, and&#x2F;or home ownership) but are particularly unsatisfied - why? If you’re not confident in your future - why? It’s not a requirement to settle these questions before finding companionship, but it helps.<p>No doubt a good partner multiplies contentment, but they shouldn’t be facing a void of it either. Lastly, if you find that your contentment is being pulled and pushed and stomped on by external factors, then do what is needed to gain control of it again - anyone can achieve this, and if someone in a land of possibility thinks they’re the exception, that the world really is getting in their way, they’re holding themselves back with that very thought.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40032181" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40032181" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nojvek</span><span>|</span><a href="#40029515">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40030630">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40032894">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40032181">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40032181">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was watching a video about Stanford long term happiness study <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;IULhd1UuicA?si=6YezvfwZ5NE5ile6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;IULhd1UuicA?si=6YezvfwZ5NE5ile6</a><p>The takeaway being what you mentioned.

He didn’t mean that there’s a connection between every sinful attitude and money — that money is always in your mind when you sin. I think he meant that all the evils in the world come from a certain kind of heart, namely, the kind of heart that loves money.<p>&gt; Now what does it mean to love money? It doesn’t mean to admire the green paper or the brown coins. To know what it means to love money, you have to ask: What is money? I would answer that question like this: Money is simply a symbol that stands for human resources. Money stands for what you can get from man, not from God! (“Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters. He who has no money come buy and eat!” Isaiah 55:1.) Money is the currency of human resources.<p>&gt; So the heart that loves money is a heart that pins its hopes, and pursues its pleasures, and puts its trust in what human resources can offer. So the love of money is virtually the same as faith in money — belief (trust, confidence, assurance) that money will meet your needs and make you happy.<p>&gt; Therefore the love of money, or belief in money, is the flip side of unbelief in the promises of God. Just like Jesus said in Matthew 6:24 — you cannot serve God and money. You can’t trust or believe in God and money. Belief in one is unbelief in the other. A heart that loves money — banks on money for happiness, believes in money — is at the same time not banking on the promises of God for happiness.<p>&gt; So when Paul says that the love of money is the root of all evils, he implies that unbelief in the promises of God is the taproot of every sinful attitude in our heart.<p>From: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.desiringgod.org&#x2F;messages&#x2F;battling-unbelief-at-bethlehem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.desiringgod.org&#x2F;messages&#x2F;battling-unbelief-at-be...</a></div><br/><div id="40032674" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40032674" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hellojesus</span><span>|</span><a href="#40029159">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40030068">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40034479">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40032674">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40032674">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I get what you&#x27;re saying, but as someone completely unfamiliar with the Bible but familiar with the common phrase, &quot;Money is the root of all evil&quot;, I agree that the GP&#x27;s original statement is much clearer.<p>&gt; For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils.<p>This reads not that money itself is the root of evils, or even that a desire for money ensures you live a sinful life.<p>To me this reads that money, as a motivator, can be a catalyst to dip into immoral practice. If someone wants riches but cares not about how they acquire it, they may steal, they may start wars, they may con others, etc. But someone who uses their desire of money as a catalyst for bringing world change via a new product, service, knowledge, is well found in their desires and implementation, as they are making the world better while achieving their goals.<p>The contrast in translations completely alters the takeaway for me.</div><br/><div id="40034106" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40034106" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gen220</span><span>|</span><a href="#40029159">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40032674">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40034479">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40034106">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40034106">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; But someone who uses their desire of money as a catalyst for bringing world change via a new product, service, knowledge, is well found in their desires and implementation, as they are making the world better while achieving their goals.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth – and I think it is a worthwhile thing to note – I do not believe that Jesus would condone this.<p>To Christ, the root of &quot;well-founded&quot; behavior is the golden rule – treat others as you would want yourself to be treated.

It comes at an interesting time for me.<p>I&#x27;m in a full blown mid-life crisis where my state of mind fluctuates between full contentment and wishing I was doing more with life. This article made me think.<p>On the one hand, I&#x27;m content because I come from an unprivileged background. My family was abusive. Me and my brothers struggled with mental health. We ran away from home as soon as we could. Where I was born there were not any decent jobs, so the future was bleak.<p>Today, I have a decently-paid job in tech, good life&#x2F;work balance, a nice clean house, and self-caring habits. I have a great mental and physical health, good relationships and a decent financial position. I traveled the world and had incredible experiences. I&#x27;ve got everything I dreamed about when I struggled mentally, physically and financially.<p>On the other hand, achieving all my dreams took me to a place where my mind says &quot;I&#x27;ve done it all, let&#x27;s just enjoy what I&#x27;ve got. Let&#x27;s enjoy life&quot;. And that works for a while but then one day I resent being too complacent. I want to do more. Launch projects, earn more money, live more experiences. The voice of ambition says: &quot;you&#x27;re 45 years old, stop thinking like a 80 year old, move your ass and live more life&quot;<p>Still working to find that fine balance between contentment and ambition. As a human I&#x27;m skeptic I will find the right answer.

Kipling<p>Media riles up those who have been limited or deprived by circumstances. It waves flags and triggers emotions and creates envy and conjures social ladders to political influence, or financial gains, or popularity and public attention, or peaks of history. The reality though is that those apply to the people who don’t know better - the new grads, the hungry and ambitious, the midlife-crisis sufferers, the naive who haven’t encountered bad people or circumstances. If you’ve seen a lot or you know evil, you don’t need a public life where you may attract it. When you know what you have and value it, a quiet life is the best way to protect it. People value privacy when they have something to lose. If you know what you want to do and can do it without attention, you are much better off doing than dealing with collateral damage from unpredictable attention.<p>The media today is becoming incredibly propaganda filled and charged.

If you can learn to find happiness where you are right now, then you can have a good life regardless of your external circumstances.<p>I had two really powerful insights when I was a teenager. The first was when I got a Christmas gift I really wanted (a walkman iirc), and it struck me that actually having it didn&#x27;t fulfill me nearly as much as I had thought it would. The other was when my grandpa died, and I would have given anything to have him back (and I still would). These two experiences made me realize that <i>stuff</i> is hollow and unimportant, and what <i>truly</i> matters in this world are people. Being with the people you love is the greatest thing we can have, and unlike material possessions can never be replaced once it&#x27;s gone.<p>I think that a simple life is far underrated.

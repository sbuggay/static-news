Out of order is a work in progress at several companies and labs.

These things take a lot of time.<p>&gt; I still think the scope of work would be relatively small<p>I&#x27;m not so sure about this. Remember that an ISA is not just a set of instructions: it defines how virtual memory works, what the memory model is like, how security works, etc. Changes in those things percolate through the entire design.<p>Also, I&#x27;m going to go out on a limb and claim that verification of a very high-powered RISC-V core that is going to be manufactured in high-volume is probably much more expensive and time-consuming than the case for an ARM design.<p>edit: I also forgot about the case with Qualcomm&#x27;s failed attempt to get code size extensions. Using RVC to approach parity on code density is <i>expensive</i>, and you&#x27;re going to make the front-end of the machine more complicated. Going out on another limb: this is probably not unrelated to the reason why THUMB is missing from AArch64.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41921935" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41921935" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sarlalian</span><span>|</span><a href="#41920927">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41921829">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41922439">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41922499">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41921935">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41921935">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The bigger question is how much of their existing cores utilize Arm IP… and how sure are they that they would find all of it?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41922499" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41922499" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ajb</span><span>|</span><a href="#41920927">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41921735">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41921829">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41922134">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41922499">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41922499">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Nevertheless, several companies that originally had MIPS  implementations did exactly this, to implement ARM processors.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41922134" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41922134" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gardaani</span><span>|</span><a href="#41920927">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41921735">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41922499">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41921553">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41922134">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41922134">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; That doesn&#x27;t mean you can just slap a RISC-V decoder on an ARM chip and it will magically work though.<p>Raspberry Pi RP2350 already ships with ARM and RISC-V cores. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raspberrypi.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;rp2350&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.raspberrypi.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;rp2350&#x2F;</a><p>It seems that the RISC-V cores don&#x27;t take much space on the chip: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41192341">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41192341</a><p>Of course, microcontrollers are a different from mobile CPUs, but it&#x27;s doable.</div><br/><div id="41922219" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41922219" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MindSpunk</span><span>|</span><a href="#41920927">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41922134">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41921553">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41922219">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41922219">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s not really comparable.

It&#x27;s not &quot;barking insane&quot;. However, some thought shows that it won&#x27;t work for a lot of people.<p>Firstly, dishwashers <i>have</i> to live at ground level whereas crockery can be stored in a cupboard at any level. You are contraining yourself to store crockery at the ground level where most people also have their under-sink unit, laundry machine, and heavy pans cupboard.<p>Secondly, plates and utensils are <i>way</i> more spread out in a dishwasher. You have to expose every surface for them to be cleaned properly. Plus, there is the space needed for the dishwasher itself, which can be pretty chunky.<p>So no, Rory Sutherland, in our 2-bedroom urban UK house we definitely cannot afford the space to have a second dishwasher. And if your job is to go around blithely trying to convince everyone that they&#x27;d be better off with one, all you&#x27;re doing is re-affirming my contempt towards behavioural scientists and salespeople.</div><br/><div id="40812203" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40812203" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pavel_lishin</span><span>|</span><a href="#40811897">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40814781">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40812203">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40812203">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It also assumes that you have exactly as much stuff as will fit into a single dishwasher, and that you go through it all at the same rate, such that when the &quot;dirty&quot; dishwasher is full, the &quot;clean&quot; one becomes empty enough that it can switch roles.<p>Right now, our dishwasher&#x27;s top rack is full of top rack stuff, whereas the bottom rack has two dishes and a coffee cup.

It means that partially, everything is connected to anything else like the Holographic Theory of Learning[1] states. Creating a field of study is creating a framework for tackling problems. Architecture for spatial and material problems, software for logical and procedural problems, history for causal problems, chemistry for material, etc. Any one of those fields gives you a tool for addressing any problem, and some of those tools are extremely useful in some narrow definition of a problem. Everything has a historical, material and spatial dimension, and everything is processed through our logic and behavior. The goal is to know which hammer to use when, I suppose.<p>[1].

But, “possible” doesn’t mean that it is sensible.
Philosophically speaking, if such things like above are allowed, then it should also be allowed to simply heat this water to very high temperature (like 99 C) with another apparatus such as a stove and then finally boil it with the candles. That is, use a stove instead of a rocket.
It is also possible to conceive of an apparatus with heating elements and photodiodes. This apparatus will run the heaters and heat the water when its photodiode detect the light from the candle. So, in effect, the candle is responsible for heating the water.<p>Here’s what I’m trying to say: we need to accept some constraints and reject some possibilities in order to answer anything. If there are no constraints, then anything is possible. But, we know that this is not how the universe works.<p>Finally, I hope to never read anything from this author again.

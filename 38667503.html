Many Linux users don&#x27;t want the OS to take off, because things will get materially worse in many regards if it gets popular. You often only find the new users and tech media theorizing about the &#x27;year of the Linux desktop&#x27;, or about Linux&#x27;s product weaknesses in the narrow lens of comparing it to Windows.<p>Fedora is able to balance this public image issue fairly well. In their landing page, they emphasize that it is for &quot;developers and makers of all kinds&quot;. But because Fedora Workstation actually is fairly close to being an easy-for-all-users distro, in their &quot;Is Fedora For Me&quot; page, they have this paragraph that essentially explains that it might also be for non-developers as long as they are curious&#x2F;enthusiastic about computers in general:<p>&gt; The Fedora distribution is made for enthusiastic and curious computer users that like to learn and experience newer versions of software and therefore might not suit everyone. Although the Project works hard to make Fedora as usable as possible for the widest possible audience there are inherent limitations on how fast a new software can be translated, gain accessibility features, provide the most comprehensive documentation and guidance. If you on the other hand need a stable Linux distribution that supports even the latest hardware, are willing to put some effort to help the free and open source software (FOSS) community and file some bug reports this might be a perfect system for you!</div><br/><div id="38670211" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38670211" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">q66</span><span>|</span><a href="#38668523">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38670012">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38668951">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38670211">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38670211">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">it&#x27;s designed to be a hacker distro; i just felt like &quot;hacker distros&quot; frequently tend to make a lot of things overly manual for no reason primarily due to halfassed choices made when packaging things - the way things are built in chimera is so that whatever is in the repo is &quot;install and go&quot; - and this includes things like large complicated desktops, in general things are designed so that if you bootstrap a system from scratch (by installing all the packages in an empty root) you need to do nothing more - other than the stuff you wish to explicitly change, and this is done without involving complicated scripts or anything of the likes, vast majority of packages install by simply unpacking themselves<p>to a degree your system package graph also defines your system configuration for things that are coarse enough to allow it; it&#x27;s also easily auditable</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38668951" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38668951" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gjvc</span><span>|</span><a href="#38668523">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38670012">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38669112">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38668951">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38668951">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&quot;&quot;&quot;Anyone who&#x27;s not an Arch&#x2F;Kali&#x2F;BSD&#x2F;suckless enthusiast type has a finely tuned sense of &quot;Oh no, that makes me feel the same way that thinking about a project car does, I&#x27;m outta here&quot;.&quot;&quot;&quot;</i><p>excellent observation</div><br/></div></div><div id="38669112" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38669112" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">akosoaaafjdr</span><span>|</span><a href="#38668523">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38668951">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38670178">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38669112">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38669112">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I mean yeah, this is transparently a BSD esque project it looks like, as in its pretty clearly tailored specifically to provide the kinds of features professional systems programmers and admins have been clamoring for from Linux for a very long time.

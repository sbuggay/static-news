At least in the areas I&#x27;ve lived (in multiple parts of the country), schools are generally built close to large neighborhoods, and have dedicated infrastructure to help kids walk to school. Grocery stores are less likely to be within walking distance. But then, even if I could walk to a grocery store, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to, because I would be limited by how much I can carry back, which means I&#x27;d have to go shopping more often.<p>Conversely, I have traveled to Europe and Japan. At least in the areas I went to, it didn&#x27;t really seem any safer for kids to play outside than many parts of America. Yes, public transit was much better, but there were still lots of cars on the streets, and there were areas that weren&#x27;t very pedestrian friendly. And in some cities it was quite difficult to find playgrounds. I don&#x27;t doubt that there are places in Europe and Japan where kids can play outside without worrying about cars.

Sure there were hiccups, one time she stole the neighbors solar powered lanterns from his front yard, but we made her return them and apologize.<p>I guess our strategy is we just don&#x27;t let her have any screens. They make her absolutely insane. So instead she leaves the house as soon as she can and goes out and plays. Even her 5 year old sister who is wheelchair bound goes with her a lot of the time, in the $1200 Thule buggy super stroller we bought (used). I guess we just lucked out, but we also insisted on it and kept letting her go out even after some woman called CPS on us for letting our kid be unsupervised.

Technology has become a great atomizing force in our society, from automobiles keeping us from talking to each other in traffic to cell phones keeping us from talking to each other at the store. Even online shopping atomizes us. And in the mean time, both parents basically have to be working all the time to keep paying for their lifestyle. All of this combined leads to isolated childhoods, and because we tend to keep the habits we learn as children, isolated adulthoods.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40640954" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40640954" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">doubloon</span><span>|</span><a href="#40639280">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40639468">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40639817">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40640954">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40640954">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">two parents working 40-60 hours a week.<p>if two parents worked 20-30 hours a week each, probably not as big a deal.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40639817" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40639817" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">WarOnPrivacy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40639280">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40640954">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40642275">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40639817">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40639817">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I would have thought that two parents working and not technology would have been the major contributor to loss of the community in early periods.<p>I had one working parent and I had a community because I had places to go.<p>My 5 kids had 1 parent at home full time and zero community.

He&#x27;s had 3 consecutive weekends of birthday parties, with largely the same cast of characters at the last 2 (the third was a pre-school friend who lives in a different city).  He knows all his friends&#x27; parents, and a bunch of them apparently know me (&quot;Hi, ___&#x27;s dad!&quot;) even though I can&#x27;t remember their names.  There&#x27;s an interlocking web of social relationships in the city that we&#x27;ve somehow become part of, where people know other people through other contexts.<p>This didn&#x27;t happen automatically, and it&#x27;s been fascinating to watch the work that my wife and other (frankly) women have done in building the village.  It&#x27;s a slow, year-by-year process of doing favors for other people, putting yourself out there, spending time with other people, having your kids spend time with other people, opening up, and building trust.  We tried carpooling for the first time last spring - it worked out great, and we have a much closer relationship with the other family now, but it can be nerve-wracking entrusting your small child to another driver.  But that is how you build trust, and trust is how you build the village.<p>The community I live in is not at all what the article would predict.  We are a secular liberal family.  Our friends are mostly secular liberal with some religious liberal families mixed in.  The community is 30% foreign-born, and 35% speak a language other than English at home.  It is racially mixed, &lt; 30% white, and about 1&#x2F;3 multiracial in my son&#x27;s grade.  All of the polemical discourse in America would say that such a heterogenous grouping is destructive to social cohesion.<p>But the most important ingredient to having community is that you have to <i>want</i> community, and value it, and be willing to put in the effort to build it.  And it has a critical mass of people who value community, enough that if you are one of them, you can find your people.</div><br/><div id="40642698" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40642698" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anon291</span><span>|</span><a href="#40640673">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40642655">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40642698">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40642698">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Unfortunately a lot of fraternal societies have disbanded and a lot of community organizing falls to women.

While this does seem to establish some kind of community amongst parents of children of similar ages, it does not seem to expand out into parents with children of dissimilar ages even within the same sport, let alone an even larger community. Which is not terribly surprising as there is not much reason for someone unrelated to a participating child to show up.<p>I might even go as far as to say that because parents get stuck in those narrowly isolated communities, it contributes a fracturing to any larger community that might have otherwise been able to form. It is difficult to have a general community of only 20-somethings and the elderly with little in-between.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40640762" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40640762" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jeffbee</span><span>|</span><a href="#40639777">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40639821">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40639960">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40640354">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40640762">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40640762">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What I want to know is why people will get up on the internet and say something counterfactual like people are moving more today than in the past, a hypothesis without a shred of supporting evidence.

My dad was involved in adult softball leagues and many of my earliest friends were the kids of his teammates. We all went to tournaments together and played with each other while the adults played their softball. I was also involved in little league and youth basketball and made friends that way and spent a ton of time at the park with other kids playing baseball and basketball even outside of any kind of league. The neighborhood gathered together in one house even under the guise of television, which united us much more than it divided us, typically to do things like watch Lakers and Dodgers playoff games or major boxing matches that were only on pay-per-view, presumably because households didn&#x27;t all want to have to pay separately.<p>Frankly, it&#x27;s hard for me to imagine what could possibly create a community in my neighborhood today. Half the properties here are AirBNB party houses. The average tenure of a neighbor who actually lives in their own property feels like maybe three years. Hard to make any kind of lasting connections, with or without a church.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40640005" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40640005" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mihaaly</span><span>|</span><a href="#40639777">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40639901">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40640005">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40640005">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are liberal and secular teenagers more willing&#x2F;open to admit problems or seek help for unusual troublesome matters set them apart form others than religious peers perhaps?

When I introduce a new topic I always start with worked examples, and I find that students are able to learn much more effectively when they have a reference. Poor pedagogy is also one of my biggest gripes with my undergraduate math program too, where the professors and textbooks often included too few worked problems and proofs, and the ones they did include were not very useful. What I found especially frustrating was when a worked example solved a special case with a unique approach, and the general case required a much more involved method that wasn&#x27;t explained particularly well.

That seems to be the most common approach in higher math, especially once you get into serious math-major courses like Real Analysis and Abstract Algebra.<p>What actually works in practice is simply creating more worked examples, organizing them well, and giving students practice with problems like each worked example before moving them onto the next worked example covering a slightly more challenging case.

As I understand it, for students (not experts), empirical results point in the opposite direction.<p>One key empirical result is the &quot;expertise reversal effect,&quot; a well-known phenomenon that instructional techniques that promote the most learning in experts, promote the least learning in beginners, and vice versa.<p>It&#x27;s true that many highly skilled professionals spend a lot of time solving open-ended problems, and in the process, discovering new knowledge as opposed to obtaining it through direct instruction. But I don&#x27;t think this means beginners should do the same. The expertise reversal effect suggests the opposite – that beginners (i.e., students) learn most effectively through direct instruction.<p>Here are some quotes elaborating on why beginners benefit more from direct instruction:<p>1. &quot;First, a learner who is having difficulty with many of the components can easily be overwhelmed by the processing demands of the complex task. Second, to the extent that many components are well mastered, the student will waste a great deal of time repeating those mastered components to get an opportunity to practice the few components that need additional practice.<p>A large body of research in psychology shows that part training is often more effective when the part component is independent, or nearly so, of the larger task. ... Practicing one&#x27;s skills periodically in full context is important to motivation and to learning to practice, but not a reason to make this the principal mechanism of learning.&quot;<p>^ from Radical Constructivism and Cognitive Psychology (Anderson, Reder, &amp; Simon, 1998) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.andrew.cmu.edu&#x2F;user&#x2F;reder&#x2F;publications&#x2F;98_jra_lmr_has.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.andrew.cmu.edu&#x2F;user&#x2F;reder&#x2F;publications&#x2F;98_jra_lm...</a><p>2. &quot;These two facts -- that working memory is very limited when dealing with novel information, but that it is not limited when dealing with organized information stored in long-term memory -- explain why partially or minimally guided instruction typically is ineffective for novices, but can be effective for experts.

The trick was to convert to the upper half-plane model (where there was an obvious choice for which point on the boundary of the disc maps to infinity in the uhp). There I was annoyed because it felt like a trick question, but the lesson was probably useful.<p>- in a topology course there was a problem like ‘find a space which deformation-retracts to a möbius strip and to an annulus. This is easy to imagine in your head: a solid torus = S1*D2 can contain an embedding of each of those spaces into R3. I ended up carefully writing those retractions by hand, but I think the better solution was to take the product space and apply some theorems (I think I’m misremembering this – product space works for an ordinary retraction but for the deformation retraction I don’t think it works. I guess both retract to S1 and you could glue the two spaces together along that, or use the proof that homotopy equivalence &lt;=&gt; deformation retracts from common space, but I don’t think we had that).

Usually such practitioners need to recall facts and ideas in context and so they achieve a high recall naturally, by associations facts and ideas with each other.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40893314" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40893314" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">k__</span><span>|</span><a href="#40893695">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40891500">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40893314">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40893314">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I got better at math after programming for a few years.<p>Maybe, we need alternative approaches, to make the topic more interesting.</div><br/><div id="40896040" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40896040" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">obscurette</span><span>|</span><a href="#40893314">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40893673">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40896040">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40896040">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Everybody gets better in every (related) field after years of experience.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40893673" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40893673" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">will1am</span><span>|</span><a href="#40893314">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40896040">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40891500">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40893673">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40893673">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think that&#x27;s a common experience!</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40891500" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40891500" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">orthopodvt</span><span>|</span><a href="#40893314">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40894567">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40891500">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40891500">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So there is such a thing as &quot;knowledge&quot;.

Their references might clarify some things, but not all.  They argue against &quot;general problem-solving strategies&quot; with a reference to Polya, but they don&#x27;t provide a clear definition of what these strategies entail.  How broad is the set of strategies they&#x27;re arguing against?  What are some examples of such strategies?  I&#x27;d like something beyond two sentences on Polya.<p>Furthermore, what audience and level of mathematics education are we discussing?  The goals (and hence appropriate metrics of success) are certainly different for high schoolers targeting non-STEM careers vs. engineering undergrads vs. math grad students.  The authors reference &quot;aspiring mathematicians&quot; and &quot;domain specific mathematical problem-solving skills&quot;, indicating they&#x27;re arguing about education for math majors, or at least students in STEM fields.  In that case, the argument is somewhat meaningless - who&#x27;s arguing math majors shouldn&#x27;t learn math-specific skills?  But, as I understand it, the argument for general problem-solving skills is that students outside of math don&#x27;t actually need many specific math skills.  Instead, math is a vessel for teaching logic, reasoning, and problem-solving skills.  Then again, this might not be the type of problem-solving the authors are referencing - as I said above, it&#x27;s not very clear.<p>On a similar note, they cite evidence that studying worked examples is more effective than &quot;general problem-solving strategies&quot;, citing an &quot;improvement in subsequent problem-solving performance&quot; without explaining how this performance is measured.  If students are tested on specific problem types, of course they&#x27;ll perform better when taught strategies for those specific problem types.  But it&#x27;s not clear that this is meaningful.  For STEM majors, sure, solving specific problems is a skill worth cultivating.  But for most students, solving specific problems isn&#x27;t as important as learning logic, reasoning, and general problem-solving skills.  In my anecdotal experience tutoring math, students tend to just memorize strategies for specific problem types instead of learning transferable logic and reasoning skills because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s tested.  I&#x27;d be curious to see which method of learning facilitates better performance on a more general problem-solving test of some sort.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not an education researcher or an educator of any sort.  But I am passionate about good STEM education, especially in math.  I genuinely feel that math education fails most students, at least here in America.  If I&#x27;m being generous, this article is a well-intentioned but poorly-executed argument for effective math education strategies.  If I&#x27;m not being so generous, this article advocates for the status quo in math education that forces students to slog through years of math classes for little discernible benefit.  Either way, it&#x27;s a disappointing article with a poorly-explained thesis.</div><br/><div id="40892413" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40892413" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zeroimpl</span><span>|</span><a href="#40891563">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40895250">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40892413">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40892413">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Furthermore, what audience and level of mathematics education are we discussing?<p>I wonder this too, I think they might mean university-level as well. For younger audiences, I feel one of the biggest problems for most people to understand math is they don&#x27;t understand why any of it is relevant. If educators can make it seem more like teaching general problem solving abilities, that will likely improve the overall acceptance and lead to better overall math skills as a result.<p>As a specific example, our high-school math curriculum taught a lot of calculus, but framed it incorrectly as being a useful tool that people would use. Eg as if a business man would write down an equation for their revenue based on inputs, and then take the derivative to compute the maximum. I&#x27;m assuming they told students this to try and get them motivated, but it clearly was a lie since everybody knows you could just plot a graph and look at it to find the maximum. If they instead were honest that the point of learning calculus was to help with understanding more advanced concepts in math&#x2F;engineering&#x2F;science, while also being a valuable learning tool for general problem solving, I think that would have been a better result.</div><br/><div id="40893566" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40893566" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">graycat</span><span>|</span><a href="#40891563">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40892413">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40895250">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40893566">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40893566">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; As a specific example, our high-school math curriculum taught a lot of calculus, but framed it incorrectly as being a useful tool that people would use.<p>One day at FedEx the BoD (board of directors) was concerned about the future of the company and as part of that wanted an estimate of the likely growth of the company.<p>In the offices there were several efforts, free-hand, wishes, hopes, guesses, what the marketing&#x2F;selling people thought, etc., and none of those efforts seemed to be objective or with a foundation or rationality.<p>We knew the current revenue.  We could make an okay estimate of revenue when all the airplanes were full.  So, the problem was essentially to interpolate over time between those two numbers.<p>For the interpolation, how might that go?  That is, what, day by day, would be driving the growth?  So, notice that each day current customers would be shipping packages, and customers to be would be receiving packages and, thus, learning about FedEx and becoming customers.  That is, each day the growth would be directly proportional to (1) the number of current customers creating publicity and (2) the number of customers to be receiving that publicity.<p>So, for some math, let t be time in days, y(t) the revenue on day t, t = 0 for the present day, and b the revenue when all the planes were full.  Then for some constant of proportionality k, we have<p><pre><code>     y&#x27;(t) = k y(t) (b - y(t))
</code></pre>
where y&#x27;(t) = dy&#x2F;dt the calculus first derivative of y(t) with respect to t.<p>A little calculus yields the solution.<p><pre><code>     y(t) = y(0) b exp(bkt) &#x2F;
            ( y(0)( exp(bkt) - 1) + b))
</code></pre>
Seeing how the growth goes for several values of k, pick one that seems reasonable.  Draw the graph and leave it for the BoD.<p>That was a Friday, and the BoD meeting started at 8 AM the next day, Saturday.<p>First thing at the meeting, two crucial BoD members asked how the graph was drawn.  For several hours, no one had an answer.  The two members gave up on FedEx, got plane tickets back to Texas, returned to their rented rooms, packed, and as a last chance returned to the BoD meeting.  FedEx was about to die.<p>I did all the work for the graph, the idea, calculus, arithmetic (HP calculator), but didn&#x27;t know about the BoD meeting.  Someone guessed that I did know about the graph, and I got a call and came to the meeting.  The two crucial BoD members were grim, standing in the hallway with their bags packed, and their airline tickets in their shirt pockets.<p>I reproduced a few points on the graph, and FedEx was saved.<p>So, some math saved a business.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40895250" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40895250" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dventimi</span><span>|</span><a href="#40891563">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40892120">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40895250">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40895250">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Teaching math is not a substitute for teaching general problem-solving skills.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40892120" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40892120" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">motohagiography</span><span>|</span><a href="#40895250">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40892058">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40892120">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40892120">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">there is a constant tension in any field between fox&#x2F;hedgehog, breadth-first&#x2F;depth-first competence where in their own contexts they are absolutely correct about the supriority of their approaches, but quite wrong outside of it. we could frame these in a general category of Endian conflicts, where depth-firsts think the breadth-firsts are handwavey bullshitters, and breadth-firsts have a finite amount of patience for depth-first&#x27;s concrete thinking and denial of abstractions.<p>I often state I don&#x27;t know anything about math as if there&#x27;s a python library and a wikipedia page that&#x27;s usually enough for my purposes, and then use a kind of profane math to do stuff instead of the sacred math that seems mostly to be about arguing and telling people what is impossible.

My impression is that the latter is far less trainable, and the best you can do is go through enough worked examples, spread out so that every problem in the space of expected learning is within a reasonably small distance to some worked example.<p>I simply mean that researcher team A will claim a positive result for method A because their test tested task fluency, while team B will claim a positive result for method B because their test tested ability to wade through new and confusing territory. (btw, I think &quot;generalization ability&quot; is an unhelpful term here. The flip side to task fluency I think more of as debugging, or turning confusing situations into unconfusing situations.)<p>&gt; If you have time, would you mind elaborating a bit more on this?<p>I don&#x27;t know what good theoretical underpinnings for human learning looks like (I&#x27;m not a time traveler), but to make an analogy imagine chemistry before the discovery of the periodic table, specifically how off-the-mark both sides of arguments in chemistry must have been back then.<p>&gt; My impression is that general problem-solving training falls into the category of lack of adequate theoretical underpinnings, but I doubt that&#x27;s what you mean to refer to with this point.<p>By the way, I see problem solving as a goal, not as a theory. If your study measures mathematical knowledge without problem solving, your tests will look like standardized tests given to high school students in the USA. The optimal way to teach a class for those tests will then be in the style of &quot;When good teaching leads to bad results&quot;  that Alan Schoenfeld wrote about in regards to NYC geometry teachers.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40891419" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40891419" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">epgui</span><span>|</span><a href="#40891396">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40891518">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40891413">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40891419">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40891419">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What it is saying is that we need to stop acting as if, or believing that, this knowledge is solid.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40891413" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40891413" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ziofill</span><span>|</span><a href="#40891396">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40891419">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40891540">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40891413">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40891413">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Maybe you haven’t had reasons to come across such research before, but rest assured there’s plenty of it <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acrl.ala.org&#x2F;IS&#x2F;instruction-tools-resources-2&#x2F;pedagogy&#x2F;a-selected-list-of-journals-on-teaching-learning&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acrl.ala.org&#x2F;IS&#x2F;instruction-tools-resources-2&#x2F;pedago...</a></div><br/><div id="40891448" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40891448" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Icy0</span><span>|</span><a href="#40891396">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40891413">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40891604">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40891448">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40891448">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You seem to have linked a collection of general research on teaching and learning, which I am aware of exists.

Then if your model can calculate 7 * 8, you can also use it to calculate 7e10 * 8e11, even if you haven&#x27;t memorized that specific fact.</div><br/><div id="40892645" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40892645" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tsimionescu</span><span>|</span><a href="#40891545">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40892048">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40892625">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40892645">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40892645">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The multiplication table doesn&#x27;t have patterns, or it only has a few.

Kinda? Overrated isn’t exactly the word I want, but there’s definitely something weird going on.<p>98% (I’m being generous) of people can no longer work almost math past early algebra and maybe a handful of finance-related plug-in-the-numbers formulas by age 35 because, assuming they ever learned any, they have <i>never</i> used it, so it’s gone by then. And that state of things seems to be entirely Ok. Like, if they needed it, they’d have <i>used it</i> and the many of them who could once at least kinda work with calculus, or what have you, wouldn’t have lost that skill.<p>Meanwhile, I’ve not found the “it teaches problem solving skills, that’s why it’s important even if you never use 80% of it outside of school” thing to really hold. Maybe for the kinds of courses math majors take in college, I dunno, but not for the rest. If it does teach any, they don’t seem to generalize well for almost all people who learn them, and the rest, I think that’s more about who they are than that they took some math courses.<p>Ultimately, it’s not clear to me that if we taught quite a bit less math to most kids and even college students, anything bad would happen.<p>I think there are probably ways to approach math in primary and secondary school, and maybe also math courses for undergrads who have a small load of math courses anyway, that would temper its evident uselessness quite a bit—namely, a laser-focus on applications past the very earliest grades—but most math majors seem to want math education to go exactly the opposite way.

If I didn&#x27;t know math, I never would have even realized that my tailfeathers had been plucked. As for &quot;anything bad would happen&quot;, bad things probably happened to you that you were not aware of.<p>An anecdote: years ago, it used to be popular to run 30 minute seminars on TV called (my version) &quot;Get Rich In Real Estate Using Scams&quot;. I recall one that bragged about making a quick $10,000. I figured it was a con, and so watched the show carefully, noting each transaction. And yes, it did net a $10,000 score for the person. But how it worked was through a confusing combination of transactions meant to obfuscate what was actually happening. The key in it was getting your mark to accept a bond that would be worth $XXXX in the future while you got the $XXXX today. In essence, it was exploiting the mark&#x27;s failure to understand the concept of current value vs future value. The beauty (if you could call it that) was there was nothing illegal about this.<p>With my math knowledge, it stunk from the outset, even though it took me a while to find the dead rat. Just like with my knowledge of physics, when it was posted on HN that electric cars were 90% efficient, that set me off immediately, and sure enough, there was a rat corpse in it.

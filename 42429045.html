Proana which is short for pro-anorexia, also known as thinspo (thin inspiration) has the core tenet of advocating and encouraging an eating disorder as how you&#x27;d obtain value. The point of thinspo is to provide people inspiration and motivation to starve themselves, which is otherwise unnatural for humans to do. if you found a community that advocate overeating as the aesthetic ideal that would be as toxic. with the caveat being that being underweight is more dangerous from a health standpoint than overweight is. again, it all depends on the community and exactly what they&#x27;re advocating for.<p>you&#x27;d be more attractive if you were thiner that is healthy, is a lot more toxic of an idea than being fat doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s something wrong with you.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42438924" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42438924" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wruza</span><span>|</span><a href="#42437544">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42438059">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42438300">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42437797">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42438924">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42438924">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I guess one is acceptance and another is driving oneself into starvation. If fat communities encourage becoming fat by eating more&#x2F;worse, they are as delusional. The key idea of thinspo and other look-related movements is to become someone who you biologically aren’t by extreme measures. Some people are naturally thin-built, for them it’s sort of normal. For others it’s basically a destructive body modification which is only temporary. Thinspo is not pursuing information, they are pursuing the body type itself. I liked thinspo <i>type</i> before it had a name, but only when it’s natural and stays within reasonable effort. What’s the point of preferring someone who is constantly on the edge and will snap out of it eventually. This movement should not exist basically, cause it does no good.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42437797" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42437797" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xyzzy4747</span><span>|</span><a href="#42437544">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42438027">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42429585">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42437797">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42437797">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This forum site for example actively encourages and supports people who want to commit suicide: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sanctioned-suicide.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sanctioned-suicide.net&#x2F;</a><p>Many of their members have died after encouraging each other to take the next step.

We vote for constituency MPs, and if there are enough of them who can agree to form a government, that is what they do. Political parties are not, particularly, even essential to the process. They just speed it up.<p>A big chunk of why we have a Labour government this time round is Tory constituencies deciding to tactically vote Lib Dem because a Labour candidate would be less likely to gain a majority, after all.

You only have to look, for example, at polls saying a majority of Leave voters would now support closer ties with Europe to resolve problems caused by Brexit. What happened is simple: people chose to have a <i>functional</i> government, which neither the Tories of 2024 or Reform could possibly offer.

People prefer to interact with people who are similar to them, so they end up with a belief that most people are like them, but as a teacher, I had to grapple with the full distribution of human intelligence. It&#x27;s wider than I&#x27;m comfortable with. Most people struggle to deal with the complexity of everyday life in the twenty-first century.<p>My grandparents used to fall for every scam phone call or email they received. It wasn&#x27;t until I showed them a compilation[0] of the George Agdgdgwngo character from Fonejacker - and the rest of my extended family sat around laughing at the ridiculous scenarios - that my grandparents realised that giving their bank details to anyone claiming to be calling from Microsoft and then expecting the bank to refund them their money wasn&#x27;t an acceptable way to handle their financial affairs. In the end, they disabled their Internet banking and now have to catch a bus to their nearest bank branch to do anything.<p>I&#x27;m sure there will be flurry of Americans along shortly to monotonously repeat that quote about not trading freedom for security. That&#x27;s their political tradition, not ours. The people of Thetford in Norfolk don&#x27;t give a flying fuck about the gold statue of Thomas Paine that the Federalist Society (or some other group, I&#x27;m not terribly interested in which it was) put up in their town, but they love the fact that a sitcom about the Second World War was filmed there.<p>Someone else will make a joke about police officers investigating tweets. That practice - which was put to an end a couple of years ago - stemmed from a particular interpretation of a law that required police forces to investigate all threats of violence made by post, that was enacted in the 1980s during a period of increased religiously-motivated terrorism. The following decade brought the negotiations that put an end to that terrorism; negotiations that were the culmination of nearly five centuries of religious conflict. It is much harder to make glib assertions that principles are more important than physical safety when the violence happens in your city.<p>I shall leave it to others to make the usual accusations about who funded the aforementioned terrorism.<p>The Online Safety Act is vague and non-specific. Social media platforms differentiate themselves in the market on the bases of: with whom users can interact (people they know personally or the user base at large); and the ways in which they can interact (photos, videos, comments, likes, <i>&amp;c.</i>). Each platform therefore poses its own unique set of risks to its user base, and so needs to have its own unique regulations. The Act acknowledges by empowering Ofcom to negotiate the specific policies that platforms will need to follow on a platform-by-platform basis. And if those policies should turn out to be too strict, and a few social media companies should find it no longer profitable to operate in the United Kingdom, that is not all that much of an issue for His Majesty&#x27;s Government. They&#x27;re not British companies, after all.<p>You can&#x27;t talk about the Forbidden Meatballs[1] on Reddit or HN. In the 90s, AOL users from Scunthorpe and Penistone were banned from user forums for telling the community where they lived to help diagnose their connectivity issues. Americans have enforced - and continue to enforce - their cultural norms on the entire Anglophone web, and now the rest of the world has started to do the same. I have much greater faith in my government to protect my freedom of speech (no matter how much I may object to their policies) than some foreign company.<p>For those who are concerned that they will have to engage a solicitor to write reams of policies for their small Mastodon instance, need I remind you how utterly half-arsed everything in this country is? &#x27;Maximum effect for minimum effort and cost&#x27; has been the guiding principle of all government in Britain for decades - it&#x27;s how Britain ruled its Empire, it&#x27;s what drove the Thirteen Colonies to rebel, it&#x27;s why the East India Company was allowed to rule a subcontinent, it&#x27;s why many of the former colonies were given independence despite not wanting it, it&#x27;s why the roads are so consistently bad, it&#x27;s why the water companies are dumping sewage into rivers, it&#x27;s why there aren&#x27;t enough police officers.<p>To anyone who thinks that regulating social media is some sort of prelude to a totalitarian state, I suggest you watch Britons at a traffic-light-controlled pedestrian crossing. This isn&#x27;t the end of the world; it&#x27;s not going to lead to any social changes of any sort at all. The Act requires protections for free speech, after all. When it&#x27;s all finally implemented, it&#x27;ll just be enforcement of social norms that no one finds controversial.<p>NB: I read through the Act to see whether an idea for a social media platform was still a viable business idea, and apart from sending policy documents to Ofcom, it wouldn&#x27;t require the business to do anything that wasn&#x27;t already in that idea. If you want to argue about what the Act requires, I will expect you to have read the Act[2].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=R9biM_ZfIdo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=R9biM_ZfIdo</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesco.com&#x2F;groceries&#x2F;en-GB&#x2F;products&#x2F;282049626" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesco.com&#x2F;groceries&#x2F;en-GB&#x2F;products&#x2F;282049626</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legislation.gov.uk&#x2F;ukpga&#x2F;2023&#x2F;50&#x2F;contents" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legislation.gov.uk&#x2F;ukpga&#x2F;2023&#x2F;50&#x2F;contents</a></div><br/><div id="42434096" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42434096" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Zak</span><span>|</span><a href="#42429806">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42429912">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42434096">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42434096">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>For those who are concerned that they will have to engage a solicitor to write reams of policies for their small Mastodon instance, need I remind you how utterly half-arsed everything in this country is?</i><p>The problem is that it&#x27;s very easy to selectively enforce this sort of thing.

It was the Americans who copied that piece of legislation and wrote God&#x27;s name at the top.

The republic that replaced him was worse, so we restored the monarchy. We solve the problem in front of us - there&#x27;s no need to solve every problem ever right now.<p>&gt; Oh so the hope is just that the government is too ineffectual to prosecute something they&#x27;re completely within their rights to prosecute?

What&#x27;s to say your Conservative Party doesn&#x27;t use this to target prominent supporters of Labour, or vice versa?<p>The government (i.e., the Cabinet and other Ministers of the Crown) have no direct control over the implementation of this legislation; that is delegated to Ofcom, a regulatory body that answers to Parliament as a whole. Any attempt to seize control of Ofcom would require legislation, which would be heavily scrutinised by the House of Lords (which is not elected, and therefore is only weakly influenced by party whips) and would also have to gain Royal Assent, which would probably be refused if the legislation were seen to weaken British democracy.<p>&gt; As an American (the horror, I know, that I deign to comment on something British), I&#x27;d love to know where your freedom of speech is codified and what a government would have to do if they wanted to change what counts as speech, what doesn&#x27;t, and what&#x27;s protected and what isn&#x27;t. I suspect that you and I have very different definitions of what qualifies as free speech.<p>Absolute freedom of speech is only granted to parliamentarians <i>when speaking in Parliament</i>. The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into British law; Article 10 of the Convention provides for a general right to freedom of expression, but permits certain restrictions. Prior to the Human Rights Act, there was no general freedom of speech; instead everything that was not specifically prohibited was allowed.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bill_of_Rights_1689" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bill_of_Rights_1689</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42437710" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42437710" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kiratp</span><span>|</span><a href="#42429806">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42435506">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42434980">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42437710">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42437710">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; And if those policies should turn out to be too strict, and a few social media companies should find it no longer profitable to operate in the United Kingdom, that is not all that much of an issue for His Majesty&#x27;s Government.

It will lead to many sites simply blocking adult communities entirely for economic reasons, a part of society that is already subject to substantial discrimination from UK authorities.<p>The Act does <i>not</i> include meaningful provisions for free speech. The Ofcom guidance simply says that people should be mindful of it, with no enforcement whatsoever. It is still the case that, given the penalties for not taking down illegal speech, platforms are much safer taking down much more speech than previously. Ofcom&#x27;s consultation responses on their &quot;proportionality&quot; show they have taken a view that the actions are proportional because Ofcom say they are proportional, and no actual work has been done to demonstrate that.<p>You say that the UK is not a totalitarian state because it&#x27;s half assed.

My perspective on this is that if you can&#x27;t effectively moderate your social media platform in accordance with the social norms of your users&#x27; surrounding social context, then you shouldn&#x27;t be operating a social media platform, and if you strongly disagree with your users&#x27; social context (e.g., users in, say, Iran), then you shouldn&#x27;t offer your platform to them.<p>Also, commercial social media platforms are increasingly disinterested in providing open APIs, anyway.<p>&gt; You say that the UK is not a totalitarian state because it&#x27;s half assed.

You are (like the government) pre-supposing that is the case and basing your whole argument upon that.<p>As for Offense speech&#x2F;Free speech. What constitutes what is and isn&#x27;t offensive is subjective. That is why people argue for a free speech standard.

This legilsation is supported by parents who would like their children to be able to use the internet, all of it, without any effort on their part to police their children&#x27;s online habits. There are many parents who give their kids smartphones at 10 years old, or younger, and create Google and Facebook&#x2F;Insta accounts with fake ages for their kids to use, and let them at it. No supervision, no discussion, no parental controls. This renders any action on the part of the tech companies moot, as parents are <i>proving</i> that their pre-teen kids are adults by providing false information. Kids then go online, go into Snapchat or whatever, cue torrent of DPs and grooming. Quelle surprise!<p>Schools in the UK spend an inordinate amount of time dealing with this, and in almost every case it turns out parents have no idea what their kids are sending&#x2F;seeing online.<p>So the result is that bad parents demand bad legislation so that they can, in their minds, transfer responsibility for parenting their kids to the state. The state, well meaning rather than malicious, massively overreaches in its attempt to provide an answer. As a result everyone else suffers.

For a sovereign country, tax money is not what a country (in general) or the state (in particular) needs. This is apparent when you note that tax is destroyed on collection (that is, it reduces the balance sheet measure of issued money). A monetarily sovereign state can create whatever money it needs on demand, which any 10 year old will point out when asking why the gov can&#x27;t just buy whatever it wants.<p>The purpose of tax in this context is to reduce the propensity to consume by the payer (allowing the state to purchase it). Since the wealthy have a lower marginal propensity to consume, tax from them is worth less per unit.<p>Moreover, the value of someone is their contribution. As I said, there are plenty of people with lots of money that contribute little in real terms and still live lavish lifestyles. The best that can be said of tax in that context is that they might be living slightly less lavish lifestyles than otherwise, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t make them more useful.<p>The point of what I&#x27;m saying is that you have very little power with your wallet. You do have power when you leave to remove your skills, which should doubtless be of concern, but people in general have an out-of-date understanding of their financial use to a country (which includes the politicians, so your rhetoric still carries some weight).</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42429811" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42429811" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">frikskit</span><span>|</span><a href="#42429428">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42429650">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42434899">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42429692">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42429811">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42429811">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Where do you want to go, I’m curious?!

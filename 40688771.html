On his fourth expedition, he died of a heart attack in his cabin while the ship was at anchor.  This was in 1922.  The ship itself stayed in service for various purposes until in 1962, it sank off the coast of Canada (the crew all survived).  Now the wreck has been found, which is cool.  But for those of us who only half remembered the Shackleton story, no it wasn&#x27;t like Shackleton himself was aboard the ship when it sank.  Shackleton had already been deceased for 40 years at that time.</div><br/><div id="40695014" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40695014" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pico303</span><span>|</span><a href="#40694947">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40695014">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40695014">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Was he ever successful?

His expeditions to the Antarctic failed their objectives. His business ventures were never successful. And he died in debt.<p>BUT. He successfully sailed one of the greatest and most perilous ocean journeys ever in recorded history, and rescued every member of his 28-man crew from certain death.<p>Funny in a cruel way. The world basically forgot about the voyage of the James Caird shortly after he returned home, since WWI had broken out during his time in Antarctica. He wasn&#x27;t adequately recognized in his lifetime.

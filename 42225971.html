I would argue that the real problem is the maniac humans.<p>Having said that, it&#x27;s obviously not ideal. Surely there are various approaches to at least mitigate some of this. Maybe eventually actual interpretable neural circuits or another architecture.<p>Maybe another LLM and&#x2F;or other system that doesn&#x27;t even see the instructions from the user and tries to stop the other one if it seems to be going off the rails. One of the safety systems could be rules-based rather than a neutral network, possibly incorporating some kind of physics simulations.<p>But even if we come up with effective safeguards, they might be removed or disabled.. androids could be used to commit crimes anonymously if there isn&#x27;t some system for registering them.. or at least an effort at doing that since I&#x27;m sure criminals would work around it if possible. But it shouldn&#x27;t be easy.<p>Ultimately you won&#x27;t be able to entirely stop motivated humans from misusing these things.. but you can make it inconvenient at least.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

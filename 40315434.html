They&#x27;ll let you do outlandish things, but given the assignment of &quot;tell a cohesive story&quot; they manage to corral the story back to something sensible unless the player intentionally keeps pushing at the boundary (in which case they probably do want things to go off the rails)<p>b) LLMs can do delightfully colorful dialogue, they just need to be grounded in a character.

But my point was that there are people who yearn for a good story, and a good story doesn&#x27;t have many options in it, otherwise the story&#x27;s beats would become meaningless.<p>Hmm. Maybe with this the problem Rockstar has with their linear missions mixed with open world could be fixed - i.e. the open world NPCs can react in story missions to what you&#x27;ve done free roam.

In the series, there is a VR video game called “World of Supers” where players can type in any superpower they can dream of into a game-master LLM, and the LLM will then create a character for them which has that power, but reworked a little bit to fit into game balance.  For example, the player could type “I can stop time and still move around and take actions for up to 90 seconds” and the game-master LLM may approve this power but alter 90 seconds to 10 seconds, and give the player a major weakness, such as “However, stopping time in the vicinity of a gamma ray source will result in immediate loss of 75% of HP due to the interaction of the time stop with the radiation’s effects.  This HP loss can be mitigated if you are encased in a significant amount of lead, such as a lead vehicle or heavy lead armor.”  It&#x27;s a pretty neat concept for how LLMs could allow custom player abilities while maintaining game balance.  That way, player agency extends to actual powers&#x2F;abilities, not just dialogue.</div><br/><div id="40316038" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40316038" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">idle_zealot</span><span>|</span><a href="#40315879">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40316273">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40316038">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40316038">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That would of course require an LLM to <i>understand</i> game balance, as opposed to just writing things that sound like they might balance a hypothetical game. At that point it&#x27;s less similar to our LLMs and more like an AGI. And at that point we may as well have it create the neurotech necessary for the sort of VR tech I assume is used in the referenced books&#x27; world.</div><br/><div id="40316060" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40316060" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">upwardbound</span><span>|</span><a href="#40315879">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40316038">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40316273">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40316060">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40316060">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Agree. This point is a big concern and is explored in the stories (the protagonist creates a &quot;mad scientist&quot; character that can use the LLM to invent new equipment, and then uses a lot of trial and error to find prompts that generate insanely overpowered equipment).  It sounds fun to play though!  Balance doesn&#x27;t have to be .. well .. balanced if there are other ways to maintain fun, such as leaning heavily into the creativity &amp; self-actualization angle.  As an example, if I could have any superpower in real life, I&#x27;d love to be able to fly, even though that&#x27;s actually a very weak power compared to things like teleporting that are mostly a superset of flying, but not as fun and whimsical.<p>Encouraging &quot;living your dream&quot; rather than being the most powerful might be easier to achieve in a game with coop or open-world objectives rather than one focused on PvP, but if &quot;living your dream&quot; could be compelling made into the primary player objective, it would pair very well with the custom powers mechanic envisioned in the story.<p>As an example of how this is explored in the story, one of the protagonist&#x27;s friends who loves surfing has a character whose superpower is &quot;the ability to surf <i>anything</i>&quot;.  It&#x27;s an extremely weak power but the character really loves it because they get to surf the most extreme things imaginable, just for the fun of it, including in outlandish scenarios such as surfing along the blast wave of an explosion, or even the beam of a laser - silly stuff that is fun to explore &amp; try.<p>I think it wouldn&#x27;t have to be VR to be fun - imagine if it was something like a Roblox-based game played on laptops.  Even then, the &quot;surf anything&quot; power and other outlandish powers would be incredibly fun to use.  Imagine if you could do almost anything!  You don&#x27;t have to be the most powerful player in the world to have fun.  Maybe you just <i>really</i> want to pilot a mecha-Godzilla, or something - even though an Iron Man or Thor level super could smash it in seconds.

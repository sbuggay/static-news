They all might fire, depending on the timing, and whether or not they are… I don’t know biology, charged or whatever. The whole system works under the assumption that many complements will mis-fire or be duds are any moment.<p>It seems (to me at least) more reasonable, to come to the conclusion that the DK neuron is really a DK neuron, if removing it causes an un-recoverable DK related failure… because the whole system is based around handling failures!

The main point of that section is that you&#x27;ve got to be careful about what you define as a &#x27;function&#x27;. In the processor case, if you defined function in terms of a register or instruction working properly, then this approach could actually give you a pretty good map. But if you&#x27;ve defined it as whether a particular game runs, it doesn&#x27;t give you a good map at all, because most games exercise most functions of the microprocessor, and so which small parts aren&#x27;t important to that particular game is only incidental. With brains the main thing is the underlying functions are not really known, so you need to approach with care.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41842219" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41842219" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fastaguy88</span><span>|</span><a href="#41841391">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41840331">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41842219">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41842219">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I am always puzzled when biologists make analogies between living systems (or sub-systems) and human-designed devices (even complex devices).  Human designed devices have an essential property that biological systems do not -- they were designed.  While radios may seem complex, they are built from a relatively small number of component types with very well understood behaviors and typically limited numbers of interactions.  Biological systems have no such constraints -- they were not designed, there can be many different ways to do the same thing (in the same cell), there are at least thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of different components, many of which have lots and lots of interactions.  Considering how messy the systems are, it is quite remarkable that genetics and biochemistry discovered the basis of heredity (or at least some of it), the genetic code, hundreds of signaling pathways, etc etc.  But there is no missing language, because there was no design that used that language.</div><br/><div id="41844224" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41844224" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">minifridge</span><span>|</span><a href="#41842219">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41843314">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41844224">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41844224">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Biological systems have also designs that emerged through evolution. Although the complexity may seem at different scales, the main difference is the measurements you can do. Both biological and electrical circuits are dynamic systems that have designs that gives them emergent functional properties.<p>As the article describes imagine having the list of radio components instead only instead of their topology (wiring diagram). The problem of figuring out how a radio works with this information, if youbknow little about their design, becomes quite similar with how figuring out how a biological system works.<p>The absence of a design diagram and our inability to measure components at the molecular level without disturbing the state of a system is the main reason bilogical systems are so challenging to understand.</div><br/><div id="41844407" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41844407" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fastaguy88</span><span>|</span><a href="#41842219">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41844224">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41843314">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41844407">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41844407">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I am a bit more comfortable saying &quot;Biological systems also have &#x27;solutions&#x27; that emerged through evolution.&quot;  That is certainly true. But unlike designers, evolution is perfectly happy to re-invent the wheel (even if it is a less functional wheel).  So different, evolutionarily independent, processes may provide the same solution, and of course solutions are constantly re-used to provide slightly different solutions.  So I&#x27;m not sure that &quot;complexity&quot; is the hardest problem, though it certainly doesn&#x27;t make things easy.

It is an ultra low cost design, and it can be built in a way that essentially takes up no extra space in your apartment, because the gantry is removable and the bed is a thin sheet of plywood which you can cover with a rug when the system is not in use.
The concept works but in my case the gantry gets a bit sticky and I lose steps, so it needs to be refined. However I have basically abandoned the project. I would love for people to use it as inspiration for future versions:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tlalexander&#x2F;large_format_laser_cutter">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tlalexander&#x2F;large_format_laser_cutter</a><p>I never finished making the youtube video for it, but I have a partially completed video that lacks a voiceover or proper edits for the second half.

Both diode and tube lasers can instantly blind you. But diode lasers can be a pain to block - because they’re in the visible spectrum you need specialized blocking materials that are opaque in that very specific part of the visible spectrum. Worse still, many have leakage into other frequencies, making them even more difficult to block. On the flip side, a co2 tube is much simpler - some common and readily available plastics transparent to visible light are opaque to the IR wavelengths emitted by co2 tubes, dramatically simplifying blocking material selection.<p>You should never operate any sort of cutting laser without an enclosure and safety goggles, and it’s MUCH easier to do this for co2 lasers.</div><br/><div id="39152848" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39152848" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">msds</span><span>|</span><a href="#39152593">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39152867">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39152848">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39152848">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I second this; this is super bad advice. CO2 systems are comparatively safe from an eye damage perspective - unless you take a direct hit, (...don&#x27;t, seriously, that&#x27;s what interlocks are for...), 10.6um is strongly absorbed by your eye and you&#x27;ll get superficial thermal damage, maybe cataracts or a corneal burn, but it won&#x27;t get focused on to your retina so serious vision loss is unlikely. Polycarbonate safety glasses have a crazy high optical density at 10.6 and are suitable protective eyewear.<p>The situation for visible diode lasers is much worse. Sure, the power tends to be lower, but they&#x27;re still powerful enough that looking at a diffuse reflection will result in dangerous power densities on your retina. Unfortunately, the brain is really good at hiding this sort of damage, so it&#x27;s possible to not notice until it&#x27;s too late.<p>1.064um fiber lasers are the worst of both worlds. Very high powers, invisible so you have no idea how much stray light is getting out or if you&#x27;re staring at a reflection, and expensive + hard to verify safety glasses.<p>I like doing things with high power lasers (next up for the collection is probably a 355nm ns system?), but am glad that I had to take a lot of laser safety training before I bough my first big laser source.</div><br/><div id="39152860" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39152860" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacquesm</span><span>|</span><a href="#39152593">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39152848">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39152867">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39152860">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39152860">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ah yes, these are very good points.

You won&#x27;t be making watches with this, but a mechanical clock with wooden gears is well within the realm of the possible and your accuracy will be <i>much</i> better than that of the best woodworker using non-CNC tooling.</div><br/><div id="39152730" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39152730" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jfoutz</span><span>|</span><a href="#39152298">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39152624">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39152602">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39152730">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39152730">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I thought of an analogy a moment ago, and I want to use it.<p>Drag racing has a super stock category, which is pretty much a normal car you buy and then mess with. Some folks are sponsored, but generally sponsorships are in the thousands of dollars range, not the millions, like pro funny car or top fuel would have. Most of the budget comes from folk&#x27;s wallets and maybe winnings.<p>There are race car drivers, there are race car mechanics, and sometimes they&#x27;re both the same person. Any _good_ driver is going to have some idea about how to turn a wrench. Any _good_ mechanic is going to have taken a few runs, and the fear of death rules out that particular career choice.<p>I think your point about the material is a good one. I think, that might also be a &quot;level 2&quot; skill. I think there is a huge amount of stuff to do to get a real sense of what CNC can do, and what a given person is able to do with a given setup. super beginner stuff like, what do I click to make the run go? is it connected right? What&#x27;s a spline? Why is the enclosure orange? Just the safety stuff alone is pretty intense. And like, engaging the safety squint isn&#x27;t going to help at all.<p>I&#x27;m very much an advocate for getting the shitty version to learn on. Maybe I learn bad practices, but I find I REALLY appreciate good tools. I have the tools I have because I finally understood what I needed and why it needed to be that way. Some of the tools in the box rarely get touched, but they&#x27;re good enough when I need them.<p>Sorry to ramble at you, I guess I just needed to get that out.<p>_edit_<p>and of course, you&#x27;re the author of the article.

But you probably already knew that. You <i>could</i> retrofit it onto an existing machine but by the time you&#x27;re done it would cost more than the original and the improvement would be too small to notice. While we&#x27;re at it let&#x27;s throw in servos and focus compensation as well as a movable Z axis... But now the machine is priced out of hobbyist territory. An aluminum open frame machine like this is not aimed at industry and so should come with lesser expectations. It doesn&#x27;t even compensate for thermal expansion of the frame.<p>The belts are usually quite good in quality, contrary to your assertion belt drives do not accumulate backlash (though they will have some it is more or less constant as long as you don&#x27;t lose steps, which normally should not happen), have a Kevlar component in them to remove a lot of the stretch issues that you&#x27;d have with cheaper belts and either the gantry is moved with two steppers or there is a cross gantry shaft which operates a passive gear (without a motor) on the other side. Obviously this isn&#x27;t perfect, the shaft is long enough that it will see some torsion so when moving fast one side will lag a bit and when you come to a sudden stop you&#x27;ll see some overshoot. But even at very high speeds and long series of repetitions (100&#x27;s) I&#x27;ve yet to see any backlash or &#x27;slop&#x27; that is visible or measurable with the tools that I currently have at my disposal. This is funny because I totally expected to find a measurable positioning error but given a nice micrometer I find the positioning error when the machine comes to a stop after many 100&#x27;s of meters of travel to be &lt; 0.1 mm and positioning error from the origin to any point on the machine to be well within the acceptable.<p>The thing that you <i>will</i> notice is that because of the open construction of the frames that the machines aren&#x27;t going to be square &#x27;out of the box&#x27;, and you&#x27;ll spend quite a bit of time getting them to be just so.<p>I don&#x27;t have access to an interferometer but if I can get my hands on one for bit by borrowing one somewhere I&#x27;ll do some measurements on it but for now my simple tests suffice to show that the machine is quite usable and produces output that is dimensionally accurate to the point that it makes zero sense to farm out jobs to professional laser cutting services.<p>If I were cutting metal (which you won&#x27;t be doing with a diode laser for obvious reasons) it would be a different matter, but even there in sheet cutting the tolerances on larger work are different than they are with for instance a mill or a lathe. You won&#x27;t be making any press-fit shafts with a machine like this, nor will you be cutting gears with 1 mm teeth. For that kind of work it just isn&#x27;t the right tool, and lasercutting isn&#x27;t the right process. If you want that kind of precision in sheetmetal you would probably either use a mill (but then your workpieces will likely be small) or you&#x27;d etch your workpiece after a photographic process to create a mask.<p>When working in wood, cardboard or textile the precision that these cheap machines offer is ample.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39153826" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39153826" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fmajid</span><span>|</span><a href="#39152298">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39153801">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39153826">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39153826">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I am primarily interested in engraving metals, so I got a 18W fiber laser with a galvo head (laser is deflected by mirrors mounted on magnetic mounts like those on old analog multimeters, much faster than moving the laser head on a gantry).</div><br/></div></div><div id="39153801" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39153801" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">reacharavindh</span><span>|</span><a href="#39153826">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39152300">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39153801">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39153801">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wish the CNC machines with a router instead of the laser became more standardised, and available to buy off of AMAZON  and made in a “it just works” territory.<p>The choices are either DIY ones off aliexpress or the more expensive ones like Shapeoko.</div><br/><div id="39153853" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39153853" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacquesm</span><span>|</span><a href="#39153801">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39152300">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39153853">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39153853">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The laser cutters are usually also sold as a kit rather than assembled.<p>There are quite a few of these:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aliexpress.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;wholesale-cnc-router.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aliexpress.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;wholesale-cnc-router.html</a><p>Quality is all over the place and given the fact that they have a tool that creates backpressure (and that sometimes wants to &#x27;climb&#x27; the workpiece depending on the direction of the cut) any kind of imperfection in the mechanism will immediately show up on the work product.<p>I posted a DIY one the other day that I think is pretty neat <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instructables.com&#x2F;LOW-COST-DIY-500-CNC-MILL&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instructables.com&#x2F;LOW-COST-DIY-500-CNC-MILL&#x2F;</a> .<p>I don&#x27;t think anything you buy of Ali or Amazon in this price range will ever be in &#x27;it just works&#x27; territory, neither laser nor mill.

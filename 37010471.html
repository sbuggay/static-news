He then told me something I&#x27;ve never forgotten. He said, &quot;Son, you be sure to set your goals so high that you can&#x27;t possibly accomplish them in one lifetime. That way you&#x27;ll always have something ahead of you. I made the mistake of setting my goals too low and now I&#x27;m having a hard time coming up with new ones.”</i><p>His father ended up dying early and right in the midst of trying to sell his company out of fear, which the son Ted Turner wanted to run.<p>I think his father was basically right in that you shouldn’t set limits on your goals, as you just might achieve them all and not know what to do with yourself. Getting stuck in a local maximum is a very real risk for most people.<p>It’s better to adopt a mindset that accepts the fact that you won’t quite get everything you want, but what you do get will be vastly more than if you had just settled and “sacrificed for”, to use the author’s term. It’s more of a process-oriented outlook than a goal-achievement one.</div><br/><div id="37045642" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37045642" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">saiya-jin</span><span>|</span><a href="#37045343">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37045878">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37045642">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37045642">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have to agree, I don&#x27;t fulfill my dreams anymore (since they were pretty abstract to begin with), but rather have goals and just tick them.

Even though I trained for it for past 6 months, the goal is not going away, just postponed (2nd time, first time broke 3 bones in my foot, I am no stranger to similar disappointments). Working on other goals in the meantime, adding&#x2F;removing them continuously (finish getting motorbike license, progressing on paragliding, improving my french, kids &amp; family etc).<p>Also, being parent and raising kids, there is endless stream of goals for solid 2 decades (and then some more) if you want to tell yourself you are a good parent and not end up with deep regrets and whys later. With a right mindset, you see goals everywhere just waiting for your interest, and end up realizing life is damn too short.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37045878" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37045878" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thyrsus</span><span>|</span><a href="#37045343">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37043820">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37045878">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37045878">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Before reading the article, I imagined myself asking that question, and it was the rude or exasperated version of &quot;What must I do for you?&quot; (to make you stop bugging me).

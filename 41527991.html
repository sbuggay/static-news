From the facts in this post, I&#x27;d reach the following speculation: the creators have a contract that entitles them to vote on certain types of company action, a share of 50% of the revenue, and potentially representation of their votes in the form of one or two of the existing board seats. Essentially there being some company bylaws in place to enact that &quot;ownership&quot; mechanism.<p>This would match what Standard have said about the setup, would match the Wendover documentary and its reference to &quot;wizardwry&quot; making it all work, and provide for input from creators and revenue to creators. Combining this with the phantom stock and how a sale would be handled, I think calling this &quot;ownership&quot; when summing it up in a single word for the purposes of a YouTube advert is... uncontroversial?<p>The alternative would be having each creator on the cap table, and my understanding is that is actually quite tricky to do at scale, and brings significant legal and tax implications for the creators and Nebula.<p>While this is all very interesting, and I appreciate the blog post, I do wonder if the answer here just boring.</div><br/><div id="41528836" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41528836" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sitharus</span><span>|</span><a href="#41528303">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41528827">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41528836">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41528836">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s definitely an interesting solution to a very similar problem I was looking at a few years ago - how to take on external investment in a co-operative company.<p>I&#x27;m not in the US, so I can&#x27;t comment on the options for Nebula, but where I live coops are a specific type of legal company which would encompass what Nebula want - a company where profit is divided between members in proportion to their contribution.

Sam and the other founders are creators who&#x27;ve put a ton of work and resources into Nebula. They&#x27;ve made awesome original content like Jetlag and have invested heavily to support other creators on the platform. Nebula gives budgets for creators to produce their own shows, and they get a share of the revenue from subscribers they bring in—I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they earn from views too. So saying it&#x27;s misleading doesn&#x27;t sit right with me. Creators on Nebula definitely get a bigger piece of the pie compared to other platforms. It might not be a perfect co-op, but it&#x27;s way more creator-friendly than most out there.</div><br/><div id="41528484" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41528484" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gautampk</span><span>|</span><a href="#41528475">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41528606">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41528484">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41528484">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It &#x2F;is&#x2F; misleading to say or imply that it is a co-op, though.

But I think what&#x27;s important is how much Nebula does to empower creators compared to other platforms. The founders are creators who&#x27;ve invested a lot to make it a place where content makers get more support and a bigger share of the revenue. Even if it&#x27;s not a co-op, it still feels like a step in the right direction for giving creators more control and benefits than they&#x27;d get elsewhere.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41528606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41528606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ParadisoShlee</span><span>|</span><a href="#41528475">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41528660">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41528606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41528606">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re saying standard has the fiscal responsibility of their entirely company?!<p>Give dave an award for being awesome and running a successful company with a single investor.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41528660" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41528660" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rambobambo</span><span>|</span><a href="#41528606">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41528660">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41528660">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How to create a similar site for my local community?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

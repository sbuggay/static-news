Or you can keep ironing out the quirks.<p>I&#x27;ve &quot;shipped&quot; things in the past that were turned on to less than 1% of the time, and we left it at that, and moved on to other things.

I worked at a medium sized company which is known for having a good culture.

The entire team, including manager, just gone one day. Not for financial reasons, but because they were “not performing well.” (There were multiple people on the team who had consistently good performance reviews.)<p>I spent a fair amount of time trying to figure out why that happened. Obviously if that could happen to them (fired despite good feedback), it could happen to anyone.<p>As far as I could tell, it’s because the CEO or CTO didn’t think the type of work they were doing was worth doing, and also didn’t think they were making a difference.<p>It’s good to be a self-starter, to advocate for best practices, and to keep users in mind. But at the end of the day, if that doesn’t fit into what your bosses expect from you, you’re done.<p>That’s why it’s important to communicate with stakeholders. Your boss needs to understand why spending time on preventative maintenance pays dividends on the long run. You can’t spend 75% of your time on stuff that doesn&#x27;t look productive (which is subjective) and also not be proactive in being on the same page as your stakeholders about what’s important.

I&#x27;ve been around these trenches long enough to have seen the dark side of &#x27;shipping&#x27; strategies.<p>Rarely in large enterprise environments are projects greenfields. The new system is often there to replace some existing Line of Business system.<p>Inthese cases the pervers but common shipping strategy is:<p>1. freeze all maintainance and evolution of the existing system. Seems reasonable until you realize that these enterprise projects are multi year calendar endeavours and the business will not stop changing during that time. The idea is not realy to halt all development, just to inctease the friction of getting anything done on the now declared &#x27;legacy&#x27; system above an administrative pain threshold.<p>2. Commandeer all the IT staff to serve on the &#x27;new&#x27; system&#x27;s project team and overwhelm them with tasks. Make sure they remember any time spend on the &#x27;legacy&#x27; (keep hammering in that term) codebase is basically waisting time assuring you&#x27;ll end up at the bottom of the corporate dinosaur tar pit at best.<p>3. Force they &#x27;new&#x27; system into production long before it is ready. Use all the leverage you build from point 1 to promise &#x27;going forward&#x27;. When essential gaps to support the business are pointed out en mass week1, reverse the tables and intigate a very heavy administrative process demanding proof that the lacking functionality is actually required with a full ROI breakdown coutering your handwoven 3 minute overinflated guestimate for implementation. Again, you know essentials are missing, you are just trying to gain time as the longer you can stay deployed the higher the chance you will.<p>This process is very destructive to not just the business, but also moral of most involved. Most projects taking this scorched earth shipping strategy fail regardless.

I&#x27;m going to pull out one point out of many that made me think:<p>&gt; Project competence. You want to aim for something like a NASA mission control vibe<p>Having read a little about early Apollo-era (and earlier) mission control this was a fun comparison. The astronauts and flight controllers had <i>no idea</i> what they were doing! There was no textbook – they were performing a human first. They were generally young and very cocky people hired out of university, but were successful anyway, for some reasons, including:<p>1. They were further culled through harsh adversarial simulation training. This made sure only those that could cut it came out the other end.<p>2. They approached each new mission phase with a trial mission, each time extending the envelope in a controlled manner. (The cowboy moon touchdown on Apollo 11? It&#x27;s often described as the first moon landing, but it really wasn&#x27;t. It was just a test to see if they could reach the surface and get back up. The real first precision landing came on Apollo 12. Oh, but that was also just a rehearsal for the first scientific mission on Apollo 14, etc.)<p>3. They were fluid in how they organised themselves, and allowed mission needs to dictate which positions existed, rather than trying to impose a hierarchy onto a mission.<p>Going back to shipping, we can squint and look at this as:<p>1. Fake it, either until you make it or get tossed out.<p>2. Prefer to ship many smaller things than one big thing. This builds confidence in your abilities, gets you experience shipping things, and allows you more feedback to adjust to what the real project is.<p>3.

A project grows the same way an embryo grows into a full animal: it does so in millions of tiny parts that overlap in discrete ways to produce a continuous spectrum of development.  I think some good additional milestones to measure that kind of development might be as follows:<p>* Your first bug report that you file against yourself which you fix yourself.  Your project is stable enough to be usable with a known bug, but you go back and fix that bug when you have time to dedicate to it.  Contrast with nothing working until everything works.<p>* Your first time seeing someone find a flaw that lies so far out of your own mental model of the project that it causes a very jarring feeling, hopefully followed by excitement that the project is now taking on a life of its own outside you &#x2F; your team as the sole developers and users.  An example of this might be someone filing a bug that image rendering is missing from a git visualisation tool where you’d never even considered using it for projects with version controlled image assets.<p>I feel like there’s an analogy here to a baby’s first detectable heartbeat and a child’s first original that-never-occurred-to-me thought.

A lot of more junior engineers are likely to work on a large project, and they will inevitably need guidance to satisfy the constraints of other parts of the system. You are responsible for knowing those constraints and, as much as possible, preventing mismatches when different components come together.<p>Meanwhile, the non technical staff (whether it&#x27;s a manager or someone from the sales team, documentation team, customer support team, etc) are going to need someone who can explain the technical system to them in plain language. &quot;Can it do this? How fast? Why can&#x27;t it do this?&quot; You tend to become their main interlocutor.<p>It&#x27;s kind of your job to anticipate problems before they happen, to look into the future so you see what&#x27;s coming and solve it in advance, and then to show up <i>all the time</i> when something needs help around launch, which it always does. It&#x27;s very undefined but there&#x27;s always something that needs doing.<p>This role doesn&#x27;t sit well with some engineers who think their job is basically about coding and staying within their lane — those engineers don&#x27;t get to be lead dev too much, because they don&#x27;t do well with the organizational side of things. (It depends, of course, whether there is a hands-on project manager who can pick up a lot of that slack, but where I work, we don&#x27;t always have that.)<p>(Context: I have worked in a large tech company a little more than 3 years and shipped some things.

A state that can do more things, almost always just the sheer option of things they can do means they can find a better policy.<p>And yet policy arguments are just <i>so fun</i> while state capacity arguments are incredibly wonky and depressing.<p>But I&#x27;ve drawn that same diagram on 100 different whiteboards in front of 100 different juniors and said the same words of &quot;before we figure out how to do the best thing, let&#x27;s just see if we can even do a thing first&quot; and it seems to have gotten through to an appreciable number of them enough that it feels like a high converting meme.</div><br/><div id="42113030" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42113030" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">strken</span><span>|</span><a href="#42111841">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42112876">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42113030">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42113030">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think this train of thought is why I now have to deal with four UI libraries in the same small-feature-set product, including three different ways of styling a React component.<p>I think that a more accurate mental model would accept that a team sometimes has no idea whether a change will get them 80% of the way there with 20% of the effort, get them 20% of the way there with 80% of the effort, do something somewhere in the middle, have zero impact, or even make the product worse.</div><br/><div id="42113877" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42113877" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">392</span><span>|</span><a href="#42111841">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42113030">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42112876">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42113877">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42113877">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why don&#x27;t you fix it?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

My dad founded Celestron, and he operated just as Paul is describing.  At my current company, I see the CEO doing the exact same thing, which gives me great hope.  Huge contrast from my previous start-up, for which I have great anti-hope unfortunately.  (Current company is Zap Surgical Systems, with Dr. John Adler as the founder.)  I&#x27;ve seen John everywhere, all day every day.  I&#x27;ve seen him literally on his hands and knees under our robotic treatment table back in the engineering lab, discussing details with a young mechanical engineer.  And yeah, we are curing cancer ;-)<p>To re-iterate:  What I believe PaulG is saying is that there is a crucially important phenomenon that we don&#x27;t yet understand, and naming it will facilitate the process of bringing it into focus so that we can help more companies be successful.<p>His footnote has a painful resonance:  &quot;I also have another less optimistic prediction: as soon as the concept of founder mode becomes established, people will start misusing it.&quot;<p>This is exactly what has happened to the Agile methodology.</div><br/><div id="41420808" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41420808" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rawgabbit</span><span>|</span><a href="#41420253">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41420845">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41420808">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41420808">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don’t believe it is that mysterious or revolutionary. What PG is describing is the “optimization of local maximum” problem.<p>Founders focus on the strategic goal. Managers focus on tactical goals.

Only the Founder has the authority to break the bureaucratic rules.<p>My favorite example is from the film Zulu when the British quartermaster  adamantly dispenses ammo per the rule book and a long queue of desperate soldiers form up. Nevermind the British were out numbered 10 or 20 to 1 and should be firing their rifles as quickly as possible and using up all their ammo as quickly as possible.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;8xjCX_TXkyU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;8xjCX_TXkyU</a></div><br/><div id="41421393" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41421393" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">baby</span><span>|</span><a href="#41420253">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41420808">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41420845">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41421393">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41421393">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Do managers focus on tactical goals?

For starters its just hard, and tiring(and even pointless) to keep jumping over the ever increasing bar.

At that point, you let things go on autopilot and begin to reduce engagement with your work.<p>The middle managers and employees you hire don&#x27;t have incentive to even care this much.

The last 20 minutes was a performative exercise where we decided on action items for the week which we all knew were unlikely to get done.<p>The company went on like this for years after I left until they ran out of extra funds to keep the charade going. The management scattered to other “startups” where I’ve heard they’re continuing to repeat the same games.</div><br/><div id="41422555" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41422555" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">k__</span><span>|</span><a href="#41416264">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41417126">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41420616">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41422555">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41422555">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hiring is so scary.<p>If you get the wrong people in the beginning, it can throw you into a wrong trajectory that&#x27;s almost impossible to correct later.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41420616" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41420616" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jll29</span><span>|</span><a href="#41416264">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41417126">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41422555">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41420461">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41420616">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41420616">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The mangagement structure always must reflect the size and the phase(!) of the startup itself.<p>What you describe sounds like a &quot;founders just came together&quot; trying to impersonate the IBM org chart without having figured out product-market fit yet, or even earlier than that.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41420461" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41420461" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fluorinerocket</span><span>|</span><a href="#41416264">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41417126">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41420616">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41417644">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41420461">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41420461">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This sounds like my last company.<p>Was it a new space startup in the Bay area?</div><br/><div id="41422657" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41422657" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bradneuberg</span><span>|</span><a href="#41416264">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41420461">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41417644">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41422657">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41422657">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Interesting, what new space startup was that?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41417644" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41417644" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ldjkfkdsjnv</span><span>|</span><a href="#41416264">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41417126">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41420461">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41420492">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41417644">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41417644">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Honestly, the people that put in these processes are the smart ones.

As the pandemic showed with JIT supply chains, efficiency and resilience are often at odds. And the bigger you are the more resilience you want to protect your core business and let you just turn the fly wheel that’s making you profitable. That’s also why you see companies start to engage in monopolistic and anticompetitive practices - now that they have the weight they can waste resources on protecting their business instead of just growing it by being more efficient.<p>This is 100% bad from a country&#x2F;market level but is what you get when you let local optimizations trump capitalism. In some sense that local optimization also isn’t bad - it’s not uncommon that that behavior is also what lets efficiencies be extracted.<p>In other words, in many ways all of this is inevitable behavior as things grow and a lot of it are themselves (perhaps inevitable) symptoms of the mechanics at play rather than the mechanics themselves.<p>In other words, once “founder mode” is documented, you’ll have everyone claiming they’re doing founder mode same as how everyone says they’re now doing agile or whatever other fad you want to pick and you’ll be back at square one until someone then invents “strategic founder mode” or “growth founder mode” and claims to have figured out how you can spot that vs what everyone is just pretending to do right now.</div><br/><div id="41423716" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41423716" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">philwelch</span><span>|</span><a href="#41416264">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41422147">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41422318">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41423716">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41423716">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  As the pandemic showed with JIT supply chains, efficiency and resilience are often at odds.<p>I’m not convinced this is necessarily true. JIT implies making all of your buffers more obvious, and you will want to reduce unnecessary buffers to save cost, but maintaining some buffers for the sake of resilience isn’t incompatible with JIT supply chains. The problem comes when you combine short-term oriented management with JIT supply chains; if you quantify the cost of a buffer, you make it easier for that type of management to make that kind of decision.<p>Toyota, for example, is one of the firms that popularized JIT, but they don’t usually run into the same short-termist problems that afflict other firms. Relatedly, Toyota’s senior management have all spent decades if not their entire careers at Toyota and still includes members of the Toyoda family. Those guys are probably not going to play fast and loose with resiliency just to make quarterly numbers look good. They are going to look at the quantified and understood cost of their resiliency buffers and say, “removing this buffer might save lots of money next quarter but in the long run that represents a risk to a company I intend to pass down to my grandchildren so I won’t do it”. Whereas a different manager at a different company might say, “this will definitely make the next quarter’s numbers look amazing and if there are consequences in the long run, either I’ll have switched companies or I can just say it’s not my fault”.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41422318" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41422318" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Eisenstein</span><span>|</span><a href="#41416264">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41422147">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41423716">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41416959">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41422318">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41422318">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; This is 100% bad from a country&#x2F;market level but is what you get when you let local optimizations trump capitalism.

  - using the product as a user
  - occasionally looking at a few “low level” artifacts like customer support threads, slack conversations, PR reviews, or user stories.

You’re essentially doing a virtual walk-around. Imagine in a physical plant, once a week, the CEO walks around the fence perimeter, through the stock rooms, observes the gate for a few minutes, walks the factory floor inconspicuously, makes herself coffee in the back cafeteria, and uses the warehouse bathroom. While she does this she occasionally asks a question here or there, praises a good effort, and very visibly picks up a piece of trash. It’s possible to do a similar thing virtually.<p>The observations from the above activities are invaluable sources of information. You cross reference it with what your direct reports tell you. You challenge them based on your first hand observations. Ask a lot of questions, and when they can’t answer them, encourage them to also become more intimately involved in their part of the organization.<p>No single perspective is enough to understand what’s going on<p>This is not micromanagement.

HBR style says read everywhere, write only direct reports. And it makes for a good software design except that humans are not computers, but there is a shared global context - the company vision and mission.<p>Through fractal management, a visionary leader can have a better  chance to ensure that the vision is translated into practice at the various levels of detail.<p>Fractal management is only part of it, though as it is a technique, but it doesn’t cover the enormous skin in the game founders have about the success of the company. For many founders, the company is their baby(I am projecting here) and they want to make it succeed. Contrastingly, many of the professional fakers instead see it as just a job, and a step on the ladder. Principal&#x2F;agent. Without genuine care, and cohesive vision, fractal management can quickly devolve into chaos. It is high reward and also <i>higher risk</i>!!! Maybe that’s why only the founders do it but not their VPs. I wonder if any VPs at Airbnb are doing anything remotely similar to what Bryan Chesky is doing as management style?

They’re good for finding “top performers” (by definition - you define what performance looks like, score your employees on it, and the ones with the highest score are your “top performers”). I personally don’t think that’s particularly useful, and it’s almost completely useless from the perspective of trying to find up-and-coming employees, or insightful employees, or whoever else is most useful to the company at such a retreat.<p>Finding “true” top performers requires much more effort than your average mid-large company wants to spend. You need a collaborative effort between individual contributors, line managers, VPs, and the C-suite to get a good idea of who the most important people in the company are. And part of that is politics (making sure that everyone knows who you are and why you’re important) - there’s always a chance that a super critical person slips under the radar.<p>As an engineer I can tell you who the most important people in my section of the org chart are off-hand, in order of importance. As in, people without whom my org would fail, or at least flounder. Some of them are engineers, some of them are sales&#x2F;business liaison, some of them are “management” (but frequently do a hell of a lot more than “just” manage). I don’t think a traditional performance review would identify all of them as being mission-critical, but it would probably identify them all as performing at least as expected for their roles.<p>I know at least one fairly critical junior engineer[0] that maybe isn’t the fastest or most efficient worker, but is learning fast and could easily be a top-tier engineer with the right support and growth opportunities. Fortunately my company did identify this and has given them a number of opportunities (including an invite to the retreat, among many others), but a standard performance review would probably score them as “adequate” or whatever other mid-tier. The way this happened for us is frequent “skip-level” meetings, 1-1 or 1-many, as well as quarterly team retreats with all members (up to the VP) present. This allows 3 levels of employees to all interact, and if you keep on top of this as a senior manager or VP (with either an engineering background or an open mind, which all people in this scenario have) it becomes fairly straightforward to find these people. It’s not a formula, or a set of rules&#x2F;identifiers, or even some guidelines that are followed, which makes it tricky to make this “fair” - it relies on everyone involved having good judgement.<p>[0] I know “critical junior engineer” doesn’t sound great, but it’s what happens when you have a rag-tag team of engineers building a product from the ground up with minimal support from the rest of the company (and thus few resources), and then hit it big and suddenly have a largely successful product on your hands that was written by essentially 4 people. Each one of those 4 people are non-overlapping domain experts, and it just so happens that 3 of them are senior engineers and 1 is a junior. Over the last 6 months this has been improving, but a year ago, it literally was 1 critical junior engineer who was the only person who knew about 20% of the product.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41420173" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41420173" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">trunnell</span><span>|</span><a href="#41417795">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41418793">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41419355">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41418167">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41420173">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41420173">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ok, good point.

But the implementation at scale is something that I now see Sony and Xbox working toward (along with their console partners - hardware and software).<p>- Youtube, definitely, given the content base, the number of active users at literally anytime, is a monumental achievement. But so are a bunch of porn websites. And I know the porn industry doesn&#x27;t have a good rep. Even in engineering. Still, porn sees more active users than Youtube and netflix combined, albeit, on a bunch of different websites, but a few large enough websites that are comparable to Youtube in terms of active users, and catalogue size. Also, these companies manage to host all of this content and delivery it all over the world on a much smaller budget than Youtube. Not to take away any of Youtube&#x27;s achievements, but from a technical point of view, I do think the porn industry wins. To begin with, porn streaming is older than youtube, but quite a few years actually. Additionally, from what I&#x27;ve heard, some of the popular live streams on OnlyFans (and similar websites) see more concurrent viewers than most YouTube live streams.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41418584" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41418584" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crdrost</span><span>|</span><a href="#41417795">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41418410">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41423154">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41419884">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41418584">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41418584">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Slightly bigger challenges Netflix faces:<p>• You have deals with N big media companies who each have their own restrictions on who can stream what from where. The list is constantly changing, so permissions to view media are locale-specific and revokable; you need a way to say “okay this person is not allowed any more to do that.”<p>• Multiple-screen detection emphatically needs to be rock solid. Someone is going to <i>unplug</i> their Roku player when their laptop says “you&#x27;re watching from too many screens,” and by the time they get back to their laptop you need to be detecting them as streaming from 0 screens. At the same time a hiccup in this process shouldn&#x27;t cause like 3% of your users to get a big streaming interruption as they don&#x27;t seem to be online.<p>• You have to recommend stuff based on what this person has watched. An acquisition team needs to do cluster analysis on this to get new stuff to fill all of the different clusters of interests that emerge in your user base.<p>• People will search for shows you don&#x27;t have. (Because of point 1, the big media companies only permit access to a fraction of their backlog.) You have to know this media that you don&#x27;t have access to, well enough to recommend something related that might keep the user on Netflix instead of hopping to another service.<p>• All of this has to happen on pretty low latencies when someone starts up Netflix. That is, anybody who jumps into Netflix should see a personalized view of what they were watching, what they can watch, filtered by your allow lists and not cached on their device, within just a few seconds.<p>• All of this has to be portable to all of the different platforms Netflix supports.</div><br/><div id="41419048" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41419048" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">torginus</span><span>|</span><a href="#41417795">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41418584">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41419884">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41419048">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41419048">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; You have deals with N big media companies who each have their own restrictions on who can stream what from where. The list is constantly changing, so permissions to view media are locale-specific and revokable; you need a way to say “okay this person is not allowed any more to do that.”<p>Yeah, international media content licensing is very likely Netflix&#x27;s moat. I&#x27;d wager starting a streaming service, and getting the big studios to host their content is pretty much impossible.<p>Recommender systems are pretty well studied, and anyways, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s significance for Netflix is overrated. People (including me) tend to watch the show everyone&#x27;s talking about. It&#x27;s a much more hairy issue for a site like Youtube, where users upload decades worth of content every day, and the site has to figure out what to show to which viewers, where the content&#x27;s shelf-life might be measured in days, so building up collaborative filtering data might not be feasible.<p>All the other technical issues are probably non-trivial, but I don&#x27;t think any of them requires world-changing engineering prowess.<p>Most engineering is non-trivial. If I attempted to design a washing machine, I&#x27;d probably fail miserably, and figuring how to do it well probably took collectively thousands of engineer-years.

It&#x27;s a whole different kind of company, and not one I choose to stay in. I just go find somewhere else to help get to that stage.<p>&quot;Professional managers&quot; and &quot;startups&quot; are incompatible. Startups have to be able to move and pivot so fast that there&#x27;s no use for a &quot;manager&quot; who doesn&#x27;t actually know how to do the work of those they manage. They&#x27;re going to be called on to fill in for those people far too frequently.

Not everyone can do this, but the people who can are better served if they exercise the ability because it improves alignment and accountability.<p>When you assign a person to a problem (hr policy, infrastructure scaling, new UX capability) they will treat that problem as most important, and if then they break it down a certain way and delegate parts those people will do the same with their respective parts. Like a game of telephone eventually what&#x27;s actually important and what people think is important will drift apart, and before you know it a lot of people are working and doing stuff that doesn&#x27;t really matter or is even counter productive.<p>A founder who can hold the whole business in their head and inspects the whole company at all levels continuously will spot and challenge&#x2F;correct these drifts.<p>I think it was from Creativity Inc I read that Steve Jobs would challenge engineers about things and if the engineer stood up to him and made their case and it made sense and fit into the vision Steve would commend them and give them the autonomy, at least for that decision&#x2F;project, but if the engineer folded or couldn&#x27;t make a case for why it was the right decision he would steamroll them.<p>So I think founder mode is basically inspecting and challenging the company at all levels to maximize progress towards realizing a vision, and only people who are great visionaries and can also understand and judge the vision-alignment of unlimited micro decisions across many disciplines are able to operate this way.</div><br/><div id="41420137" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41420137" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">figassis</span><span>|</span><a href="#41418149">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41419873">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41420213">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41420137">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41420137">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I run a payments startup, but to ktlo, I had to do consulting work, and I’d hired a sales person to acquire and manage clients.

I&#x27;ve seen at least one company that was not successful under its founders and where a hired CEO took it to the next level. That hired CEO operated closer to what you&#x27;d call &quot;founder mode&quot;. Both these companies grew to multi-billion dollar valuations and would have likely never gotten there without hiring a CEO and both executed really well by any measure.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen founders that weren&#x27;t really at a level where they could &quot;founder mode&quot; and micromanaged things badly.

This can be the entire company but it can also be one product or project within the company. Trying to construct this picture out of pieces in multiple people&#x27;s heads is vastly inferior and is a factor in the failure of projects&#x2F;products and companies. You can&#x27;t separate vision&#x2F;what&#x2F;how across people.<p>What I don&#x27;t think we want to take away from this is that the founder is always right or that you shouldn&#x27;t hire good people and let them do their job. I don&#x27;t think these two statements are accurate.

A founder will never rest if they know there&#x27;s an issue to be solved in the company, while the manager has a life and know they can move forward in case.
A founder will not be intimidated by any internal policy or rule if they believe they need to change something. A manager will try to play by the rules, and in case try to modify them through influence.
A founder is basically a ruler who truly care about the success of the company (not necessarily about the happiness and fulfilment of the people taking part in the company).

We can argue whence it comes but it is palpable from strong founder leaders. There is a general sense that they hold the entire business in their head.<p>A founder can wield this to effect changes that would be nearly impossible without it. In this sense, a founder can solve some problems in every part of the organization that no manager can. If a founder delegates everything to managers, or cannot identify problems best addressed with this founder&#x27;s tool, then you are setting up managers to be ineffective in some situations that could have been solved by the founder stepping in. I think this is also part of what makes founder-led companies different generally. Professional managers do not have this tool at their disposal to solve organizational problems.<p>It requires judiciously picking when and where to leverage this power. Applying it unnecessarily will have the effect of disempowering your managers, and now you have a new organizational problem.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41418253" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41418253" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mikeg8</span><span>|</span><a href="#41418149">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41420005">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41419065">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41418253">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41418253">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Couldn’t agree more.

This stuff happens in every department and has a lot to do with how the company is run day to day. If you think about the major deliverables of a department - and pick any department - “manager culture” says the head of that department produces the deliverable internally, getting feedback from stakeholders outside their team perhaps, but “owning” the decision. Thus the product roadmap is “owned” by the product team, and the person the VP PM or CPO reports to is a passive recipient of it even if they have input or feedback on it. But that cascades downward: in manager culture, the mobile roadmap is owned by the mobile PM, the internal tools roadmap is owned by the internal tools PM, and so on. They all buy into manager culture, where autonomy is viewed as a defining aspect of their impact and importance, and to take away that autonomy is to undermine them and risk losing them (“micromanaging, which is bad”).<p>This same thing happens with marketing. Budgets get set. Agencies get hired. Branding and creative campaigns get developed and show up on the doorstep of the CEO hundreds of thousands of dollars deep. In engineering. In customer support. In finance (we have to do this, because the forecast cycle requires it; we can’t do that, because we don’t have the budget).<p>In founder culture, the founder gets down and dirty in the roadmapping process. They will give direct feedback on how a customer issue is routinely handled, or a design choice, or a creative campaign. Or a technical standard - Gates and Jobs both famously did this incisively and decisively. I’m no huge fan of Zuck, but it’s clear how much involvement he has with product and design for example. He famously bought Instagram because he wanted to, and understood its importance to facebook’s future, not because a strategy team identified it and a corp dev team engaged and investment banker to analyze and negotiate it.  Mark Pincus was like this at Zynga too- ask anyone who was there.<p>Why is this important?  Because people all the way down the organization don’t usually have the same nuanced understanding of the product, the market, the company strategy, the positioning, as you do. They will make decisions that optimize their subsystem but are sub optimal to the system. I had a customer support manager recently ask me if he could move a set of things that was causing a lot of load on his team to our law firm. The law firm of course charges 10-30xx per hour what a customer support agent makes. Even if you do a good job evangelizing the company mission and hiring non-mercenaries and whatnot, again and again and again you will see people wanting to “professionalize” their teams in ways that add more process, slow things down, and attenuate impact.<p>So If you let your company get into manager mode, you really lose control of the boat. And if you try to operate in founder mode after hiring a bunch of managers, they pissed because they don’t want to be micromanaged. But if they were crushing it, you wouldn’t need to.<p>I think the best founders are able to navigate this dynamic effectively, whether that’s by being able to effectively make a jump to a more delegated model, or building a team that can leverage their strengths without snuffing their hands-on involvement, or taking back the wheel at the right time.<p>A good counter example I can think of is Yahoo, when Jerry Yang took back over after Terry Semel retired. Manager culture had deeply set in there, and was not reversible despite Jerry’s good efforts and some great executives who were aligned to it. (And yes, the big, Steve Jobs inspired, “fix the company retreat” they did was literally “VP’s and up”.). As someone who worked there, was not a VP, but likely would have been in a “top contributing employees” cull by different measures, it was extremely painful to experience.<p>I would note that it takes a lot of energy to sustain this mode and be a leader through it, or to make changes in this direction to course correct.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41419697" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41419697" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thomukas</span><span>|</span><a href="#41418149">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41418456">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41419890">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41419697">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41419697">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">He was implicitly referring to what Chesky did recently at AirBnB (personal involvement in lower-level decisions eg product design in his case as it’s his forte).</div><br/></div></div><div id="41419890" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41419890" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">capdiz</span><span>|</span><a href="#41418149">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41419697">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41418417">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41419890">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41419890">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;paulg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1830300111232188626" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;paulg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1830300111232188626</a><p>He does clarify, in the linked reply, that he didn&#x27;t provide examples or go into detail about what exactly &quot;founder mode&quot; is or how it should be done because it needs a lot of research and would more or less require a whole book to explain.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41418241" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41418241" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">antupis</span><span>|</span><a href="#41418149">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41418417">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41420109">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41418241">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41418241">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My ex colleague is still fuming after several years about case where professional manager decided to program parser that we decided was 8 story points.

Both paid $300-400k and sourced through recruiters who charged $75k in recruiter fees. So we were getting what any VC would consider cream of the crop VP of Sales.<p>Yet both of them failed spectacularly. We went from closing business every month to (both times) sales stalling and flat lining.<p>The 2 VP&#x27;s were smart people and they had seen success at prior companies similar to ours in size and scale and maturity (and deal size, sales cycle length, B2B, etc). So what was the problem?<p>Simply put, what worked at their prior companies didn&#x27;t work at our company. And both of the VP&#x27;s wanted to push us the founders as far away from the sales group as possible so the VP&#x27;s could retain full autonomy with their team. Onboarding both VP&#x27;s was a miserable experience because, both times, they clearly weren&#x27;t interested in internalizing the hundreds of failed lessons (and success stories) that had gotten us to this point. So after a while we saw the whole sales team slide back into old behaviors and tactics that we as founders knew didn&#x27;t work (because we&#x27;d already learned those lessons).<p>By the time founders get to the point of bringing in outside management, they&#x27;ve  probably been running the company for many years. The fatal problem is when founders bring in outside managers who don&#x27;t bother to understand the tactics the founders used to get the company to the stage its at, and instead they come in wanting to replicate experiences they had a prior companies, because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s comfortable for them.<p>Unfortunately, on the flip side, promoting from within isn&#x27;t a much better option, either. I&#x27;ve seen it happen multiple times where extremely high performing IC&#x27;s are promoted into Lead or Manager roles, and the company 1) immediately loses a high performer because they&#x27;re now focussed on managing people which is usually a totally different skillset than whatever made them a high performing IC, and 2) the manager fizzles out after 1-2 years because they aren&#x27;t practiced at basic management tactics like delegation, quit, and go back to an IC position at another company.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly difficult to convert an IC into a manager. And it&#x27;s also incredibly challenging to (successfully) bring in a manager who wasn&#x27;t first an IC at your company.<p>&quot;Founder Mode&quot; to me is figuring out how to scale your company in a way that doesn&#x27;t lose the &quot;magic sauce&quot; that got the team to where it is. &quot;Magic sauce&quot; being culture, processes, systems, tactics, lessons, knowledge, etc that founders used to get the company to where it is before needing managers to scale people.<p>&quot;Founder led sales&quot; ... &quot;Founder led engineering&quot; ... &quot;Founder led marketing&quot; are all dirty words when talking to VC&#x27;s, PE, potential acquirers, because anything &quot;Founder-led&quot; isn&#x27;t scalable and relies on the founder working at the company to work. Maybe &quot;Founder mode&quot; is a stage of a company where the focus is figuring out how to scale &quot;Founder led X&quot; beyond what has historically been seen as practical.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41419877" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41419877" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">danielmarkbruce</span><span>|</span><a href="#41418149">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41418402">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41418229">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41419877">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41419877">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s making decisions, in the weeds, across functional boundaries and some form of micromanaging.<p>He&#x27;s right.

It&#x27;s about incentives. If I own substantial equity of a company and I consider it &quot;my child&quot;, the reward for doing a good job will be much greater than if I was a hired manager. The reward is not just financial but also self-worth and reputation.<p>2. Selection bias. When we talk about &quot;founders&quot;, we really mean founders that have built successful companies. This criterion selects only those founders that are remarkably good at their jobs. They are good CEOs in general and also good fits for their specific companies.<p>3. Deep knowledge of the company and the business. For example, they remember all of the things that were tried but didn&#x27;t work.<p>4. They are much more willing to shape the company and have a high degree of control. If I&#x27;m a hired CEO, I&#x27;m managing someone elses organization, it doesn&#x27;t feel ok to make drastic changes. My mental setting is that I&#x27;m trying to please my boss (shareholders, board).

Employees are not fungible in a startup.<p>The other fatal flaw is that in larger orgs there is almost no existential risk to the organization from individual behavior. All the cloaks and daggers will get sorted out in the wash and Amazon will still be just fine. But this is not the case for a scaling startup. Bad individual behavior — prioritizing career progression over company success — especially at the expense of other employees, can and does sink smaller companies.<p>I think the stage of scaling is something that industry experience doesn’t provide a ready supply of employees to hire for. There are too many variants of startup company, too many weird starting structures, and the critical periods too short and intermittent.<p>The other variable not discussed here is the environmental constraints. An established org can be managed because the environment is relatively stable. The customer base is more of a constraint and the financial expectations are better integrated.

So imagine something like apple the iMac when they launched it and then the iPhone and then the iPod drove the company into what we know it to be today. But if they didn&#x27;t have all of the other managers and stuff who were pushing papers and getting things going, the company wouldn&#x27;t even exist. The founder really needs to know what matters in the company no matter how large it gets and how to go to the next step in the company and that will take very very little of the company&#x27;s actual outputs. Figure out who are directly responsible for creating those outputs and create a direct relationship with them. Going through the mbas and the paper pushers is secondhand information and usually they are tampered with.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41415834" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41415834" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lifeisstillgood</span><span>|</span><a href="#41417720">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41422732">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41415834">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41415834">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I am writing a book about an idea - software literacy is a new form of actual literacy and will be as impactful.<p>And I keep coming back to how important organising above the Dunbar number is and how bad economics etc is at this.<p>This resonates for me - and it’s still just grasping in the dark - but they seem to revolve around the idea that with software a company is no longer a lot of Dunbar number tribes working together through politics of their representatives (managers) but that action through the whole company can be co-ordinated through software (I even have the idea that the workers are CPUs so the coders are new managers).<p>Anyway the point is that founder mode might mean simply acknowledging that software runs &#x2F; orgnaisies a company more than anything else - and building for that.

That said, there are a couple of discrepancies I think.<p>First, I don&#x27;t think Founder Mode works as a name. He&#x27;s saying all the founders are being told to grow their company the wrong way—the Manager Mode way. Chesky is unique in that he&#x27;s ignoring them. Most Founders are doing Manager Mode not &quot;Founder&quot; Mode.<p>It&#x27;s possible the name could work because it describes what Founders should be doing rather than what they&#x27;re currently doing. It&#x27;s meant to capture that people who start a company have a much different interest and emotional investment in the mission and company. This distinction is important (and has been told many times). I&#x27;m not sure that model holds so tight anymore. Being a tech founder today is a mainstream and maybe default path today for many, it&#x27;s not a weird one that you&#x27;d have to be crazy about what you&#x27;re trying to build in order to attempt. Founders are choosing founding first and searching for ideas second, and then pivoting those ideas as a best practice of founding.<p>Pick a random company that&#x27;s sent you a recruitment email—look at what they say they do and then ask yourself how many people might be excited about that. Take an interview with a small one, you have a good chance you&#x27;ll talk to a founder or someone quite high—this person frequently does not seem interested in this. Even without a successful product or an exit, the VC round is paying them a good salary to startup. A recent thought I&#x27;ve been having is there&#x27;s a little more opportunity now to treat founding as a salary job, not really an equity play.<p>&quot;As Airbnb grew, well-meaning people advised him that he had to run the company in a certain way for it to scale.&quot; The problematic norm to me in tech is the opting for organizing functionally (dividing into engineering, design, marketing. etc.) to scale. Related to this is the problem with PMs at most companies. If they&#x27;re good ones, they should be leaders. Yet they don&#x27;t own much nor manage anyone (they&#x27;re ICs with no reports). And so Chesky removed them or guided them to something more specific like PMM.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41422825" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41422825" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blackoil</span><span>|</span><a href="#41422732">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41420504">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41422825">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41422825">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think idea boils down to know enough of your companies and subordinates&#x27; work and working to smell any bullshit they try to peddle.

I&#x27;ve seen these guys move up into higher and higher positions, and yet the projects they build are simply great stories.

They&#x27;re missing one of the key components.  The perspective of your customer (what their business is, and the understanding of what is and what isn&#x27;t important to them), and an understanding of how to deliver it (what capabilities does your customer have, how do they like to do business), and finally a perspective on how to deliver that value (an expertise in product).<p>Many people are experts at &quot;delivering&quot; or they&#x27;re experts at understanding their customers PoV, or they&#x27;re experts at understanding how to do business with those customers.

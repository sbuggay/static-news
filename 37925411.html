I think French is also an important language. Of course there are English writers such as the beast.<p>Just curious if anyone is into this kind of stuffs. I got into this in late teen, believing that Lovecraftian is a really thing. It quickly turned out to be made up by the great writer, but nevertheless Occult drew me in. I was never deep into it due to lack of time and my belief in science (or we can say modern science especially Physics and Mathematics are the modern Occult).<p>Maybe I&#x27;ll dig deeper and learn a few foreign languages after 50.</div><br/><div id="37936560" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37936560" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wise0wl</span><span>|</span><a href="#37936342">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37936494">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37936560">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37936560">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There are actually some fairly high quality translations of things nowadays.  Much better than even 20 years ago.  If you are still inclined to the occult, now is a better time than pretty much ever.<p>Science doesn&#x27;t negate an interest in the arcane, esoteric, or occult.  You can still find this stuff fascinating, and in fact there are practitioners who are actively involved in scientific circles simultaneously. It is not always mutually exclusive.</div><br/><div id="37936714" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37936714" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bodangly</span><span>|</span><a href="#37936342">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37936560">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37936494">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37936714">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37936714">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’d say it goes beyond not being mutually exclusive. They complement each other, sometimes in surprising ways. Sacred geometry, concepts of frequency and vibrational rates, extracting signal from noise, if you are well versed in math and science you’ll find a lot of synchronicities. Fourier analysis dovetails with the concept of unity.<p>Pythagoras was what we might call an occultist. Newton was an alchemist (which isn’t about lead to gold, it’s about the transmutation of the Self), Jack Parsons was a Thelemite. Ramanujan credited his genius to visions.<p>Science and math can’t (yet) answer the big questions. There are things it doesn’t even try and touch. In my experience, curious minds are often interested in trying to attain a broader understanding of the universe and our place in it.</div><br/><div id="37937044" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37937044" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jhbadger</span><span>|</span><a href="#37936342">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37936714">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37936494">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37937044">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37937044">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Newton was an alchemist (which isn’t about lead to gold, it’s about the transmutation of the Self)&quot;<p>Well, maybe not so much. That&#x27;s kind of a 19th-20th century interpretation. We didn&#x27;t want to believe that all these smart people really were into stupidity like turning lead into gold. Surely it must be much deeper than that! It must have been metaphors! But maybe not. Maybe they literally were into what they said they were into.

You have the benefit of three centuries of subsequent scientific advances, to which geniuses like Isaac Newton, and those other smart people, contributed significantly.<p>Besides alchemy, Newton was deeply immersed in various occult studies.  He was also a heretic, being a Unitarian, keeping his religious beliefs secret.  Scientific research occupied only a part of his time. The seventeenth century was a time of religious and political turmoil, millenarianism and apocalyptic prophecy abounded.

Their origin is without a king, autonomous and immaterial; it is not concerned with material and corruptible bodies, it operates, without submitting to strange influences, supported by prayer and divine grace.<p>The symbol of chemistry is drawn from the creation by its adepts, who cleanse and save the divine soul bound in the elements, and who free the divine spirit from its mixture with the flesh.“</div><br/><div id="37937411" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37937411" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jhbadger</span><span>|</span><a href="#37936342">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37937306">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37936494">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37937411">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37937411">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">On the other hand we really can understand the chemistry that alchemists were fiddling with -- it wasn&#x27;t metaphorical -- they really were messing around with chemicals and not souls.

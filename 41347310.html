That branched out to computer games, but let&#x27;s not digress.<p>We had Vampire LARPS in Finland from way back in the early 2000&#x27;s and possibly earlier than that, but i only played in the tabletop with some people who on the side were keen on boffering battles and the political campaigning pertaining to the World of Darkness.<p>&gt; Is there any similar view on sword and sorcery larp scene? One of my projects wants to drink from that, but I have little real knowledge about it and wouldn&#x27;t like to disrespect larping.<p>If you can elaborate on this, i could maybe give more substantial advice, but personally, i’ve seen most fantasy LARPers take it to the streets and wilderness, and even our backyard, although it was rare that i would run into a group when taking the dog out or out hiking.

Confetti or water balloons for area effect spells, serpentine or other similar effects for line attacks, ... . NPCs are also people dressed, and maybe some cardboard cutouts for goblins, kids, and other things that could be big in numbers or shouldn&#x27;t take part in a larp.<p>I don&#x27;t know what things go in the back, such as, should some NPCs just be GMs doing the rolls and acting on the scenery?

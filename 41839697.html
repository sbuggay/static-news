They test on Wednesdays around noon. Transmission is voice or PACTOR. It&#x27;s ham-type technology for 
government emergency response.<p>Although many local first responders are not on this net, the USCG, military, and Homeland Security monitor it. So it&#x27;s a way to reach U.S. Government resources in emergencies. This isn&#x27;t something you access with a handheld, since it requires at least a long-wire antenna. You can get hundreds or thousands of miles of range. The idea is to have something that can get through from a large disaster area.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cisa.gov&#x2F;resources-tools&#x2F;programs&#x2F;shared-resources-shares-high-frequency-hf-radio-program&#x2F;shares-faqs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cisa.gov&#x2F;resources-tools&#x2F;programs&#x2F;shared-resourc...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ema.arrl.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;files&#x2F;SHARES_Spectrum_Monitor.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ema.arrl.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;files&#x2F;SHARES_Spectru...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41840419" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41840419" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mindcrime</span><span>|</span><a href="#41856761">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41840805">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41840419">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41840419">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So very true. Ham radio operators, AIUI, played a critical role with emergency communications in the Western NC area in the aftermath of Helene. I believe there were some instances where local PSAP&#x27;s &#x2F; dispatch centers were knocked completely offline and they had local ham radio operators helping to dispatch fire&#x2F;ems resources.<p>The great thing about ham radio, it really is an inexpensive hobby to get started. Now, once you get into it, you can spend just about as much money as you want (or have access to). But a Bao-feng handheld that costs around $40 or so can work the local repeaters on 2m or 70cm and is a fine way to get started, learn the lingo, etc.<p>I encourage everyone to give it a shot, and join up with a local AUXCOMM group or whatever you have locally.

What are the most interesting things people are doing with Ham these days?</i><p>It&#x27;s sort of hard to answer that. In a certain sense, the answer is &quot;talking to other people on the radio&quot;. Which taken literally, sounds kinda boring. You can talk to people lots of ways.<p>That said, what people get out of ham radio varies a lot from person to person. A lot of people are interested in the hardware, and the electronics of building, tuning, and&#x2F;or repairing radio equipment. Other people focus on &quot;DX&#x27;ing&quot; or making contacts from as far away as possible, using the last amount of power as possible. The fun part is all the fiddly details and what not to optimize the situation at hand. You could think of it as being a sort of analogue to &quot;code golf&quot; - trying to squeeze a certain algorithm into the smallest number of lines of code, or the least amount of memory.<p>Other people are interested more in the &quot;public service&quot; aspect being discussed in TFA. They are interested in being available to help during disasters and other events. Also, just as an FYI, hams do more than just help during disasters or other emergencies. At least here locally, hams often volunteer to help run comms for sporting events like marathons and what-not.<p>And then you get people who want to experiment with new modulation schemes, or who want to use genetic algorithms to evolve interesting new antenna designs, or who want to bounce signals off the moon, or who want to talk to the ISS, etc. etc. Other people like messing with inter-linking repeaters to see if they can talk to somebody on the other side of the country using a 5 watt handheld, by linking 5 or 6 repeaters (or whatever it takes). Other people interconnect ham radio systems with the Internet, or do digital data transmission over the air using APRS or similar protocols. Other people might use DTMF tones to remotely control some kind of device. Others are maybe into drones and might experiment with strapping a repeater to a drone and seeing what that yields. Some might use ham radio to collect telemetry from their drone (or other device).<p>So really, &quot;talking to people&quot; is kinda the base of the whole thing, but there&#x27;s a lot of other aspects of ham that entice people. Me, I do a small amount of random talking with people on the local repeaters (so called &quot;Ragchewing&quot;) but my interest is more in the electronics aspect, and the public service aspect. But there&#x27;s lots of room to experiment and play around with stuff in the ham space.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41856027" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41856027" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bittwiddle</span><span>|</span><a href="#41840805">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41849620">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41855835">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41856027">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41856027">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">With packet radio you can transmit digitally, and basically have IRC via radio.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Packet_radio" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Packet_radio</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41855835" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41855835" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">amingilani</span><span>|</span><a href="#41840805">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41855759">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41855835">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41855835">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Heh, I just finished an AuxComm training and two IMS (Ontario’s version of ICS) courses last week.

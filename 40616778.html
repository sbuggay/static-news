The most interesting mechanism is paleopolyploidy [1] where the whole genome of the organism is doubled due to hybridization or DNA replication errors and from that point on the duplicates start diverging. It has occurred at least once in most flowering plants and it must have happened several times with this fern. Normally after this kind of event, the genome is paired down and duplicate genes are &quot;silenced&quot; in a process called diploidization [2] but if there are a bunch of transposable element, they might differentiate the copies enough to keep them before the process completes.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paleopolyploidy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paleopolyploidy</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Diploidization" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Diploidization</a></div><br/><div id="40621058" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40621058" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bee_rider</span><span>|</span><a href="#40618743">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40619034">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40621724">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40621058">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40621058">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well it makes perfect sense, after all you have to water plants.

E.g. a special chromosome for birch vs oak. Or drought vs monsoon. Given the endpoint of the species is purportedly 350mn years it stands to reason that a highly specialized and nuanced system of regulatory pathways may have emerged. Sequence data and genomics would be revelatory.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if there was specialized information per-host which was regulated by signal produced by the host, I think this would explain redundancy pretty well. Different epigenetic pathways operating on different x¹ chromosomes yielding differential response to discrete small molecules&#x2F;proteins&#x2F;hormones produced by host species which prove beneficial in the <i>looong</i> run. This could have a whole cascade of effects or just subtle SNP differences which yield fitness enhancements. Essentially each one being a subroutine for each host case producing local optimums.<p>But I&#x27;m just a scrubby undergrad so with a grain of salt. There&#x27;s probably many other more reasonable explanations, it&#x27;s biology, biology seeks to find exceptions to every rule by its nature.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40621332" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40621332" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">__MatrixMan__</span><span>|</span><a href="#40618743">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40619127">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40619541">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40621332">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40621332">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Until a better story emerges, I&#x27;m imagining that fern mode is just what we see when it is dormant.

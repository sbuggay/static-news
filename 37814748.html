Let one key represent the &quot;Kuh&quot; sound, another &quot;ah&quot;, and a third &quot;tuh&quot;. Press them all down and when released, you get &quot;cat&quot;. &quot;Al&quot; &quot;Guh&quot; &quot;Or&quot; &quot;If&quot; &quot;Um&quot; &quot;Algorithm&quot;. 5 strokes instead 8. And that&#x27;s not even trying to be efficient.<p>Another mapping is to use shapes. Three keys in the top row and one in the middle on the bottom looks like a &quot;T&quot;. So, map that to something you associate with T.<p>A theory can be any mapping you want. Stenography is based on shorthand which was invented in the late 1800s. There are plenty of theories that already exist. You don&#x27;t need to make your own.<p>When you write, you use some words or phrases frequently. Map those to convenient keys. Such mappings are called &quot;briefs&quot;. Go crazy with them and you can reach 370 words per minute of real-time dictation.<p>You obviously don&#x27;t have to be that good. I find that 30 wpm is sufficient to be productive at work. You can reach 70 wpm by practicing 15 minutes a day for a few months. You&#x27;re a programmer. You can do it.<p>Expecting a lifetime of computer input? Don&#x27;t optimize for easy key-to-output mappings such as QWERTY or Dvorak.

I have some mini life hacks like getting a glass of water and not using things like water bottles or tea pots that &quot;allow&quot; you to stay at your desk longer. Anything that forces you to get up is a good thing. A simple stroll to the kitchen is a good thing. Standing desks are great too.<p>Also, because I figured out that a lot of my issues are shoulder related I do some simple exercises to loosen those once in a while. That&#x27;s also why walking helps. Swimming is also great. If you sit still for extended periods of time, shoulders tend to cramp up and the nerves to your wrists and hands go through there. Where you feel pain and where the problems are are not necessarily the same thing.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37816271" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37816271" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">edvinbesic</span><span>|</span><a href="#37815699">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37818085">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37815649">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37816271">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37816271">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I can echo this myself, however what made the biggest difference for me was having my elbows resting on something taking the weight off of my shoulders.

I find ESC easier to type than Caps Lock because it is in the corner of the keyboard.<p>I used to have RSI and what solved it (over 15 years ago) was taking more care to hit the precise center of the key. Using my sense of touch to sense the key&#x27;s exact location <i>before</i> even trying to activate the key helps me do that. When the key is on left edge of the keyboard, it is easier to do the determination of the exact location (of the left edge of the key I want) because I don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally activating the key to the left of the key I want. Caps Lock of course is also on the left edge of the board, just like ESC is, but ESC is also on the top edge, which is an additional help: the easiest keys to type in my experience are the ESC key and the left control key because they are in corners of the board. (The other two corner keys, &quot;pause&#x2F;break&quot; and the right arrow key, are harder because of how far they are from the home row.)<p>I never understood the desire many writers on this site have of moving the hands as little as possible. More precisely, I understand the rationale, but I consider the rationale to be misinformed. If you don&#x27;t move your hands (i.e., because you have a keyboard with only 36 keys or something), you still have to use your arm muscles to hold your hands over the board, and the human brain is better at movement than at using the muscles to statically counteract gravity like that. That is part of it, but there is more. When hitting a ball with a tennis racket, it is ergonomic to take a back swing, i.e., to move the part of the racket that will hit the ball in the direction opposite the direction you want the ball to go, before starting the swing. Very quick back swings are important in typing, too, for preventing RSI (for reasons I don&#x27;t fully understand). And I think moving my hands around the board (i.e., in the 2 horizontal dimensions) makes it less likely my brain will put the relevant muscles in &quot;freeze mode&quot;,  which makes RSI more likely. Or something like that.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37815958" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37815958" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jfdi</span><span>|</span><a href="#37815649">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37816118">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37815180">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37815958">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37815958">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">inoremap kj &lt;Esc&gt;<p>:)</div><br/><div id="37816290" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37816290" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">qup</span><span>|</span><a href="#37815649">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37815958">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37816293">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37816290">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37816290">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I use this one, too.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people recommend jj, but that&#x27;s part of something I type a lot, so I had to choose another. jk works okay too, because I don&#x27;t use that acronym.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37816293" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37816293" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Clever321</span><span>|</span><a href="#37815649">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37815958">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37816290">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37815180">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37816293">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37816293">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I thought I was the only one insane enough to do this.</div><br/><div id="37816371" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37816371" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bbotond</span><span>|</span><a href="#37815649">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37816293">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37815180">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37816371">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37816371">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There are dozens of us!

I attribute this to not having any habits, let alone bad ones. Or maybe they’re all bad. I’ll explain.<p>I started programming pretty early, but I didn’t have a desk until my first job after college. I pretty-much made do with whatever situation was available to me. I also started working pretty early, doing physical jobs. I bucked hay for local farmers at about 12 and started shearing Christmas trees at about 15. The latter doing a lot of damage to my shoulders over the next few years. In college I rowed crew, which didn’t make things better as far as my arms went.<p>After college I started programming and I’ve been doing it professionally for going over 30 years now. It’s never really been physically comfortable. Even back then I was good for like an hour-long sit at most before I had to get up and move around and “get the blood flowing“ so to speak. That’s never changed. I still don’t like working at a desk. I stand, I sit on the floor, I sit in comfortable chairs, I lay down on the sofa, I’ve been known to steer a sailboat with one hand and program with the other.<p>I feel like this is why it still works for me - I don’t repeat my posture much. I have a really, really low bar for my programming “situation” and take full advantage of that.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37816927" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37816927" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jasfi</span><span>|</span><a href="#37815710">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37817092">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37816927">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37816927">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Some things that have worked for me:<p>- Fish oil.<p>- Getting enough protein.<p>- Yoga.

I also play a musical instrument that I guess you would say is physically demanding, and I have a hobby that is sort of hard on the hands. On the forums I inevitably follow about those activities, there is a sort of background of paranoia about how if you don&#x27;t do everything perfectly all the time, your hands will be ruined, you will never have seen it coming, and you should base all your decision-making regarding practice time around avoiding catastrophic injury.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are some other people who share my interests who have been the victims of misfortune when it comes to RSI injuries, but I think for the bulk of us who do anything repetitive, it&#x27;s not incredibly difficult to avoid these issues if you just pay attention to what you feel.<p>For example, on Friday I noticed that, after pretty much a solid week of intense  editing of code (I wrote a large thing and then realized I had gotten it all wrong and needed to move a lot of stuff into different files), I kept noticing that my elbows were killing me because they were grinding into the armrests of my chair. It didn&#x27;t dawn on me until the end of the week that the reason I don&#x27;t usually have that elbow discomfort is that years ago I took the armrests off my chair, or as the case with my current chair, I folded them backward and out of the way. I had put them down to clean them or something and forgot about it.<p>If I mind myself, I&#x27;ll notice the stuff that makes me uncomfortable. If I try doing whatever that is less and I feel better, then I&#x27;ve learned something. If I stop doing the thing that I&#x27;ve learned makes me uncomfortable, that&#x27;s great. If I did it too long and I need to visit a doctor or a therapist to help me undo the damage, that&#x27;s great too.<p>So long story short, pay attention to how you feel, recognize that however you feel is probably a result of the choices you&#x27;ve made, intentionally or not, and treat your body as a machine that needs maintenance and either find a good technician or learn to do it yourself when it makes sense.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37815412" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37815412" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hnthrowaway0315</span><span>|</span><a href="#37815606">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37817919">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37815412">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37815412">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I can confirm that the vertical mouse (exactly same brand) fixes my wrist issue.

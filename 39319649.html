That&#x27;s like reading the tea leaves for interviewing candidates.<p>Instead, this article reveals the real secret: You have to be prepared to do some legwork and research, as well as look beyond the obvious. You could go hire a lot of smiling ex-FAANG people with perfectly curated LinkedIn profiles and professional headshots by throwing large salaries at them, but you&#x27;re not going to get the best results that way. It&#x27;s also one of the least efficient uses of your headcount budget and those people are almost guaranteed to ghost you in 18 months when someone else offers them a fancier title.<p>There is a lot of gold waiting to be discovered among people who aren&#x27;t curating perfect LinkedIn profiles or collecting famous company names for their resume.

More specifically why a key few hires can change the trajectory of a company. The answer almost always comes down to one word and applies companies of any size: <i>leadership</i>.<p>Leadership is a concept largely foreign to the software industry for two reasons.<p>* Most software developers are never exposed to strong personalities and have no idea what strong leadership looks like. An excellent software developer tends to score high in agreeability, but a strong leader knows how to turn that down to 0 for maximum confrontation and&#x2F;or defiance.<p>* Strong leaders know when to not follow trends with extreme criticality. This is highly paradoxical since so many software companies are funded by advertising which is a business of growing trends. Real leaders set new trends and take share from existing players setting their brand reputation in the process. Most people in software are deathly afraid to abandon conventions of comfort whether in business or in product&#x2F;process innovation.</div><br/><div id="39332014" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39332014" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aurornis</span><span>|</span><a href="#39331986">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39332199">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39332014">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39332014">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Leadership is a concept largely foreign to the software industry<p>Maybe in the companies you’ve worked for, but I haven’t found this to be true at all<p>&gt; An excellent software developer tends to score high in agreeability, but a strong leader knows how to turn that down to 0 for maximum confrontation and&#x2F;or defiance<p>Hard disagree. “Maximum confrontation and&#x2F;or defiance” has never been a goal of good leaders who are trying to build a team that works together.<p>Encouraging people to speak their mind is good. Encouraging “maximum confrontation” is just going to create chaos. The goal is to work together to ship, not to argue and defy all the time. I can’t think of anyone who would want to work on a team where everyone had agreeableness dialed down to 0 where leaders encouraged confrontation all the time, except maybe for people who just like to argue a lot.<p>&gt; Most people in software are deathly afraid to abandon conventions of comfort whether in business or in product&#x2F;process innovation.<p>Another strong generalization that I can’t agree with. Most people I’ve worked with in software have been so aggressive about bucking trends and trying new things that we’ve had to dial it back a notch. A lot of the debates I’ve had with teams have been about choosing boring, stable technologies over the newest cutting edge technology that’s popular on Twitter. Same goes for business strategies, where I’ve had to deal with everyone from product managers to sales people trying to do things their own creative way when the standard, boring practices are what finally got the job done.</div><br/><div id="39332046" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39332046" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">austin-cheney</span><span>|</span><a href="#39331986">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39332014">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39332557">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39332046">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39332046">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Leaders do more than build teams.

Balancing leadership and responsibilities across people also allows the personal cost of such activities (whether it&#x27;s emotional labour, political backlash, etc) to be distributed as well.<p>This, I also believe, is why co-foundership appears so often in stories of successful companies.

Here are several ways in which these systems might be different, based on various assumptions about the nature and scope of magic:<p>1. *Regulation of Magical Practices*: Just as with professions and practices in our world, there would be regulations governing who can practice magic, how it can be learned, and where it can be used. Licenses or permits might be required for practicing certain types of magic, similar to medical licenses or driving licenses.<p>2. *Magic-Related Offenses*: New categories of crimes would exist, such as unauthorized enchantments, illegal curses, magical fraud (using illusions or mind control for deceit), and unlicensed necromancy. Laws would specify what constitutes a magical assault versus a non-magical one, with potentially different penalties.<p>3. *Enforcement and Jurisdiction*: Special law enforcement units trained in counter-magic or magical defense would be necessary to handle crimes involving magic. The jurisdiction might depend on the nature of the magic used; for example, cross-dimensional or time-altering magic could involve a higher authority or international magical council.<p>4. *Evidence and Investigation*: The collection of evidence might include magical means, such as truth spells, scrying (viewing distant or future events), or reviewing memories directly. However, there would also need to be laws protecting individuals against invasive magical investigations.<p>5. *Rights and Protections*: There would be laws to protect non-magical beings from discrimination or harm by magical individuals or entities. Similarly, sentient magical creatures or beings might have their own rights, leading to more complex legal considerations regarding interspecies interactions.<p>6. *Ethical Use of Magic*: Legislation would likely address the ethical implications of spellcasting, summoning, and other magical practices, including the use of magic on unwilling subjects or creating sentient beings. Regulations might prevent or restrict the use of magic that can alter someone&#x27;s will, memories, or identity.<p>7. *Magical Contracts and Agreements*: The legal system would need to address the binding nature of magical contracts, which could have irrevocable consequences. Laws might specify how such contracts can be fairly negotiated and what remedies exist for breaking a magical contract.<p>8. *Intellectual Property*: In a world where spells, potions, and magical items are created, there would be intellectual property laws protecting the creators of magical inventions. This could include patents on spell formulas, copyright on magical texts, or trademarks on magical item designs.<p>9. *International Relations and Security*: On a larger scale, there might be international laws governing the use of magic, especially in conflicts or espionage. Treaties could limit the use of particularly destructive spells or ban the creation of magical weapons of mass destruction.<p>10. *Education and Public Safety*: Laws would govern the education and training of individuals with magical abilities, possibly requiring mandatory schooling to ensure that magic is used safely and responsibly. Public safety regulations would address the storage of magical materials and the construction of magically protected buildings.<p>In this magical world, the legal and legislative system would need to be flexible and innovative, capable of addressing the ever-evolving nature of magic and its impact on society. It would be a blend of traditional legal principles and new rules designed to manage the unique challenges posed by the existence of magic.</div><br/><div id="39331394" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39331394" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aspenmayer</span><span>|</span><a href="#39324539">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39330709">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39330836">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39331394">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39331394">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You basically just described the anime Witch Hunter Robin.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Witch_Hunter_Robin" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Witch_Hunter_Robin</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39330836" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39330836" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pcc</span><span>|</span><a href="#39324539">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39330709">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39331394">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39330742">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39330836">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39330836">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Fun little exercise: while reading above, see what happens when mentally substituting “magic” with “AI”, words like “enchantments” with “algorithms” and so on.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39330742" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39330742" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bena</span><span>|</span><a href="#39324539">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39330709">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39330836">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39330144">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39330742">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39330742">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">All of these are basically &quot;what we have now, but with magic&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m sorry but how magic and the legal system interact <i>is</i> a subject explored in fiction.

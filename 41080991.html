What the internet would need is something like IPv6 with automatic encryption via IPsec, with PKI provided by DNSSEC. But Tailscale has every incentive to <i>prevent</i> such things to be widely and compatibly implemented, because it would destroy their business. Their whole business depends on the problem persisting.<p>(Repost of &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38570370">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38570370</a>&gt;)</div><br/><div id="41085166" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41085166" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Animats</span><span>|</span><a href="#41084227">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41085061">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41085166">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41085166">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And, worse, incentivized to require users to use a &quot;coordination server&quot; which helps with the NAT and firewall traversal problem by being something you can reach from outbound-only clients.  There&#x27;s a lot of verbiage there, but the general idea seems to be that Tailscale sits at the middle of this as the means by which machines find each other.<p>There are other ways to do that.<p>There are dynamic DNS schemes, so you can give your machine which only has a temporary IP address a permanent name. That&#x27;s been around for decades, and seems to have a bad reputation.<p>There are schemes with multiple coordination nodes that know about each other, and published lists of such nodes. The list may be out of date, but as long as the published list has one live node, you can connect and get updated. That&#x27;s how Kademlia, which underlies Etherium&#x27;s network and some file sharing systems, works. That&#x27;s about 20 years old, and sort of has a sketchy reputation.<p>It&#x27;s possible to go only halfway, and separate discovery from transmission. Peertube does that. You find a file to stream via ordinary HTTP to a server you find by ordinary web search means. Anybody can set up such a server. The actual streaming, for files wanted by many clients, is distributed, with people currently watching also sending out blocks to other people watching. This scales well, in case your video goes viral. It&#x27;s not used much, though.<p>So it&#x27;s definitely possible to do this without someone in the middle able to cut off your air supply.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41085061" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41085061" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway211</span><span>|</span><a href="#41084227">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41085166">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41085022">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41085061">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41085061">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For a car analogy:<p>The problem with car manufacturers selling spare parts is that by fixing a car, they&#x27;re incentivised to keep producing bad cars.</div><br/><div id="41085153" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41085153" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smolder</span><span>|</span><a href="#41084227">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41085061">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41085128">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41085022">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41085153">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41085153">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a poor analogy.

    to support IPv4 growth until IPv6 is fully deployed.  To that end,
    many ISPs will deploy a Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) device, such as that
    described in [RFC6264].  Because CGNs are used on networks where
    public address space is expected, and currently available private
    address space causes operational issues when used in this context,
    ISPs require a new IPv4 &#x2F;10 address block.  This address block will
    be called the &quot;Shared Address Space&quot; and will be used to number the
    interfaces that connect CGN devices to Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).

Isn&#x27;t the major problem of the current internet is inherent centralization of services because the initial promise of 100% decentralized network is simply too complex to realistically manage? I view that problem as deeply technical. Unless if by &quot;social&quot; you simply mean everyone should become an experienced sysadmin. (or the slight variation of, everyone should know an experienced sysadmin who&#x27;s willing to run their application for them for free)<p>Take something as mainstream as social media. Imagine a world where Facebook&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;TikTok&#x2F;YouTube&#x2F;Reddit&#x2F;HN&#x2F;etc worked (seamlessly) like bittorrent. An application on your machine when you run it, it joins a &quot;Facebook&quot; network where your friends see you online through their instance of the application. Your feed&#x2F;wall&#x2F;etc is served to them directly from your machine. All your communication with them is handled directly between the 2 (or 1000 or millions) of you. No centralized server needed. You can easily extend and apply this majority of centralized application today. The only ones I can think of where this wouldn&#x27;t work would be inherently centralized services like banking for example.<p>There are already plenty of p2p <i>networks</i> that show that this is a viable solution. Bittorrent, soulseek, bitcoin, etc.<p>All the problems you will run into however to make this as seamless as just connecting to facebook.com are purely technical. The initial big hurdle is seamless p2p connectivity. That is without port forwarding, dynamic dns, and requiring advanced networking, security, and other sysadmin knowledge from every user. Next would be problems like what happens when the node is offline? What happens to latency and load if you need to connect to thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of machines just to pull a &quot;feed&quot;? How is caching handled? How are updates&#x2F;notifications pushed? How do nodes communicate when they are wildly out of date? Where is your data stored? How do you handle discoverability, security, etc.<p>All deeply technical problems. Most are solvable, but you&#x27;re gonna have to invest a significant amount of effort to solve them one by one to reach the same brain-dead simple experience as a centralized service. The fediverse has been trying to solve just a small subset of these problems for over a decade now, and the solutions still require a highly capable sysadmin to give users a similar (or only slightly worse) experience than twitter.com.</div><br/><div id="41084578" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41084578" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">imiric</span><span>|</span><a href="#41083107">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41083866">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084176">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41084578">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41084578">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Isn&#x27;t the major problem of the current internet is inherent centralization of services because the initial promise of 100% decentralized network is simply too complex to realistically manage?<p>Not quite. The internet _is_ decentralized. What made the web so centralized from the start could partially be the result of lacking tools that made publishing as easy as consuming content. I.e. had we had a publishing equivalent to the web browser, perhaps the web landscape would&#x27;ve been different today. You can see that this was planned as phase 2 of the original WWW proposal[2] (&quot;universal authorship&quot;), but it never came to pass AFAIK.<p>So you could say that the problem is partly technical. But it&#x27;s uncertain how much this would&#x27;ve changed how people use the web, and if companies would&#x27;ve still stepped in to fill the authorship void, as many did and still do today. Once the web started gaining global traction in the early 90s, that ship had sailed. People learned that they had to use GeoCities to publish content, and later MySpace, Facebook and Twitter. These services gained popularity because they were popular.<p>There have been many attempts over the years to decentralize the web, but now the problem is largely social. As you say, we&#x27;ve had the fediverse for over a decade now. How is that going? Are technical issues still a hurdle to achieve mass adoption, or are people not joining because of other reasons? I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the latter.<p>Most people simply don&#x27;t care about decentralization. They don&#x27;t care about privacy, or that some corporation is getting rich off their data. They do care about using a service with interesting content where most of their contacts are. So it&#x27;s a social and traction issue, much more than a technical one. The only people who use decentralized services today are those who care more about the technology than following the herd. Until you can either get the average web user interested in the technology, or achieve sufficient traction so that people don&#x27;t care about the technology, decentralized services will remain a niche.<p>There is another technical aspect to this, though. Even if we could get everyone to use decentralized services today, the internet infrastructure is not ready for it. Most ISPs still offer asymmetrical connections, and residential networks simply aren&#x27;t built for serving data. Many things will need to change on the operational side before your decentralized dream can become reality. I think this landscape would&#x27;ve also been different had the web started with decentralized principles, but alas, here we are.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;info.cern.ch&#x2F;hypertext&#x2F;WWW&#x2F;Proposal.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;info.cern.ch&#x2F;hypertext&#x2F;WWW&#x2F;Proposal.html</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41084176" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41084176" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">intelVISA</span><span>|</span><a href="#41083107">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41083866">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084970">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41084176">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41084176">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What&#x27;s Tailscale&#x27;s value prop?

It&#x27;s mostly in their software&#x2F;managed offerings, and the ability to quickly add more servers. If you are a &quot;serious company&quot; and you don&#x27;t want to pay AWS or a similar company, renting a rack and colocating your own servers (either within your premises or in a datacenter) is doable and done by lots of companies.<p>I disagree that certificates have caused centralization, and they&#x27;re not something separating the haves and have-nots and are in no way comparable to having or not a mainframe. HTTPS becoming pseudo-mandatory didn&#x27;t push people into having their own (sub)domains, which is nowadays the only requirement to obtain a certificate. It already happened out of convenience.<p>The other point of centralization mentioned is DNS, which tailscale doesn&#x27;t avoid at all. MagicDNS still relies on the ICANN root, as does the tailscale control plane. And if all you wanted was a free subdomain, there are plenty of people offering that.<p>If you are behind CGNAT, tailnets aren&#x27;t particularly less centralized, as traffic has to flow through the DERP servers.

One of the upsides is the combination of these, and that the management interface in general is easy.

We&#x27;re building pipelines that are very similar to what&#x27;s described here.<p>Update 2020-08-26:<p>Aha! Okay, for some reason this article is trending again, and I&#x27;d better provide an update on my update. We did implement parts of this design for use in our core product, which is now quite distinct from logs processing.<p>After investigating the &quot;logs&quot; market last year, we decided not to commercialize a logs processing service. The reason is that the characteristics we want our design to have: cheap, lightweight, simple, fast, and reliable - are all things you would expect from the low-cost provider in a market. The &quot;logs processing&quot; space is crowded with a lot of premium products that are fancy, feature-filled, etc, and reliable too, and thus able to charge a lot of money.<p>Instead, we built a minimalistic version of the above design for our internal use, collecting distributed telemetry about Tailscale connection success rates to help debug the network. Big companies can also use it to feed into their IDS and SIEM systems.<p>We considered open sourcing the logs services we built (since open source is where attributes like cheap, lightweight, etc tend to flourish) but we can&#x27;t afford the support overhead right now for a product that is at best tangential to our main focus.

For those who want it and those who care. There&#x27;s an ecosystem of mostly FOSS software now designed to run on a home network and replace big, centralized, cloud providers. That software is right on the edge of being easy enough for everyone to use and for <i>sufficient numbers of people</i> to deploy and administer. News like Immich (to replace Google Photos) getting a major investment thanks to Louis Rossman and FUTO [1] is encouraging. The ecosystem of software you can now run on a commodity built NAS or homelab is, for me, the most exciting thing in computing since I first used the Internet in the late 90s.<p>The rollout and transformation, if it happens, won&#x27;t look like all this stuff becoming so easy that every individual can run a server. But it is possible that <i>every extended family will have at least one member who can run a server or administer a private network for the whole clan</i>. And that&#x27;s where tech like tailscale&#x27;s offering will come in. That&#x27;s where I see the author&#x27;s vision being a believable moonshot:<p>Each extended family, and some small communities, with their own little interconnected, distributed network-citadels, behind the firewalls of which they do their computing, their sharing, and their work. Most family members won&#x27;t need to understand it any more than they understand the centralized clouds they use now. And most networks won&#x27;t be as well secured as a massive company can make its cloud offering, but a patchwork heterogeneity of network-citadels creates its own sort of security, and significantly lowers the value of any one &quot;citadel&quot; to even motivated adversaries.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uyTPqxgqgjU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uyTPqxgqgjU</a></div><br/><div id="41084198" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41084198" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zoom6628</span><span>|</span><a href="#41083257">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084139">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41084198">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41084198">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Totally this.

But how am I supposed to build Internet apps intended for everyone if they need to be invited to my network first?<p>Not to mention most Internet services do need a central backend to function even if there are no barriers among clients at all (because the clients are completely unreliable), including even the textbook p2p example of file transfer: while direct p2p is nice in many cases, with a central service the recipient can receive at any time, instead of having to coordinate with the sender to both stay online simultaneously and for the duration of the transfer, which is quite difficult nowadays with most of the computing happening on phones.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41084575" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41084575" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK</span><span>|</span><a href="#41085048">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41083292">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41084575">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41084575">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That looks like Hamachi of 20 years ago.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41083292" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41083292" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">OJFord</span><span>|</span><a href="#41084575">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41085042">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41083292">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41083292">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a &#x27;gimme some of that Wix money&#x27;, IPO&#x2F;acq ramp-up post right?</div><br/></div></div><div id="41085042" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41085042" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kkfx</span><span>|</span><a href="#41083292">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084083">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41085042">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41085042">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ehm, sorry no. OSes matter much as before because even if today giants want to call desktop and co &quot;just endpoints&quot; a politically correct variant of old dumb terminals of &quot;their mainframes&quot;, actually we know very well that &quot;the intelligence&quot; must be in &quot;endpoints&quot; and no &quot;mainframe alike&quot; modern solution can scale or serve well in that regards. Of course we need networking, a network of individual hosts, not of dumb endpoints.<p>Devs have lost such knowledge because big tech have trained them to loose it and now we see more and more limits of their model. The new internet must be the very old one, a network of hosts communicating each others, without *NAT and alike in the middle explicitly done in most case to lock users hosts behind some giant iron curtain.<p>The modern web today matter because we lack UIs because commercial desktops have decided for widgets based UIs and have strongly hit their limits, finding in the modern web a crappy modern version of the old classic DocUIs and we know as well we need DocUIs. Slowly we start coming back to the end-users programming admitting that visual crap and all tentative to make programming hard on purpose led to unsustainable crapware ecosystems. Maybe in a decade spreadsheets and &quot;calculators&quot; will be finally dropped and Jupyter&#x2F;R alike tools will have finally substituted them eventually with some LLM plugged in to help the dumb mean users. In another decade we probably will be back at LispM because try other paths to profit from users is not sustainable anymore.<p>The shortest this period will be the less damage we will suffer.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41084083" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41084083" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">iczero</span><span>|</span><a href="#41085042">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084728">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41084083">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41084083">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; centralization is bad except when we do it<p>TL;DR</div><br/></div></div><div id="41084728" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41084728" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throw782349872</span><span>|</span><a href="#41084083">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41084428">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41084728">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41084728">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve been an active Tailscale user for years now, preaching the Gospel of Wireguard Control Planes to all who will listen (and many who won&#x27;t) in both my personal and professional life.<p>It&#x27;s been really disheartening to watch the steady enshittification of Tailscale, Inc.

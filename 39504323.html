We have a species of primates that evolved in frigid conditions, who seem to have had skeletons indicating adaptations to cold, who most likely couldn’t make clothes, nor the type of shelters that can be efficiently heated, yet they didn’t have fur.<p>We have woolly rhinos and mammoths, but Neanderthals didn’t have fur because obviously lol, they’re our cousins after all. We don’t even know why we don’t have fur, and at what point we stopped having it.

The popular consensus, however, is so steeply biased towards anything labeled &quot;homo sapiens&quot; that there&#x27;s no consideration given to how other humanoid species might have lived.<p>You assumption is correct, that they could not have survived in the freezing cold if they were also just stupid.  In reality, if they were to survive in the freezing cold in small groups (most Neanderthals lived in groups of 8-40 individuals) they would have had to be<p>- incredibly conflict-avoidant<p>- very emotionally stable<p>- would need to have a great amount of calories to last the winter, which means they would need to start preparing at least a year in advance<p>- would also need to be strong and be able to work together in a group well<p>- maintain quality over quantity -- mouths to feed that can&#x27;t contribute to the group would be disastrous.<p>- The last point implies that they had very stable social situations and likely little to no arguments over who should marry whom.  Probably also had a very stable social hierarchy<p>The tools Neanderthals have built have been found to have through multiple stages of preparation and multiple layers of coating.  They domesticated many, if not most, of the animals that we now keep as pets.  They also revered their elderly and gave proper consideration to their dead.<p>These are all signs of an advanced manner of cognition, certainly not animals.  In fact you could certainly make the argument that with the high social trust and extended time spent &quot;hibernating&quot; (waiting for it to get warm enough) inside a cave, they were more like mad geniuses working on large problems for months on end.  Considering just how long they survived, they would also have been great at passing down things from one generation to the next, which is yet another point in favor of them having a rich culture.</div><br/><div id="39521747" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39521747" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jgilias</span><span>|</span><a href="#39521373">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39521647">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39521548">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39521747">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39521747">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Can you point me to some sources about Neanderthal animal domestication?

This now appears to be rubbish.&quot;<p>&gt;The scandal only came to light when Prof Protsch was caught trying to sell his department&#x27;s entire chimpanzee skull collection to the United States.<p>&gt;An inquiry later established that he had also passed off fake fossils as real ones and had plagiarised other scientists&#x27; work.<p>&gt;&quot;Their stories about him were increasingly bizarre. After a while it was hard to take it seriously. You had to laugh. It was just unbelievable. At the end of the day what he did was incredible.&quot;<p>&gt;During their investigation, the university discovered that Prof Protsch, 65, a flamboyant figure with a fondness for gold watches, Porsches and Cuban cigars, was unable to work his own carbon-dating machine.<p>&gt;Instead, after returning from Germany to America, where he did his doctorate, and taking up a professorship, he had simply made things up.<p>&gt;In one case he had claimed that a 50 million-year-old &quot;half-ape&quot; called Adapis had been found in Switzerland, an archaeological sensation. In reality, the ape had been dug up in France, where several other examples had already been found.</div><br/><div id="39521652" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39521652" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jgilias</span><span>|</span><a href="#39521373">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39521548">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39521652">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39521652">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I hoped to see an image of a face!<p>I wasn’t really talking about passing a chimp skull for a Neanderthal one.

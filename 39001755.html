I found that it did not discuss quantum circuits in a detail that helped me really understand what I was doing -- though I suppose that is a conceit of quantum computing. Perhaps I will return to it later (I am working through Nielsen&#x2F;Chuang now, which is very theoretical, but explains things very clearly)<p>My policy is that a book is nothing more than a learning tool, which a hobby project can also be (perhaps more effectively due to the experience gained).<p>Then again, knowledge is power, and books are great at pointing you in the right direction -- assuming you found the right one for your needs, of course.<p>I know some people who won&#x27;t open a book unless they know they can read the whole thing, which I think is a ludicrous attitude.<p>I did just order O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s Generative Deep Learning book, and am hoping to get something out of that, and if I only retain a handful of snippets to use in my career, that is profitable for me.<p>The least I can count on is that it will look nice on my shelf.</div><br/><div id="39005573" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39005573" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sfn42</span><span>|</span><a href="#39005303">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39004004">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39005573">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39005573">[14 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Fundamentals don&#x27;t change.

I look at many books of software engineering that were popular in the early 2000s, like The Pragmatic Programmer, Agile Software Development or the Design Patterns book by the gang of 4. Those books aren&#x27;t taking about technologies that we expected to be superceded in 5 years. And yet, a lot of the text regarding object orientation and design patterns is outdated at best, and outright harmful at worst.<p>One can also look at, say, concurrency. A topic often seen as unimportant in the 90s, but ultimately taught at the lowest level, with mutexes, threads, semaphores and such. Those aren&#x27;t going away, but how often is concurrent programming all about manually setting mutexes? We use higher order abstractions, but those change too. Many languages are encapsulating this in monads, whether people know their promise implementation is a monad or not. But that&#x27;s not the only way, and the most popular way can change: Maybe languages in 10 years will be all about continuations and direct styles. Maybe it&#x27;ll be something else. The fact that in the end, the same basic features from the 80s and 90s will exist at the bottom somewhere isn&#x27;t that useful for most programmers.<p>And html generation... I was writing UIs before web apps were there. A lot of things that seemed fundamental went away when the browser was embraced. But will the browser live forever, or be superceded? I suspect that it will all get replaced, or be utter legacy, eventually. Will that eventually be 10 years? 30? It&#x27;s very hard to say what will remain fundamental, and what will not.</div><br/><div id="39009616" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39009616" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bad_user</span><span>|</span><a href="#39005303">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39007069">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39006366">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39009616">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39009616">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Mutexes, semaphore, CAS, threads are fundamental and this doesn&#x27;t change when you embrace monadic effect systems or continuations, even if some of the details change (e.g., obviously, if a computation can jump threads, then you need implementations of mutexes, semaphores, etc, that can jump threads).<p>Also, programming languages in 10 years from now will be pretty much the same languages we have today.

Then you need a mentor (to guide you) or to go back to school.<p>If you just need someone to have done the legwork and established the exercises and presentation of material for you, there are a myriad of options: books, blogs, videos, open courses, paid courses, etc.<p>The trick I&#x27;ve found to mastering a field without having a teacher standing over me and guiding me (and even when I have a teacher) is to learn to construct my own courses and exercises. These are &quot;synthetic&quot;. I look at multiple university courses on a topic and grab one or more books, and then work through them in an order that fits my way of learning. If they have a lot of exercises, I do them. If they don&#x27;t or their exercises are poor (happens), I have learned (over the years) to construct my own exercises.<p>A major lesson from years of doing this is that there are no perfect teachers, courses, books, or other resources that will, on their own, teach me a topic to mastery. I have to assemble it myself to fit my way of learning and needs as a learner. That part requires introspection along with trial and error. I attempted courses and books that taught me nothing (or barely anything). After a bit of floundering with that, I took a step back and figured out what resources were effective and ineffective for me, what they had in common or were missing, and started assembling my own &quot;courses&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s a very useful skill to develop, and it transcends disciplines. Even if you do have an actual teacher with you this is still helpful (perhaps even essential) to be able to go beyond what they&#x27;re teaching you and to cover over their weaknesses as a teacher (either general weaknesses or weaknesses with respect to you).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39003323" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39003323" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">brigadier132</span><span>|</span><a href="#39002597">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39002809">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39002949">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39003323">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39003323">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This seems to be true of all human development.

Fundamentally flawed design. There&#x27;s no possible way anyone tried it and went &quot;yes, this is fit for purpose&quot;. Worse, the complexity of its design which caused so much of the trouble (it had a single-sided blade that could be spun around—the locking mechanism was simply flawed, I didn&#x27;t get a bad one, it just <i>could not</i> work well) could have been entirely avoided by spending <i>barely</i> more money on manufacturing.

I believe software is much more engineering than science.  The challenge is in organizing the bits.  Most of the things learn, debate and design in software are more less arbitrary structures created to facilitate our own cognition.  The hard science behind computers is much more cleanly abstracted away, compared to, for example, chemical engineering.  For that reason, I don&#x27;t believe software advances in the same way that natural sciences do.  It&#x27;s much more social in the sense that groups rally around different ideas and implementations, and wherever that energy goes also shapes the new ideas to bloom on top.<p>Put another way: I think almost everything in software is arbitrary.  Certainly some ideas are better than others, but on balance everything is a tradeoff, and I don&#x27;t really expect for some powerful new discoveries or ideas to reshape the industry towards more structure and efficiency.

The purest theoretical CS is like mathematics in general. Also necessarily structured around cognition, but seemingly groping for something more fundamental or universal.<p>I&#x27;d agree lots of software is like engineering in that it is further tilted towards the practitioners and marketplaces and their limitations. It has more focus on cost-effective repeatability and risk management. But, traditional engineering is more rooted in some physical reality. I.e. civil engineering has basis in physics and materials science, because those drive failure modes and design criteria. The more social aspects---say evacuation routes for fire safety---developed within an existing practice that already been formalized to manage risks of structural failure etc.<p>But, lots of software is far detached from such a physical realm. It is more like legislation or contract law, or the arts. It&#x27;s all about what people want to say or hear and display to each other. Massive influence from the cognitive and social context. It may be colored by technique and available materials or resources, but thanks to Moore&#x27;s Law and friends, these practical limits have less and less influence on the shape of the outcome. Significant failure modes can be rooted in the vagaries of psychology, social sciences, or even political sciences.<p>However, software diverges from law or arts when we attempt to scale it up. We want to reach speeds that cannot be supervised and quality controlled by a human operator, or volumes of support tasks that cannot be managed by an affordable human workforce, or impactful decision-making and effects that cannot be adjudicated by a higher court. You need something like engineering here to manage risk, but there is no physical basis for building codes etc. Not only the new software products, but even the elements of risk are social constructs.<p>But I think the metaphors are broken as one pushes too hard &quot;up the stack&quot;, into AI replacing knowledge workers and analysts. Our current best social systems completely depend on human adjudicators in hierarchical layers of oversight. Courts that can comprehend the big picture and resolve differences when our other abstract social activities go wrong. I am nervous about a future where tech behaviors become too complex for such oversight. Or worse, where naive practitioners think they can solve it with another layer of unproven tech. Instead of turtles all the way down, it becomes some faith-based electronic oracles all the way up?</div><br/></div></div><div id="39004863" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39004863" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">osigurdson</span><span>|</span><a href="#39002288">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39003246">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39005363">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39004569">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39004863">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39004863">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A better analogy for software engineering is search.

Start by tinkering!&quot; (Other comments have been downvoted for describing what tinkering might look like, but any tinkering is valid! Try running llama.cc on your MacBook! Quantize a model yourself)<p>Ultimately, you&#x27;ll become good if you do it a lot, and you&#x27;ll do it a lot if you have one or more hobby projects that you&#x27;re motivated to work on. I have a few friends who are completely self taught (one going the Arduino &#x2F; electronics &#x2F; hardware route, the other going the web app and tools for personal use route), and the keys to their success is that they have projects they like working on. And they&#x27;ve kept at it for years.<p>They don&#x27;t know everything, and they don&#x27;t necessarily have great foundations, but it&#x27;s not too hard to learn things on an as-needed basis these days. Both of them find information very differently than I do, which is also valuable for me to learn and see.<p>There are other ways to motivate yourself: taking a class with homework that gets you coding (the success of this strategy depends on the person!), finding an accountability buddy who you discuss your projects with, finding an open source project you&#x27;re interested in (start by adding comments, fixing typos, or looking for a good &quot;first timer&quot; GitHub issue), do Recurse Center (although their job placement program may have limited options for junior &#x2F; entry level engineers)<p>At some point, you&#x27;ll have beaten your head against a problem (how can I order these things correctly? How do I get this interaction to work correctly? Why is my component re rendering in an infinite loop?) and you&#x27;ll watch a video or read a blog post explaining it and you will truly understand the issue. It will be common, and you might have encountered it in a 201 class, but your first-hand experience will help it stick.<p>Another totally valid way to learn programming is to be good enough to get a job [1] and then be paid to figure it out day after day, and ideally have experienced programmers mentoring you. I&#x27;ve seen people go through bootcamps get a lot out of it, but I think the quality is highly variable<p>[1] unfortunately, while I think this was a really good path ten years ago, the bar continues to be raised (new grads with internship experience can be very good, companies are not hiring as aggressively today as they did in the world of zero percent interest rates)</div><br/></div></div><div id="39004718" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39004718" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">theyinwhy</span><span>|</span><a href="#39002668">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39007023">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39004718">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39004718">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">On the frontpage at the same time: Become a master in 1 year [1]<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;micromasters.mit.edu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;micromasters.mit.edu&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39007023" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39007023" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aldousd666</span><span>|</span><a href="#39004718">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39002240">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39007023">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39007023">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have been dropping links to this article since 1998.

But if your metric is just &quot;I&#x27;ve played it occasionally since 10 years ago&quot; then indeed, you probably didn&#x27;t develop much breadth or scope as you were constantly forgetting and relearning as opposed to compounding your knowledge.<p>As for programming, I don&#x27;t think programming is all that hopelessly complex and broad as field, but it can seem that way to a beginner. Most computer science concepts translate very well to other parts of the field, and the core programming constructs and libraries don&#x27;t change much at all. How many ways can you configure a website, a mobile app or a database? Your instinct might be to think about all the different libs you can pull in, all the different programming languages, etc. But they all do roughly the same thing, they all compile down to the same stuff. You just have to develop the skill of understanding the fundamentals as opposed to getting lost in a sea of high level abstractions.</div><br/><div id="39006957" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39006957" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AidanSW</span><span>|</span><a href="#39004948">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39005180">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39005298">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39006957">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39006957">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree writing a variety of software will have similar base ideas, but still, having a good foundation in a topic doesn&#x27;t make you an expert.

I often implement things over decade or more, through a series of small increments.  I also decompose many problems recursively and use a sort of A* approach to make progress, sometimes revelling in some detail for months or more at a time before solving it, then backing up the stack to the larger problem I was working on.<p>For example, I&#x27;m building an automated microscope.  I work with folks who buy $1M scopes just to speed up their science.  I don&#x27;t want a $1M scope- I want a $1K scope that does 30% of what the $1M scope does.  To do this, i&#x27;ve learned how to design and 3d print components, integrate motors, controller boards, etc.  Eventually I reached a point where improving the illuminator (the LED light that provides the light to the sample, which is  then picked up by the camera) was the most important step and so I took a deep dive into LEDs, and the electronics required to support them.<p>This has meant putting the scope down and instead creating a series of designs for PCBs that incorporate increasingly sophisticated electronics and higher power LEDs.  I set a challenge for myself that is beyond my ability: design and have manufactured, a working constant current driver and assemble the PCB myself using surface mount components.  When I started, I knew nothing about constant current, or SMD, or designing PCBs.  I started with the simplest possible designs- copying a reference design for ac ontroller, cloning a board I already have, incorporating low-power LEDs onto a board.  Each step along the way, adding something slightly more challenging.<p>When I do this I fail a lot.  Some days I get a PCB made to my design after a week of waiting (JLCPCB is AMAZING) and within 5 minutes realize I made a fundamental mistake.  Other times, a board works perfectly and I &quot;level up&quot;: I can now take everything I learned in the process, and use it to pick up the next challenge.  Sometimes I get frustrated and depressed- not being able to figure out something that should be straightforward, and then I either rubber duck it, or ask a simple&#x2F;stupid question on reddit, which typically unblocks me.<p>Today, I expect to receive my next constant current board design.  If I assemble that and it works, I can then proceed to building a board to host a high power LED.  That will introduce all sorts of new problems (heat management) that involve going into Kicad, thinking about stuff, making some experiments, sending a design to JLCPCB, waiting a week, and then assembling a bunch of boards, most of which will burn out (high power LEDs are tricky, if they got hot they fail faster).  There&#x27;s an opportuntity to buy some thermistors (little temperature measuring devices) and put them on the board to see how well my design for heat spreading it.<p>At the end of all this, I&#x27;ll have a world-class transmission light microscope that can track tardigrades for hours at a time (itself an enjoyable delve into modern computer vision techniques), and I&#x27;ve talked to the world&#x27;s leading tardigrade researcher, who wants to incorporate my ideas into his research to make tardigrades a model organism.<p>By the way, if I had stayed in academia, I would NEVER had the time, money, or energy to pursue this; I&#x27;d be stuck working on my funded research.  NOBODY wants to give me money to design scopes that are roughly where state of the art was in the 1970s.  But if I keep this up, in a few years I&#x27;ll be ready to go play with the big boys and girls in the robot biotechnology labs with their $1M toys.<p>Bringing this back to Peter, I had the chance to work with him on a project (attempting to disprove the Beal conjecture by finding a counterexample).  He did all the brilliant math and we wasted a bunch of CPU (and I mean A BUNCH) trying to find counterexamples.  I like how when he wrote <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;norvig.com&#x2F;beal.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;norvig.com&#x2F;beal.html</a> he wrote in the nicest possible way that I was wasting time and energy.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39005212" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39005212" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">arp242</span><span>|</span><a href="#39004099">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39003284">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39005212">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39005212">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">24 hours?

This is what they had at the local bookshop.<p>The &quot;10 minutes&quot; is done by explaining what C++ is and then it declares &quot;there, in the last 10 minutes I explained things and you now know what C++ is&quot;.

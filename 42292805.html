It was coined by someone in reference the property of a specific system, many decades ago. That system stored program definitions in the same form that the programmer entered them in (either just the original character-level text, or some tokenized version of it), allowing the definitions to be recalled at runtime and redefined. He turned &quot;same form&quot; into &quot;homoiconic&quot; with the help of Greek&#x2F;Latin. It&#x27;s all in the Wikipedia.<p>Line numbered BASIC is homoiconic: you can edit any line of code and continue the program.<p>POSIX shell lets functions be redefined. They can be listed with the <i>set</i> command executed without arguments, and copy-pasted.<p>In Common Lisp, there is a function called <i>ed</i>, support for which is implementation-defined. If support is available, it is supposed to bring up an editor of some kind to allow a function definition to be edited. That is squarely a homoiconic feature.<p>Without <i>ed</i> support or anything like it, the implementation does not retain definitions in a way that can be edited; i.e. is not homoiconic. Some Lisps compile everything entered into them; you cannot edit a <i>defun</i> because it has been turned into machine language.</div><br/><div id="42294179" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42294179" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">coldtea</span><span>|</span><a href="#42292885">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42292971">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42294179">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42294179">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;<i>In Common Lisp, there is a function called ed, support for which is implementation-defined.

Mostly that&#x27;s just English.<p>There&#x27;s no Latin at all, but <i>hom-</i> [same] and <i>icon</i> [image] are arguably Greek roots. The Latin equivalents would be <i>eadem</i> [same, as in &quot;idempotent&quot;] and <i>imago</i> [image, and the feminine gender of this word explains why we need &quot;eadem&quot; and not &quot;idem&quot;]. I&#x27;m not sure how you&#x27;d connect those.<p>However, since <i>icon</i> begins with a vowel, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible for <i>hom-</i> to take the epenthetic <i>-o-</i> that appears when you&#x27;re connecting two Greek roots that don&#x27;t have an obvious way to connect. If the word was constructed based on Greek principles, it would be <i>hom(e)iconic</i>. Treating <i>homo-</i> as a prefix that automatically includes a final O is a sign of English; in Greek they&#x27;re separate things.<p>I remember that when there was a scandal around cum-ex financial instruments, a lot of people wanted to say that cum-ex was Latin for &quot;with-without&quot;, which it isn&#x27;t; it&#x27;s Latin for &quot;with-from&quot;. (&quot;Without&quot; in Latin is <i>sine</i>, as compare French <i>sans</i> or Spanish <i>sin</i>.) Cum-ex is <i>English</i> for &quot;with-without&quot;, and the same kind of thing is going on with <i>homoiconic</i>.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42293564" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42293564" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">galaxyLogic</span><span>|</span><a href="#42292885">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42293911">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42293564">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42293564">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If I understand the gist of this article it goes like ...<p>1.

Conceptually splitting out &quot;parsing&quot; into &quot;tree validation&quot; and &quot;syntax validation&quot; is slightly interesting (although isn&#x27;t this now a <i>tricameral</i> system?), but in practice it just seems like a simple aid to constructing DSLs.<p><i>&gt; These advantages are offset by one drawback: some people just donât like them.

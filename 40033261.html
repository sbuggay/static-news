Increases in the number of included diagnoses over editions is primarily due to concessions to important researchers as opposed to clear identification of previously undescribed illnesses.<p>There are lumpers and splitters in academic psychiatry. Lumpers are suspicious that there are several hundred discrete disorders of the brain that can&#x27;t be more parsimoniously explained with existing, better validated illnesses.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40035342" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40035342" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crtified</span><span>|</span><a href="#40035193">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40034813">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40035342">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40035342">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is there any condition with as broad a definition as autism?<p>It can cover anywhere from a non-verbal 9 year old with an IQ of 70, to a popular attractive valedictorian genius with incredible masking skills.

For example, you could say we don&#x27;t need a justice system once we have the biology worked out, or arts, or sports. At some level it&#x27;s a fundamentally authoritarian argument as well: if you have the biology worked out, what&#x27;s to keep the holders of power from altering people to whatever norm they want? Having the biology completely worked out won&#x27;t magically reveal natural disorder states.<p>The biological explication of a behavior doesn&#x27;t obviate the need to have some norm for intervention decisions.

Twin&#x2F;Sibling studies were used to debunk this but twin studies don&#x27;t totally control for shared environmental influences.<p>It seems more like a politically controversial thing than something which has been seriously scientifically examined either way.  It can&#x27;t be the smoking gun only cause but I see no actual evidence that it&#x27;s impossible that parental neglect can&#x27;t be a contributing cause.  I will note that it is more politically convenient to simply blame a child&#x27;s inherent defects instead of parental neglect, since the children relative to their parents lack political power.<p>I&#x27;ll also point out that contemporary autism diagnosis relies on parent reports to establish a diagnosis, and people often only get diagnosed if a parent actively seeks out a diagnosis.  Autism is also based on observation, if somebody was socially impaired due to neglect, how exactly would an examiner know the difference between that and somebody being socailly impaired due to say epigenetics?  I would be rather surprised if who raised somebody doesn&#x27;t have a rather large impact on if somebody will end up with an autism diagnosis.  As in an especially well resourced and attentive parent might mean somebody who would be considered autistic might not be, and somebody who was overstretched and inattentive might have a child who would otherwise not be considered autistic be considered autistic.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40035827" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40035827" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">naasking</span><span>|</span><a href="#40034813">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40034877">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40035284">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40035827">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40035827">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Mental illness could also be defined by a person&#x27;s ability to function in their community and social constructs.<p>No, I think mental illness should be defined relative to a person&#x27;s capacity to change behaviour volitionally or in response to feedback signals, like a scolding or rehab or imprisonment.

under the crust of words and concepts, the living reality of
non-adaptation to the world is always crouched, ready to
spring. Since neither gods nor words can manage to cover it
up decently any longer, this commonplace creature roams
naked in railway stations and vacant lots; it confronts you
at each evasion of yourself, it touches your elbow, catches
your eye; and the dialogue begins.&quot; [0]<p>&quot;After all, if an individual refuses both to adapt to the
violence of the world, and to embrace the violence of the
unadapted, what can he do? If he doesn&#x27;t raise his will to
achieve unity with the world and with himself to the level
of coherent theory and practice, the vast silence of
society&#x27;s open spaces will raise around him the palace of
solipsist madness.&quot; [1]<p>&quot;People are bewitched into believing that time slips away, and
this belief is the basis of time actually slipping away. Time
is the work of attrition of that adaptation to which people
must resign themselves so long as they fail to change the world.&quot; [2]<p>Raoul Vaneigem<p>0, 1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.darkmatterarchives.net&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2013&#x2F;06&#x2F;Vaneigem.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.darkmatterarchives.net&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2013&#x2F;0...</a>

Ultimately I don&#x27;t think that really happened; DSM-5 was a change but not the radical change I think the chairs and primary committees wanted it to be.<p>Frances&#x27; flooding of media outlets around that time was sort of strange in certain ways. He seemed to correctly identify potential problems in the mental healthcare system but then had this idea that changing things in the DSM to address some of its issues would make everything worse. It felt as if he was co-opting concerns everyone was having to argue for not changing anything at all, and in the process turned everything on its head.<p>The DSM is a very political document with a lot of interest groups involved at all levels, which is why it didn&#x27;t change even more than it did. As a result, you had NIMH circumvent the whole process with RDoC, which then in turn seems to have had a relatively short life (maybe?) associated with changeover in its own administration.<p>It feels as if everyone has their own schema for thinking about mental illness, and the whole field moves along without any serious consequences. There&#x27;s probably a lot of reasons for this, including scientific and medical sociology, and the complexity of mental wellness and illness as a domain. But it makes me wonder if some of the distinctions that are argued to be critical are really that critical in the end.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40035871" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40035871" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">naasking</span><span>|</span><a href="#40035008">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40035479">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40036373">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40035871">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40035871">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; It&#x27;s not a great situation, and I don&#x27;t see many signs that it&#x27;s improving.<p>I think this is a little too pessimistic on the one hand, and very accurate on the other.<p>On the accurate side: this discipline took one of the most significant hits from the replication crisis, and was one of the most resistant to acknowledging and changing practices. Everyone should keep pushing for open science and preregistered studies to improve quality of the evidence here.<p>On the optimistic side, there is one potentially huge change that&#x27;s just starting to crest as opinions improve and acceptance spreads: psychedelics. MDMA for PTSD was a huge win and indicates a potentially large untapped realm of possibilities for altering cognition in positive ways.<p>There&#x27;s also hope that neuroscience can start to supplant at least parts of psychology in a few decades.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40036373" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40036373" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">matrix87</span><span>|</span><a href="#40035008">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40035871">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40036422">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40036373">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40036373">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Legitimate advances are being made<p>Like what?

We&#x27;re already way behind the tech curve on anything physical. Propping up oil doesn&#x27;t help, but it isn&#x27;t the problem by a long shot. China props up coal and it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt their manufacturing.<p>The problem is that we can&#x27;t build anything in this country, with a handful of very expensive exceptions. If the US wants to change that, we have to send a planeload of senators to Shenzhen and copy fucking everything. Take detailed notes and copy JLCPCB, LCSC, Alibaba, Foxconn, all the raw material suppliers, all the chemical suppliers. Build a new EEZ near NYC or SF and invest $1 trillion over 10 years (5% of discretionary spending.) Write up a few laws: every business must have fast turnaround, thin margins, and instant quotes. In a decade every product in the world would be made in America.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t even be hard; that number is ~10% of military spending and all of those companies will voluntarily give you a detailed tour. It&#x27;s not like we don&#x27;t understand any of this stuff. Etching a PCB or running a warehouse or spot-welding some crap is relatively simple.<p>Everyone thinks China leads the world in manufacturing because of labor costs. Ha, no. It started out as the labor costs, but now it&#x27;s the vertical integration. You can go from prototype to product in a month in China. Try doing that in the US; it&#x27;ll take a month just to get your calls returned, and you&#x27;ll find that we don&#x27;t and we can&#x27;t make shit. At scale, we can&#x27;t make foam, we can&#x27;t mold plastic, and we can&#x27;t make PCBs.

But it was already suffering even before the tariffs.<p>It&#x27;s very simple: the EV market is growing at around 20% globally this year. That&#x27;s despite all the whining from some manufacturers that there&#x27;s no demand for EVs. Which is true but only for their EVs. Because they simply aren&#x27;t good enough. Too expensive to make. Not comparing well to cheaper competitors, etc. Take your pick. They aren&#x27;t selling well and that&#x27;s a problem for the manufacturers that are making them. But it&#x27;s not true for other manufacturers that are growing. Even in the US the EV market is expanding.<p>Either way, that EV market growth is in the context of an overall car market that isn&#x27;t growing anywhere near 20%. So, EVs are growing at the expense of legacy car makers. Their market share is effectively shrinking. By about 1&#x2F;5th a year. They have cost related to that for downsizing production capacity, getting rid of staff (and the associated compensation packages), dealing with related strikes, etc. Many of these companies won&#x27;t make it. It would take many billions in $s of investment in R&amp;D, new products, new production facilities, etc. And with many of these companies slowing down those investments, it&#x27;s not going to magically improve for them. It&#x27;s a death spiral.<p>There are also no signs of EV market growth slowing down much further. With price parity effectively there if you have access to BYDs (which much of the world does), it&#x27;s game over for ICE.</div><br/><div id="42271760" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42271760" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">edwcross</span><span>|</span><a href="#42271090">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42271494">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42271548">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42271760">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42271760">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Don&#x27;t worry, in Europe, the incumbent manufacturers have a much better way to prevent EV sales: lack of charging spots.

Which means that, if you rent, you can&#x27;t buy an EV.

It&#x27;s fine. A bit of chore to park the car 500m from where they live once a week or so and then unplug it and drive it back to its regular parking spot. They are still saving loads of cash on fuel using only public chargers. Beats having to spend 60-70 euros on petrol.

US car manufacturers produce and import lots and lots of intermediate goods from those two countries. Setting up tariffs on those two with the hope of reshoring the manufacturing is problematic because it takes time and capital to build those types of supply chains and also develop the expertise among workers to operate those factories efficiently. Those workers and that capital will need to be devoted to building yesterday’s car parts instead of tomorrow’s.<p>Preventing cars from being imported from China is still a problem too. American companies are going to innovate slower without the competition. We may see a day when Chinese cars are just miles ahead of American cars in terms of technology, efficiency, comfort, and price. At that point, people are going to be asking “why am I paying so much for this shitty car when much better alternatives are available? Whatever happened to capitalism in this country?” And once those protections are lifted, the car industry would face rapid, destabilizing collapse.<p>A slower, controlled collapse (not saying that would definitely happen) of the US car industry would mean those resources (the capital and labor) would be able to be put to more productive uses in this country. There’s a lot of stuff we want to build, like modular nuclear power plants, wind turbines, geothermal plants, AI data centers, prefab new housing, humanoid robots, or some other stuff I can’t even imagine. I personally think robotaxis&#x2F;AV are going to put the entire worldwide car industry into near terminal decline anyway.

It seemed to be like lithium was ahead solely because there was so much industrial knowledge learned from optimizing for energy density first, but that other battery chemistries had to be better for grid storage once we invested the same economies of scale in them, too.</div><br/><div id="42271621" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42271621" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">owenversteeg</span><span>|</span><a href="#42271007">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42271077">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42271277">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42271621">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42271621">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I totally agree, but I don&#x27;t find it weird that lithium led for so long.<p>Sure, in theory, sodium-ion batteries are made of inexpensive materials and are easy to build. You don&#x27;t need any nickel, copper or cobalt at all and sodium is dirt cheap. But if you look into it, you&#x27;ll find many thousands of similar examples across countless fields, where something uses advanced materials or parts when there is a simpler and cheaper alternative. If you ever design for manufacturing, you quickly realize that the key is often not simplicity, the key is identifying and using existing high-volume processes. In other words, don&#x27;t find the cleanest way to solve your problem; instead, kludge together a solution using off-the-shelf solutions already produced at incredible scale.<p>The problem is that low-cost manufacturing is an art form and is far more complex than anyone realizes. Scale is important, sure, but what you really need is scale+time+intense cost competition. In that environment, it is very hard to start on a significantly different chemistry to compete with lithium-ion. (LiFePO4 is similar enough in manufacturing.) IMO the only place you could start this is China, which would leave BYD and CATL as the only two that could pull it off.</div><br/><div id="42272210" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42272210" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">HPsquared</span><span>|</span><a href="#42271007">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42271621">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42271277">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42272210">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42272210">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Software engineering is a LOT like this too.

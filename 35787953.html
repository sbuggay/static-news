For example, Mary Angela Branch-who grew up in Brownsville and is a member of the Center, ABC, and Save RGV-regularly visits the Boca Chica area to enjoy the beach and to swim, picnic, fish, and view wildlife, including protected birds. She plans to continue visiting the area; however, her ability to enjoy Boca Chica beach and the surrounding areas and the wildlife they support has been, and will continue to be, adversely affected by SpaceX activities, including through closures to accommodate SpaceX construction and launch activities as well as from the noise, heat, light, explosions, and fires associated with such activities.</i><p><i>Plaintiffs also have members that have researched, studied, observed, and sought protection for habitats and species that are adversely affected by the SpaceX activities authorized by FAA. For example, Jim Chapman, a member of Save RGV who lives in Weslaco, TX, works to protect the Santa Ana and Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuges, and advocates for the animals that use the tracks of brush and forest habitat to migrate between populations. Mr. Chapman is highly invested in the preservation of the Boca Chica area, as it is essential for many of the native wildlife which he seeks out and enjoys. Mr. Chapman regularly visits the Boca Chica area to view wildlife, particularly birds such as the protected plovers and migratory species that rely on the area. Mr. Chapman is passionate about the native wildlife and enjoys exposing people to the unique ecosystems of the region. His interests in observing and protecting the Boca Chica area have been, and will continue to be, adversely affected by the SpaceX activities permitted by FAA, including harm from closures, increased vehicle traffic and resulting collisions with wildlife, the intense noise, heat, and light from rocket launch and testing activities, and &quot;anomalies.</i><p>It may seem difficult to avoid creating subjectively negative impacts such as this when launching the largest rocket in history, but careful thought will demonstrate we as an enlightened modern society could avoid such deleterious harm on the preferences of a handful of individuals by simply banning all of human civilization.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35788406" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35788406" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jackmott42</span><span>|</span><a href="#35788861">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35788358">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35788406">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35788406">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t like that people are doing this, but I also feel like Elon has been bringing this kind of negative attention on himself by acting in an increasingly awful way over the past 5 years.

McNerney decided not to spend billions of dollars building a new plane to replace the 737. Instead, Boeing tweaked and updated the existing model and called it the 737 Max, outfitting it with larger, more efficient engines for increased economy. Compensating for the resulting instability was a secretive automated system called MCAS that would adjust the plane’s pitch without input from the pilot.<p>&gt; McNerney also fought to deeply cut costs. On his watch, the company opened its first non-unionized aircraft production line and initiated a program called “Partnering for Success” that pushed suppliers to cut their prices by 15 percent or more. Many feared that squeezing suppliers would harm the quality of their components, but McNerney was determined to recoup the cost of the 787’s development; if the subcontractors complained, they could find their work taken away from them, as happened to landing-gear-maker United Technologies Aerospace Systems.<p>&gt; McNerney retired in 2015, handpicking his successor, president and COO Dennis Muilenburg. Over the next three years, Boeing’s stock price more than doubled as it sold new planes the world over. (As Bloomberg News reported, Muilenberg and McNerney “had personal reasons to emphasize productivity and cost-cutting” because their compensation was tied to share performance. Together they took $209 million in total pay over seven years.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymag.com&#x2F;intelligencer&#x2F;article&#x2F;boeing-planes-problems-stock-price-shareholders.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymag.com&#x2F;intelligencer&#x2F;article&#x2F;boeing-planes-proble...</a></div><br/><div id="41528391" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41528391" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JackYoustra</span><span>|</span><a href="#41528096">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41528519">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41528391">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41528391">[18 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s kinda fun, right? The whole point of tying executive compensation to share price was to have them have some rough stake in the business, but even that didn&#x27;t prove enough: there&#x27;s always a longer term, and doing a visible, clear NPV boost is usually accretive to market cap even if it introduces long-term risk, because the long term risks are usually hidden from public eye and very mushy.<p>Ironically, I think the poster child for how to properly structure compensation away from this is Hank Greenberg&#x27;s AIG, where not only was his compensation basically all deferred stock options, they were deferred until retirement, so about as long-term a view as you can get. He was very risk-averse, and his biggest flaw wasn&#x27;t under his operational ownership but under successor and personnel selection (looking at you, Welch).<p>But at some level, it was just bad people making bad calls. I don&#x27;t think McNerney thought that this would wreck Boeing, he was just wrong. Even if he was left predictably destitute at the end of such a failure, he probably wouldn&#x27;t have changed his choices because he thought they were good. You could claim that this is a failure of boards and governance (and, truly, I think boards are by and large really bad and I wish there was a much more pervasive activist investor culture) but at some level I&#x27;m not sure how much of this is solvable.<p>I don&#x27;t know. There&#x27;s probably a way to do boards well enough that this isn&#x27;t a problem.</div><br/><div id="41528471" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41528471" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">darby_nine</span><span>|</span><a href="#41528096">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41528391">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41528424">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41528471">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41528471">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We all know boeing won&#x27;t be &quot;wrecked&quot;; they&#x27;re too critical for state interests to be allowed to fail.

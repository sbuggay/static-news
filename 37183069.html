It was apparently a stroke of luck that they still had the source code.<p>Notably, the 2007 version was before huge changes to the game that many original players disliked enough to stop playing. But it was also before the HD version. So OSRS player have been stuck with low quality graphics (however, a modder has recently fixed that. There was some drama over this, Jagex tried to prevent the mod from being allowed, but they backed off).<p>The OSRS version was also pre-neutering of PvP for real-word currency purposes, which happened Dec 2007. I guess this 2009scape would have a neutered Wilderness too. Or perhaps they&#x27;re making some editorial tweaks.<p>2009 still predates many of the wild changes Jagex made that eventually morphed into RS3. Some would be nice to have in OSRS (mining&#x2F;smithing was rehauled in a nice way, some new skills that OSRS players wish they had like Dungeoneering are missing --- but changes like &quot;Evolution of Combat&quot;[1] was a breaking point for many). My understanding is that if they had found the source code circa 2009, Jagex would have used that and OSRS players would have enjoyed HD on day one.<p>Jagex has done a good job with OSRS, running it with just a few people and heavily relying on community feedback in the form of polling content updates. If something does not pass majority opinion, it is not added to the game. They&#x27;ve added multiple new quests, areas, and skilling options under this model, to the point where OSRS is quite distinct from its circa-2007 seed. One thing they can&#x27;t seem to get consensus on though is a new skill - every attempt I&#x27;m aware of has been downvoted by the community, seemingly for reasons similar to &quot;it would devalue my investment in X skill&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runescape.wiki&#x2F;w&#x2F;Evolution_of_Combat" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;runescape.wiki&#x2F;w&#x2F;Evolution_of_Combat</a></div><br/><div id="37184126" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37184126" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lolinder</span><span>|</span><a href="#37183492">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37183879">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37184126">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37184126">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; One thing they can&#x27;t seem to get consensus on though is a new skill - every attempt I&#x27;m aware of has been downvoted by the community, seemingly for reasons similar to &quot;it would devalue my investment in X skill&quot;.<p>Sailing recently got enough votes that they&#x27;ve started development on it:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oldschool.runescape.wiki&#x2F;w&#x2F;Sailing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oldschool.runescape.wiki&#x2F;w&#x2F;Sailing</a><p>I suppose it could still get shut down by the community later.</div><br/><div id="37184230" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37184230" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hoten</span><span>|</span><a href="#37183492">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37184126">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37183879">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37184230">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37184230">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh that&#x27;s exciting!

The appeal of that version of the game is as a whole.  It was not <i>just</i> &quot;the version without the one later change that wasn&#x27;t liked&quot;.  It was the version before the general change in approach.<p>The big problem with the &quot;HD&quot; version was that it was inconsistent.  They couldn&#x27;t update the whole world at once (or chose not to) so they updated it in bits, and those bits often felt really out of place compared to the much more cohesive older style.<p>&gt;2009 still predates many of the wild changes Jagex made that eventually morphed into RS3. Some would be nice to have in OSRS (mining&#x2F;smithing was rehauled in a nice way, some new skills that OSRS players wish they had like Dungeoneering are missing --- but changes like &quot;Evolution of Combat&quot;[1] was a breaking point for many). My understanding is that if they had found the source code circa 2009, Jagex would have used that and OSRS players would have enjoyed HD on day one.<p>Dungeoneering was a (pretty good) minigame forced into the mould of a (pretty bad) skill for essentially no reason.  The mining&#x2F;smithing rework was very recent and not at all good for the game.<p>Contrary to the popular belief of people like you (who seem to be the dominant voice on social media), the desire in the first place for &quot;2007scape&quot; did not originate with JaGEx.  It came from a website very similar to this one, which aimed to recreate a 2005 or 2006 version of the game.  JaGEx saw this desire and found the oldest copy of the RS2 source code they could.  It isn&#x27;t that they would have gone <i>later</i> if they could have.  They would have gone <i>earlier</i> if they could have.  Even 2007 was the beginning of the end for the game.  It was when it started to morph further towards what it is like today: a wholly unlikable game, the players of which are obsessed with grinding to the maximum level in every skill.  That&#x27;s not how people played before they added the level 99 skillcapes in 2006.<p>&gt;Jagex has done a good job with OSRS, running it with just a few people and heavily relying on community feedback in the form of polling content updates.<p>This was true for the first few years but clearly isn&#x27;t true today.  They add a lot of content to the game now.<p>&gt;If something does not pass majority opinion, it is not added to the game. They&#x27;ve added multiple new quests, areas, and skilling options under this model, to the point where OSRS is quite distinct from its circa-2007 seed. One thing they can&#x27;t seem to get consensus on though is a new skill - every attempt I&#x27;m aware of has been downvoted by the community, seemingly for reasons similar to &quot;it would devalue my investment in X skill&quot;.<p>This is evidence that the game is nothing like it was in 2007.  Back then, people loved new skills and the idea of &quot;devaluing my investment&quot; just didn&#x27;t exist.  The awful &quot;xp waste&quot;&#x2F;&quot;grind&quot; mentality of players today is what has driven a lot of players away from the game.  It&#x27;s this sort of mentality where you cannot have a valid opinion on the game unless you&#x27;re at &quot;endgame&quot; and have basically maximum levels in every skill.  That is a World of Warcraft&#x2F;Everquest-style mentality.  &quot;The game starts at endgame&quot;.  &quot;The game is about raiding and killing bosses&quot;.  Just not what RS was originally about at all.<p>Frankly they&#x27;ve changed the game so much since the 2014 revival of &quot;2007&quot;-scape that it is more different today than RS3 was from 2007scape in 2014.  And not for the better.</div><br/><div id="37184063" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37184063" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">insanitybit</span><span>|</span><a href="#37183492">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37183789">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37184020">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37184063">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37184063">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wonder what the impact of social media has been.<p>1. I was on Runscape in the early 2000s. There was no Twitter, Facebook was very new and not really that popular, and nothing else existed. Like, I think <i>Gaia</i> was one of the more popular forums I knew of lol. That meant that Runescape was actually a highly social experience - it&#x27;s insane the kinds of relationships I built as a 14-18 year old who played the game somewhat obsessively. Staying up all night, meeting strangers. Not actually &quot;playing&quot; the game - like, that was something to do for fun, but so much of it was <i>hanging out</i> with people.<p>With social media I get a lot of that from other sites. And in general I don&#x27;t need it as much as I&#x27;m not staying up until 4am anymore lol but man it was something else to socialize through a &quot;forum&quot; like Runescape. Even the organic fact that people could &quot;overhear&quot; your conversations just because they were near you in the game led to so many funny &quot;meet cutes&quot;, for lack of a better term.<p>2. The other side of social media influence is that there&#x27;s a lot more flexing, memeing, and appealing to masses. When I played Runescape it was like... a shameful thing lol, I literally told almost no one at school, and when it came up it was kind of a secret between the few kids who played. It was lame, period , and we did not want to be thought of as lame. No way in hell would I have been posting online about it, nor was there any place to post about it like Reddit - you either posted on the RS boards (probably not tho), or in your clan&#x27;s custom forum that someone set up.<p>But now, re (2), there&#x27;s a lot more room to posture. You can brag way more about your 99s, show them off, show off what you&#x27;re doing etc. And I think that probably leads to a lot more of the &#x27;grind&#x27;, which, again (1) was not the point. The point was to run through the wild with your friends at 4am and get scared when pkers came after you and you&#x27;d lose a bunch of your shit but who cares. The money we made was genuinely just to fuel those good times. No one actually thought they were going to be the next Zezima - I say this as someone who had multiple 99s, it was mostly just for fun. And it&#x27;s interesting that you bring up the capes - all of my 99s were after the capes, they were definitely a part of the ceremony.<p>Viewing RS as a game with an &quot;endgame&quot; or as a game where the points matter is just sort of baffling to me and it&#x27;s a bit of a shame to me that that&#x27;s where it apparently has gone.</div><br/><div id="37184811" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37184811" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tsunagatta</span><span>|</span><a href="#37183492">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37184063">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37184903">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37184811">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37184811">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  Not actually &quot;playing&quot; the game - like, that was something to do for fun, but so much of it was hanging out with people.<p>I think probably far too much about how social media (or, in a broader sense, the mass adoption of the internet) has affected online games like this, and I was really happy to see your point here since this is a thought I&#x27;ve had a lot, but few people seem to understand what I mean when I try to bring it up! I vividly remember a time where people used to just <i>talk</i> in online games a lot more, whereas now most online games feel sorta dead (if they even have a chat option) -- and I suspect that&#x27;s due to the fact that people are either A) playing with people they already know from real life and don&#x27;t see any reason to communicate with anyone else, or B) only communicating with the community on platforms like Reddit, in an asynchronous, &quot;flex&quot;-based way. Imo, that shift is the major reason online games have essentially died out except in the form of competitive multiplayer with ephemeral lobbies.<p>And I&#x27;ve noticed that when I try to explain how things were to people who weren&#x27;t online before the shift happened, they can&#x27;t even picture what it was like, or why it was fun.

For all of these reasons, you don&#x27;t end up with people that would be willing to queue to trade their time for someone else&#x27;s runecrafting experience and a couple of Law runes.</div><br/><div id="37186500" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37186500" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eigenket</span><span>|</span><a href="#37183411">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37185904">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37186520">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37186500">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37186500">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think that most people these days train runecrafting with the &quot;guardians of the rift&quot; minigame.

Private servers are usually for people who want changes to the official game (or removal of changes), and sometimes just to avoid paying subscription fees. This one is aiming to replicate the official state of the game as it was in 2009.<p>It&#x27;s mostly a &quot;grind&quot; sort of game with simplistic combat. It&#x27;s pretty relaxing for the most part, though it does have some tense PvP elements if you enter into some special areas. You can definitely play it fully focused, but most people would conside it a &quot;Second Monitor&quot; game. i.e. You can watch YouTube or do work and keep old-school RuneScape active on a second screen, interacting every minute or so.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37184535" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37184535" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">calvinmorrison</span><span>|</span><a href="#37183246">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37183419">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37184413">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37183880">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37184535">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37184535">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s a large amount of osrs that play &quot;ironman&quot; myself included which prohibits interacting with the economy at all.<p>This is a trade off for me because I would prefer 2006scape or pre market place economy where you had to buy and sell manually by sitting in an area and trade. Automated trading economy made a lot of the content of the game easy to cheat because a good deal of the Quests and such are really just running around picking up obscure items.

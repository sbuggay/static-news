Note that the 12-c is one of a legendary &quot;voyager&quot; series of HP calculators which have that landscape form factor and are highly prized by collectors.  There is an HP15-C scientific calculator equivalent and a 16-C which is supposed to be for programmers so does the sorts of things we programmers do all the time like converting things from hex to octal etc. It has built-in support for bit twiddling and shifting operations too. If you ever see a landscape-style &quot;voyager&quot; HP calculator in a junk shop or whatever and it&#x27;s <i>not</i> a 12-C (because they are quite common) it&#x27;s quite rare and may be worth buying and reselling if it&#x27;s in usable condition.<p>I have 2 HP-12c calculators which I bought while I worked at Goldman. One was always on my desk at work and I had another at home.  I can certainly confirm they were common in finance back in 2000-2009ish. That said even back then they were being replaced by non-RPN calculators for a lot of people and only people with nostalgia and the hardcore had a 12c.<p>They&#x27;re incredibly robust - famously a zookeeper once used an HP12-c to calculate proportions for animal feed, dropped it into the mix and it passed through the digestive tract of a hippo. It was still able to calculate the yield to maturity of a bond after cleaning.<p>In addition their batteries last forever. Even though the versions I have use the &quot;weak&quot; newer battery tech[1] they are both still on their original batteries and as I say mine are about 20 years old and at one point I used one of them every day. Having a slow cpu means they just run forever.<p>I now additionally own two other RPN calculators which I bought because I needed a scientific calculator and have a nostalgia for HP calculators because I used to write little programs for my dad on his. The 12c and the like don&#x27;t have trig functions in particular so I own an HP35s and a swissmicros DM42[2], which is essentially an HP42S emulator with a faster processor and some enhanced capabilities based on Thomas Okken&#x27;s &quot;Free42&quot;[3].  I would strongly recommend the DM42 for anyone who likes HP-style RPN calculators and wants a more powerful version.  It&#x27;s a fabulous calculator. Pretty much the only way the HPs are better is the feel of the keys which is too stiff on the DM42.<p>The HP35s is a great calculator also.  Not as powerful as the DM42 but with that lovely classic HP key feel and a bit more usability for some things at the expense of being much worse to program, much slower and only having a 2-line screen. It does have a nice built-in set of physical constants though (which I never use).<p>[1] The original battery tech uses some sort of legendary toxic battery that is no longer permitted due to hazardous chemical regulations.<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.swissmicros.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;dm42" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.swissmicros.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;dm42</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thomasokken.com&#x2F;free42&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thomasokken.com&#x2F;free42&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="41528734" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41528734" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">inejge</span><span>|</span><a href="#41528086">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41527714">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41528734">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41528734">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>The original battery tech uses some sort of legendary toxic battery that is no longer permitted due to hazardous chemical regulations.</i><p>Alkaline button batteries used to contain mercury, which has been phased out in the last 20-25 years. The original Voyager line used 3 x LR44 (alkaline), but even then you could have replaced them with their less toxic silver-oxide equivalents. Today&#x27;s LR44 cells are mercury-free.<p>Later iterations of HP12C use 2 x CR2032, not because of any concerns about toxicity -- the 2032s were equally toxic -- but, I suspect, because the original battery controller was all custom HP silicon in some funky semi-analog process, which couldn&#x27;t survive when HP, along with the rest of the industry, fully succumbed to cost-cutting disease.

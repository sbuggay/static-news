Think about how &quot;most&quot; companies use tech. Most companies are not big, they have a minimum set of tools to get what they need done. They currently, and routinely, have human mistakes.

On one hand, these were CS undergrads, so naively I would expect their score to be at least a bit higher than the white-collar worker average. On the other hand, these undergrads weren’t actually familiar with most of the software being tested - surely less familiar than GPT-4! And on the other-other hand I would expect an actual IT professional to do better. There is a difficult conflation with subject-matter knowledge and actual intelligence which makes “human-level” especially problematic. “CS undergrad-level” doesn’t roll off the tongue, but “human-level” seems downright misleading.<p>Nevertheless, this is a striking result, indicating categorical weakness in out-of-distribution reasoning. And I think these tasks being so familiar - real human problem-solving where your ability to think makes up for gaps in knowledge - helps illustrate the problem with transformers: they’re just not smart enough.<p>[1] I get very annoyed with discussions about “AGI” for systems that are totally incapable of solving problems that hunter-gatherers need to solve.

Unemployment is 25% and pundits are calling it &quot;the new normal&quot;. You and your wife and your two kids now live with her parents. You share a three bedroom in the suburbs.<p>Every morning you both leave early to stand amongst fifty others outside the local Amazon Mechanical Turk offices. Once a software developer with a thriving career, you&#x27;re now just another face in the crowd, hoping for a day&#x27;s work training AI — your deep knowledge reduced to manual inputs for algorithms you once could have designed.<p>The daily scramble for work, even with your computer science degree, has become a grim routine. The young woman with the tablet doesn’t even meet your eyes as she checks you in. &quot;You&#x27;re training AI for advanced behavioral prediction in smart home systems.&quot;<p>Your wife misses out. Her PHD in physics is no help.<p>There&#x27;s still some good jobs out there, but the supply vastly outstrips demand. Your kids witness the daily tension and uncertainty that you and your wife face, the scramble for sporadic employment, the diminishing returns on your education and experience. This environment is their new normal; they adapt, but at a cost. The stress and instability shape their expectations from life, narrowing their dreams to mere thoughts of making it through each day. They have no idea how great the 90s truly were.<p>This generational shift means that the skills, values, and aspirations that once propelled the middle class are forgotten or dismissed as irrelevant.<p>As the middle class dissolved under the relentless march of AI and automation, the notion of Universal Basic Income (UBI) was quickly dismissed as &quot;unrealistic&quot; and &quot;impossible&quot; by policymakers. Tax rates for the capital-rich continued to plummet, entrenching wealth in the hands of a few. This stark contradiction highlighted a society deeply invested in maintaining the status quo, prioritizing wealth accumulation at the top while the concept of a basic, stabilizing income for the displaced masses easily cast aside as an unfeasible dream.<p>This grim future is not merely possible but an impending reality on our current trajectory, where technological advancements are harnessed to consolidate wealth at the top, and equitable solutions like UBI are dismissed as fantasies. The future promises a deepening divide and escalating societal strife.<p>The idea of a sudden, dramatic loss of jobs sparking immediate and widespread unrest underestimates the more insidious nature of technological displacement. This process is neither swift nor explosive; rather, it unfolds gradually, almost imperceptibly, eroding job security and living standards slowly over years. By the time the consequences fully manifest (soaring unemployment and entrenched wealth inequality) it feels too late to act.</div><br/><div id="40195058" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40195058" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bamboozled</span><span>|</span><a href="#40192624">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40194778">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40192249">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40195058">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40195058">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>Every morning you both leave early to stand amongst fifty others outside the local Amazon Mechanical Turk offices.

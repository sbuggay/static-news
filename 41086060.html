The family and friends were having some kind of get-together celebration maybe a wedding or so and prof. Vaisala&#x27;s wife had bought him a brand new suit to look good for the occasion.<p>During the party they were playing croquet in the garden and prof. Vaisala got really into the game, but had the realization that suit-pants may not be the best for playing croquet. He could have stuffed the end of his pant-legs into his socks but that didn&#x27;t really work, maybe socks were too tight and pants too big. So, he found a pair of scissors somewhere, and cut his pant-legs short. His wife started crying. She didn&#x27;t really appreciate the genius of mathematicians.</div><br/><div id="41088627" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41088627" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mandibeet</span><span>|</span><a href="#41087940">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41086269">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41088627">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41088627">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you for sharing this story!

It would have been possible to admit Russia into NATO, I know it sounds ridiculous but Switzerland was formed out of a having the bully canton join the alliance of smaller cantons that was expressly formed to defend against it. It can be done and there was historical precedent. Not anymore, China and Russia are now so joined at the hip they might as well be considered a single entity. I think the west overestimated its strength, and even now with the posturing for WWIII with fancy and expensive weapons it appears that the West doesn’t understand that warfare has forever changed. I did hope the Houthi conflict would have woken people up to that reality but somehow we’re holding on to this notion that a WWIII is winnable.<p>I should note that I lament the cost of these conflicts to human lives on both sides and wish smarter populations governed by astute politicians would have found ways to successfully avoid war, perhaps at the cost of a multipolar world which we’re likely to get anyway.

I’m pretty sure that’s how the song goes.<p>LOL. Good one, mate.<p>As someone who grew up with the Dick Smith Electronics Fun Way 1 &amp; 2 books, which were dog-eared and well-loved way into the 90&#x27;s, it tickles me to no end that HN occasionally gets articles about this utter genius.<p>And, as a retro-computing enthusiast it is very fun to see someone making the effort to produce a Wizzard clone.  These were very much a &#x27;crossover&#x27; type of device, where you could just use it to game, or learn to program - and it was definitely one of those &#x27;make or break&#x27; situations - you either gamed, or you learned to program.  A friend of mine had one - but he never programmed, because he hated the keyboard... whereas me, with my Oric-1 out there in the bush, had no access to any software - so I had to learn to program, whatever my issues with the chiclet keyboard.<p>As a curator for a retro-computing museum, of course I&#x27;m biased but I think there is definitely a market for re-imagined 8-bit computers.<p>Kids really benefit from digging into these systems and learning how the CPU really works, and 8-bit computers provide a really useful interface to this technology that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming.  We&#x27;ve built systems in the modern era that are so complex and overwhelming - returning to the simplicity of 8-bit computing really makes it a lot more accessible.<p>I for one welcome re-imagined 8-bit computers being released to a new and eager market.  I am constantly being asked where to get one of the machines in the museum collection - systems like the Fenix256 (another re-imagined 8-bit machine) and the MEGA 65 are very welcome new additions to this market, but we need to scale up.<p>I could sell 4 of these machines a week, without even trying - categorically, kids go through my museum exhibit, playing with the old machines (we emphasize having access to the old machines, which still work, for people to have direct contact with the experience) .. and end up asking me where they can get their own.  I&#x27;d <i>love</i> to have the MEGA 65, ZX Spectrum Next, Fenix256 .. and maybe a reinvented Wizzard? .. to offer them on their way out  ..</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

The intention may not to be to one up and yet the other perceives it that way. Or the intention actually could be the one up and the other _doesn&#x27;t_ perceive it that way.<p>Overall I think we talk way too much about getting better at listening and not nearly enough at getting better at talking.<p>EDIT: OK, I can get better at listening&#x2F;reading lol, as the author said the following:<p>&gt; One reason is this myth: that the good listener just listens. This egregious misunderstanding actually leads to a lot of bad listening, and I’ll tell you why: because a good listener is actually someone who is good at talking.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39587890" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39587890" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chacham15</span><span>|</span><a href="#39587682">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39587831">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39587841">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39587890">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39587890">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree that I disagree with this as a blanket statement, but as a baseline, I would agree. The real issue here is <i>why&#x2F;how you&#x27;re relating</i> A lot of people relate poorly. The common mistake is as the author points out: to compare experiences. This comparison is almost never useful. Either your experience was worse, which feels invalidating to a listeners feelings or your experience was not as bad, which feels like an inauthentic relation.<p>IMO relating does a lot better when it serves a purpose useful to the listener. A few that I have found:<p><pre><code>    1. when you&#x27;re validating how they&#x27;ve already expressed how they feel. sometimes people doubt their own feelings and so you can use your own related experience to show them that you felt a very similar way when you were in a similar situation. caveat: dont ever tell them how they should feel, only validate what they&#x27;ve already expressed. also, if theyre not doubting their emotions, dont do this either...its not useful at best

    2. when you&#x27;re trying to understand how they&#x27;re feeling (e.g. one time my dog died and I would just always expect to see her around the corner, but she was never there...is that like what you&#x27;re feeling?)

    3. when you&#x27;re helping out with things that need to be done: (e.g. my parents passed away too, do you want help with sending out funeral invitations &#x2F; finding a cemetery &#x2F; etc)

    4. if they dont know what to do &#x2F; what options are and you relate different experiences about how you may have dealt with a similar situation.
</code></pre>
Caveats:<p><pre><code>    1. Relating without a purpose will come off as a comparison, dont do it.

    2. Not every purpose is valid for every person. A lot of these reasons require that the person trust you to an extent. E.g. offering to help a stranger with their funeral obligations will come off very poorly.

    3. You have to have actual relevant experience with something, trying to shoehorn something tangentially related comes off very poorly.

    4. You have to know how to deliver the related experience

    5. They have to be ready to hear it: if someone is talking, dont interrupt. dont change the topic. only use the solutions above if the person seems like they are looking for it.

    6. tons more.
</code></pre>
In sum, there are reasons to relate, but there are lots of potholes here so its very easy to get wrong. So, as a general statement I would agree, but if you can do these above things well, it can really help people when they may need it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39587841" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39587841" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">avyeed_desa</span><span>|</span><a href="#39587682">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39587890">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39587896">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39587841">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39587841">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This was the only point I also disagreed!

They might be if they would shut up and use the listening time to actually form a better return. Not saying this is you, but saying ‘accumulates information very fast’ about yourself is a somewhat red flag imho.<p>It is rarely the case, even for famous smart people; most listen and then take a bit of time to come back with an answer; interrupting is terrible, more so when it’s not really relevant to what the actual point was (just hanging on to the first sentence and not listening to anything else until you can make your point about that sentence even though that was not the point of the discussion, at all). Or say they have to ponder it somewhat longer instead of having an instant response. Of course it depends on the subject; in political talks it seems more normal to blatantly step on someone talking, but then again, not all talks are political.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39587242" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39587242" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">andxor_</span><span>|</span><a href="#39588001">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39587607">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39587242">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39587242">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; What a different world we’d live in if more boys felt safe sharing feelings, in their own way, right from the start.<p>What if it turned out to be a world much worse than what we have?

That the goal is to detach and have a quiet, steady, peaceful existence, absent of conflict, but also absent of too much connection.<p>And if those groups advocate for more suppression, to start to express more can create some deep conflict and possibility of ostracism or excommunication. For example, many people consider it to be an emotional affair if you say how you honestly feel to someone who is not your exclusive romantic partner. Many families consider it the ultimate betrayal to share family secrets with those outside the family. Etc.<p>So when I think of more men doing it, I worry that if not all men did, then culture could have that strong clash. Maybe we already have it. Some advocating to open up more, to be more aware of how we&#x27;re feeling, and some advocating to go in the opposite direction.<p>I would love to talk about this more and I worry this post is already long enough for now :-)</div><br/></div></div><div id="39587404" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39587404" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Sai_</span><span>|</span><a href="#39587242">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39587275">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39588145">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39587689">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39587404">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39587404">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">(Since we&#x27;re discussing counterfactuals and could-have-beens)<p>In a macabre way, maybe suicidal ideation due to suppressed emotions is nature&#x27;s way of managing male populations?

That being said, tech teams are often rather “quiet” and having that crude loudmouth is often better than having nobody speak their opinions at all.<p>I wouldn’t say it’s valued though. At least not in my experience. What is valued is engineers who can voice their opinions in an assertive and friendly manner. This is because that unlike the crude loudmouth, these people lead to the quiet people joining in. Which can lead to actual discussion and at the very least put forward more opinions from the team, without you having to be the elementary school teacher picking the quiet student in order to hear what they have to contribute.<p>I guess being a crude loudmouth can lead to promotions, but it’s probably also a quick way to become one of those managers&#x2F;architects which are called hot-air balloons or the emperors new clothes behind their backs.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39587187" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39587187" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">amatai</span><span>|</span><a href="#39586923">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39587685">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39587187">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39587187">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is the same reason engineers rub engineers the wrong way.

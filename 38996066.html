Threw away all foods in my house that had preservatives and started to read labels at the store finding foods made with simple to a few natural ingredients.  I increased my daily water intake to almost nothing to 3 liters a day, stopped eating all beef, pork and only eat grilled chicken, fruits, salads, rice, almond milk, breads (grains), avoid fried foods, cut down on dairy, do some type of exercise &amp; or go to the gym daily (though ive always done that but stopped lifting heavy weights .. lots of cardio (running, swimming, lite weights) as kidney cant break down creatine as it use to when you lifted weights) and as mentioned i do my best to avoid taking all&#x2F;any medications.

What they found out during the surgery (because there&#x27;s no high-enough resolution scanning to detect this) was that the S1 nerve was actually &#x27;tethered&#x27; to the slightly bulging L5 disc due to scar tissue that  had become &#x27;sticky&#x27; over a number of years (apparently scar tissue, in areas that get recurring aggravation, can become sticky).<p>(Aside: the initial scar tissue was likely caused by a particularly  memorably nasty football injury, after which I couldn&#x27;t walk properly for a couple of weeks - knee drop the spine - yep, that&#x27;d do it)<p>So, my issue was not actually caused by a bulging disc impinging the nerve. As it turns out, when doing physical activity (tennis, roller skating, trying to catch my misbehaving children) the S1 nerve moves slightly up and down the spinal nerve cavity as you move your legs whilst running, and this movement of the S1 nerve was &#x27;pulling&#x27; on the &#x27;tethered&#x27; L5 disc, causing aggravation and inflammation, and it was this inflammation impinging on the S1 nerve and causing the pain.<p>And since the inflammation came well after the activity it takes a while to realise what&#x27;s happening, such that the cause and the effect are separated by enough time as to make the (secondary) cause (ie. running activity) difficult to diagnose.<p>My pain was caused by inflammation, but that&#x27;s still only a symptom. The  underlying cause, the real thing that actually needed to be fixed, for me, was the S1 nerve&#x2F;L5 disc tethering.<p>Inflammation is not a cause, it&#x27;s a symptom. But it could be a symptom of an individual&#x27;s genetics, and therefore not treatable by anything other than anti-inflammatory drugs.<p>As another anecdote: I get phlegmy after eating certain things. I&#x27;ve heard this is a manifestation of low level allergy to whatever I&#x27;ve eaten. What makes sense to me is that an increased base level of inflammation is a symptom of slight allergy to something environmental.<p>What also makes sense to me is that physical activity reduces inflammation as increasing the flow of blood around the body increases how quickly ones blood is cleansed (by the liver and kidneys and whatever else) of things that may cause inflammation.<p>P.S. The surgery was a success, and I&#x27;m back to leading an active lifestyle - even more active than it would have been as I was able to experience life where movement is pain, and  thus how wonderful it is to be free of that.</div><br/><div id="38996898" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38996898" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">NoPicklez</span><span>|</span><a href="#38996855">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38996978">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38996898">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38996898">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Inflammation is absolutely a symptom and not a cause like you say.<p>Exercise reduces inflammation long term because exercise creates stresses on the body, which signals an inflammatory response to repair and rebuild.

Through enduring the constant repair and build cycle that inflammation flags from muscular and cardiovascular fatigue.<p>It is why so much emphasis is placed on what you do outside of exercise during recovery, than the effort itself.<p>This is all purely in the context of exercise and not other forms of inflammation which the article also covers.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38996978" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38996978" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">firecall</span><span>|</span><a href="#38996855">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38996898">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38997173">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38996978">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38996978">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Interesting!<p>I have similar issues.<p>Did you have an MRI?<p>I have had a couple of MRIs.<p>Still suffering and managing.

The public health system denied surgery because it didn&#x27;t seem to be a bad enough issue as to require surgery. Even the private surgeon I went to said he was 50&#x2F;50 and so it was up to me to decide whether to go ahead with the surgery because, again, the MRI didn&#x27;t show anything particularly extreme. I chose surgery because within myself I knew there was something more extreme that was wrong, and the surgery, even if unsuccessful, would have been a path towards an overall cause &#x2F; diagnosis.<p>I&#x27;m sure my case is fairly exceptional, though. The surgeon specifically came to discuss it with me while I was in recovery.<p>I don&#x27;t want to sway you either way, I&#x27;ve heard more bad stories about back surgery than good ones. Having said that, outside of some kind of disastrous surgery incident, being the age I was, I&#x27;m more likely to heal faster, better, stronger, than if I waited until later in life to have the surgery. I thought long and hard weighing the risks.<p>One thing the MRI showed was that my lower back muscles were noticeably lacking in size - which I think is fairly normal for someone who sits at a desk most of the day. As part of my months-long recovery process I was told to see a physio to work on core strength exercises in order to build the muscles around the abdomen that can help to support the spine and take (some) pressure off the discs. I was also told to do dead lifts to build back strength, but to start very light  - I started at only 5Kg at about 10 weeks after surgery. Make sure you&#x27;ve got the correct stance, otherwise you risk making things worse. I&#x27;ve continued with dead lifts over a few years, much moreso than pilates or core exercises. I aim to keep slightly increasing the weight every couple of months for as long as I can - I&#x27;m up to 50Kg (I lost about 9 months of progress when I broke my wrist a year ago - the risks of an active lifestyle :)).<p>There&#x27;s also a posture aspect to spinal disc pressures - accentuate the natural of your spine to &#x27;feel&#x27; what correct posture feels like (ie the opposite of slumping down in your chair - shoulders back, bum out).<p>A relative of mine swears by pilates for helping with back pain, after having tried both yoga and pilates.<p>Try pilates, try dead lifts. Get someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing (a physiotherapist ) to guide you on proper posture and technique (for both pilates and dead lifts), and once you&#x27;ve got that down you can probably do the rest yourself at home. The heardest part is the self-discipline (a physio won&#x27;t solve your problems, but they can show you what you need to do to solve them).</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38997173" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38997173" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">boringuser2</span><span>|</span><a href="#38996855">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38996928">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38997173">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38997173">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve always generally disliked this thesis because it feels wishy-washy, and, also, pharmaceuticals that suppress inflammation don&#x27;t increase longevity by any appreciable amount, and pharmaceuticals that increase longevity don&#x27;t act directly on inflammatory markers (metformin et al).<p>It all feels geared towards selling you a very vague promise of health and longevity through some obscure supplement or medication.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38996928" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38996928" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AnimalMuppet</span><span>|</span><a href="#38997173">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38997120">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38996928">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38996928">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The opposite of Betteridge&#x27;s Law:  Yes, of course.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38997179" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38997179" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dukeofdoom</span><span>|</span><a href="#38996680">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38996870">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38997179">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38997179">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This seems like it should not work, but who knows.<p>Grounding – The universal anti-inflammatory remedy<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S2319417022001706" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S231941702...</a></div><br/><div id="38998096" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38998096" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">unsupp0rted</span><span>|</span><a href="#38997179">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38996870">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38998096">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38998096">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It’s not impossible “grounding” turns out to be a thing, but every sentence of this article reads like hand-wavey pseudoscience.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38996870" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38996870" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">duttonw</span><span>|</span><a href="#38997179">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38996870">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38996870">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Most inflammation that people have is from the food they eat and when they eat (plus if they over eat).<p>The human body is great at storing everything for a rainy day and that includes bits of dead cell&#x27;s which have protein&#x27;s that body could reuse if it required.<p>When we don&#x27;t follow a natural cycle of fasting, we don&#x27;t recycle what&#x27;s needs to be properly disposed of and is a bit like dead wood ready for a forest fire.<p>The other component that people miss is that certain items should not be in our blood stream and only contained within our cells.

This mess they expel causes the immune system to fire up and in trying to clean up said mess causes inflammation.<p>Another interesting tidbit is that spinach and other similar foods once consumed in high enough quantities (as little as 1&#x2F;2 a cup a week) causes little needle (Oxalates) like structures to form in our bodies, this is really bad when its in our joints.

This time period was peak &quot;corporate engineering&quot; culture imho. During this period I felt like a stranger in my own field.<p>In my entire career I had never cared about &quot;leveling&quot; and suddenly I found a world of people obsessed with it. Engineers were being hired en masse so your actual skills mattered little (you were going to be solving real problems, you were there to boost your managers head count), but your ability to &quot;play the game&quot; was everything. I figured out the rules, and had my bit of success but working in tech sucked in this time period (aside from comp). The worst part was that this infected companies of all sizes.<p>While you can still play the FAANG-game today if you want, it&#x27;s increasingly become not required and I&#x27;m seeing more and more teams hiring people based on technical skills and the ability to solve real and actual problems. Weird smart people are starting to be in demand again (rather than pariah&#x27;s because they couldn&#x27;t perform the shibboleths required to fit-in). My last two companies had no &quot;leveling&quot; and were much better for it.<p>Hopefully we&#x27;ll return to a time when people are exited for a role because it offers interesting problems to solve rather than chasing some meaningless career ladder.</div><br/><div id="41755665" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41755665" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wonnage</span><span>|</span><a href="#41755453">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41755760">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41755665">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41755665">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I feel like the entire industry decided to just copy Google&#x27;s career ladder in 2012 and now we have a bunch of titles pulled out of thin air.

Technically curious people reaching out to teams working on hard problems is a strong signal for those teams. But the key is, don&#x27;t present yourself as looking for work, show you&#x27;re interested in the same problem and have skills that will help.<p>One caveat: if you&#x27;re expected in FAANG style TC, then you won&#x27;t be able to find great teams.

They come from a perfect world, where every problem is solved in 50 lines or less, and will not need to be maintained.<p>I have known <i>many</i> folks that constantly practice these, and are extremely good at them. Many practice sites, optimize for target companies, advising on how to solve in a manner each is looking for.<p>They also frequently optimize for recent school graduates, as these types of problems are almost exactly how software development is taught.<p>In my case, I write code for <i>shipping</i> software, every single day (including weekends. Today, I am working on a backend admin tool for a shipping app), and have been, for many, many years.<p>Just about every single day, I have a problem, that, if I don’t solve it, will mean that I can’t ship whatever I’m working on. Often, the solution requires that I learn something new, or unlearn something that I <i>just know</i> is The Right Way to Do It. So I’m usually humbled, every single day.<p>This also takes time; sometimes, quite a lot of time. I don’t really have the bandwidth to practice code that is irrelevant to solving my daily existential programming crises. Many times, learning the new techniques required to solve the issue, involves LC-style exercises, but focused on addressing a very real-world problem, so I guess I do practice.<p>But I am aware that today’s software industry isn’t really interested in folks like me. They want armies of short-timers that will make relatively small contributions to massive codebases that will outlive them. I’m not particularly interested in that kind of work. I really enjoy what I do. I enjoy it so much, that I do it for free, as no one is interested in paying folks to do it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41755444" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41755444" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zabzonk</span><span>|</span><a href="#41755198">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41755164">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41755444">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41755444">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Is there a concept of Staff-level titles?<p>Not anywhere I ever worked or consulted at, and the article never seems to explain what she means by it.</div><br/><div id="41755816" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41755816" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Cthulhu_</span><span>|</span><a href="#41755444">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41755587">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41755816">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41755816">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The article links to another one that has a breakdown in Tech Lead, Architect, Solver, and Right-Hand: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;staffeng.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;staff-archetypes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;staffeng.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;staff-archetypes&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41755587" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41755587" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jaggederest</span><span>|</span><a href="#41755444">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41755816">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41755575">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41755587">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41755587">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Staff software engineer is a title I see that means something that used to be &quot;tech lead&quot; (or is a promotion above &quot;tech lead&quot; in a single team, to handling multiple) in my opinion.<p>It is also used (incorrectly, imo) as a simple promotion above senior software engineer.<p>I think it&#x27;s a different sort of job than being an individual contributor, more about growing people, growing the health of the engineering organization, technical liaison to other parts of the company, and promoting engineering productivity and quality.<p>I also think that, if you&#x27;re a staff software engineer and you don&#x27;t write code, it&#x27;s kind of bonkers.

The feedback given was absolutely baffling and just goes to show it&#x27;s really a crapshoot applying at these larger companies. If you get someone reviewing your code who clearly doesn&#x27;t want to be there, doesn&#x27;t know the language, and is too lazy to learn the absolute basics, then you&#x27;re screwed. I&#x27;ve held numerous Head of Engineering and CTO roles, as well as several team lead roles prior to this. This is the same coding challenge that is given for junior roles, and is <i>not</i> leetcode. I&#x27;m just staring at the written response in disbelief. There&#x27;s no path forward from here, bad luck, move on:<p>&gt; <i>Thank you for your submission. Your README was clear and concise, and included instructions on how to run the tests along with your assumptions and design decisions.  You were able to analyse the requirements to produce a working solution, however the design was confusing, with components that interacted with each other in strange ways.</i><p>&gt; <i>There was a lack of test coverage on a domain model level. At a technical design level, the interface was not clear and confusing. This was due to not knowing where the main entry point for the provided solution was.  </i><p>&gt; <i>We liked that you included an integration test for the scenario outlined in the exercise, however, we also found gaps in the testing, for example depositing or withdrawing with non-existent accounts.</i><p>I can&#x27;t reveal the company or coding challenge details without giving away too much information. But needless to say the coding challenge specifically states not to implement a CLI or user interface of any kind. So when the reviewer couldn&#x27;t find the entry point, what they really meant was they weren&#x27;t familiar with JUnit! They also didn&#x27;t take the time to fully read the &quot;clear and concise&quot; README which stated:<p>&gt; <i>We&#x27;re building a JVM library, and executing some tests. There&#x27;s no application and therefore no explicitly defined main
entry point — just the tests.</i><p>There was of course also the precise CLI command (`.&#x2F;gradlew test`) required to execute the tests, a short explanation of the build system and why it was chosen. Additionally included was an explanation of how to run and debug the tests in an IDE. Plus all the standard stuff like documentation for the domain model and functional behavior of the APIs.<p>The feedback about &quot;depositing or withdrawing with non-existent accounts&quot; also makes no sense and demonstrate the reviewer is totally unfamiliar with Kotlin. There&#x27;s no input (no CLI or GUI), so there&#x27;s no way to provide a &quot;non-existent&quot; account. The APIs are strongly typed and non-nullable. (There&#x27;s also explicitly no account deletion or multi-threading to worry about).<p><i>Sigh!</i><p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I&#x27;m sure the code was far from perfect. I don&#x27;t believe in such a thing and LOVE learning new things in code reviews. But my gosh, this is a company that has a truly brilliant Kotlin engineering department at their disposal. Unfortunately, with organizations of this size, all it takes is some part of your application to randomly land in the hands of the wrong person and it&#x27;s game over.</div><br/><div id="41755528" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41755528" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crystal_revenge</span><span>|</span><a href="#41755378">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41755682">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41755528">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41755528">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">At the peak of the meaningless hiring frenzy period in tech (when people were just shoveling bodies through interview funnels), I had to learn how to guess what the interviewer knew and thought was the correct answer.

Maybe they meant staff engineer as in very senior IC who does not manage? If this is the case your role is to be strategic. You might write production code, you might design architecture. Whatever your current project(s) they will have wide reaching business impact. Asking difficult questions that may make people uncomfortable is very much part of this role. Yes these roles are seldom hired in to by first timers. But once you&#x27;ve be in one before, being hired externally is possible. I have a hard time believing that this person could do this type role at this point in their career (yes it was 2020 so adjust accordingly).<p>I&#x27;ll leave the below since it might be useful for someone seeking a mid-level career.<p>--<p>I think they are equating a staff engineer with a mid-level engineer. They say that companies don&#x27;t hire for this role but in my 26 years of working this has not been my experience. Granted, I focused on &lt; 1000 employee companies because I liked the transparency, mobility, and influence I had there.<p>I don&#x27;t know what kind of role they were looking for, but not wanting to write production code in a software company usually means you are going to be in a support role. These are often not traditional software engineering roles. You don&#x27;t have to have a college degree, but you need to know the material. Programming is a skill just like anything. You have to practice.<p>Interviewing is an inexact, unfair process. Keep trying, doing as many as your sensitivity to rejection allows.<p>The thing that many applicants don&#x27;t know is that many parts of a positions requirements that seem fixed are actually flexible.<p>Focus on good communication skills, listen well, and demonstrate concretely how you exemplify the skills they&#x27;re looking for. Often the how and the why matter more then the what.<p>Recruiters usually know very little about what they&#x27;re searching for. Yet they are the first line filter. Say what ever you need to say to move past them. But be mindful that they will often report what you say to the interview panel or hiring manager. Telling them an outright lie can be a bad idea.<p>Leetcode exercises aren&#x27;t fun and they&#x27;re a time sink. You can and should practice for them. In many cases they are a first line screen to filter out the noncoders. If you&#x27;re considering searching for a solution and cutting and pasting it as your answer, know that leetcode has basic tools to detect this. They track your time and keystrokes.<p>Most teams have a balance of dead weight, followers, doers, and leaders. There are usually more of the former than the later. This plays in your favor if looking for a mid-level role.<p>Good luck out there.</div><br/><div id="41755521" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41755521" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">timr</span><span>|</span><a href="#41755410">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41755442">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41755521">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41755521">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; If you&#x27;re considering searching for a solution and cutting and pasting it as your answer, know that leetcode has basic tools to detect this.

You’ve highlighted tools and techniques that can be used to solve problems and puzzles.

Instead, you are quizzed in a closed environment on a question you have no context for before the interview (i.e. no time to research the problem space). You are given a hard time limit to solve a problem perfectly with a proctor who can range from being a helpful teammate to a stone wall who just says &quot;this is wrong&quot; or &quot;this isn&#x27;t the solution I wanted&quot;. And if you pass that it says nothing about your ability to perform what was actually on the job description. Who wins here?<p>And the kicker is you may not even get a leetcode question in my domain to begin with. So all that trivia study could be wasted and you fail on some deep C++ deep dive or math questions or any other number of tooling questions. every company is different and they all treat these &quot;problem solving&quot; like we&#x27;re still in high school and can &quot;cheat&quot; the answer.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41755311" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41755311" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">abc-1</span><span>|</span><a href="#41755263">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41755486">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41755311">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41755311">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">From everything I’ve read, that seems to be the name of the game on anything beyond senior.

This leads to false positives turning into major frustrations since it&#x27;s hard to get in touch with a person to resolve the issue. When dealing with businesses it&#x27;s frustrating, but as these get more used in law enforcement, this could be life ruining.<p>For instance - I got flagged as illegal reviews on Amazon years ago and spent months trying to make my case to a human. Every year or so I try to raise the issue again to leave reviews, but it gets nowhere. Imagine this happening for a serious criminal issue, with the years long back log on some courts, this could ruin someones life.<p>More automatic detection can work (and honestly, it&#x27;s inevitable) but it&#x27;s got to acknowledge that false positives will happen and allocate enough people to resolve those issues. As it stands right now, these detection systems get built and immediately human case workers get laid off, there&#x27;s this assumption that detection systems REPLACE humans, but it should be that they augment and focus human case workers so you can do more with less - the human aspect needs to be included in the budgeting.<p>But the incentives aren&#x27;t there, and the people making the decisions aren&#x27;t the ones working the actual cases so they aren&#x27;t confronted with the problem. For them, the question is why save $1m when you could save $2m? With large AI models making it easier and more effective to build automated detection I expect this problem to get significantly worse over the next years.</div><br/><div id="42746590" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42746590" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">drysine</span><span>|</span><a href="#42744066">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42744353">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42746590">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42746590">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Imagine this happening for a serious criminal issue, with the years long back log on some courts, this could ruin someones life.<p>It can be much scarier.<p>There was a case in Russia when a scientist was accused in a murder that happened 20 years ago based on 70% face recognition match and fake identification as an accomplice by a criminal.

You’re literally having a “conversation” with the servers of companies that built their entire product line using other people’s professional and personal output whether they approved, or even knew about it or not. Less a “it’s better to ask for forgiveness than permission” sort of thing than a “we’d rather just not ask and be pretty cagey about it if they ask, and then if they prove it, tell them they tacitly agreed to it by not hiding it from us even though they had no way to know we were looking at it“ sort of thing. Frankly I’m astonished that open ai, specifically, promises as much as they do in their privacy policy. Based on their alleged bait-and-switch tactics quietly swapping out models or reducing compute for paying customers after the initial “gee wiz look at that” press cycle, I can’t imagine those privacy policies will have much longevity when the company gets a more stable footing… and whooops looks like they figured out how to extract the training data from the models! And it’s different data since we extracted it from the model so the old privacy policy doesn’t apply! Haha sorry, that’s business and we’re building a techno utopian society here, so you should feel honored to be included! You think Altman wouldn’t sell that in a <i>heartbeat</i> to try and fund some big moonshot product if they get clobbered in the marketplace? Never mind the sketchy girlfriend-in-an-app-class chatbots.<p>Don’t get me wrong — I absolutely think the privacy SHOULD be there, but I’m just shocked that anyone would assume it was.

Currently proposed:<p>- &quot;Child Sexual Abuse Material&quot;, which is a growing category that now includes AI-generated images in the US and may soon extend to Japanese animation.<p>- Threats against important individuals. This may be extended to include what used to be considered political speech in the US.<p>- Threats against the government. Already illegal in many countries. Bear in mind that Trump likes to accuse people of &quot;treason&quot; for things other than making war against the United States.<p>- &quot;Grooming&quot; of minors, which is vague enough to cover most interactions.<p>- Discussing drugs, sex, guns, gay activity, etc. Variously prohibited in some countries.<p>- Organizing protests or labor unions. Prohibited in China and already searched for.<p>Note that talking around the issue or jargon won&#x27;t evade censorship. LLMs can deal with that. Run some ebonics or leetspeak through an LLM and ask it to translate it to standard English. Translation will succeed.

It does not matter if your model is running locally, or if it uses trusted cloud hardware — once a sufficiently-powerful general-purpose agent has been deployed on your phone, the only question that remains is who is given access to talk to it. Will it be only you? Or will we prioritize the government’s interest in monitoring its citizens over various fuddy-duddy notions of individual privacy.<p>I do think there are interesting policy questions there. I mean it could hypothetically be mandated that the government must be given access to the agent (in the sense that we and these companies exist in jurisdictions that can pass arbitrary laws; let’s skip the boring and locale specific discussion of whether you think your local government would pass such a law).<p>But, on a technical level—it seems like it ought to be possible to run an agent locally, on a system with full disk encryption, and not allow anyone who doesn’t have access to the system to talk with it, right? So on a technical level I don’t see how this is any different from where we were previously. I mean you could also run a bunch of regex’s from the 80’s to find whether or not somebody has, whatever, communist pamphlets on their computers.<p>There’s always been a question of whether the government should be able to demand access to your computer. I guess it is good to keep in mind that if they are demanding access to an AI agent that ran on your computer, they are basically asking for a lossy record of your entire hard drive.</div><br/><div id="42743190" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42743190" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cryptonector</span><span>|</span><a href="#42741104">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42742153">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42743190">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42743190">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The author helpfully emphasized the interesting question at the end<p>We&#x27;re already there.

&gt; a technical guarantee is different from a user promise. [...] End-to-end encrypted messaging systems are intended to deliver data securely. They don’t dictate what happens to it next.<p>Then Green seems to immediately forget the point they just made, and proceed to talk about PCC as if it were something other than just another technical guarantee.  PCC only helps to increase confidence that the software running on the server is the software <i>Apple</i> intended to be there.  It doesn&#x27;t give me any guarantees about where <i>else</i> my data might be transferred from there, or whether Apple will only use it for purposes I&#x27;m okay with.  PCC makes Apple less vulnerable to hacks, but doesn&#x27;t make them any more transparent or accountable.  In fact, to the extent that some hackers hack for pro-social purposes like exposing corporate abuse, increased security also serves as a better shield <i>against</i> accountability.  Of course, I&#x27;m not suggesting that we should do away with security to achieve transparency.  I am, however, suggesting that transparency, moreso than security, is the major unaddressed problem here.  I&#x27;d even go so far as to say that the woeful state of security is enabled in no small part <i>by</i> lack of transparency.  If we want AI to serve society, then we must reverse the extreme information imbalance we currently inhabit wherein every detail of each person&#x27;s life is exposed to the service provider, but the service provider is a complete black-box to the user.

Then later,<p>&gt; <i>On the one hand they can (1) send plaintext off to a server, in the process resurrecting many of the earlier vulnerabilities that end-to-end encryption sought to close. Or else (2) they can limit their processing to whatever can be performed on the device itself.</i><p>We&#x27;re still confusing &quot;transmit plaintext&quot; with plaintext being available to the server; the clear option of &quot;use TLS&quot; is omitted. It doesn&#x27;t really undermine the argument — the server would still have access to the data, and could thus maliciously train AI on it — but it is surprising for a &quot;cryptographer&quot;.<p>&gt; <i>For example, imagine that Apple keeps its promise to deliver messages securely, but then your (Apple) phone goes ahead and uploads (the plaintext) message content to a different set of servers where Apple really can decrypt it. Apple is absolutely using end-to-end encryption in the dullest technical sense… yet is the statement above really accurate? Is Apple keeping its broader promise that it “can’t decrypt the data”?</i><p>No, no reasonable person would believe that (though I am sure that if the scenario ever came to be, Apple, or whoever, would likely argue &quot;yes&quot;) since it would utterly scuttle the term &quot;E2EE&quot;. If you say &quot;Our product supports X&quot;, and then have to caveat away 100% of what makes X X, then it&#x27;s just grift, plain and simple.

If you&#x27;re working on a game and the words &quot;gang of four&quot; pop into your head you unfortunately have suffered permanent brain damage. The main problem with this book is that it focuses on things that are not actually issues for game development. Instead of deep knowledge you learn trivial factoids.<p>You don&#x27;t need or want a service locator in most cases, but if you read a book like this you&#x27;ll be trained that it&#x27;s some necessary and integral part of game development. If you can figure out how to draw trees, you can also figure out how not to duplicate their mesh&#x2F;texture 200 times with their &quot;flyweight pattern&quot;. You almost certainly don&#x27;t want a bytecode interpreter in your game. You shouldn&#x27;t be thinking in terms of prototypes. The only useful &quot;pattern&quot; in the book is the singleton, and hedged with &quot;Despite noble intentions, the Singleton pattern described by the Gang of Four usually does more harm than good.&quot;.<p>It teaches complete beginners to think incorrectly about how games should be developed, but it covers enough topics will entertain people. If you want a book, I would suggest &quot;Game Engine Architecture&quot; because it goes much more in depth on what actually goes into a game engine instead of abstract design patterns from textbooks that are somewhere between maliciously bad and incompetent.</div><br/><div id="39451606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39451606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">toppy</span><span>|</span><a href="#39451421">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39451294">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39451606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39451606">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are you referring to this one? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gameenginebook.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gameenginebook.com&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39451294" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39451294" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sigmoid10</span><span>|</span><a href="#39451421">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39451320">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39451294">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39451294">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s already very difficult to say what amounts to &quot;good&quot; patterns in game programming and even more so if it comes from one of the most mediocre studios in EA&#x27;s portfolio. Of course financial&#x2F;critical success and code quality can be totally uncorrelated, but for people who actually want to get to get a grip on game programming, there are very good free resources out there. One of the most insightful ones I&#x27;ve found are the dev streams of Thor from PirateSoftware. He streams on Twitch and you can also find a bunch of his stuff on youtube. He&#x27;s one of the few people out there who tells you what you actually need to know if you really want to make a game and not just screw around with experiments.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39451320" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39451320" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wokwokwok</span><span>|</span><a href="#39451294">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39451252">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39451320">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39451320">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Usually when this pops up I drop in to tell people not to waste their time with it, but, people are relentlessly drawn to free content, no matter how questionable it is.<p>Instead, today I&#x27;ll link to <i>different</i> free content that is actually useful advice by people who know what they&#x27;re talking about: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.unity.com&#x2F;games&#x2F;level-up-your-code-with-game-programming-patterns" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.unity.com&#x2F;games&#x2F;level-up-your-code-with-game-pr...</a><p>...also, checkout the link at the bottom to their forum where there&#x27;s some (reasonably) thoughtful commentary on it by folk who&#x27;ve been down that rabbit hole themselves; including why &quot;Game Programming Patterns&quot; misses the boat in at least some respects.</div><br/><div id="39451364" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39451364" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hacful-tonteg</span><span>|</span><a href="#39451320">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39451252">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39451364">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39451364">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">could you summarize what&#x27;s wrong with the book?</div><br/><div id="39451435" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39451435" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wokwokwok</span><span>|</span><a href="#39451320">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39451364">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39451252">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39451435">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39451435">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The patterns (eg. Implementing a scripting language, double buffering, components) aren’t things you would use unless you were implementing a <i>game engine</i>, and are actively <i>anti patterns</i> if you are using an existing engine like godot, unity or unreal.<p>Many are “generic advice” that does not apply; singletons, for example are an anti pattern in unity and other engines (due to scene loading) resetting world objects.<p>Some of the other patterns are legitimate (eg state machines) but trivialise a complex domain (AI) and are cover far better and more comprehensively by specific resources on the topic.<p>It also fails to address <i>actual</i> programming patterns that <i>actual gamedevs</i> use like GPU kernels, ECS (<i>real ecs</i>) or deterministic simulations.<p>Patterns are not just magic sauce you sprinkle on and <i>bam</i> it’s a great game! Complexity solved! Use them thoughtfully to solve actual problems, when you need them.<p>This just very generic advice, like “how to write unit tests” with no specific language or engine or framework.<p>Yes, <i>in general</i> test are good, and “your test runner and package manager here can help you run tests” but the advice is deeply lacking if you want to try use it for writing actual tests in c++.<p>…but hey, read the 10 or so previous HN threads on it. People have had opinions on it since the beginning of time, when it was first posted.

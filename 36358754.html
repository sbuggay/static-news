Thank you for saying it is an excellent read — that was no small amount of work.<p>You ask “Where is the productive output of all these arbitrage shell games?”, which is a very fair question. The purpose of financial markets, sometimes but not always wholly achieved, is to transfer risks to those best able to hold them. E.g., you are not the optimal person to hold the risk that, through no fault of your own, your house burns down. That risk exists, and you are not the optimal holder of it. Hence insurance. A Lincolnshire farmer — and yes, I like the non-abstract solidly of the example — is not the optimal holder of the ‘risk’ that the Australian and Kansas wheat harvests are super-bountiful. Markets allow that risk to be transferred to a non-farmer better able to hold the risk.<p>Of course, with markets come some ‘unproductive’ stuff. Likewise, democracy is good, but that is not necessarily praising the optimality of all parts of campaign finance legislation.<p>Let me also mention that I am the author of the definitive reference book on old Vintage Port: Port Vintages (and seemingly the board disallows a link).</div><br/><div id="36366709" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36366709" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">FabHK</span><span>|</span><a href="#36362703">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36364466">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36364544">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36366709">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36366709">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The purpose of financial markets, sometimes but not always wholly achieved, is to transfer risks to those best able to hold them.<p>That is just one of the purposes; others are:<p>- time-shifting of consumption: borrow when you study or build a house, then invest and save during work years, then live of retirement portfolio<p>- maturity transformation enabling investment: extra cash goes in the bank (and can be redeemed on demand), is bundled and lent (long-term) to fund construction or businesses [1]<p>- allocative function: send capital to its most productive use.

Markets allow that risk to be transferred to a non-farmer better able to hold the risk.<p>Are you familiar with the arguments of (more popularly) Aaron Brown and (transitively) Jeffrey Williams?<p>Essentially, the idea that a farmer would be an active participant in a futures market is quaint, but the vast majority of activity is speculation. This is not a contradiction of your point, but an elaboration of a counter-intuitive part of it.<p>One might look at a futures market and see that well over 98 % of the activity is buying and selling by people who never have any reason to care about wheat other than for the possibility of its price going up or down. But this large-scale speculation is precisely the thing that makes it possible for a farmer to hedge (by providing liquidity and a motive for the counterpart of the hedge) or, as Williams&#x27; points out, perhaps more commonly &quot;take out loans in commodities&quot; for their convenience yield.<p>Essentially, the Lincolnshire farmer can lock in a price with a plain forward contract. However, that does take a double coincidence of demands (or whatever the phrase is) and the standardised nature of futures contracts help avoid that problem.<p>But! The most common use of futures contracts (aside from speculation) is not (or at least was not, when Williams wrote his book) hedging, but effectively borrowing and lending in commodities.</div><br/><div id="36367161" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36367161" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lxgr</span><span>|</span><a href="#36362703">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36367127">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36367343">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36364804">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36367161">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36367161">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; the vast majority of activity is speculation<p>Where do you draw the line between (useful) arbitrage and &quot;pure speculation&quot;?<p>Much of what is commonly known as speculation is actually an important mechanism for price quality or liquidity.<p>Obviously there are limits, and there are ample opportunities for making a one-sided profit without regulations, but people often seem to miss the value that arbitrageurs tangibly provide to them: Being able to exchange foreign currency at very tight spreads almost 24&#x2F;7; being able to buy and sell even not commonly traded stocks etc. are often a function of that.</div><br/><div id="36367297" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36367297" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kqr</span><span>|</span><a href="#36362703">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36367161">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36364804">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36367297">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36367297">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think you and I are saying the same thing!

The central problem of economics is &quot;How do you produce the things that your population needs, in the quantity and at the time they need them, as efficiently as possible?&quot;  This is why every centrally-planned economy eventually fails, and why we were stuck in the feudal middle ages for a millennia.  Information (and <i>incentives</i>) about what to produce and how to produce it efficiently weren&#x27;t getting to the population at large, which caught us in a local subsistence minima.  Financial markets give all the players an incentive (in the form of profit) to transmit information (in the form of prices) from people who want goods to people who can supply them.<p>This is also behind the theory of why certain forms of financial transactions are legal and others are illegal.  Arbitrage = legal, because it converges prices in two separate markets in a way that gives producers in both those markets better information about true demand.  Futures markets = legal, because they smooth out temporal fluctuations in demand so that producers only have to worry about producing, while also incentivizing the construction of just enough storage &amp; buffering to hold that product.  Pump &amp; dump schemes = illegal, because they distort price information in the market in an unsustainable way and then leave later participants to bear the cost of this.  Same with Ponzi schemes.  Equities markets = legal, because they transmit information about the overall cost of capital within the economy to firms, which can then use it to decide the profitability or unprofitability of various investments.</div><br/><div id="36365194" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36365194" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">panarky</span><span>|</span><a href="#36362703">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36364499">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36362856">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36365194">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36365194">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; solely for information transmission</i><p>Certainly one function of financial markets and prices is to convey information, but that&#x27;s not &quot;solely&quot; their purpose. They also provide a mechanism for resource allocation, risk management, wealth generation and collective action, among other things.<p>Your point about centrally planned economies, while historically corroborated in cases like the Soviet Union, might be an overgeneralization. The effectiveness of an economic system depends on numerous factors, including its degree of flexibility, the effectiveness of its institutions, and its ability to adapt to changing circumstances.<p>Not all centrally planned economies are doomed to failure; some have been quite successful, notably in East Asia where countries like China and Vietnam have managed a mixed economy with elements of central planning and market mechanisms.<p>Many capitalist corporations are centrally planned economies larger than many nation states. While everything fails eventually, these centrally planned organizations can last multiple human generations, and can be more durable than many markets and market-oriented economies.<p>The assertion about the feudal Middle Ages also needs some nuance. The Middle Ages, and the feudal system in particular, had complexities beyond simple information and incentive problems. Numerous sociopolitical factors were at play, including a rigid class structure, the influence of the Church, and the lack of certain technological innovations. Ascribing the issues of a historical period mainly to its economic structure oversimplifies the multitude of factors that influenced societal development.<p>Moreover, while financial markets do help in transmitting information from consumers to producers, they are not infallible. They can, and often do, suffer from issues like information asymmetry, where one party in a transaction has more or better information than the other. This can lead to problems like adverse selection and moral hazard. Financial markets can also be subject to speculation, which can distort the &quot;signal&quot; provided by prices.<p>The focus on profit as the sole incentive in the market might be somewhat limited. People&#x27;s decisions to buy, sell, and produce are influenced by a host of factors beyond profit, including societal and environmental concerns, personal values, and ethical considerations. Financial systems, to be truly effective, need to take into account this wide range of motivations.</div><br/><div id="36365729" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36365729" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nostrademons</span><span>|</span><a href="#36362703">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36365194">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36362856">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36365729">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36365729">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Resource allocation, risk management, and collective action are all information transmission problems.

You mitigate risk on speculation by hedging. I&#x27;ll try and give a similarly simple (if not perfectly accurate and far more lengthy) explanation. Someone mentioned farming financials in the comments around this, so we&#x27;ll use that. It&#x27;s also something I know well, as I know a lot of farmers.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine that a commercial farmer, whom we&#x27;ll call Jeremy plants 100 acres of wheat on a farm. Market values for wheat (and everything else you can farm, from livestock to grains and so on) vary and move constantly, as a function of supply and demand. We saw this in an extreme form with the invasion of the Ukraine, and the droughts in Italy last year.<p>Now the problem with farming is your timescales are long compared to the movements of values for your product in the market, so you&#x27;ve no real idea as to what what you&#x27;re planting will be worth by the time the bloody thing has actually grown and you&#x27;ve got it harvested and into barns to be sold. And once the seed is in the ground, you can&#x27;t exactly just plough it all over and plant something else (not strictly accurate, but you don&#x27;t want to go down that route).<p>So now let&#x27;s fast forward. Jeremy now harvests his wheat, and let&#x27;s say the price has moved up a lot between planting and harvest. Jeremy is a happy man, who&#x27;s going to have a bumper time, even if his crop doesn&#x27;t produce as much per acre as he might like at the minute, because it&#x27;s not raining enough. Or conditions are perfect, and the price has gone up, and he makes a huge amount and can reinvest. Jeremy is a happy camper.<p>However, if the price falls, Jeremy is not going to be quite so chipper. As such, Jeremy can move his risk, through the use of a hedge. Let&#x27;s say Jeremy hunts around to find someone to buy his wheat at the start of the season. He might sign a contract with a flour producer, stating that they will promise to buy x tonnes of his grain at £y per tonne. Jeremy now has a fixed price, which has hedged his risk profile. Now his risk has moved from financial to productive - he has to be able to provide the x tonnes. If he can&#x27;t produce it all on the farm, he needs to source the difference. On the other hand, if he&#x27;s a good farmer, and the farm produces well, and he doesn&#x27;t over-extend his risk on what he&#x27;s committing to, he now has a fixed price contract for his goods, <i>which isn&#x27;t going to fluctuate based on time</i> (assuming the contract is honoured - if he&#x27;s worried about that, Jeremy could then buy insurance on the risk of a default on the contract, but that then gets complex). This is a very good thing, but means if the market prices his wheat vastly higher than he expected, he&#x27;ll miss out on that upside.<p>This is called a forward contract. There&#x27;s other types of contract which can be used to do similar things (futures, derivatives...) but that gets a bit more complex.</div><br/><div id="36363562" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36363562" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Utkarsh_Mood</span><span>|</span><a href="#36362703">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36363347">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36363104">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36363562">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36363562">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; On the other hand, if he&#x27;s a good farmer, and the farm produces well, and he doesn&#x27;t over-extend his risk on what he&#x27;s committing to, he now has a fixed price contract for his goods, which isn&#x27;t going to fluctuate based on time (assuming the contract is honoured - if he&#x27;s worried about that, Jeremy could then buy insurance on the risk of a default on the contract<p>So basically a third party would step in to assure him that he&#x27;d be paid the fixed price for a small fee?

(As a massive scale version of this, see 2007&#x2F;2008 financial crash. That&#x27;s basically what happens when counterparties default at scale and insurance contracts have to pay out everywhere, to the level that the insurers themselves have to be rescued.)<p>Simple example - let&#x27;s say the contract is for 100 tonnes of wheat at £175 a tonne. So Jeremy should get £17,500 for the wheat he&#x27;s contracted to deliver. Now let&#x27;s say that Jeremy has the 100 tonnes ready to go, but the flour merchant can&#x27;t&#x2F;won&#x27;t pay up. Maybe he&#x27;s in financial troubles, maybe Jeremy ran off with his wife, who knows. But for whatever reason, he refuses to pay.<p>Now let&#x27;s also imagine two scenarios - one in which the price of wheat has gone up, and one where it&#x27;s gone down. In the former, Jeremy is actually happy with this, as he can now sell his grain on the open market for more than the contract, and claim the insurance payout on the contract. On the other hand, if the price went down, Jeremy still has to sell his grain, but he might only get £100 a tonne, which is going to result in a loss of £7,500. At this point Jeremy is very glad of the insurance.<p>Now the interesting bit is the insurer has the estimate the risk of default, and the likely movement on the market, to be able to offer a sensible insurance product to Jeremy. So Jeremy might pay £1,000 for an insurance product which pays out £10,000 on the default of the purchaser, for example. Obviously the numbers involved here are fictional (apart from the price of wheat per tonne, which is probably around the mark given at the moment), but the principle is accurate.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36366156" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36366156" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pravus</span><span>|</span><a href="#36362703">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36363562">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36363675">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36363104">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36366156">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36366156">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Are there no repercussions if the contract isnt honored?<p>Basically the entire point of futures markets is to standardize the contracts and process by which these contracts are fulfilled to the point where all of that is just part of the pricing mechanism.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36363104" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36363104" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TuringTest</span><span>|</span><a href="#36362703">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36363005">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36363347">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36362890">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36363104">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36363104">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No, that&#x27;s purely destructive greed.<p>Ancient civilizations invented the jubilee (loans should be repaid in 7 years) to prevent speculation on them.

The use of derivatives in agriculture does not, on balance, result in fewer crops being produced. On the contrary, by allowing farmers to protect themselves against various risk, derivatives markets allow farmers to safely invest more money in production, and reduces the risk of farmers going bankrupt (bankrupt farmers don&#x27;t produce many crops). Food would almost certainly be more scarce and more expensive if farmers did not have access to the financial markets.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36363786" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36363786" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">marcosdumay</span><span>|</span><a href="#36362703">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36363278">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36363907">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36363679">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36363786">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36363786">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The one goal of future contracts is for producers and consumers to be able to make deals before that production and consumption happens.

This works a lot like a game of telephone where changes in one market venue propagate through related instruments to other venues crossing space, species, and even time. Much like telephone, each pair of neighbors wants to do a good job sharing information without loss and, also, over long distances minor errors add up.<p>Arbitrage is the glue which prevents this from happening. Arbitrage says that any time <i>anyone</i> discovers some level of disconnection occurring, they can make money at very low risk by voting to shift markets to better align with one another.<p>Arbitrageurs are getting paid to provide a service to the market and subsequently the entire world. Their actions ensure that information flows throughout the global financial system quickly and without relying on centralized planning.

All of these actors regularly face situations where they need (or want) to expend money now that they will have eventually but do not have now. The financial markets are primarily about making it as efficient as possible to do that. (There is arguably another side of the financial markets that is about helping people manage risk, though they are somewhat related.)<p>Most of the financial wizardry you read about in the linked article is related to that aim. It&#x27;s not always obvious, because a lot of it is higher-order stuff: transactions between financial market participants where payouts are linked to other transactions (or aggregations of transactions) between financial market participants, etc. It can be hard to see the link to the participants I mentioned above. But a lot of it is a means to understanding, and spreading, the risks associated with financing those participants. It is a lot easier to lend people money to finance their wants and needs if you can (a) differentiate between people who will pay you back and people you won&#x27;t; and (b) share the risk of not being paid back with others.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36363762" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36363762" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pwatsonwailes</span><span>|</span><a href="#36362703">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36363513">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36364125">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36368274">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36363762">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36363762">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not dumb at all.

That requires capital expenditure. You might not have the free capital to be able to do that. However, if you can improve your cash position, that might be something which becomes available sooner, allowing you to grow more rapidly.<p>That requires that you&#x27;re able to secure finance, which means you need someone to either buy something from you now, or to buy the promise of something for the future. In either case, you now have increased cash at bank, which lets you invest to generate returns (hopefully).<p>This is deeply rooted in the idea that money you have now is worth more than money you may have in the future.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36368274" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36368274" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lordnacho</span><span>|</span><a href="#36362703">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36363513">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36363762">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36365576">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36368274">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36368274">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The participants are time-and-space separated buyers and sellers of<p>- Commodities like wheat, barley, cows, coal, electricity and so on<p>- Money itself, in which case we call this lending and borrowing<p>- Money for other money, commonly called currency transaction<p>- Ownership stakes in companies, aka shares<p>- Contingent claims like options and futures on the above<p>Say you want to build a factory to make cars. That&#x27;s going to cost something, and you want to share the risk with the public.<p>- When you IPO this company, you get a bunch of money from the buyers of your shares. The owners of the shares, why do they bother? They don&#x27;t just get all the profits of the company like if they owned a restaurant. They don&#x27;t control the car factory, they leave that to the management, including how much of the profits are paid out. What if they need the money, despite everyone thinking the company has good prospects? Enter the secondary market, what we normally call the stock market. Here you can find other people who want the shares you don&#x27;t want, and will give you money today for your shares, even if the company hasn&#x27;t made a dime yet.<p>- You have plans with the 10B from the IPO, but not right this day. If there were a money market you could gather some interest until the bill for the factory comes. Some other business needs to make payroll with their receivables a couple of weeks later. You just need to match with them somehow.<p>- When you start selling cars, you find that a lot of people don&#x27;t have 50K in cash. Not to worry, you hand these people their cars anyway, and you make a financing plan where they pay for the car with money that they owe you. Now you have a bunch of loans from people, but you can&#x27;t use the IOUs to expand your factory. What do you do? You find someone to forward you some actual cash on the expectation that the car buyer will eventually give you the money for the car. You just need a market to find this person with the opposite need to you.<p>- You might sell cars in other countries. If your factory is not in that country, your expenses will be mismatched. If only there was someone out there willing to swap all the Euros you got from selling cars in Europe for your Dollars that you use to pay your workers. It happens that there are other companies in America expanding to Europe needing Euros for their local offices, and having only dollar income. How to find them?<p>So what happens then? Who is going to match all these different interests? The answer is market makers. Basically people who know that there are clients whose interests match. Your basic middle man who stands there when the farmer comes in, buys the grain, and then waits for the restaurant guy to come in, and sells them. That way they don&#x27;t need to meet at the same time and place, and they don&#x27;t need to match exactly.<p>Not matching exactly brings us to contingent claims. If everyone just transacted everything in the exact right quantities, that would be nice for the market maker. He&#x27;d just take a spread on everything and sleep comfortably. But that&#x27;s not what happens and supply and demand change, and prices change. In fact prices can change a lot, and you might need some sort of deal where you can buy or sell something, but only if the price is at some particular level. Or you might want to buy or sell something definitely, but not right now, only at some time in the future. This whole derivative game allows people to move risks around in order to match their changing balance of buyers and sellers.<p>I haven&#x27;t even added speculators yet, but that&#x27;s the start of a &quot;who&#x2F;why markets&quot; answer.<p>EDIT. I know people will ask next. What does any of this very nice sounding imaginary world of completely explicable financial needs have to do with arbitrage?<p>The answer is liquidity aggregation on similar products, and liquidity spreading by interaction of participants.<p>Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a market to borrow money for each year in the future, eg 2024, 2025, 2026, and so on. Some guy decides he needs to borrow money for 2025 to build a factory. As a market maker, that&#x27;s fine, but hey wait a minute. There&#x27;s nobody I know who wants to lend in 2025. What do I do? I have this guy who wants to lend in 2024 and a guy who wants to lend in 2026. Hey, maybe I can just do all these deals, paying me a spread? My books will be slightly off balance, but don&#x27;t interest rates basically move up and down together? Let&#x27;s do it and deal with the mismatch later. So now these related markets are connected. They are sort of one large pool of liquidity, but still their own separate pools since there is still some difference.<p>This is a loose arbitrage. You&#x27;re not guaranteed to make money on it, since rates can move the wrong way for you. But this is also the most common arbitrage, the one where you sort-of hedge your book against similar things and hope the imbalance falls out eventually.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36365576" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36365576" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">johngladtj</span><span>|</span><a href="#36362703">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36363513">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36368274">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36366536">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36365576">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36365576">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Every single person in the world who has ever traded anything with anyone</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36366536" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36366536" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">plandis</span><span>|</span><a href="#36362703">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36362828">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36367523">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36366536">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36366536">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The thing that I’ve always found wild is that the money people make on markets seems to be so much higher than the money people who actually make goods&#x2F;services.<p>Why has the global economy put such a high benefit from investment bankers compared to, for example, family doctors?</div><br/><div id="36366715" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36366715" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thelamest</span><span>|</span><a href="#36362703">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36366536">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36367523">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36366715">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36366715">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For one, finance is a macro force multiplier; it can make or break entire other industries.

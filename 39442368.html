In every company I&#x27;ve worked at the biggest hurdle with these tools is getting the entire team to use them and keep them up to date. I think that gen AI could provide tons of value with that problem (because most teams have members that don&#x27;t update their tickets)<p>A while ago I had the idea that gen AI would probably be able to maintain a jira&#x2F;kanban board of choice without people in your company being required to update it. You could track this based off what was going on with other company activity. E.g., looking at what people are saying in Slack, what commits a developer has pushed to GitHub, etc, what someone said they would do on a zoom call, etc.<p>Have you guys thought about any similar features in this space?<p>Congrats on the launch!</div><br/><div id="39445380" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39445380" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zswaff</span><span>|</span><a href="#39444716">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39451214">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39445380">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39445380">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yep, keeping tickets updated is one of the biggest problems with PM today and was part of the genesis for how I got started working on this. We do already have an integration with GitHub that will automatically sync updates, as well as an integration with Slack that helps users turn messages into tasks. The Slack one doesn&#x27;t really do anything automated though, just helps the two systems talk when you want them to. The vision to connect all workspaces for seamless and automatic updates (like from Zoom calls as you mention) is something we’ve thought about and is quite appealing.<p>The biggest challenge with that is that every time we make an integration based on feedback or requests we see far less usage out of it than pretty much any other feature in the product. It turns out that people like to suggest tons of integrations but rarely take the time to set them up in practice. We can probably do a better job with that, and with giving more value to users sooner from the integrations.<p>Big picture, though, your vision totally aligns with ours: minimize (or zero out) the time that ICs need to spend updating stuff while maximizing the info available for PMs etc. in the tool. We plan to do a better and better job with this over time.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39451214" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39451214" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bx376</span><span>|</span><a href="#39444716">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39442623">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39451214">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39451214">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great pricing model when compared with Linear.app. If I have a budget of $8 I’d love to subscribe Dart rather than Linear.app</div><br/></div></div><div id="39442623" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39442623" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">leoqa</span><span>|</span><a href="#39451214">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39446543">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39442623">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39442623">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I went in pessimistic but the demo was pretty good- every AI-based feature was solving a real point of friction and seemed reasonable.</div><br/><div id="39443258" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39443258" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zswaff</span><span>|</span><a href="#39442623">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39446543">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39443258">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39443258">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks!

The conflict between the people doing the project and the project manager is very, very common: the former doesn&#x27;t want to spend time updating the tool, and the latter wants&#x2F;needs centralized updates&#x2F;status. In the future we absolutely plan to solve this better than we do now.<p>It&#x27;s super compelling to hear about different pain points like this.

I&#x27;d agree that they are probably coming to other tools that want to adapt eventually, but by and large they aren&#x27;t there yet! I think we take a markedly more AI-forward philosophy than other tools so I&#x27;m honestly not 100% sure that they even will fully adapt in a timely manner- especially the large incumbents. Most of those are still focused on finding different creative ways to put chatbots in their products instead of meshing useful AI features in a more streamlined way.<p>Also admittedly this isn&#x27;t a product-reason, but at least for now as a relatively small startup we&#x27;re able to offer a lot more custom support and strategizing with any team that switches over. I can&#x27;t promise we won&#x27;t eventually run into the same bottlenecks as the large companies eventually, but for now I&#x27;m confident our service is better and some of our users have expressed that as one of the primary motivators for keeping with Dart.<p>Ultimately, if you&#x27;re happy with your current system and don&#x27;t see your team becoming more efficient on Dart then it&#x27;s probably not worth the switch.

This is something that I have spent a lot of time thinking about. Honestly probably worth a whole blog post&#x2F;PG-style essay at some point. Shipping and iterating at top speed is honestly paramount for a startup.<p>Probably the biggest thing we&#x27;ve done has been to focus on hiring for people that can and will move quickly, and building a company culture around that. Our team is very strong, works unusually hard, and ships quickly at all costs. For a startup, I would recommend hiring startuppy people rather than engineers with 20y experience at the magnificent 7.<p>One of our most counterintuitive&#x2F;provocative&#x2F;potentially wrong practices has been to deemphasize automated tests. I&#x27;ll probably catch a lot of flak for this but I think that spending a bunch of extra time writing thorough tests for something that will change next week when we iterate and improve is a waste of time. In my experience you can make up for this with thorough manual testing by someone (e.g. founder, product owner) that really, really cares about the product and UX. This is part of the overall &quot;do things that don&#x27;t scale&quot; ethos and as the product has matured we have started to evolve to a higher level of test coverage. tl;dr I recommend less time spent engineering tests pre-PMF.<p>Otherwise we generally follow established best practices. Review fast, ship fast, roll forward. Extreme ownership and responsibility to ICs. Use Dart for project management to save time ;)<p>Overall, I think the first thing is most important: build a team and a culture that moves uncomfortably and unusually fast and breaks things (then fixes them immediately).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39445048" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39445048" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">trollbridge</span><span>|</span><a href="#39446515">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39443533">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39445048">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39445048">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Do you have any free or discounted plans for nonprofits?

We also have similar capabilities in AI doc editing (although Notion and other tools are definitely more fleshed out there if your use case is primarily writing).<p>That being said it&#x27;s a very quickly evolving landscape and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if things change in the near future.

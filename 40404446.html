But they did drink beer in quantities that would be untenable today.<p>The author is also muddling points - medieval people didn&#x27;t have to understand microbiology to know that beer was safer to drink.<p>And it was! Not only would the brewer have access to better water, it would be boiled as part of the process. (And aromatics like hops acted as mild antiseptics - the beer would be safe to drink for as long as it tasted well).<p>To review:<p>- It was tasty<p>- It was convenient<p>- People you knew who drink it had the trots less often<p>- It was cheap enough<p>- It made you feel good during long days of arduous labor<p>- There was no social stigma so long as you don&#x27;t get drunk<p>And it makes plenty of reason that brewers would be incentivised to keep ABV low so people could drink it all day if they could.<p>Even going into the US prohibition, I think people would be astonished by how much the typical worker drank (usually cider in the US). With workplaces themselves providing it by the truckload.<p>Yes, people drank water.

The dirtier the water, the more need to boil the water. Boiling the water would not have significantly improved the taste. Some streams were known to be unhealthy despite not appearing dirty and locals knew to boil this too. Springs and deep wells were so highly valued in part because these were known to be safe to drink without any processing. European records are full of people being prosecuted or just directly murdered for messing with spring or fountain water. The idea people would not connect the taste of the water (which was quite well observed) with health is not born out by records of the time. Laws on the books dictated where one might bathe, wash clothing, rinse unhealthy flesh, and especially where one might piss or shit, specifically concerned with causing widespread disease. In siena in 1262 a woman was flayed alive after she was accused of poisoning fountain water—not dirtying it, but specifically destroying its safety.<p>The reason people drank beer is the same as today: it&#x27;s tasty, it makes you feel good, you get some calories, and water is &quot;boring&quot; unless you&#x27;re really thirsty.

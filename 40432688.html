the book is from 01980, the year before ibm shipped its first ascii-supporting equipment, the ibm pc.  it&#x27;s reasonable to see jennings&#x27;s account as a violent reaction against mackenzie&#x27;s book, writing the malignant influence of the punched-card codes out of history entirely, though, as we&#x27;ll see, the original draft of ascii was designed by a punched-card man<p>bell&#x27;s oral history interviews <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.computerhistory.org&#x2F;collections&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;102702036" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.computerhistory.org&#x2F;collections&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;10270203...</a> don&#x27;t mention ascii or asa or ansi, so he probably wasn&#x27;t on the committee, but if it was a connivance by a friend of his, it would be easy to imagine him deliberately not mentioning it<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;363831.363839" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;363831.363839</a> is an early (01965) publication of what eventually became ascii-1967, but it doesn&#x27;t list the subcommittee members;

at mit, where bell had been working, and the pdp-1 for which bell designed the uart, as well as another 40 or so.  so it wasn&#x27;t like there was no contact.  as it happens, neither of those two character sets includes a bell character<p>the bell character appears in the first version of the ascii proposal in the leftmost column of table 3 on page 17 — but at position 10, from which it was moved to its current position of 7 (^g) after four revisions (iso&#x2F;tc97 wg b, 01962 may 4, following x3.2&#x2F;1, which was 01961 september 18).  his only comment on why they moved all the control characters around was, &#x27;the controls were regularized and grouped to 7 transmission controls, 6 format effectors, and 5 device controls; the improvement from the haphazardness of the previous proposals is quite apparent.&#x27;  this was shortly before ibm sent him to the penalty box for promoting ascii, leading to him quitting to go to univac<p>at that point there was still disagreement about whether to start the alphabet at the beginning of a 16-codepoint &#x27;column&#x27;

It is a Microsoft Research project inspired by Vannevar Bush&#x27;s hypothetical Memex computer system. The project includes full-text search, text and audio annotations, and hyperlinks. The &quot;experimental subject&quot; of the project is computer scientist Gordon Bell, and the project will try to collect a lifetime of storage on and about Bell.. For this, Bell has digitized all documents he has read or produced, CDs, emails, and so on. He continues to do so, gathering web pages browsed, phone and instant messaging conversations and the like more or less automatically. The book Total Recall describes the vision and implications for a personal, lifetime e-memory for recall, work, health, education, and immortality. In 2010, Total Recall was published in paperback. As of 2016, Bell was no longer using the wearable camera associated with the project. He described the rise of the smartphone as largely fulfilling Bush&#x27;s vision of the Memex.</i><p>&quot;Total Recall&quot; (2009) by Gordon Bell, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Total-Recall-Memory-Revolution-Everything&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0525951342" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Total-Recall-Memory-Revolution-Everyt...</a></div><br/><div id="40435212" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40435212" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TiredOfLife</span><span>|</span><a href="#40434540">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40434375">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40435212">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40435212">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And obligatory related HN thread <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40425306">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40425306</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40434375" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40434375" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Doctor-R</span><span>|</span><a href="#40434540">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40433569">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40434375">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40434375">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Some of his books are available in pdf on his website:

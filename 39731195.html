A lot of refactoring.<p>The tests that stayed true were the UI tests that almost always pointed to real problems with real code.<p>It took a while to figure out how to write them though - trying to rely as little as possible on the internal ids &#x2F; html &#x2F; css and write them with what the user sees - e.g. instead of clicking on the button with âtestid=loginâ we would âclick on the button with the text login in itâ. Identifying fields by the labels to them or tables by their column headers. It was inspired by railsâ capibara testing lib.<p>And making sure the tests were not flaky, fast to execute and isolated took some time.<p>But it was so worth the investment - itâs surprising how little those tests would change, as it allowed us to fearlessly refactor stuff without changing any tests. They felt a lot more like a friendly QA helping out rather than an annoyance you had to deal with <i>after</i> youâve finished writing your code.<p>And writing them was actually fun, since you didnât have to understand how the app worked, fiddle with brittle css identifiers etc, you just wrote the steps you thought the user should do and saved it into a file.<p>Being UI tests kinda meant they tested the whole system with the various micro services involved, databases and other infra. And I think this is where most problems in software arise, at the edges of systems when they try to interact with each other.<p>Static types, immutability automatic API schemas and validators usually make sure the code one writes executes reasonably well, its where the code one writes starts interacting with all the other systems where people usually canât anticipate things. And thats where the integration &#x2F; e2e &#x2F; UI tests help the most I think.</div><br/><div id="39732381" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39732381" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Supermancho</span><span>|</span><a href="#39732031">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39732126">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39731632">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39732381">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39732381">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was a big fan of the unit testing done at JP Morgan.

But other aspects, I do often care how the code &quot;looks&quot; or more precisely &quot;does&quot; something. Like, it shouldn&#x27;t be needlessly wasteful of resources, but I don&#x27;t want to pigeonhole myself as &quot;the performance guy&quot;. It shouldn&#x27;t be using under-educated idioms that increase the likelihood that someone&#x27;s gotta come back to this later to fix something stupid like a null pointer exception. At the same time certain things that sometimes get derided as ivory tower complex (or just &quot;clever&quot;) code constructions, I don&#x27;t think should necessarily be avoided all the time, but should be tastefully balanced with an aim towards broader understanding and not showing off cleverness for the sake of cleverness. I&#x27;ve replaced so many hundreds of lines of code with some relatively simple tens of lines type theory constructions in plain old Java 8, just because a dev who stopped learning around Java 1.4&#x2F;5 doesn&#x27;t understand doesn&#x27;t make them &quot;complex&quot; or &quot;clever&quot;. I don&#x27;t even particularly like static typing, but a tool is a tool.<p>But often I just don&#x27;t care about even those details, and sometimes feel guilty about it. Carmack says to fill your products with give-a-damn, but I&#x27;m sorry, for so many things, a lot of the time I just don&#x27;t&#x2F;didn&#x27;t. Work must be done anyway though, and not just by me. So practices that are broader, like enforcing tests, do help deliver a good enough product even under the guidance of devs and management and management&#x27;s management etc. who seem to care even less than I do and don&#x27;t even feel bad about it. It&#x27;s particularly crazy when you talk to a customer who is gushing about something you know could have been even better with slightly different prioritization and tradeoffs; an important lesson is that many people are stoked merely that something exists.<p>It&#x27;s sad when tests catch something that really should have been caught, if not during code authoring time by an author who actually cares a bit more than just doing the job however and going home, then by code review time, but in large companies you sometimes have to just accept things for long periods and at least with more tests we can be more likely to catch things at all. (Not to mention they&#x27;re pretty valuable when the original author who best understood the code is long gone, they help you make minor tweaks without having to tradeoff new feature development time with time getting a deep enough understanding of that old code that still mostly works most of the time.)</div><br/><div id="39732856" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39732856" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lelanthran</span><span>|</span><a href="#39731827">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39732067">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39731576">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39732856">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39732856">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; have been caught, if not during code authoring time by an author who actually cares a bit more than just doing the job however and going home,<p>I have to ask, what&#x27;s the alternative type of author to one who does the job however and goes home?<p>Because doing the job properly takes more time, where does this extra time come from?

We spent a horrible ammount of time getting the test system up and running (microservices, browser add-ons), with the UI testing being the most challenging.<p>But then they also wanted to &quot;move fast and break things&quot;, which we did, so we spent an annoying ammount of time fixing breaking tests.

Iâve had great success working with manual testers for very complex products with real world repercussions, compared to this tiny start up in dev tooling.<p>They refused. So they decided weâd do cross functional testing and then test the entire system whenever weâd do a merge. So developer velocity fell from a cliff because we became the manual testers.

Like how all the fighter planes that returned with damage had damage to the wings.
Point is, damage anywhere else was fatal, the takeaway should not have been to armor the wings more, which was the first thing which was tried.
Likewise thinking about bugs this way discounts potential bugs that _were_ stopped by tests.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39732027" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39732027" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">osigurdson</span><span>|</span><a href="#39731858">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39731640">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39732027">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39732027">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;&gt; Maybe the tests are only a symptom.

Please don&#x27;t.<p>I consider it significant that both of the examples he cited are interactive programs. Thorough testing is low-payoff for those, for two reasons: it&#x27;s common to tweak behaviors a bit, and if something is broken, you&#x27;ll notice in the process of using it. Not <i>no</i> tests, but fewer tests, makes sense.<p>At the opposite end, I&#x27;m working on a VM, and you better believe it&#x27;s got tests. Not enough, it needs more, it always needs more, but they&#x27;re a godsend. When I add an optimization to the compiler, I want confidence that it hasn&#x27;t broken other behaviors, which frequently it does at first. They&#x27;ve enabled several refactors, with at least one more big one on the roadmap. Change one end of the pipeline, change the middle, change the end: half the tests fail, figure out why, the tests are green, all is well.<p>It&#x27;s almost a tautology but: write tests for a reason. Good reasons change over the lifecycle of a program. Early on, fixing simple invariants and preventing regression is a good motive, but with the recognition that things are going to change. Dogmatic TDD can lock in a design too early, if literally everything has a test right from the beginning the effort of every change is multiplied.<p>For a mature systems program designed to be robust and load-bearing, complete coverage could be a good goal. For something like a text editor or terminal emulator, that&#x27;s probably overkill outside of the core components. Tests aren&#x27;t free, but no tests can get pretty expensive too.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39732602" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39732602" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mellutussa</span><span>|</span><a href="#39731726">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39732396">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39732602">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39732602">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; was 100% sure that I know how the code works and that this canât happen again.<p>No, no, no and nope.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

The big issue I find is that often PMs are too far away from the product and spending all their time politicking and thinking about &quot;strategy&quot;, so they have no idea how much work a particular feature is. I was leading a technical team in my last job working on industrial software, and I&#x27;d regularly have a PM come to me and tell me that there&#x27;s been a contract signed for a new customer, and we have X piece of bespoke work as part of that contract due by usually ~1 month in the future. So you start asking questions, what does X mean, how do you want to resolve this problem, etc. etc. etc. and most of the time, the PM can&#x27;t answer those questions, so you&#x27;re stuck. And the deadline gets closer and closer, and then the customer isn&#x27;t happy when it inevitably gets missed, and the pressure comes down on you as an engineer to make things work, and people get burnt out.<p>My view is that PMs should sit super super close to the team. There should never be a case where the software team is more knowledgeable about the product function than the PM, but in practice this is often the case.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38672437" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38672437" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bjornsing</span><span>|</span><a href="#38680435">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38671655">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38672437">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38672437">[114 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve spent some time interacting with product managers as an engineering manager, or head of a functional area. I&#x27;ve also been &quot;acting&quot; PM for an internal product at a medium size tech company.<p>I think product management entails some of the most important things a company does. But it&#x27;s really hard work, and many less capable PMs gravitate away from it and more towards either &quot;driving&quot; (i.e. micromanaging) the engineering team or just playing politics. In an organization with separate Engineering and Product functions &#x2F; org charts this is really hard to deal with. You can complain up the chain of command, but bandwidth in that direction is (for natural reasons) very limited. As an EM the end result is often that these PMs make life miserable for your best engineers, and they leave.<p>My current view is that the best approach is to embed product management in the form of a &quot;mini-CEO&quot; (i.e. PM) in each team, and if they&#x27;re not technically competent pairing them with a &quot;mini-CTO&quot;. Much less room for politics, and much more for teamwork.</div><br/><div id="38672527" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38672527" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ath3nd</span><span>|</span><a href="#38672437">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38672546">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38672527">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38672527">[90 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t believe in Product Managers or Project Owners as a net good towards building a better product or a better company.<p>The most successful teams I have been in had no dedicated product role, instead, all decisions were made by the developers.<p>My current view is best to remove all type of non technical people or even mildly technical people from the developers&#x27; way and let them build in peace.</div><br/><div id="38673146" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38673146" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">flappyeagle</span><span>|</span><a href="#38672437">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38672527">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38677107">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38673146">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38673146">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The best PMs I’ve worked with were HIGHLY technical, either in the same areas as the developers or in adjacent areas, like product design, or the domain of the product<p>PM for retail company did long stints in merchandising at Costco<p>PM for spreadsheet company was a former banking analyst<p>Most companies hire under qualified generalist PMs who have to learn everything about their market from scratch; it’s very challenging and prone to outright failure.<p>Hire fewer PMs, and make sure they bring a key skill to the table.

Without significant prior experience in some related facet to the product, it is not possible to be successful as a PM, and I wouldn’t expect a new grad to be able to do much more than push papers.

Ideally, they should be. Realistically, there&#x27;s one guy in another branch of the company with a totally unrelated title that everyone eventually figures out is The Guy on this product domain; and the PM&#x27;s role becomes &quot;interface with Jim&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t generally find myself in the Anti-PM camp; but I think one of the valid criticisms of the role is that high quality hiring for it is so extremely difficult that maybe its existence <i>is</i> an indication of a structural problem. As the article says; if the ratio of PMs to Teams should be less than 1:1, maybe the correct lens to view this role through is more of a higher-level product lead, or a separate product branch who act more like free agents that attach themselves to teams temporarily, splitting time, where needed.<p>I will say, I&#x27;ve worked in two roles where this was the case; one a very large public tech company everyone reading this would recognize, and another a 30 person startup; giving PMs higher cross-team authority felt, to me, like a really good decision. One small positive byproduct I actively observed: when speaking with our PM, who was shared with four or five other teams, he was constantly aware of all the other work they were doing, and would actively make recommendations about how our little feature could plug-in with their little feature to increase the quality of the overall product. One small negative he communicated: because the company had no entry-level PM roles, which is where he started before they refactored the org chart, its non-obvious how you backfill these roles or create an entryway for new talent to breach the industry. Their current solution to this is &quot;well, we can&#x27;t really promote internally unless an EM or Engineer wants to switch domains&quot; which they genuinely did try to support.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38672603" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38672603" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">allsunny</span><span>|</span><a href="#38672437">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38672548">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38674288">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38672595">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38672603">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38672603">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree with the point you’re making.

I could likely make more elsewhere but I find the domain I work in quite rewarding and interesting.</div><br/><div id="38676419" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38676419" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stale2002</span><span>|</span><a href="#38672437">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38676390">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38679482">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38676419">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38676419">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; have RSUs or financial incentives where they do better if the firm does better?<p>They have a larger emotional incentive to work on cool things that they enjoy, as opposed to the relatively small change in company price if their individual product succeeds or fails.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38677071" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38677071" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">NearAP</span><span>|</span><a href="#38672437">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38675994">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38679482">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38676135">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38677071">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38677071">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not the OP, but I think my comment here [1] might be a good example of what the OP means<p>1]  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25975417">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25975417</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="38676135" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38676135" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stavros</span><span>|</span><a href="#38672437">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38675994">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38677071">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38679471">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38676135">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38676135">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If I had to guess, it&#x27;s a lack of adequate market research.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38679471" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38679471" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sublinear</span><span>|</span><a href="#38672437">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38672527">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38675215">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38678886">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38679471">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38679471">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A good PM might not be that technically knowledgeable at all.<p>If they&#x27;re at least very detail-oriented and can effectively lead sprint planning or whatever the equivalent is at your org, much chaos and indecision can be avoided.<p>They get bonus points if they&#x27;re good at shielding dev teams from office politics and committing everyone to a firm schedule free of sloppy requirements or loose due dates.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38674604" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38674604" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ako</span><span>|</span><a href="#38672437">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38672527">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38678886">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38673029">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38674604">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38674604">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t understand, how do you handle prioritization decisions: if you have a 100+ customers that all want something, how do you create understanding of all needs, how do you distill that to an integrated roadmap, and how do you align the roadmap prioritization decisions across 20+ teams?<p>How do you organize updating of documentation, training materials, enablement of support, pricing decision, updating  of price lists, enablement of sales, presales, and customer success teams?

It may be a superior way to the reality of most companies today, but that reality makes achieving an environment like that extraordinarily difficult.<p>Here&#x27;s the reality I&#x27;ve seen: PMs and EMs share a very similar domain of responsibility. The &quot;20% work&quot; of both jobs is different; but 80% of it isn&#x27;t; its communication and defense from the rest of the business, and organizing the work the engineers need to actually do. Who actually does it, in your org, the PM or EM, depends on who has more political capital between the two, which is something of a function of their skill level, experience, and ability to market themselves. Great EMs look like PMs. Bad PMs do all the bad things bad EMs do, like micromanage.<p>Phrase that paragraph another way: in <i>most</i> orgs, in my experience, the PM role fills a need which arises when the team makes a sub-optimal EM hire, and vice-versa.<p>That&#x27;s my reality; but the obvious problem with that reality is, if you look at the scientific, hypothetical definition of what a PM should do, its not that. There&#x27;s tons of more product-focused &quot;we want to build the best thing&quot; kind of work that feels, to me, <i>rare</i> for even Fantastic PMs to actually get to do because they&#x27;re compensating for an EM that isn&#x27;t pulling their weight. Vice-versa, if you have a Bad PM it might not even occur to them that this &quot;we want to build the best thing&quot; class of work is a fundamental part of the role; ZIRP document factories that could basically be replaced with an LLM trained on all the meetings they&#x27;ve attended.<p>The additional lingering problem is that, part of that 80% work, &quot;defense against the rest of the business&quot;, depends significantly on the rest of the business stepping back and creating an environment where this &quot;unit&quot; (the EM, PM, and engineers) can be autonomous; and I&#x27;ve also nearly-never worked anywhere where this was the case, even leadership that says &quot;its y&#x27;alls call, you&#x27;ve got authority in this domain&quot; inevitably catch wind of some decision they dislike, for reasons rarely more substantiated then &quot;it feels wrong&quot;, and even a small number of torpedoes like that can <i>seriously</i>, <i>seriously</i> harm an entire team&#x27;s feeling that they&#x27;re allowed to go on of the offensive, rather than playing defense 24&#x2F;7.<p>Point being: The single best characteristic of upper leadership, its not close, there&#x27;s zero argument of this in my mind, its not technical ability, business experience, good talking skills, domain experience, whatever: Its Hiring. Being able to identify strong talent, keeping a pulse on the performance of that talent, ground-truth, all the time, and being willing to let people go if mistakes are made. But, what I&#x27;ve just described is <i>extremely</i> difficult to execute effectively, because every actor in this game is self-interested and will actively misrepresent the performance of themselves and their unit; politics is the hardest game in the book.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38675768" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38675768" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nfm</span><span>|</span><a href="#38672437">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38672527">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38674220">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38672777">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38675768">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38675768">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What kinds of products were those teams building?</div><br/></div></div><div id="38672777" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38672777" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">naijaboiler</span><span>|</span><a href="#38672437">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38672527">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38675768">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38672546">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38672777">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38672777">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What was the product being built.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38672546" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38672546" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gardenhedge</span><span>|</span><a href="#38672437">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38672527">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38672503">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38672546">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38672546">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A mini cto is an architect in this position</div><br/></div></div><div id="38672503" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38672503" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">demondemidi</span><span>|</span><a href="#38672437">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38672546">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38671655">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38672503">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38672503">[22 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">“Politics”<p>35 years in the semi industry.

Boss W, I think, spent more time playing chess than anything else.  First he worked out a situation where he was peer to Boss F, then, with another coup, managed to get Boss F working for <i>him.</i>.  Still not satisfied, he managed to change to whom the department reported to from Uberboss J to Uberboss C.<p>Uberboss C, who was peer to another administrative type, Administrator W, was eager to prove the value to the change.  And so I was tasked with developing a product rather similar to something that Administrator W had at his previous job.  The product itself was politics, in that it presented to a group of stakeholders about a thousand to three thousand items to decide the disposition of.  But this was futile, really, because we had about six hundred thousand items to have reviewed, so we would never actually <i>get</i> anywhere with presenting this to the stakeholders.  But they wanted it and so ...<p>And so I was told that this was going to be an Agile thing, and I had until the start of the semester to have it done, and they needed to see a fully-featured prototype (a contradiction) right away.  Although promised, I never got to meet with the internal stakeholders who would present this product to the external stakeholders who would do the disposition.<p>That&#x27;s quite a tight deadline, but it gets interrupted because to prove value to someone <i>else</i>, I get sent on a week-long conference doing something utterly unrelated.  They just wanted to prove to the guy running Dept B that they were going to have someone in the mix for <i>his</i> technology.<p>Despite this and catching a tremendous cold, I managed to have something developed by the start of the semester, because it was so very very urgent.<p>And then it was not shown to the internal stakeholders for <i>seven months</i>.

Their formal rewards (like promotions, bonuses, and recognition) are often tied to technical achievements. If a developer spends 40 hours on customer research, this effort might not be as formally recognized or rewarded as much as a technical achievement like developing a new authentication solution that benefits the entire team.<p>Shifting this dynamic is not just about encouraging developers to spend more time on product management. It requires a systemic change in how organizations value and reward.<p>Changing the incentive structure to be more user-centric and less technically focused would significantly impact middle and upper management roles. A shift  would challenge the very foundations of their roles and responsibilities, potentially leading to a loss of control and influence.<p>It&#x27;s likely that such changes would face subtle yet strong resistance from middle and upper management.

When your PM is the expert in your userbase and how they expect to use something, they need to be involved a lot.</div><br/><div id="38673845" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38673845" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nip</span><span>|</span><a href="#38671012">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38673614">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38672523">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38673845">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38673845">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Agree on all counts!</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38672523" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38672523" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">havkom</span><span>|</span><a href="#38671012">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38671550">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38671599">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38671646">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38672523">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38672523">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Best PMs know both the what, why and how and tries to bridge all that.<p>It may include knowing technical weaknesses and strengths in the energineering teams abilities and their plattforms abilities and weighing that in for planning and priorities.

Nothing fancy, it could have been building a website with HTML and CSS many years ago, writing some ad hoc SQL queries, or taking a Python class while doing a Master’s degree. __something__ that helps a PM understand that writing code is neither an exact science nor outright wizardry.<p>These PMs tend to advocate for the engineers they work with, or at least try to strike a balance between business demands and engineering realities.

I’ve been in hi dress of hours of cross functions team meeting where 1-2 people did any work, and usually the PM talked the whole time, while 10-20ppl are on mute and only sign off at the end to show they indeed exist. The end result see teams of dejected engineers that don’t have time for actual technical work, and are asked to give estimates or commitments on the spot without any research or even understanding of the code. I’ve seen PMs reject technical designs because they didn’t like the number or “points”, and engineers just had to reformat the same ideas into different “tickets” to satisfy some inscrutable PM aesthetics. Entire projects delayed and derailed because of lack of understanding and pointless status signaling rituals.

But how much of &quot;the product manager does product management&quot; is genuinely just the title they&#x27;re assigned, versus some innate capability they were born with?<p>I&#x27;m becoming more agreeable to the notion that, at least in product development: most people should be doing more things. People can and should have specialization; but maybe it should be more organic and nuanced, like &quot;Mike is our API guy, but he&#x27;s also pretty good at organizing large projects and if you&#x27;ve got a big architectural ick to work through definitely go talk to him&quot; versus &quot;Sarah is more on the product side, she&#x27;ll have great insight into user experience and she knows who to talk to in the organization to get decisions made faster, but she can also take on some smaller frontend tickets.&quot;<p>My argument isn&#x27;t really &quot;great idea dude, let&#x27;s get rid of titles&quot;; because I think the critical part is, this mindset is deeply predicated on Agency. You need an organization that assigns High Definition and High Agency to teams. You also need a hiring process that, very specifically, treats Personal Agency as one of the most important qualities a candidate can have; you don&#x27;t know Go, that&#x27;s cool, we can teach you Go, what we <i>can&#x27;t</i> teach you is the genuine desire to want to be taught Go, and Rust, and some language I haven&#x27;t even heard of, and by the way you&#x27;re interested in the overall business and revenue and such.<p>The obvious problem is, people like that are a vast minority, and maybe you can&#x27;t really scale companies by relying on the people you hire being intelligent generalists.

As pure engineers, we love engineering, and may over-engineer solutions given the opportunity. Unless we are building some developer tools or highly technical product, this doesn&#x27;t work for the majority of non-technical products.<p>You need a PM who can separate the technical design from the user experience, but also understands how to bridge the two when it comes to actually building the product. No technical experience rarely helps, as you spend a lot of wasted time debating why things should or can&#x27;t be built.<p>As a PM with technical background, I&#x27;m not going to waste engineering time proposing radical user experiences that I know will require excess resources and time to build. At the same time, deeply understanding what users want, I&#x27;m not going to build a product that is too technical for them to understand how to use. We understand the limits of our technical stack and how to reduce user frustration. That is the advantage of having a balanced PM with both user and technical experience.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38673748" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38673748" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">steveBK123</span><span>|</span><a href="#38673786">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38672570">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38673748">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38673748">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Expose everyone to users &quot; - I would note this of course has logical limits.
I&#x27;ve worked in orgs where we had shared slack channels (and DM ability) with all customers.  Not great.<p>This meant that squeaky wheels got a lot of oil.  They quickly figured out who in the channel actually knew what they were doing, and so every customer had their pet senior engineer they would bother all hours of the day &#x2F; weekends &#x2F; etc with questions.  Support rotas and on-calls go out the door when your customers can directly escalate to their engineer of choice.<p>I actually turned off all slack alerts and disabled notifications on my phone as a mental health exercise as a result.

This is not a scientific study but I can at least concur with your experience. There are clearly orgs that don’t work this way, but I find that it’s very common when chatting with my PM colleagues. The exceptional cases have been project managers for projects that involve wide scope, multiple products, or some other factor.<p>I’ve also found that in addition to the Project Manager turned Product Manager, there are plenty of Product Managers forced to be Project Managers and it goes poorly unless a Development Manager is willing to carry that.<p>The ultimate problem is that Project Management doesn’t go away just because a company eliminates the role. The same is true for Product Management. If you’re ok with your developers or someone else doing the work, and it is fruitful, great. For about a decade I tried as hard as I could to get one of the limited Product Managers for the products I worked on to very little avail. As a result I had to guess about price increases and other functions that I, someone with 70% of a CS degree and some extension courses in business topics, have to learn on the fly each time I face the challenge. I was successful but I am sure a real Product Manager would have done a better job.<p>The companies I’ve worked for typically have a cynical view of dedicated Project Managers but I appreciate that this is a specific skill for similar reasons to my Development Manager forced to be a Product Manager experience.</div><br/><div id="38671109" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38671109" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pnathan</span><span>|</span><a href="#38670963">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38671060">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38670972">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38671109">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38671109">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have very rarely encountered a PM(any title) who lucidly communicated their value-add to the company.

As a developer I wanted time to think about how best to solve the problem I was facing, not writing documents, refining the big picture, get a buy in from the stakeholders, giving reports, making sure the other parts of the project kept getting along and so on. It was important for me to be kept in the loop, not doing it on top of my job.
As a product manager, it’s the other way: I have a product that need to be there and so I’m trying to find a good compromise between the stakeholders idea, what would really work and what can be done with the ressources I have. That means sometimes I recommend to not start anything, but to buy a solution (then I need to validate that it will work as intended, that the budget and contract are ok and so on)<p>It’s another job altogether. That doesn’t mean I won’t follow the technological trends, educate myself or refuse to program anything. I wrote some postman script to validate what’s happening with our api, know the infra behind it, and can generally point people in the right direction. I have to know the product inside out to make educated answers when something goes wrong or if a decision is required.<p>It’s often a people job.

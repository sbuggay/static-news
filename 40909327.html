Excellent problem-solving, and very nice result!!<p>Taking a completely direction, my wife and I made our own wedding rings out of stainless steel (a low-nickel alloy suitable for contact with skin -- 316L, I think), and we milled them on a lathe in my employer&#x27;s machine shop after hours. Nearly 20 years later, and they have held up remarkably well.<p>If you&#x27;re going to lathe a ring, make sure you do as much shaping and polishing before you detach it from the rest of the rod, and then create a mandrel that is the correct size to hold the ring (using friction) from the other direction. Hammer it onto the mandrel, do your final burr-removal and polishing, then pop it off the hammer.<p>Important side note: Don&#x27;t do a test-fit before taking the burr off, or else you&#x27;ll slice the skin on your finger all the way &#x27;round in a very nice ring-shaped pattern and it will be the absolute dickens to try and get it off.

IIRC, at the time it was something to do with a variety of &quot;surgical stainless&quot; to focus on the best corrosion resistance combined with something that was somewhat machinable. At the time, I think we were comparing 304 (easier to machine, much worse corrosion resistance) vs. 316 (harder to machine, but much better corrosion resistance). I think looking at metals that we were able to source in partial lengths might have been a factor as well.<p>In hindsight, one might be able to find something with better properties in a more specialized alloy, but if I had to do it over again, I would 100% be willing to choose the 316L again. I have zero complaints with it, and the corrosion resistance it offers is superb. In 20 years, I&#x27;ve never polished my ring once, and it still has that mirror-finish quality (especially on the inside where it has never brushed concrete).<p>I rarely take the ring off (sometimes when juggling) -- I don&#x27;t worry about it and leave it on even when using tools or scrambling up a rock ledge or carrying cinder blocks or whatever. Very occasionally it will get scratches (concrete is one of the few things that has left a mark from time to time), but they&#x27;re never very severe scratches, and they buff out nice and naturally over time.

For the size and tolerances needed for a ring you can probably ignore this detail. You can get what is called a low-shrink mold made for some alloys that helps mitigate this if you want to make your prototype to finished size (or you didn&#x27;t know better before you takes to the jeweler).<p>Patternmakers deal with this using what are called shrink rules. They look like regular rules, but are e.g. 5% longer. If you&#x27;re buying an old rule, make sure you don&#x27;t get one by mistake.<p>Silver rings, worn regularly, won&#x27;t need to be polished to keep the tarnish at bay; the contact from your skin will do quite well enough. Our wedding rings are also silver, and I&#x27;ve only polished mine when I haven&#x27;t worn it for a while. Ours probably don&#x27;t polish up to quite the same luster though.

She mentioned the idea of casting our own rings, and I remembered my friend happened to have made his own small foundry — a concrete lined paint can with some pipe and 10$ hair drier as bellows — a couple of years prior.<p>We bought some sand casting equipment and a thermometer and went over to his house. He had only ever used the foundry to melt aluminum, so we weren&#x27;t sure it&#x27;d get hot enough to melt gold. We stuffed it with anthracite coal from a big bag he managed to get from a hardware store a while back, and sure enough, it got plenty hot enough. That 10$ hair drier really pulled its weight too, surviving hours upon hours of continuous use.<p>Before we bought any gold though, we did some test casts in aluminum. My wife, I, and a couple of friends melted down some cans, formed our sand molds with some cheap steel model rings, and cast some pretty bad rings. They weren&#x27;t even rings, really, since they didn&#x27;t even form full circles. But after a few more tries, we figured out better places to put air channels, how to pour the metal better, etc. and came out with some decent aluminum rings. We also cast some other trinkets like some dice and a little darth vader figurine.<p>More confident we&#x27;d be able to successfully cast gold rings, we ordered some 14k casting grain. When it arrived, we headed back to my friends house, cast some more aluminum trinkets to warm up, then my wife and I cast each others rings with only one small mishap; luckily gold can is easily re-melted. Breaking apart the sand molds to reveal the results was a tense moment, but they came out great.<p>We also opted for hammer finishes, and we&#x27;re both very happy with the result. They have some small pockets on the surface, and we overestimated how much the rings would shrink, so mine&#x27;s a little too big and I wear it on my middle finger, but we think of the defects as reminders we cast them ourselves. The end result wasn&#x27;t the point anyway; if we wanted perfect rings we would have just bought some. The point was the experience of making them, and it sounds like the author had the same kind of experience, so I&#x27;m glad for him.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40910068" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40910068" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">doctoboggan</span><span>|</span><a href="#40911534">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40910961">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40910068">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40910068">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When I was getting married a few years ago I started down this path as well.

There are casting houses out in LA that will accept a STL file and will 3d print, cast, and finish your ring for you. The price is very reasonable, just labor and a bit of a premium on top of the spot gold price.<p>Using that experience I ended up starting a side business where I sell custom designed jewelry. My most popular design incorporates my customer&#x27;s fingerprints. I build a pipeline that lets me go from a jpeg or other image file of the fingerprint to a fully 3d printable STL file (mostly using the blender python API).

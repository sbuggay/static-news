A few excerpts:<p><pre><code>  The power to see like a state was intoxicating for government planners, corporate efficiency experts, and adherents to high modernism in general. But modern technology lets us all see like a state. And with the advent of AI, we all have the power to act on that seeing.. like a data structure.. built for and within a set of societal systems—and stories—that can’t cope with nebulosity.. things are continuous spectra, not discrete categories.. avoid being fragmented into nanogenres.

  While large organizations can exist, they can’t be the only ones with access to, or ability to, afford new technologies.. We can create new “federated” networks of organizations and social groups, like we’re seeing in the open social web of Mastodon.. where local groups can have local rules that differ from, but do not conflict with, their participation in the wider whole..

  The idea of having multiple identities.. some of us have gotten used to having a “portfolio career” that is not defined by a single hat that we wear. While today there is often economic precarity involved with this way of living, there need not be, and the more we can all do the things that are the best expressions of ourselves, the better off society will be.

  Think of how we use weather apps, fitness apps, or self-guided museum tour apps to improve our lives. We need more tools like this in every context to help us to understand nuance and context beyond the level we have time for in our busy lives.. A tool is controlled by a human user, whereas a machine does what its designer wanted. As technologists, we can build tools, rather than machines, that flexibly allow people to make partial, contextual sense of the online and physical world around them.

Scott explored what happens when governments, or those with authority, attempt and fail to “improve the human condition.” Scott found that to understand societies and ecosystems, government functionaries and their private sector equivalents reduced messy reality to idealized, abstracted, and quantified simplifications that made the mess more “legible” to them. With this legibility came the ability to assess and then impose new social, economic, and ecological arrangements from the top down: communities of people became taxable citizens, a tangled and primeval forest became a monoculture timber operation, and a convoluted premodern town became a regimented industrial city.<p>One thing that I remember from Seeing Like a State is that people used to be judged by village tribunals, and now we have fair trials at the state level. People used to live in the same place all their life, now we can go in many places. Making things more legible can mean destroying a forest by making it into a monoculture timber operation. It can also mean allowing all kind of people to live as long as they pay taxes, offering them freedom that they couldn&#x27;t find in a smaller structure.<p>I think it&#x27;s very important to remember that the map is not the territory, that unknown unknowns exist as well as known unknowns, that trying to impose to people a specific way of life will often not make them happier. But also that technology has meant better lives for most people on this planet.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40570319" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40570319" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">photochemsyn</span><span>|</span><a href="#40572049">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40570128">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40570319">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40570319">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The one data structure that crops up again and again when looking at complex systems is the graph. Nodes on the graph represent the components and elements like state variables (e.g. population, resources, temperature, servers and clients, etc.) of the system, and edges between nodes represent interconnections, e.g. flows of matter, energy or information between nodes.<p>A good introduction to this way of looking at the world is &quot;Thinking in Systems: A Primer&quot; by Donella Meadows.  Important concepts include analyzing systems to determine their relative robustness or fragility under stress, the nature of the feedback loops in the system (possibly some nodes are connected by partially directed edges, so flows in one direction are easy but not in the other), what kind of temporal delays matter the most (e.g. how long does it take between creating a change and seeing the result of that change), and so on.<p>Given the natural utility of graphs in modeling systems, it&#x27;s really a bit strange that graph theory really only developed in the 20th century, with some minor exceptions like Euler and Kirchhoff.  It&#x27;s interesting to think about an alien civilization whose mathematics began with graphs and how it might have developed.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40570128" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40570128" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">abtinf</span><span>|</span><a href="#40570319">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40555998">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40570128">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40570128">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ted Nelson was talking about this decades ago.

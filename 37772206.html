It&#x27;s nice that we have better tools to detect problems, but those tools are also readily available to bad actors and they will run their attempted fraud through these tools multiple different times until they succeed and bypass them. We see the same thing in malware where every malware producer make sure before they deploy something that it doesn&#x27;t get detected by any known tools or methods.</div><br/><div id="37775020" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37775020" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Leo_Germond</span><span>|</span><a href="#37773071">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37773222">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37775020">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37775020">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s not quite the full picture you&#x27;re painting here.<p>First of, at the moment the effort is super asymetrical: it takes way more efforts to check a paper for image duplication than it takes to alter an existing image to add it to a paper. So the  journals are losing against the counterfeiter as we speak.<p>What&#x27;s more, it is possible to run the detection tools long after publication, which makes it harder for someone to fake images because they run the risk of being detected later on with a more advanced version of the tooling. Typically malware devs try to erase all traces of their bad deeds and to run away undetected for this exact reason. But how do you hide an already published paper?<p>Finally, it takes efforts to run the tools. If this effort is greater than the effort it takes to fake an image, which it is, then the cost may become prohibitive, so fakers will try to avoid faking+prechecking in favour of faking+hiding (by publishing in unchecked journals for example). That is until they group together to organize faking at scale (setting up and automating a tool like that is probably were the cost is, not running it). Faking at scale does exist, some countries practice it eagerly. So now the question becomes: do we turn a blank eye to such blatant misuse of research or do we try to take them red-handed and to ban&#x2F;punish bad behavior? Not such a hard question since being on the offensive is the only scenario where we have a remote chance of stopping or at least reducing the influx of faked papers, you don&#x27;t stop the mafia by ignoring them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37773222" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37773222" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">civilized</span><span>|</span><a href="#37773071">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37775020">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37774482">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37773222">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37773222">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think it might stay the same as it&#x27;s always been: perfectly executed fraud is impossible to detect, but fraudsters are lazy and leave clues.</div><br/><div id="37774217" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37774217" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">corethree</span><span>|</span><a href="#37773071">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37773222">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37774482">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37774217">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37774217">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sounds like a problem that AI can solve!

Publish a preprint and let the world have at it! You don’t need a committee to decide who your ‘peers’ are: if they care enough they will be reading your paper anyway. Normalising publishing these reviews (like PubPeer) would ensure review, without an arbitrary choice of ‘peers’. Think a paper needs more reviews? Then pay the reviewers and publish their reviews. The benefits of secrecy and gate keeping are negligible compared to the downside.<p>Currently billions are spent on academic publishing even though servers are cheap and the labour is unpaid. This would be a good starting point to fund replications. But that will never happen while the status quo is “peer reviewed = good science”<p>Also, scientists should be spending time on what they think is valuable. Scientists happily replicate important papers using their existing resources. If no-one cares about your result and won&#x27;t replicate for free, then pay someone to do it! This is the basis of adversarial collaborations (see FEP collaboration funded by a philanthropic foundation). No-one is advocating that e.g. we replicate newtons law for the Nth time. And how to determine if N is enough? Use Lakatos&#x27; MSRP to compare rival theories.<p>Again, these dreams are predicated on the status quo changing to where scientists care about the content of a paper, not where is it published or that a faceless committee has accepted its foibles.

Only a fraction of reviewers (depending on field) will check that the paper includes enough information to be reproduced.

Same idea with reputation, hard to get your career started if you want to work on theories that go against the prevailing theory or if you have work that contradicts it.<p>This is the whole idea behind the concept of paradigm shifts.</div><br/><div id="37774720" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37774720" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Guvante</span><span>|</span><a href="#37773071">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37774521">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37775028">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37774720">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37774720">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The former issue will be easier to fix than the latter.<p>After all going against the establishment generally results in failure.<p>Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity may not agree with each other but they both have destroyed mountains of attempts to disprove them.<p>I am not being rosy I am on the side of &quot;we have to do something&quot; contrasted against &quot;all science is bad&quot;.<p>Not saying you are saying that but some posters are.<p>We can certainly improve things on many vectors but throwing away all existing science isn&#x27;t the way forward either.</div><br/><div id="37774884" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37774884" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">_aavaa_</span><span>|</span><a href="#37773071">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37774720">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37775002">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37774884">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37774884">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity may not agree with each other but they both have destroyed mountains of attempts to disprove them.<p>I agree.

Not sure if Nature has an angle (probably also free scans) but they gave the researcher free access to the AIT per the preprint disclaimer [0]. Also, it&#x27;s not really giving you enough info to asses whether the AIT is better, because it&#x27;s basically PR, so allow me:<p>For one, the fact-checking against the AIT per the preprint is &quot;Duplications highlighted by ImageTwin.ai were evaluated as appropriate or inappropriate by80
one reviewer (the author)&quot;. Not a great way to reduce false-positives given the conflict of interest (more free scans for the author!) and the fact he&#x27;d already reviewed most of the offenders.<p>Also, the article says the AIT missed four papers the author flagged. But in the preprint the category with &quot;At least one inappropriate duplication was identified during the manual review, none were highlighted by the ImageTwin.ai software&quot; has 34 members. Per the author&#x27;s results text, out of 715 papers with images, the author caught 34 inappropriate duplications the AIT missed, the AIT caught 57 inappropriate duplications that the author subsequently agreed were bad, and they both caught 24 together. But these numbers disagree with the venn diagram shown in figure 3 and referenced in the conclusion, which the Nature article also references. So... am I missing something or is that inconsistent? And were there any AIT flagged papers that the author disagreed were problematic or not?<p>AIT charges a pretty non-trivial amount per scan, at high volume it&#x27;s still &gt;$2 before you get to custom pricing [1]. It was &quot;only&quot; 2-3x faster than the researcher, and at least per the article it still needs to be checked for false positives. Taking some normal researcher pay and reasonable estimates for the rate at which they can review papers, it seems like the AIT is pretty damn expensive and might be priced competitively to &quot;research intern&quot;.<p>This technology has existed for a really long time in the form of reverse image search. Google launched it in 2011, later neutered it (probably not profitable enough), but Yandex still has a pretty good one since 2014 [2]. Overall this seems like a pretty sloppy preprint with an obvious conflict of interest, and a tool that doesn&#x27;t have any apparent innovation beyond commercializing a probably-underserved vertical.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biorxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2023.09.03.556099v2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biorxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2023.09.03.556099v2</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imagetwin.ai&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imagetwin.ai&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.searchenginewatch.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;19&#x2F;yandexs-sibir-reverse-image-search-technology-is-pure-awesome&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.searchenginewatch.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;19&#x2F;yandexs-sibir-r...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37773559" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37773559" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">23B1</span><span>|</span><a href="#37775149">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37773818">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37773559">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37773559">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Machines are very good at detecting other machines.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37773818" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37773818" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">supernova87a</span><span>|</span><a href="#37773559">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37773818">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37773818">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why is the article&#x27;s title phrased with the word &quot;problematic&quot; rather than &quot;duplicated&quot; or outright &quot;fraudulent&quot;?

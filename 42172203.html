Two days after the battle, Germany requested an armistice, and the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires disintegrated. Two months later in the US in 1919, prohibition went into effect, 26 cities had violent race riots, and the Attorney General began a purge of immigrants and communists. In 1920, the Republican Party returned to the White House with the landslide victory of Warren G. Harding, who promised a &quot;return to normalcy&quot; after the years of war, ethnic hatreds, race riots and exhausting reforms. Harding used new advertising techniques to lead the GOP to a massive landslide.   <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_the_United_States_(1917%E2%80%931945)#1919:_strikes,_riots_and_scares" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_the_United_States_(...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42226578" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42226578" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">globalnode</span><span>|</span><a href="#42226606">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42225489">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42226578">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42226578">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">what a touching story</div><br/></div></div><div id="42225409" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42225409" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smitty1e</span><span>|</span><a href="#42225489">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42225865">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42225409">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42225409">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Sixteen years old when I went to the war<p>To fight for a land fit for heroes<p>God on my side, and a gun in my hand<p>Chasing my days down to zero&quot;--Motorhead, 1916<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kTG6I3jxdnc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kTG6I3jxdnc</a></div><br/><div id="42226312" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42226312" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CobrastanJorji</span><span>|</span><a href="#42225409">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42226159">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42226312">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42226312">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was the first fruits of the battle of Missionary Ridge.<p>When I felt the bullet enter my heart<p>I wished I had staid at home and gone to jail<p>For stealing the hogs of Curl Trenary,<p>Instead of running away and joining the army.<p>Rather a thousand times the country jail<p>Than to lie under this marble figure with wings,<p>And this granite pedestal<p>Bearing the words, ”Pro Patria.”<p>What do they mean, anyway?<p>- Edgar Lee Masters, from Spoon River Anthology.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42226159" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42226159" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ddejohn</span><span>|</span><a href="#42225409">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42226312">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42225865">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42226159">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42226159">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is a lot of really phenomenal metal based around WWI for anybody else interested.

It is no more realistic than changing someone&#x27;s religion by persuasion - possible, but rare.<p>&quot;Knocking people&#x27;s heads together&quot; doesn&#x27;t work on people who have the entire military force of their country at their disposal. Such heads are basically un-knockable.

We can tell that by comparing the number of civilian victims whenever Russia bombs Ukraine, with the number of civilian victims when Israel bombs Gaza or Lebanon. While there is no excuse for &quot;collateral damage&quot; (that&#x27;s the Western term, I&#x27;m sure Russians have a similar euphemism), and one civilian victim is one too many, it is clear that Russia is targeting infrastructure and not humans. It is throwing many more, and more powerful bombs than Israel and doing orders of magnitude fewer civilian victims. This (false) narrative may have worked, had the conflict between Israel and Palestine not restarted, providing a grim yet useful comparison point.<p>Regarding the first statement, the extent to which Ukraine was disarmed is subject to debate. After all, demilitarization is an explicit goal of the Russia invasion. The main reason Russia invaded Ukraine is to prevent it from being used as a NATO-powered bulwark against Russia in the future, as America often does with its &quot;allies&quot;.

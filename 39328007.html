And don’t get me wrong, those interviews can be fun (in the same way that Project Euler can be fun), but it’s not very relevant for most jobs</i><p>I&#x27;m curious what changed around 2015-2016 that led to the current interview process. In the before times the interview was more of a technical conversation, sure they had some gotcha questions, but nothing too brutal. If you had real experience that you could talk about, maybe it was validated against references or a background check. People usually looked for a CS or adjacent degree, and that was enough. The quality of folks wasn&#x27;t too different in my experience.<p>I really feel for those with a lot of experience that are being dropped into the fire, especially those with families who may not have the time to memorize patterns for 3 months, but are still very capable. Non-tech, low paying jobs now ask you to create a soduko solver or trap rain water within 45 minutes.

For example, there are personnel issues, company image, proprietary tech, etc.  Also, you don&#x27;t want to say something that ends up misleadingly quoted out of context on a jobs forum or word-of-mouth by someone with a different sense of professionalism or confidentiality, and you don&#x27;t want to give ammo to a spy from a competitor.<p>In practice, the line of what to say seems pretty intuitive to hit, and I haven&#x27;t knowingly had a problem with it.

You can try to evaluate traders, but the deep truth is that very good traders can become very bad traders  seamlessly because nothing guarantees any success of any kind in that domain. 
When interviewing software engineers you shouldn&#x27;t care that much about the abilities that someone shows during the time of a technical interview on a specific day; that&#x27;s not an appropriate way to measure the skills you need for your business. Leet code is an appropriate way to measure how much such engineer is able to perform as a competitive coder. You will never need a competitive coder in your team; because what to be done in SE is not about coding less than 10 lines of code in less than X minutes to transform data A into data B. But back to candidate selection, due to the short amount of time you have to meet applicants, you finally decide to hire whatever person that succeeded to find the fastest solution to the almost scholastic problem you proposed because in the end, you fail to understand what could be the appropriate selection method : aren&#x27;t all candidates more or less equivalent if you stop proposing leet code problems ? What can prove that X person with 5 years of exp is less good than that one that worked at google for 6 years ? Does it really matters than candidate Y doesn&#x27;t know Go when all the languages we use aren&#x27;t that <i>truly</i> different ? Is someone from nowhere, without any education of any sort, but that seems to be an hobbyist programmer since his childhood really a <i>bad</i> candidate ?
You never know, but because whether you&#x27;re HR or the person with technical authority in the team, you don&#x27;t want to risk anything, and you believe that a good leet code solver can do the work.
And finally, to me, that&#x27;s the truth : more than 50% of the persons you decided to offer an interview would have done the work with success, and at least 20% seemed very nice, and you couldn&#x27;t choose so leet code was the thing.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39330932" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39330932" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">a_wild_dandan</span><span>|</span><a href="#39329680">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39331207">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39329469">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39330932">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39330932">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They should live stream interviewing the stock trading fish.

For instance, for a penetration testing role, I&#x27;ve run standardized interviews that involve generating and prioritizing attack surface lists and hypothetical bug lists. The output isn&#x27;t &quot;pass&#x2F;fail&quot;, it&#x27;s the list of places to test, the list of bugs expected, scheduling&#x2F;testing budgets, and things like that.

You can do design exercises, you can work out the dependencies that are going to be needed for a particular complicated project, you can do estimation exercises, you can catalog likely bugs. Review some PRs together. Look at the day-to-day work your team does, and then make the exercise a model of that work.<p>It&#x27;s not especially easy to do compared to just sitting down and asking a bunch of questions. Moreover, it&#x27;s <i>very hard</i> to adopt it as a practice, because you have to trust the rubric (iterating on it over time, but using it enough for it to be meaningful) and not override it based on extrinsic considerations (referrals, misgivings about candidate background, &amp;c).<p>But the upside is pretty obvious?

I&#x27;ve been on the receiving end of a couple of very bad attempts.<p>In one, which I have described here before, an interviewer asked me to design a system for selling concert tickets. After half an hour of confused back and forth, it emerged that they wanted a network service that replied to requests with unpredictable random integers, which did not repeat, unless the service rebooted and then it was okay if there was an accidental repeat. Needless to say, I started with a lot of assumptions based on the idea of selling concert tickets, and I don&#x27;t think it reflected poorly on me that it took so long to figure out that the real problem they were judging me by was so radically different from the one they asked me to solve.<p>I had another interview recently which had a similar wrinkle. The interviewer asked for a system to solve a very particular problem, which because of the particulars of the problem would involve receiving very small amounts of data from systems in the field. The interviewer asked multiple times about the cost of data ingress and data storage, and each time I deflected them, saying that it wasn&#x27;t significant compared to other costs in the system. I was so focused on solving the problem as stated that it didn&#x27;t dawn on me until later that the interviewer likely had a different problem in mind in which the data was much bigger, and they were evaluating whether I could be sensitive to those costs and design an economical system.<p>Interviews like these are very frustrating, and I don&#x27;t think they will lead to great hires. You will end up hiring people who solve the problem you have in mind even though you told them to solve a different problem. These programmers will have the same biases and preoccupations as you, which might make them easy to incorporate into your team, but they will probably have the same blind spots as well, which means your team will be less prepared to solve new problems in the future.</div><br/><div id="39331157" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39331157" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ascar</span><span>|</span><a href="#39331106">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39329940">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39331157">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39331157">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To be fair, I would say if your task is to design a system it&#x27;s your job to find out what the person actually wants and not run with assumptions you made based on a bad description.

Most companies are going to put you through the 10 round process or some other tedious process. Unless you&#x27;re financially willing and able to turn down over 50% (probably a lot more actually) of job opportunities. And most people have bills, mortgages, rent, food they&#x27;d like to be able to afford. So it goes.<p>I don&#x27;t like it either btw. I agree with you in principle.<p>Rest of your points are good though.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39329481" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39329481" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">X9</span><span>|</span><a href="#39329940">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39330477">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39329481">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39329481">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Love this approach!

Admittedly the job market was really quiet but it was eye opening the differences in interview techniques and processes.<p>I had one interview from a FinTech company which I actually thought went quite well, the next day I got a rejection stating &quot;I need to improve my STAR technique&quot;. I just rolled my eyes thinking FFS<p>Another company the CTO wasn&#x27;t on the call but had asked to record the last 15 minutes of the interview with questions he&#x27;d prepared, I was close to terminating the interview. If he couldn&#x27;t be assed sitting in on the interview why should I answer questions the interviewer himself didn&#x27;t understand. One of the questions was &quot;What is triple D&quot;. I&#x27;m an experienced dev, fully aware there are too many acronyms in the industry but had never heard of triple D before, when I googled it after I was thinking FFS, that&#x27;s just what any competent dev does by default. I guesses data driven development but admitted I wasn&#x27;t sure.<p>Another interview the principal engineer yawned 3 times when I was talking before I even got to the half way stage, not one apology. I know it&#x27;s just human nature but to not even acknowledge  he was making me uncomfortable reminded me afterwards that it&#x27;s probably a toxic work culture, which I&#x27;ve been told since is the case from people who worked there.<p>Thankfully at the start of the new year I was offered 3 roles, 2 of them I thought I&#x27;d screwed up the interview. The one I accepted, apart from taking on a task to review some code and raise issues with it, I was asked to describe an architecture of some system I&#x27;d worked on and enjoyed. I spoke too long, going past the interview time but didn&#x27;t feel I explained the whole system.<p>I understand interviewing candidates is difficult, I&#x27;ve had to do it a few times in the past but the competency of interviewers and the process to score candidates varies wildly from organisation to organisation. A realisation for me although I was already aware of it, is the personality of the people interviewing you varies wildly, more often than not it&#x27;s a good indication of the organisation itself.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39331108" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39331108" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rohanjain91</span><span>|</span><a href="#39331025">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39330380">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39331108">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39331108">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s very similar to how good product management interviews are conducted.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39330380" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39330380" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dangus</span><span>|</span><a href="#39331108">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39331421">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39330380">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39330380">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This sounds like a regular situational interview?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

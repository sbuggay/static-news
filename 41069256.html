I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m worth compared to other reverse-engineers and my signature technique is extremely fringe.

Knowing various programming patterns and architectures is helpful for making sense of (de)compiled code during static analysis. Being knee-deep in the bowels of a misbehaving program armed with GDB and you&#x27;re getting a taste of dynamic analysis. Throw in some missing debugging symbols or advanced optimization work and you&#x27;ll pick up some assembly on the way.<p>In my eyes, the only real difference is the mindset.

This reads like a lot of fluff or immediately unimportant stuff.<p>Reverse engineering in the real world takes a few forms, some of which the write takes on too briefly towards the end of the material. Applied reverse engineer is usually modifying an existing piece of software so:<p><pre><code>    * .dll&#x2F;lib injection
    * signature scanning and patching
    * packet interception and rewriting
    * mitm HTTP(s) calls
</code></pre>
These are just a few places where you see reverse engineering used, usually to modify existing software.<p>I&#x27;m curious if there&#x27;s any reading out there that covers this stuff from the meat and potatoes and less of this CS 101 stuff.<p>I&#x27;ve done all of the above, and you can usually learn about this stuff from some different forums on the web, but I don&#x27;t know of any good bibles on the subject matter.</div><br/><div id="41070821" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41070821" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">boricj</span><span>|</span><a href="#41070079">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41070422">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41070821">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41070821">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Applied reverse-engineering is all about bending the rules of engineering. Because of this, I think it can be learned through experience, but I doubt it can be taught through theory (or at least not in an effective manner). At its core, it&#x27;s about spotting metapatterns to gain an understanding of a program and applying leverage to affect it. That&#x27;s more art than science, no matter how much tooling you throw at it.<p>Honestly, I think the most effective way to learn about how to reverse-engineer something is to learn engineering at the same layer first and then start tinkering. If you want to binary patch a program, learn assembly. If you want to inject a .dll, learn how to write and use dynamic libraries. If you want to MITM a REST API, learn how to call a REST API. Because once you know the rules well, you can start breaking them and see exactly how much you can get away with.<p>I wrote a series of articles on reverse-engineering on my blog, about studying and modifying a program that outputs an ASCII table, mostly because I needed a way to introduce delinking as a technique.

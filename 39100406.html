So the editorializing of the title is quite uncalled for.<p>Some notable takeaways (still applicable today albeit under different guises);<p>&gt; As a pioneer of “social therapy,” an approach that classified personal pathologies as political symptoms,<p>&gt; he grasped that racism was an abyss in its own right.<p>&gt; the psychic distortions that imperialism inflicts on colonists and colonized alike.<p>&gt; He saw firsthand that colonialism exiles us from ourselves:<p>&gt; At the core of Fanon’s increasingly radical approach to mental health care was his conviction that, as Shatz puts it, “some forms of psychological suffering have their roots not in an individual’s psychic constitution but in oppressive social relations.”<p>&gt; The forms that mental illness takes within a certain society are good guides to its neuroses, and Fanon knew well that the racist phobias and fantasies of his European patients functioned as windows onto the world that colonialism had wrought.<p>&gt; But even the most innovative clinical techniques did not go far enough for Fanon, who knew that political solutions are the only long-term remedy for political diseases. Colonialism is “a system of pathological relations masquerading as normality,” Shatz eloquently writes,<p>&gt; In his view, anti-colonial violence was “a kind of medicine, rekindling a sense of power and self-mastery” that allowed the colonized to recover their dignity by way of self-assertion.<p>&gt; The abolition of imperialism was the best medicine, both for Algerians and for everyone else who lived under colonialism, but in the interim, its indignities smarted — and even after it was dismantled, its traumas would linger.<p>&gt; At a conference in 1956, he warned against the “exoticism” that occupiers often adopt toward native populations,<p>&gt; All of them were victims of what Fanon called the “mental disorders of colonial warfare,” which plagued him in equal measure. In a world so sick, no one could be cured, not even the doctors.</div><br/><div id="39114924" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39114924" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pvg</span><span>|</span><a href="#39114604">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39114912">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39114924">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39114924">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>So the editorializing of the title is quite uncalled for.</i><p>This is one of the weedsier HN title rules, book review titles are changed to the title of the book.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

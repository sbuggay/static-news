All to often I see managers tell me they want to be the &lt;insert something popular&gt; brand. More often than not I ask them is that true about this company? Many don&#x27;t see the connection between promoting something true to your core vs what you want to be perceived as. Some literally feel offended no being what they want to be even when it&#x27;s clear.<p>The line I reuse is, &quot;Find a fundamental truth, then celebrate it&quot;<p>Truth doesn&#x27;t mean you cant polish and choose the best angle, but the truth must be there and exist today.<p>One of the classic examples is the Guiness dancing man. They literally celebrated how long it takes to pour a Guiness vs ignoring or tying to make out it&#x27;s not that long.

You&#x27;d quickly get a picture of how everybody worked together, and then it&#x27;d click.<p>Boom, &quot;if there&#x27;s a way to paint a target right about...
here, so to speak, definitely do it.&quot; That kind of thing.<p>It was interesting to me because the work often showed a very sharp relief around the concept of &quot;core self&quot; and &quot;projected persona&quot;. A lot of people run fantasy businesses and effectively hallucinate what it is they do, or offer. This feels like a tremendous mission to them of course, and it provides important energy.<p>But you had to be very careful about telling people that the persona--or the &quot;who I want people to think I am &#x2F; we are&quot; was by definition generally less available in terms of raw productivity energy. This would tend to kick the logic stool out from underneath their value proposition. Then they automatically think, &quot;of course, so life has to be boring.&quot;<p>IOW if you were telling an architectural illustration firm, established and profitable after years of hard work, that they were basically a political advocacy organization by default, and probably couldn&#x27;t _not_ be that if they tried--that was not really something you could just come out and say to everybody.<p>So to this day I&#x27;m very familiar with orgs out there that are hired for architectural illustration or whatever, and then the topic of political maneuvering comes up, and the client suddenly pulls them in closer, and later keeps asking for illustration work in the future, because...well, probably because they like the huge discount they get on political strategy!<p>That the vendor doesn&#x27;t want to look at their own work this way is not the client&#x27;s problem, and the accompanying under-valuing of their services definitely seems to be a covert benefit.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35785795" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35785795" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aqme28</span><span>|</span><a href="#35782661">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35785686">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35785795">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35785795">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This feels like textbook survivorship bias as advice.

And the idea of motivating the reader by giving an example is sound, even though in and of themselves, single examples reek to high heaven of survivorship bias.<p>If it motivates someone to not give up because they don’t seem to fit the existing templates for success, that is necessary, but not sufficient by a long shot.<p>What’s missing are concrete tactics for succeeding with the strategy of “make your own niche.” Lacking specific tactics for replication—at any scale, in any field—its primary value IMO is as an exhortation to go out and research how to succeed with this strategy.<p>It’s only a short essay, so it really has no more weight then the preface of a book. And that’s what it reads like: An anecdote at the beginning of a book about succeeding as a niche or specialized entity…<p>Only the rest of the book—with specific chapters detailing the strategy at finer levels of detail and laying out tactics to thrive—is missing. We are left to either fumble around blindly, frustrated that we are unable to “paint the target around our arrow,” or go out and do a lot more reading and learning to assemble the rest of the book by hand.<p>If anyone does find this inspirational or thought-provoking, there are entire books touching on the subject that provide a lot more value. If this motivates people to go out and read such books, it’s not a complete waste of time, but it is incomplete and fails to say “Hey, this is just to whet your appetite, this is the beginning of a long journey. Bruce took decades to discover what worked by trial and error and working with others, you can read these books to get you started on the right road.”<p>I’ll contribute one book recommendation: “Marketing Warfare” by Reis and Trout. It’s also lightweight and easily digestible, but it contains a simple model of competition that divides business into four different strategies (offence, defence, flanking, guerrilla) and then details specific advice for success in each one.<p>What they call “guerrilla” is closest to what this essay espouses, and readers may find their advice a little more actionable. But even then, that book is not a complete how-to. You have to keep learning and keep researching.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35788234" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35788234" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">grungydan</span><span>|</span><a href="#35785795">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35788510">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35785686">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35788234">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35788234">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m a litle surprised to see something so vapid ranking so high on the site.</div><br/><div id="35788559" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35788559" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">a4isms</span><span>|</span><a href="#35785795">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35788234">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35785686">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35788559">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35788559">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In some ways, the less such an essay says, the easier it is to become a “tabula rasa,” where the reader fills in the huge, empty spaces with things they already believe.<p>The next step is to applaud the essay because the reader feels it “feels right.” Of course it feels right if you mentally fill in the blanks, and if it says nothing that can be empirically falsified.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35785686" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35785686" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Fricken</span><span>|</span><a href="#35785795">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35785625">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35785686">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35785686">[22 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Instead of aiming for the same target as other musicians—trying to out-sing or out-play them—Springsteen instead doubled down on the quality that made him unique: His ability to write song lyrics.<p>No, the ability to write song lyrics does not make Bruce Springsteen unique.

All to often I see managers tell me they want to be the &lt;insert something popular&gt; brand. More often than not I ask them is that true about this company? Many don&#x27;t see the connection between promoting something true to your core vs what you want to be perceived as. Some literally feel offended no being what they want to be even when it&#x27;s clear.<p>The line I reuse is, &quot;Find a fundamental truth, then celebrate it&quot;<p>Truth doesn&#x27;t mean you cant polish and choose the best angle, but the truth must be there and exist today.<p>One of the classic examples is the Guiness dancing man. They literally celebrated how long it takes to pour a Guiness vs ignoring or tying to make out it&#x27;s not that long.

You&#x27;d quickly get a picture of how everybody worked together, and then it&#x27;d click.<p>Boom, &quot;if there&#x27;s a way to paint a target right about...
here, so to speak, definitely do it.&quot; That kind of thing.<p>It was interesting to me because the work often showed a very sharp relief around the concept of &quot;core self&quot; and &quot;projected persona&quot;. A lot of people run fantasy businesses and effectively hallucinate what it is they do, or offer. This feels like a tremendous mission to them of course, and it provides important energy.<p>But you had to be very careful about telling people that the persona--or the &quot;who I want people to think I am &#x2F; we are&quot; was by definition generally less available in terms of raw productivity energy. This would tend to kick the logic stool out from underneath their value proposition. Then they automatically think, &quot;of course, so life has to be boring.&quot;<p>IOW if you were telling an architectural illustration firm, established and profitable after years of hard work, that they were basically a political advocacy organization by default, and probably couldn&#x27;t _not_ be that if they tried--that was not really something you could just come out and say to everybody.<p>So to this day I&#x27;m very familiar with orgs out there that are hired for architectural illustration or whatever, and then the topic of political maneuvering comes up, and the client suddenly pulls them in closer, and later keeps asking for illustration work in the future, because...well, probably because they like the huge discount they get on political strategy!<p>That the vendor doesn&#x27;t want to look at their own work this way is not the client&#x27;s problem, and the accompanying under-valuing of their services definitely seems to be a covert benefit.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35783842" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35783842" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">plq</span><span>|</span><a href="#35782661">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35782643">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35783842">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35783842">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh sure, do that.

class="content">Regarding your mention of rhyming dictionaries, it&#x27;s perhaps not widely known, but they are not considered cheats by most songwriters, but rather essential tools of the trade, like code editors or inline docs for programmers.<p>If you pointedly refuse to use one you&#x27;re not being more authentic, you&#x27;re just making your job much harder.<p>At the risk of destroying the mystique of the craft, I will also say that they are not used in the way you might think. Instead of writing the second line of a verse and then looking for a rhyming word that somehow fits, it&#x27;s common to compile lists of relevant rhymes to your starter material and theme, and work backwards, creating lines that connect to the rhymes. If you do this the other way around it&#x27;s very hard to write meaningful verses without abandoning your rhyming scheme.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35784013" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35784013" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">markeibes</span><span>|</span><a href="#35782539">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35783693">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35784098">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35784013">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35784013">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Have you Read the lyrics to &quot;For You&quot; recently?

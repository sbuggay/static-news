The outer ends of the line have only the old fixed-block signalling. The section from Westall in the south east to (eventually) Sunshine in the north has both. There is a dedicated model of train, the HCMT, which is fitted with the CBTC and is the only type that can run through the tunnel during normal operation. When an HCMT passes Westall heading towards the tunnel, the lamps on the fixed block signalling ahead of it go out. When a diesel regional train has HCMTs ahead of it on the next fixed block, it will see the lamps lit for Stop.<p>Trains runnin have been running this way in normal passenger service for months now, though I think it’s only in the last few weeks they’ve been testing it with HCMTs entering the tunnel at Hawksburn with diesels behind them instead going to South Yarra. (Currently, the trains with actual passengers take the South Yarra route at that junction.)<p>The HCMTs run only on this line, from Sunbury to East Pakenham&#x2F;Cranbourne. They have their own new depot at East Pakenham so they don’t have to go elsewhere for stabling and maintenance. And they probably can’t; just for them to go through the City Loop as is temporarily required that tunnel had to be resignalled (the old location wasn’t visible from the cab.)<p>They did run an old Comeng train through the Metro Tunnel, without any signalling, to test clearance for a track maintenance train.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42545716" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42545716" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bobthepanda</span><span>|</span><a href="#42520400">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42544500">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42546089">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42545438">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42545716">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42545716">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">At least in other systems the way this works is that any train using CBTC going onto a non-CBTC section will just operate using non-CBTC. Which is fine for lower frequency branches or emergency diversions. All you need for non-CBTC operation is a driver who can see.<p>It is also, where provisions have been made, possible to put CBTC equipment on old trains. That is what NYC is doing, for example.</div><br/><div id="42545970" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42545970" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">skissane</span><span>|</span><a href="#42520400">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42545716">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42545438">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42545970">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42545970">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; All you need for non-CBTC operation is a driver who can see.<p>Wikipedia&#x27;s article on CBTC [0] seems to want to limit the term to moving block systems only, not including fixed block – I&#x27;m not sure if that is correct or if that is just some agenda some Wikipedia editor has.<p>But it seems to me that even in a fixed block system, the train could operate (semi-automatically) if it knew its location and the location and current state of signals – and the current signal state could be broadcast to it via radio. Would you call such a system CBTC or not?<p>Also, it seems to me that fixed block with physical signals and moving block CBTC could coexist on the same line. Moving block CBTC trains are authorised to disregard red signals, and instead get their movement authority via radio; fixed block trains are not. If a fixed block train is in a fixed block, that locks the block out for all trains (both fixed and moving); if a moving block train is in a fixed block, that locks the block out for all fixed block trains; but two moving block trains can coexist in the same fixed block provided their moving blocks are non-overlapping.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Communications-based_train_control" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Communications-based_train_con...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42545438" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42545438" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RossBencina</span><span>|</span><a href="#42520400">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42544500">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42545716">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42518809">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42545438">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42545438">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not sure that they are going to run non-CBTC trains through the new tunnel.<p>I have heard it said that the level crossing removal program is associated with a goal of moving to driverless trains network-wide.

My $100m project was charged with replacing a tiny part of their mortgage system: the onboarding of a new customer. That was it: just getting a new customer in to the existing legacy system.<p>Oracle were the prime. They were a disgrace. Accenture had their grubby little fingers in the pie and were theoretically, laughably, going to run the thing. They used to charge us $2m to copy and paste documents. The thieves.<p>It was an utter shambles. The &#x27;plan on a page&#x27; was diamond shapes on a PowerPoint slide. There was no link to any sort of reality.<p>I lasted 9 months before the blessed gods let me go.

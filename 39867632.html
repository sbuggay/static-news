Back in high school, I used to volunteer at an animal shelter, and we had an area out back where we&#x27;d walk the dogs or let them run around in one of a few fenced in areas throughout the day so they could go to the bathroom and get some exercise. The door leading out here was located in one of the rooms with dog kennels, so people coming to potentially adopt a dog would walk through this room a lot, and often they&#x27;d try to walk out back and watch or participate with the volunteers and staff taking some of the dogs out. We&#x27;d ask them politely to go back inside because they aren&#x27;t allowed out there and point out the very large sign in large font on the door saying this, and every time they&#x27;d always act very surprised because they claimed not to have seen it. I&#x27;m sure some people were just feigning ignorance because it seemed easier, but the sheer number of people claiming it makes it believable that at least _some_ of them genuinely didn&#x27;t notice; they saw a door, they wanted to go through, and they opened it without processing the words right in front of their face.</div><br/><div id="39868832" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39868832" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">petsfed</span><span>|</span><a href="#39868063">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39868085">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39868832">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39868832">[48 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There are situations where its hard to understand <i>how</i> even the non-verbal warnings didn&#x27;t latch though.<p>There&#x27;s &quot;no unauthorized personnel&quot;, and then there&#x27;s &quot;Fire door, alarm will sound&quot;.<p>In college, i worked at a university recreation center, and the desk I worked at was about 15 feet from a fire door. It sat somewhat between the weight room and the men&#x27;s locker room, so virtually all male customers walked past this specific, well marked, fire door during their visit. And about 2-3 times a week, while I was working, somebody would finish up their workout and just push that door open and walk out. And every time, they&#x27;d look thunderstruck that the alarm did in fact sound.<p>I eventually dropped all pretense of understanding that they were on autopilot, and began commenting as I deactivated and reactivated the alarm AGAIN &quot;I thought universities required students be able to read&quot;.

This door had a fire alarm on it.<p>The university needed to control access to the facility through one secure checkpoint (that I had worked at in the past, but at this time no longer did so). They didn&#x27;t want (for instance) random townies to be able to come and go via the side doors without filling out the relevant liability waivers, because it turns out screwing around in a weight room carries some risk. To say nothing of the consequences of some rando wandering in off the street and posting up in the locker room.<p>I was answering phone calls, helping people rent outdoor equipment. My job was not at all watching the door.

A cost center that they&#x27;re only too happily outsourcing to generative AI.<p>Even the word &quot;content&quot; is a problem. It&#x27;s industry jargon but I view it as something of an euphemism. This so called &quot;content&quot; is nothing but a generic replaceable square around which the ads agglutinate like parasites. The web today is mostly garbage because of all this industrial scale &quot;content&quot; being produced. Nobody has anything <i>real</i> to say, it&#x27;s just &quot;content&quot; they produce by the truckloads in order to attract people to sites so they can sell out their audience&#x27;s minds to the corporations. There ought to be a better name for it. &quot;Slop&quot; comes to mind. Yeah, slop sounds good.<p>All this slop isn&#x27;t real human creation, it&#x27;s just an undesirable industrial byproduct of the modern web. People create slop in order to attract audiences so they can sell them out to the advertisers. When you see HN users complaining about how shitty the Google search results are, they&#x27;re complaining about the ever increasing density of worthless slop they&#x27;re running into when they search for literally anything. People are actually paying for search engines whose entire business model is filtering out the slop and presenting to their users the sites which are actually worth visiting.<p>Hell, this is why people come to HN to begin with. There&#x27;s a refreshingly small amount of slop on this site. On HN you find <i>real</i> people writing <i>real</i> thoughts. People who work at billion dollar companies, people who created programming languages and operating systems that others use, people who thought up the algorithms you learn about in books, a disproportionate number of them come here in order to comment on things. Sometimes they tell incredible stories. Those comments are more valuable than the articles being commented on. This is what slop <i>isn&#x27;t</i>: real human culture. Maybe the advertisers just haven&#x27;t found out about HN yet. Not too long ago, there was a story here about Google bumping HN up in search results. That bit of news actually made me scared for the future.<p>What&#x27;s more sinister though is the fact advertisers have literal censorship power over the web. You&#x27;ll never see a text such as this comment posted on an ad-supported website. The fact is if it offends the advertisers it doesn&#x27;t get published at all. Because if you publish it, they cut you off from your advertising money. Therefore the advertisers <i>own</i> the creators and control their creative processes. I&#x27;ve seen such cutoffs happen, it&#x27;s downright pathetic. Watching good people bend down to the likes of Google because someone with money was offended at their brand being associated with something they didn&#x27;t like even though they literally paid for it. I watched people scramble to unpublish, to delete, to <i>destroy</i> their own creations just to appease the almighty advertisers. It seriously made me sick.<p>&gt; distastefully full of ads<p>It&#x27;s made to be that way. It&#x27;s carefully tuned via unethical human experimentation (&quot;A&#x2F;B testing&quot;) to make it as profitable as possible but just tolerable enough that you won&#x27;t leave or do something about it. They employ talented programmers to design algorithms to automatically figure out your limits and push you right up to those limits.<p>Use uBlock Origin. It&#x27;s essentially legitimate self-defense at this point. Self-defense for our minds.<p>Don&#x27;t try to pay them off, that just proves you have disposable income to spend on products you don&#x27;t need, driving up the value of your attention even further. You&#x27;re essentially paying for the privilege of segmenting yourself into the upper echelons of their markets. At some point, some shareholder value maximizing CEO <i>will</i> come along, notice the vast piles of money being left on the table and then promptly sell out the audience so as to avoid leaving money on the table. Betrayal is virtually guaranteed.<p>Don&#x27;t empathize with them. Just laugh when they call you entitled, when they call you a thief. Nobody in this world is more entitled than an advertiser. They think they are entitled to your attention. They think they can sell <i>your</i> attention to corporations. The mere fact they even <i>think</i> your attention is theirs to sell to begin with just invalidates anything they could possibly say in their defense. You&#x27;ll watch them defend nonsense such as &quot;intellectual property&quot; even though they constantly violate <i>your</i> right to privacy by collecting vast amounts of personal information about you, information that really ought to belong to you by all reasonable standards.<p>Just use uBlock Origin.

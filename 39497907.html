However, many emperors spent little time in Rome, and when there was a civil war it was apparently common to declare some other city a “New Rome,” so that idea was going around. Roman citizenship was considerably more flexible than other ancient empires, including people of many ethnicities, and was eventually extended to every free inhabitant in the empire. They didn’t just call themselves Roman, they legally were citizens, despite not living in and never going to Rome.<p>We could instead focus on the similarities, like not having a monarchy. Anyone could be chosen emperor if they were in the right place at the right time. (Originally by being a popular and effective general, but later acclaimed by the crowds in Constantinople after political maneuvering.)<p>So I agree that there’s a “Ship of Theseus” aspect to it, but it seems like a consequence of Roman flexibility, allowing the empire to evolve into something rather different over the centuries.<p>(Apparently Christianity resulted in far more religious strife, though, compared to polytheism. As a state religion, it seems like it was a turn for the worse, and the history of the many schisms over nonsense is rather tedious.)</div><br/><div id="39521620" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39521620" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JumpCrisscross</span><span>|</span><a href="#39518397">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39518703">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39518871">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39521620">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39521620">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>Roman citizenship was considerably more flexible than other ancient empires, including people of many ethnicities, and was eventually extended to every free inhabitant in the empire</i><p>This practice predated the Empire by decades.

Sometimes in circles, or sometimes in a straight line when the forces are balanced.<p>Sure, down the line we will be able to do some really crazy stuff by bioengineering robots like this.

Hype over possibilities hinted at in the first few observations are basically all you can get at early stage R&amp;D, and it&#x27;s great for generating grant funding.

I seriously doubt it would have much effect at all on specialists in the field. They&#x27;re gonna follow the results, not the names.<p>Then the author doubles down at the end with a nice little bible story about the big invisible swinging dick in outer space, and how HE got Adam to name the animals.<p>Is the author seriously advocating this prehistoric creation myth? If so, that&#x27;s pathetic.<p>As for my own advocacy, I&#x27;ve always taken the opposite position regarding what happens when we apply a name. I always told my son when he was a small child, and learning a lot of words, that once we learn a name for a thing, it becomes invisible to us.<p>As soon as our brain can identify something that we know a name for, we instantly slap that label on the thing and we never see another detail of it&#x27;s actual existence. That kind of covering up endless layers of detail is essential to prevent being bogged down in the real world, but it&#x27;s also a major inhibitor to getting over stereotypes and uncovering new facts.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

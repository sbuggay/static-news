If your output is entirely dependent on a superstar, it inevitably won&#x27;t be durable against their departure; one way to look at corporations is through the lens of efficiency maximizers, but another equally valid way of thinking about them is through the lens of durability maximizers. The day-to-day actions of most people inside a corporation is far better pattern-matched toward Survivability, not Efficiency.<p>Take any company, and grade it (personally!) on both &quot;how ideologically driven is their mission&quot; and &quot;how productive are they&quot;; eight times out of ten it&#x27;ll correlate. New companies like OpenAI (&quot;we&#x27;re inventing machine intelligence&quot;; strong ideology&#x2F;mission); extremely productive. Musk&#x27;s companies, Tesla and SpaceX, extremely strong, important mission, extremely productive. Some smaller companies like 37Signals, very ideologically&#x2F;personality driven, very productive. There&#x27;s even a few big tech companies left, like Cloudflare, that have strong, coherent mission drive (&quot;Building A Better Internet&quot;) and have productivity to match it.<p>One counter-example (and why its, like, eight out of ten): Microsoft. No one has any clue what Microsoft&#x27;s mission is. That product factory still churns out more new stuff than anyone on the west coast.<p>Those two paragraphs are 100% connected, because roughly the only way to mitigate (not eliminate) the risk of superstars leaving is high, coherent mission drive. &quot;High&quot; means &quot;its clear, its communicated, its meaningful&quot; and &quot;coherent&quot; means &quot;its practiced, its demonstrated, its genuine&quot;. Compensation is another way, but the problems with compensation are (1) you will lose the compensation fight with competitors eventually, (2) it selects for actors that aren&#x27;t interested in anything except compensation, and (3) it breeds complacency&#x2F;retirement without simultaneous high+coherent mission drive (Nvidia&#x27;s problem right now).<p>Oxide [1] is an interesting case-study in mitigating some negative impacts of high compensation; &quot;Everyone at Oxide makes $201,227 USD, regardless of location.&quot;<p>It just comes down to: Poor Leadership. If the product is boring, if leadership can&#x27;t coherently communicate mission, direction, value, etc; superstars aren&#x27;t going to join or stay for very long. Everything else is window dressing. In the absence of that, the most effective way to maintain continuity of operations is normalization and &quot;the bell curve&quot;.<p>Also: If you find yourself believing &quot;well, some companies just don&#x27;t operate in an area where high mission drive is even possible, not every company is on the bleeding edge of AI CryptoTech&quot;, just stop. I don&#x27;t care what you&#x27;re doing; building a high, coherent mission is <i>always</i> possible. Amazon&#x27;s mission is to be the most customer-centric company on the planet. That&#x27;s a freakin awesome mission that would resonate with a ton of superstars, and its a mission that every damn company could have, if their leadership chooses it and is high quality enough to live it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oxide.computer&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oxide.computer&#x2F;careers</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="38830076" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38830076" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">walteweiss</span><span>|</span><a href="#38829939">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38830263">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38830058">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38830076">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38830076">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Have you ever tried freelancing or having your own company?

Is success in democratic politics really defined by content or by your ability to build a majority around certain ideas that may or may not be your own?

In software development, there are things you can measure. For example, you can put a new starter on a big pile of bugs and say “get through these”. You can measure throughput of work tasks, or story points, or lines of code. Can people game this stuff? Yes, but managers can be the check on such things (and have managers of their own).<p>I know someone that works in a sales oriented profession and who manages a large number of people. Their company is ruthless, you get only a couple of weeks to demonstrate you can hit the targets, and after that maybe a couple of weeks of grace after the hard talking to. Less than 50% of new hires make it through probation. Staff that survive all have the same attributes: excellent sales ability and focused determination. It also allows in a high percentage of narcissistic bastards though.<p>I don’t like the idea, but I wonder if a similar metric based probation would achieve the same in this industry. If you want people who can pump out quality content at a higher than average rate, set the bar high and cull ruthlessly during probation.</div><br/><div id="38830389" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38830389" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">iamflimflam1</span><span>|</span><a href="#38830188">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38830313">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38830185">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38830389">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38830389">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It has always amazed me how differently sales people are treated compared to tech.<p>One of the historical reasons has been that it’s very hard to find and hire tech people - I wonder if that is changing?<p>It’s also been fairly easy for tech teams to obfuscate performance and bamboozle managers who don’t understand tech.<p>With sales the performance criteria tends to be very simple and there aren’t really any good excuses for failure (at least none that seem to be accepted).</div><br/><div id="38830447" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38830447" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thesumofall</span><span>|</span><a href="#38830188">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38830389">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38830185">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38830447">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38830447">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think this is because sales tends to be a one-person job in most settings (except the very highest value deals). One sales person manages a number of accounts. Measuring the results of that person is then quite straightforward. Tech tends to be a collaborative job even in quite simple settings, which makes it immediately more difficult to measure. Add to that that the true results are often only visible after months if not years of work and you have a real challenge at hand. But I agree: there are also simple settings where you can measure a programmer’s productivity. Those are probably just not the settings in which people are that concerned about attracting top talents, though</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38830185" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38830185" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">freetanga</span><span>|</span><a href="#38830188">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38830071">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38830185">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38830185">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But one could argue that the person he chose to be his successor was more of a process person, rather than content, no?<p>Just thinking out loud, not trying to be smarty pants, but on the other hand people that pontificate every musing from Steve Jobs feel a bit… uneducated to me.

One can simulate a full system, including not just the processor, but also the peripherals and the system-on-a-chip interconnects, mimicking a real system&#x27;s behavior.  I really appreciate the ability to inspect the memory as well as the individual registers as you are running a program.<p>The possibility to show real-time visual feedback and debugging capabilities provides an excellent avenue for people to understand the nuances of computer architecture.  Through CPUlator, I have been able to guide learners through the use of ARMv7 assembly instructions and their usage who might not have access to ARM hardware themselves. I can&#x27;t recommend this tool enough.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36754310" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36754310" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">olliej</span><span>|</span><a href="#36753597">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36753031">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36754310">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36754310">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh wow, it supports the NIOS2. I remember my first real &quot;engineering&quot; internship basically involved bringing up a pseudo-OS for this thing, it was super new at the time, and the software - at least with whatever license my employer had at the time - was extremely limited. Essentially no OS, no memory protection, no threading (mostly needed for event dispatch on the platform I was working on) - I think other &quot;softcore&quot; CPUs existed at the time that had linux options but presumably I was being given fairly &quot;they&#x27;re an intern&quot; tasks so I&#x27;m not sure how much they really care. Certainly the bulk of their interns were EE and I was the only one who could actually write software at the time, but on the other hand that meant I didn&#x27;t know EE :D</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

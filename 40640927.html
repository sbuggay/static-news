Developers need to step back, think more deeply, and not worry about being pressured into &quot;shipping code&quot; that barely works.<p><i>The dopamine rush of your code being shipped</i><p>This frequent overstimulation leads to less ability for long-term attention. When I taught programming, I saw plenty of beginners do this, especially with an IDE, and the addictive nature of being able to edit and run to see the changes immediately lead to many of them falling into an unproductive rapid iteration loop where they were barely even thinking about what they were doing, just making random changes until something seemed to work.<p><i>Your team (and manager) sees you&#x27;re working</i><p>Tough problems need time to solve, and you won&#x27;t see much meanwhile. If needing to put on a show for others is more important than actually working, something is very wrong.<p><i>Your git commit streak looks good</i><p><i>Yes, people say this doesn&#x27;t matter. But I&#x27;m sure people like recruiters look at GitHub profiles, and an empty page isn&#x27;t a great look.</i><p>Optimising for metrics never works for those who can see through the illusion, and that&#x27;s an increasing number of people over time. If I was a recruiter and saw that sort of activity, I wouldn&#x27;t think of it as more than someone just putting on a show --- especially if the majority of those commits are effectively &quot;thrashing&quot; or &quot;churning&quot;.<p><i>The satisfaction (and mental benefits) of getting something done</i><p>I can personally say that the satisfaction is far bigger the longer you&#x27;ve persevered.</div><br/><div id="40642699" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40642699" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mythhabit</span><span>|</span><a href="#40641762">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40644036">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40642699">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40642699">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Some of the main benefits of shipping every day, is:<p><pre><code>  1.

  3. Learn to do multi phase increment.
  4. Develop an automatic deploy&#x2F;rollback system.

All are good practices, and essential if you need HA. It also gets the velocity into your daily work, so if you need to deploy extra logging, a bugfix ect, you can do it in minuts and not hours&#x2F;days&#x2F;weeks.<p>Can you do all of that and ship on a weekly basis?

Absolutely, I just haven&#x27;t met anyone that do that.<p>I&#x27;d go as far as to claim that you cannot, at least at a level close to a highly available system updated with full CD without any gating or manual intervention.<p>Weekly deployments implicitly lead to merge trains and large PRs and team members sitting on their ass to approve changes. Each deployment is huge and introduces larger changes which have a larger risk profile. As deployments are a rare occurrence, teams don&#x27;t have incentives to invest in automated tests or mechanisms to revert changes, which leads you to a brittle system and pressure to be conservative with the changes you do. As deployments are rare, breaking deployments becomes a major issue and a source of pressure.<p>To understand this, we only need to think about the work that it takes to support frequent deployments. You need to catch breaking changes early, so you feel the need to increase test coverage and invest in TDD or TDD-like development approaches. You also feel the need to have sandbox deployments available and easy to pull off. You feel the need to gate deployments between stages if any automated test set breaks. You feel the need to improve testing so that prod does not break as often. If prod breaks often,you also feel the need to automate how deployments are rolled back and changes are reverted. You also feel the need to improve troubleshooting and observability and alarming to know if and hoe things break, and improve development workflows and testing to the ensure those failures don&#x27;t happen again.<p>You get none of this if your project deploys at best 3 or 4 times a month.<p>Another problem that infrequent deployments causes is team impedance. You need more meetings to prepare for things which would otherwise be automated away. You have meetings for deployments for specific non-prod stages, you have meetings to plan rollback strategies, you have meetings to keep changelogs, you have meetings to finalize release versions, you have meetings to discuss if a change should go on this or that release cycle, etc. bullshit all around.</div><br/><div id="40643701" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40643701" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Arainach</span><span>|</span><a href="#40641762">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40643166">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40644036">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40643701">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40643701">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If your tests only run as part of deploy, you&#x27;ve already lost.<p>So long as you have a good set of integration tests and the right staging environments to run those tests against, when you ship doesn&#x27;t matter.  I&#x27;ve worked on multiple teams with test suites that give very high confidence what changes are good and are not; most tests were fast and could run before code was merged and block submission. The expensive integration tests ran against a staging environment, and when they started failing it was very quick to identify the range of CLs there and understand what to rollback&#x2F;fix.<p>For most of my time there those services only pushed to prod twice a week - sometimes less if the integration tests were failing on the day of one of the deploys.  Not every day, not every commit.  And yet we had all of those benefits that you claim are impossible.  No list of idle people waiting to approve changes, no &quot;huge&quot; deployments, infrastructure for automated tests and more. There are no meetings - those two weekly rollouts are entirely automated infrastructure, and unless an abnormal error rate is detected during the canary proceed entirely without human involvement.<p>The world didn&#x27;t fall down.  Customers didn&#x27;t ask us where things were. Oncall appreciated that there weren&#x27;t constant builds at risk of breaking and falling over - they only had to monitor rollouts twice a week and otherwise could focus on failing tests, logs, and alerts.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40644036" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40644036" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">flir</span><span>|</span><a href="#40641762">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40642699">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40642992">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40644036">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40644036">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree with everything you said.

A commit can be anything, from a major refactoring to fixing a typo. Any developer worth its title is well aware of stuff that needs to be done in a project in spite of not being a high priority. From renaming a function to refactoring a class, from adding a unit test to tweak how a test is setup, there is always, and I mean always, things that need to be done in a project.

They want to look busy so nobody gives them actual work to make them actually busy.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40643724" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40643724" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">liampulles</span><span>|</span><a href="#40643719">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40641869">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40643724">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40643724">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No, focus on pushing the right solution.

Tasks are not necessarily related to coding. It could be a task related to image editing. Initially, I was feeling very bad if I can&#x27;t finish a task within the time I&#x27;ve set for it.<p>Now I don&#x27;t feel bad if I can&#x27;t finish that task on time. I perceive it as a micro-iteration of the task. The trick is to iterate further, until the task is done.<p>While rushing to do a task within a specific timeframe, might be productive in the short-term, I don&#x27;t see it feasible if you push yourself all the time doing it. I imagine it might reflect on the quality of your work and lead to a self-induced burnout.<p>Shipping for the sake of it, in my opinion, might create some false perception of work being done. In my experience, employers tend to reward that behavior.<p>So maybe the question here would be: why are you shipping in first place? To show off, to boost dopamine through gamifying yourself, or to deliver a piece of work you&#x27;ll be proud of before going to bed.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40642222" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40642222" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">purple-leafy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40641993">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40642991">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40642222">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40642222">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Spell it with me team<p>B

Memory is cheap. CPU is cheap. Your time is not. And it takes investing your time to make this stuff more optimal and faster. And VS code just does a lot of nice things that make you more productive.

Running a heavily scriptable editor with a GUI was entirely viable on a 7.16MHz Amiga with 1MB RAM, and more responsive than many modern editors.<p>Integration with other tooling, like RCS, compilers, or linkers was a given for Amiga apps at that time.<p>(FrexxEd was also notable for exposing internal buffers as files in a special filesystem, so you could e.g. lint or compile or call your revision control - limited as they were - directly on the buffers without any custom integration)</div><br/></div></div><div id="39427312" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39427312" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zozbot234</span><span>|</span><a href="#39427115">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39427268">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39427404">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39427220">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39427312">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39427312">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">CSS grid exists now, so it should be easy enough to achieve the same &quot;repaint small areas of the window, don&#x27;t do global layout&quot; workflow in a web-based app.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39427220" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39427220" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Qwertious</span><span>|</span><a href="#39427115">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39427268">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39427439">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39427220">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39427220">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Now we do the same, but we look at the text editors of 1995 which used 4 MB of RAM as incredibly efficient and well made, paragons of craftsmanship.<p>That&#x27;s because the text editors don&#x27;t exist in a vacuum; the 4MB-RAM text editor would be slow on a 1995 computer but blazingly-fast on a 2024 computer.<p>VS Code is slow and annoying to use, and RAM is just a more measurable symptom of that.</div><br/><div id="39427258" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39427258" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thejosh</span><span>|</span><a href="#39427115">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39427220">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39427439">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39427258">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39427258">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t care about memory usage for editors as much I care about input latency and responsiveness.<p>Jetbrains (IDEA IntelliJ, Pycharm, etcetc) put a lot of effort into making their IDE low latency as it was getting to a point of being almost ridiculous.

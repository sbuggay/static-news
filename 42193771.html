The earliest influences on the viticulture of the Italian Peninsula can be traced to ancient Greeks and the Etruscans. The rise of the Roman Empire saw both technological advances in and burgeoning awareness of winemaking, which spread to all parts of the empire. Rome&#x27;s influence has had a profound effect on the histories of today&#x27;s major winemaking regions in France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain.<p>The Roman belief that wine was a daily necessity made the drink &quot;democratic&quot; and ubiquitous; in various qualities, it was available to slaves, peasants and aristocrats, men and women alike. To ensure the steady supply of wine to Roman soldiers and colonists, viticulture and wine production spread to every part of the empire. The economic opportunities presented by trading in wine drew merchants to do business with tribes native to Gaul and Germania, bringing Roman influences to these regions even before the arrival of the Roman military. Evidence of this trade and the far-reaching ancient wine economy is most often found through amphorae – ceramic jars used to store and transport wine and other commodities.<p>[…]<p>Among the lasting legacies of the ancient Roman empire were the viticultural foundations laid by the Romans in lands that would become world-renowned wine regions. Through trade, military campaigns and settlements, Romans brought with them a taste for wine and the impetus to plant vines. Trade was the first and farthest-reaching arm of their influence, and Roman wine merchants were eager to trade with enemy and ally alike—from the Carthaginians and peoples of southern Spain to the Celtic tribes in Gaul and Germanic tribes of the Rhine and Danube.<p>During the Gallic Wars, when Julius Caesar brought his troops to Cabyllona in 59 BC, he found two Roman wine merchants already established in business trading with the local tribes. In places like Bordeaux, Mainz, Trier and Colchester where Roman garrisons were established, vineyards were planted to supply local need and limit the cost of long-distance trading. Roman settlements were founded and populated by retired soldiers with knowledge of Roman viticulture from their families and life before the military; vineyards were planted in their new homelands. While it is possible that the Romans imported grapevines from Italy and Greece, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that they cultivated native vines that may be the ancestors of the grapes grown in those provinces today”</i></div><br/></div></div><div id="42198580" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42198580" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">inglor_cz</span><span>|</span><a href="#42195789">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42197622">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42202006">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42198841">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42198580">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42198580">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In a pre-industrial agricultural society, slavery or something similar (serfdom etc.) tends to be widespread, as human and animal muscles are the only reliable and ubiquitous source of energy.

Historically, for most of human civilization, chattel slavery was a linchpin of most societies. The Romans were unremarkable in this respect.<p>And if I may take a long digression to emphasize just how normal chattel slavery was for not only the ancient world, but for centuries after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it took Christianity to mount a challenge to this practice. It gave us a robust notion of the Imago Dei and human dignity, and a recognition of the evil of unjust servitude (which must be distinguished from just title servitude). Ancient Christians, having been born into a pagan world of entrenched and ubiquitous slavery, while believing that slavery was indeed evil, recognized that its abolition was impossible and impractical at the time. Of course, membership in the Church was open to everyone equally; social status had no significance. After Christianity&#x27;s legalization under Constantine, the Church worked to free slaves and eventually managed to eradicate the practice in Europe. A former slave even became pope (Callistus I).<p>Some will point to chattel slavery in the New World, but this confuses what the Church as an institution held with what individual Catholics or Protestants did. Eugenius IV, prompted by slavery in the Canary Islands, condemned slavery in the papal bull <i>Sicut Dudum</i> in 1435, threatening excommunication. In 1537, Paul III issued <i>Sublimus Dei</i> to condemn enslavement of the natives of the Americas. In 1591, Gregory XIV promulgated <i>Cum Sicuti</i> to counter the practice in the Philippines. Urban VIII promulgated <i>Commissum Nobis</i> in 1639 in support of Philip IV&#x27;s edict prohibiting the enslavement of American natives. Benedict XIV, in his 1741 document <i>Immensa Pastorum</i>, reminded that the penalty for enslaving the indigenous was excommunication.<p>Similar condemnations were issued regarding the Atlantic slave trade by Innocent XI,  Gregory XVI (<i>In Supremo</i>, 1839), and Leo XIII in two bulls condemning slavery in 1888 and 1890. The condemnations were often so harsh that their publication was often forbidden without royal approval.<p>And we credit the abolitionists of and from the Christian West for politically ending the practice in their various respective jurisdictions that fell under Western rule. Their appeals were grounded in the general heritage of the Christian tradition and its understanding of the human person, whatever theological or philosophical differences there might have been between them.<p>&gt;  What matters is what -you- chose to do. Be known for the fruit of your tree, and not as the product of the hill from which you sprout.<p>Wise words. History ought to be remembered, and unresolved historical trauma should be addressed and resolved lest it fester (reasonable justice and remembrance matter; without truth, there is no authentic reconciliation or unity), but to stew perpetually in stomach-churning grievance over what someone else&#x27;s ancestors did to your ancestors (often overlapping groups, btw) only succeeds in wasting the short time we have in this life and contributes nothing to it. It&#x27;s an excellent method of self-sabotage.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42197985" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42197985" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BurritoAlPastor</span><span>|</span><a href="#42195789">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42196519">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42201196">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42197985">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42197985">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Note that, at least in Thomas Malory’s telling, the arm holding Excalibur out of the lake is <i>not</i> the Lady Of The Lake, who is nearby <i>on</i> the lake.

This lends a certain mystique to the Nazis and cements the notion that they were somehow extra sharp. Aesthetic forbidden fruit. I don&#x27;t like that, not in the least because it&#x27;s not correct. The uniforms for all the Nazi arms of the state were designed by party insiders. Boss didn&#x27;t even start designing men&#x27;s tailored suits until after the war.<p>This is not to exculpate Hugo Boss, but to knock the shine of fancy suits off of the nazis. Hugo Boss had been selling ready made menswear since 1923, joined the nazi party in 1931, and won contracts to produce the uniforms much the way FEDS Apparel makes the USDA branded polo shirts [1]. In fact, he produced the uniforms using slave labor.

Users pay by the month, but server costs are per hour of use. As a business, this only works if users don&#x27;t use it much, like a gym. Or users face severe limits on how much time they can use. 
Most of the early &quot;cloud gaming&quot; companies are gone, because the business model didn&#x27;t work for them.<p>For a sense of what it really costs, see Shadow PC.

Sure, h265 requires less bandwidth but it also is a slower encoder.

I REALLY love that it seems like I can share with my friends, as a jellyfin, audiobookshelf, konga, navidrome, and calibreweb &#x2F; opds enthusiast, if I can add videogames to the mix that would be amazing. I already share my steam library through family sharing with some friends cause why not? Otherwise it&#x27;s going to waste!</div><br/><div id="40404444" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40404444" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">samspenc</span><span>|</span><a href="#40404304">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40404414">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40404444">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40404444">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;and agpl3 too!&quot; If you don&#x27;t mind, I&#x27;m curious what you mean by this :) most service hosting providers I&#x27;m aware of (and worked with in the past) run away from AGPL3 software due to the viral nature of the license.</div><br/><div id="40404463" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40404463" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">isatty</span><span>|</span><a href="#40404304">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40404444">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40405164">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40404463">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40404463">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Isn’t that a good thing?</div><br/></div></div><div id="40405164" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40405164" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">komali2</span><span>|</span><a href="#40404304">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40404444">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40404463">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40404414">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40405164">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40405164">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m a rabid FOSS evangelist and anticapitalist. If businesses hate it, I typically like it ;) but I also personally believe FOSS, even &quot;viral&quot; licenses (honestly I haven&#x27;t seen evidence of this in practice though I hear it a lot about GPL), can lead to successful capitalist efforts. For example I believe that FOSS code leads to greater innovations that various organizations can capitalize on and drive profit through. SaaS hosting comes to mind, my co-op self hosts almost all of our saas, however there&#x27;s one or two that are mission critical enough that we just fork over the cash to the experts to host.<p>In this case, there&#x27;s already closed source solutions, such as stadia and GFN. Stadia shut down and took everyone&#x27;s games with it (luckily offering refunds). Pure capitalist ventures are demonstrably unsustainable and don&#x27;t serve the needs of the greater populace. But FOSS doesn&#x27;t have that problem - if someone offers to host a FOSS GFN, you can pay to use their computers, that&#x27;s really awesome! If they shut down their business, someone else can take it up, or you can host your own! Also awesome. I think there&#x27;s valid business models there. I have a decently powerful gaming machine but I still pay for GFN for when I want to try a 4090 or when they have better throughput to my location.<p>Also recently Nvidia stopped supporting the API that self hosting option Moonlight uses, forcing the development of a pure FOSS protocol, thus leading to Sunshine (iirc), a similar self hostable game streaming server. Clearly the corporations don&#x27;t care if we like things, they&#x27;ll just shut them down (stadia, every other google product ever), so if these corpos come up with something people clearly like, it&#x27;s a very good idea to build a FOSS version so we can keep having the thing when the corporation determines the profits won&#x27;t reach several billion so it&#x27;s not worth supporting (also some other company can then offer the service and simply make millions instead! Everyone wins)<p>Sorry I&#x27;m on my phone so it&#x27;s a disorganized rant. I&#x27;m also a big user and hoster but I&#x27;m relatively ignorant so I might have gotten some terms wrong.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40404414" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40404414" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">langarus</span><span>|</span><a href="#40404304">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40404444">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40404329">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40404414">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40404414">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Really nice.

The latency from the Bluetooth controller is far worse. What is a little annoying is the I think compression artifacts?

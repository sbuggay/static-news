Simply adding a scan line &#x2F; CRT grid filter isn&#x27;t even how consumer-grade CRT TVs looked like: distortion, blurriness, color bleeding, static, cheap selector interference... it was fine when you looked at your TV from several feet, but even arcades preferred to use high-quality CRTs instead of exploiting its side effects because you would look at them up close, like we use monitors now.<p>Right now is a great time to appreciate the exquisiteness involved in pixel art, its perfect pixels and perfect colors, scaled to high resolution with sharpness. I agree some of the genius of working with CRT limitations is lost, but the overall majority of it became a pleasure to see.<p>Now, vector arcade games, those really are a sin to play on anything but a vector CRT :P</div><br/><div id="41136987" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41136987" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jeroenhd</span><span>|</span><a href="#41134063">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41135715">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41137074">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41136987">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41136987">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Simply adding a scan line &#x2F; CRT grid filter isn&#x27;t even how consumer-grade CRT TVs looked like: distortion, blurriness, color bleeding, static, cheap selector interference...<p>This is why I find many &quot;scanline filters&quot; so jarring. My CRT experiences may have come from the last decade of CRTs, but I&#x27;ve never actually seen the dark, black grid hovering above the PS2 graphics from my youth. Yet, when I enable CRT emulation in many emulators, it looks like someone put a plastic grate in front of my screen.<p>The scanlines were there, but they didn&#x27;t have the contrast a black overlay has on a modern flat screen.<p>I have seen some (GPU intensive) filters that do mimick CRTs more accurately, but to display them well, you need a 4K monitor or better, simply because the effects applied to the individual pixels involves multiple pixels of blend&#x2F;distortion, often in a non-linear fashion to mimick the bulging screen. ShaderGlass was the first tool that actually allowed me to see some old games as I remembered them (after a bit of tweaking).<p>I think most people agree that the clarity of modern displays are a huge benefit, but when playing older games, a lot of nuance is lost. When (much younger) developers start emulating older pixel art styles without having ever seen the blurry, distorted CRT graphics, you get this weird anachronistic super-crisp pixel art that&#x27;s supposed to be retro. Still looks good, but they&#x27;re graphically off even if they copy directly off of old sprite sheets.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41137074" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41137074" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">_the_inflator</span><span>|</span><a href="#41134063">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41134041">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41137074">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41137074">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is a reason why raster demos were so extremely popular on Commodore 64.<p>CRT&#x27;s resolution was so blurred and totally dependent on the user, not the programmer.

I don&#x27;t see any composite artifacts but don&#x27;t know if the image is RGB or S-Video.<p>&gt; When it comes to computer screens, there are always two resolutions involved: the one produced by the computer, such as 320x200, and the dot pitch, or &quot;dots per inch&quot;, of the screen proper.<p>The fun thing about CRTs is that there&#x27;s always more things affecting resolution, like spot size (PVMs&#x2F;BVMs and their narrow spots made interlacing more obvious) and amplifier bandwidth (if you run at a high enough hsync rate, you can get horizontal blur because the electron gun changes brightness slower than once per phosphor).<p>As I understand, 320x200&#x2F;240 on a VGA monitor is actually line-doubled because VGA cards and displays can&#x27;t take hsync rates below 30 kHz. This can be seen in your Duke Nukem 3D screenshot if you watch the source video, switch to 4K resolution, and zoom into the HUD or main screen.

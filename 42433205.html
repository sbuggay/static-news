The only way to take the premise of this claim seriously is to ignore data for the past 100 years.<p>When I was in the US military, we all complained about the Body Mass Index standards. They were based on the WWII era &quot;normal&quot;. Men were smaller. Less muscle mass. Shorter. If the average fit American young man tried to fit into a pilot&#x27;s cockpit from the 1950&#x27;s, it would feel quite cramped. Like it was built for much small people. It was.<p>We have certainly climbed the Kardashev scale since the 1950&#x27;s. To what degree is a matter of contention. But, all would agree that we have moved up the scale.<p>Muscle atrophy has not been correlated with the growth. The opposite seems true. The average American, both male and female, has more muscle mass than in 1924. A 2024 person spends significantly more time on average in a gym pushing their muscles to hypertrophy than in 1924.<p>In addition, it is likely that the romantic picture of the average laborer &quot;bodybuilding&quot; is fictive and ignores how muscle atrophy and hypertrophy works. Most laborers are NOT doing activity that leads to hypertrophy. They are staying well within cardiovascular zones of muscle activation. Hence, bodybuilders as we know them are largely a modern phenomenon. And they are certainly WAY more muscular.<p>Seems the model that underlies this claim is built on seemingly demonstrably false premises.</div><br/><div id="42435674" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42435674" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">loeg</span><span>|</span><a href="#42435325">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42436008">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42435674">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42435674">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The average American, both male and female, has more muscle mass than in 1924.<p>This is true, but sort of a sleight of hand -- obese people that don&#x27;t exercise have more muscle mass than non-obese people who don&#x27;t exercise, just to carry around all of the fat.

Based on archaeological evidence (bones and remains), historians and archaeozoologists estimate the following sizes:
 • Height: Approximately 100–120 cm (3.3–4 feet) at the shoulder.
 • Weight: Between 200–400 kg (440–880 lbs), depending on the breed, sex, and regional conditions.<p>For comparison:
 • Modern cattle like Holsteins (dairy cows) stand around 140–150 cm at the shoulder and weigh 700–900 kg.
 • Some smaller modern breeds, like Dexter cattle, resemble ancient cattle in stature, with a height of 90–120 cm and weight of 300–450 kg.<p>Factors Influencing Smaller Size in Ancient Cattle
 1. Nutritional Limitations: Grazing conditions were less controlled, and fodder quality was inconsistent.
 2. Genetics: Ancient cattle were not selectively bred for size like modern cattle.
 3. Purpose: Cattle were primarily used for labor (draught animals) and small-scale milk production, rather than for meat.<p>Ancient cattle were functional animals suited to the agricultural practices and available resources of their time, so their size reflected these limitations.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42436184" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42436184" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tartoran</span><span>|</span><a href="#42435325">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42436008">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42437562">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42436892">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42436184">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42436184">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gymnasium_(ancient_Greece)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gymnasium_(ancient_Greece)</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42436892" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42436892" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mhb</span><span>|</span><a href="#42435325">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42436008">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42436184">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42437663">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42436892">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42436892">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Wendy, the bully whippet, would like a word:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.timescolonist.com&#x2F;local-news&#x2F;wendy-the-whippet-famed-for-massive-muscles-has-died-4645620" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.timescolonist.com&#x2F;local-news&#x2F;wendy-the-whippet-f...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42437663" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42437663" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">antonygonsalves</span><span>|</span><a href="#42435325">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42436008">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42435553">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42437663">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42437663">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is another, and in my opinion, a much greater flaw with the base argument - most predictions about the future are very, very wrong.

But that&#x27;s also an argument for ridding us of these pesky bodies that we have to be carried around in.</div><br/><div id="42438430" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42438430" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Gud</span><span>|</span><a href="#42434177">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42434990">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42435286">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42438430">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42438430">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not everyone considers their bodies to be “pesky”.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42435286" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42435286" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">swayvil</span><span>|</span><a href="#42434177">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42434990">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42438430">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42435520">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42435286">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42435286">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If paying the rent is our aim, who knows what unnecessary limbs may be disposed of.

What if life as we know it is, for instance, little more than a day&#x27;s lesson in another reality? Or a day of a gaming? Perhaps a test of character for some sort of role? There&#x27;s no reason to assume time, and life expectancy as we know it, are universal truths. Even within our own reality the rate of the passage of time is variable.<p>The only problem I have with the simulation hypothesis is it being turtles all the way down.

The body is responding to actual physical forces and the response is tightly coupled to how, when and where those forces are applied. Bone density and structure for instance is not just a matter of increasing production of bone cell production. It instead responds to the forces of gravity and other forces on the body as it moves through space. These forces do trigger electrochemical signals in the body, but it wouldn’t be trivial to recreate these signals in such a way that the body is fooled into responding just as it would if the signals were triggered by gravity and other physical forces.<p>It seems like it could be a more difficult but similar problem to the one experienced by lab-grown meat producers. The meat texture still isn’t right. And these meat “muscles” only require proper taste and texture. They wouldn’t have to actually support a living organism.<p>Edit: On reread I realize your comment allowed for assisting rather than totally replacing the required physical aspects. I agree with that. Use of  chemicals could make it easier to trigger the necessary reactions, lowering thresholds, increasing outputs, etc. This could be applied broadly and the physical forces of everyday life might do the rest.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42437658" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42437658" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tw04</span><span>|</span><a href="#42437098">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42434011">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42437658">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42437658">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">All you need to do is look at the NFL to know how silly this claim is.

I think the majority of what you see is that due to how rapidly technology and other fields have bloomed via human involment, and due to how we have become an interconnected society due to the industrial revolution.<p>I think that the major way humans cope&#x2F;tackle this is via specialisation. While not for everyone, most people seem to find a job in a field, and the work in that field helps us support a more complicated society than we can fathom. Most people can&#x27;t memorize all the stuff from multiple domains, or they would burn out.  Most people don&#x27;t understand how truly complex a semiconductor is, or how electricity and power is generated, or how to design a car. These are just basic examples but I&#x27;d argue a really good example of how humans have chosen a specific domain or thing and over time developed better understandings of the field and topic. The average person could do any job I&#x27;d argue.<p>We are not as physical as we used to be, we have &quot;engineered&quot; ourselves replacements. The tractor, the car; both replaced horses but at the cost of needing someone who understood the principal of the new technology.<p>Be it robot workers replacing amazon warehouse employees, or the tractor that improved the farmers ability to harvest or plant crops; both required smart people to not only develop them but to maintain them.<p>I&#x27;d argue while we really are less physically active, due to technology and general advancements we have made over the years; this comes at the cost of mental strain.

Prior to the widespread acceptable of the interchangeability of organs, it was not uncommon to think that your self and body are unified and linked in a way that implied organ transplation was problematic or undesirable.<p>And on that note - is it just me, or are biological visions of humanity&#x27;s future fairly scarce in sci-fi and in futurism (another name for sci-fi)? My guess is because such topics seem dominated by software engineers, physicists, etc. that are less interested in biology.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

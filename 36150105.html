You haven&#x27;t done it before. Not exactly the same thing. You <i>think</i> you&#x27;ve done it before, but you haven&#x27;t. If you had actually done it before, you would probably be faster this time, not slower.<p>2. Other things besides you have changed, or will change. Coworkers, company, customers, tools, economic realities, the weather. Either it&#x27;s already changed, or it&#x27;s going to change. That has an impact on deliverability, even for the exact same work. (but it&#x27;s not the same work, because you haven&#x27;t done it before)<p>3. You have changed, or will change. You&#x27;re literally a different person since the last time you did it, and you haven&#x27;t taken that into account, and now things take a different amount of work&#x2F;time.<p>4. You&#x27;re fallible. You just remembered wrong, guessed wrong, fucked up, forgot, etc.<p>5. Estimating is a skill. After a long career, you can look back at what you did and what happened, and look at what you&#x27;ve got now, and make an estimate. The more experienced you get, the better your estimates get. That doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re <i>accurate</i>, because you can&#x27;t control #2-4. But they&#x27;ll certainly be closer.<p>My favorite is when I actually have a very strong feeling about an estimate, and I tell my boss, and he doesn&#x27;t want to believe it, so he arbitrarily tries to find a way to get a better estimate. I end up right, he conveniently forgets my original estimate.</div><br/><div id="36162452" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36162452" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DharmaPolice</span><span>|</span><a href="#36160200">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36159269">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36162452">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36162452">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;1.

That is, once you throw away -- as you said -- &quot;happy path&quot; optimism and get down to business. An extra padding of cynicism will make sure you never miss a deadline; and if it turns out you were too cynical, you can always under-promise and over-deliver and wow everyone.<p>But padding is necessary, and I wish it didn&#x27;t have this air of dishonesty associated with it. Realistically, shit happens. Stakeholders can huff and haw because it gets in the way of their aggressive plans, but it&#x27;s not dishonest to say it&#x27;s going to take another 3 months, because you&#x27;re asking me to dig you a hole with a plastic sand-castle shovel. Yes, I can actually pound Red Bulls and wear myself down to the bone digging that hole as fast as humanly possible -- but I&#x27;m not going to.<p>If that&#x27;s not good enough, the next best is to ship in phases (what little &quot;A&quot; agile tries to do, but fails in practice): a group of features will be guaranteed to ship at some date. At that point, we&#x27;ll reassess and estimate the next batch -- until the project is done. We can even do soft estimates on all the batches, but using ranges (e.g. 3-6 months, rather than something concrete -- because they&#x27;ll become de-facto deadlines), to give a rough &quot;total project estimate.&quot; I like the month-by-month &quot;sprint&quot; model more than the 2 week model. Analysis and planning isn&#x27;t free. It costs time, effort, and mental resources. Doing it every 2 weeks is absolutely ridiculous.

I think impressive how informative it manages to be in such a short space, and how the visual work helps tell the story. I’m definitely going to use this (with full credits) from time to time when the discussions on how a team needs to work with estimations.<p>What I wish it also included was the not-so-academic parts of estimations. Like how we’re often operating in systems where it is much better to over than underestimate, because it’s much better to never let a client know that you didn’t actually spend that X time compared to letting them know that you need X more. Or how estimating things you’ve done before can also be hard because people don’t actually deliver Y “story points” every week, because sometimes their children get sick, they sleep poorly, whatever. Or how even the most senior developer can spent 3 hours on something silly.<p>But I guess a lot of that plays into a different sort of discussion. One where we talk about whether a lot of the “control” parts of the work process are actually necessary or just wasted resources. And I don’t want to sound like I think it’s wasted resources, because it can be both and often it’s a combination. Personally I tend to avoid working in areas with too much “control”, if you estimate by anything less than a day, then I’d like not want to work for you. Not because I can’t do it, but because I hate spending time on things that aren’t “the work”. I’m not sure how to include that sort of metric into the discussion, but I think it may be relevant. Because I doubt I’m the only one, and while completely anecdotal, I wouldn’t want to invest in any of the places I wouldn’t want to work because they tend not to do so hot in the long term. So maybe looking at overhead is important?

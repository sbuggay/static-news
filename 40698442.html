My take is that Will Wright had a very exciting vision but visions are just that: not real. They are inherently nebulous and everyone on the team (and many many people beyond it) had their own idea on what Spore would be or turn into. We converged on something and negotiated with one another and many constraints, social and technical, and arrived at something. It didn&#x27;t help that part of the game&#x27;s marketing appeal was a bit Rorschach-y in the first place and capitalized on the exciting but vague promise of Will Wright (Sim-) + Universe (-Everything).</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40699681" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40699681" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jokoon</span><span>|</span><a href="#40699204">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40699301">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40702237">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40699681">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40699681">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Don&#x27;t you think the granularity of factorio is what brought its success?

One of the surprising things I learned while researching this book was that Maxis was actually trying to do that at one point, and in fact more. They had an initiative called SimWorld that would allow all their sim games to link together and even be open to third party development. This very ambitious OS-like architecture meant that The Sims really was seen as zooming into SimCity, and in fact early prototypes of what became The Sims let you do just that. And SimCopter did let you open SC2k save files and fly through them. While SimWorld didn’t take off it seems that without it we wouldn’t have The Sims, which introduced an innovative object-oriented architecture that underwrote its cutting-edge AI, UI, and business model (modular expansion packs).<p>Some fun primary sources:<p>[1] Will Wright interview for SimCity 2000 CDROM:

Or maybe not; I leave the decision to you.<p>Sim City isn’t a simulation. It’s a game. The reason it was commercially successful is because it was fun.<p>This is explicitly a different goal from creating a simulator. A simulator <i>can</i> be fun to certain groups of people, but it’s not <i>designed</i> to be fun to large groups of people. Games are.<p>So here’s the rub. When people draw a correlation between sim city and reality, are they saying that the way to make a simulation of reality is to make a fun game? Because sim city was designed to be a fun game first and foremost, not a simulator.<p>Can’t it be both? Well, sure. Lots of things are. But when you’re saying that you’re putting the world in a machine, it becomes a different discussion. Is the best way to put the world in a machine to make it fun? That doesn’t seem too plausible, even if the result is fun for some people. So both the title and the descriptions of world building (as in, the world we live in, not a fantasy world) seem off the mark.<p>I genuinely don’t know if it’s worth pointing this out. But then I read the description, and again, they’re saying very clearly that this book is comparing simulation of reality to a commercially successful game that was designed with a different goal in mind. Is this just coincidence?</div><br/><div id="40699432" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40699432" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">larsiusprime</span><span>|</span><a href="#40699072">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40701242">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40699432">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40699432">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Simulations and models, regardless of whether they&#x27;re designed for fun or for realism, can still teach you plenty of things about the real world; sometimes not from the simulation itself but explicitly by its omissions. The fact that SimCity famously removed all the parking lots tells you something interesting right away. The fact that City Skylines bites the bullet of traffic and renders it in fairly sophisticated detail -- to the degree that the game often devolves into &quot;Traffic Management Simulator&quot; instead of &quot;City Builder Simulator&quot; -- is another such interesting lesson.<p>But in terms of &quot;how directly transferable are lessons learned <i>directly</i> from the model&quot; is always going to depend on the model&#x27;s assumptions.<p>Fun fact -- have you ever heard of the &quot;Monocentric city model?&quot; It comes up in a lot of econ papers, and a lot of urban economics, and therefore a lot of real world policy is based on it.<p>The &quot;Monocentric city model&quot; is about as simplistic as it gets -- it models the city as a <i>LINE.</i> IE, you have a bunch of agents, and they live some distance from the city, and they have different travel&#x2F;commuting costs proportional to their distance from the city center; let&#x27;s run that and see what kinds of consequences fall out of it.<p>Turns out it&#x27;s actually a pretty good model and generates outcomes that are pretty analogous to what we see in the real world! Is it perfectly representative of the real world? Of course, not, it models the city as a friggin line. But if we&#x27;re talking about sheer complexity alone, SimCity is already orders of magnitude more complex than this famous economic model. But that in and of itself doesn&#x27;t mean that a successful SimCity city would make for a successful real world city, because it&#x27;s not just about sheer complexity, it&#x27;s about the appropriateness of the assumptions.</div><br/><div id="40701567" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40701567" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chaimgingold</span><span>|</span><a href="#40699072">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40699432">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40701770">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40701567">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40701567">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is fascinating!

Interest is somewhat split between modeling aesthetics and modeling transit. I think the greatest interest is in modeling societies and economies, but few games seem to make that work except on small scales. There&#x27;s an old game called City Life that did an commendable job modelling social classes. The early Tropico games had a very engaging economic system.

SimCity and all its sequels and imitators present a very simplified set of tools and mechanics.

The intersection of those things and the tradeoffs that are required in all simulations (which all reside on a spectrum of toy to faithful representation) are interesting. IMO it&#x27;s (ironically) too simplistic to say that SimCity is a mere game and thus unworthy of thinking more deeply about, and I suggest that you&#x27;re taking that &quot;world in a machine&quot; marketing phrase a bit too literally.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;la-xpm-1992-10-02-vw-391-story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;la-xpm-1992-10-02-vw-391-st...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40699193" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40699193" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">YesBox</span><span>|</span><a href="#40699072">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40698554">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40699193">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40699193">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This book is on my reading list!

Reading it, I found myself getting caught up in their grand vision.<p>The first part of _Building SimCity_ is a deep dive into the game&#x27;s historical antecedents: from tabletop city simulations and Vannevar Bush&#x27;s analogue computers, to systems thinking and cellular automata. This part explores many ideas that I have briefly encountered before and wondered &quot;why hasn&#x27;t anyone taken these wonderful ideas and produced something great with them?&quot; The book answers: &quot;Will Wright did, you just didn&#x27;t notice.&quot; More specifically, _Building SimCity_ argues that SimCity the game is a synthesis and application of many great ideas, which are mostly hidden to the player. This book gives us a look behind the curtain.<p>The second part of the book spends chapters on the design of SimCity, the history of Maxis, and the experience of playing SimCity. The implementation chapter has no code listings — as a programmer, reading it feels like reading an exceptionally clear design document, explaining the real-time (UI) clock and the simulation clock, the 16-bit representation of map tile state, the main simulation loop, and the map scan algorithm for information propogation across tiles. This chapter is accompanied by exceptionally well-designed diagrams, which I find quite valuable on their own.<p>To set expectations: this is an academic work. It contains war stories and technical details, but it also goes to great lengths to situate SimCity in its historical context, connecting it to previous ideas, and providing full citations. But though the prose has an academic bent, I find it very engaging and readable.<p>The only negative thing I can say about this book is that the printed edition has a chemical smell, which I assume is due to the full-color printing and will presumeably fade with time.<p>[Disclaimer: I haven&#x27;t finished this book yet, I&#x27;ve read the first few chapters about the history of simulation and also skipped ahead to the chapter about SimCity&#x27;s implementation details.

The focus is SimCity, but once the book gets into Maxis I get into SimEarth, SimAnt, SimLife, and The Sims. They aren&#x27;t treated in as much detail, but they are here because they are crucial for understanding the overall arc of Maxis, SimCity&#x27;s consequences, and Will Wright&#x27;s career.<p>You can&#x27;t understand Maxis without understanding the relationship they had with the world beyond videogames. Consider SimEarth. Stewart Brand (should need no intro; Kevin Kelly introduced them—he and Wright bonded over their love of social insects) introduced Wright to James Lovelock (co-inventor of Gaia hypothesis), who happily collaborated, and Maxis donated money to Lovelock&#x27;s nonprofit. And Brand&#x27;s GBN consultancy was interested in using SimEarth for their work. There&#x27;s more context to all this I get into, but that&#x27;s the super short version.<p>I&#x27;m still stunned by how much Brand thinks I got all this right (and how much he loves the book): &quot;Of course I checked the few moments where I intersected with the events in the story.

It&#x27;s what Will Wright calls the &quot;Simulator Effect&quot;:<p>Will Wright defined the “Simulator Effect” as how players imagine the simulation is vastly more detailed, deep, rich, and complex than it actually is: a magical misunderstanding that you shouldn’t talk them out of. He designs games to run on two computers at once: the electronic one on the player’s desk, running his shallow tame simulation, and the biological one in the player’s head, running their deep wild imagination.<p>&quot;Reverse Over-Engineering&quot; is a desirable outcome of the Simulator Effect: what game players (and game developers trying to clone the game) do when they use their imagination to extrapolate how a game works, and totally overestimate how much work and modeling the simulator is actually doing, because they filled in the gaps with their imagination and preconceptions and assumptions, instead of realizing how many simplifications and shortcuts and illusions it actually used.<p>The trick of optimizing games is to off-load as much as the simulation from the computer into the user&#x27;s brain, which is MUCH more powerful and creative. Implication is more efficient (and richer) than simulation.<p>Some muckety-muck architecture magazine was interviewing Will Wright about SimCity, and they asked him a question something like “which ontological urban paradigm most influenced your design of the simulator, the Exo-Hamiltonian Pattern Language Movement, or the Intra-Urban Deconstructionist Sub-Culture Hypothesis?” He replied, “I just kind of optimized for game play.”<p>During development, when we first added Astrological signs to the characters, there was a discussion about whether we should invent our own original &quot;Sim Zodiac&quot; signs, or use the traditional ones, which have a lot of baggage and history (which some of the designers thought might be a problem).
Will Wright argued that we actually wanted to leverage the baggage and history of the traditional Astrological signs of the Zodiac, so we should just use those and not invent our own.<p>The way it works is that Will came up with twelve archetypal vectors of personality traits corresponding to each of the twelve Astrological signs, so when you set their personality traits, it looks up the sign with the nearest euclidian distance to the character&#x27;s personality, and displays that as their sign. But there was absolutely no actual effect on their behavior.<p>That decision paid off almost instantly and measurably in testing, after we implemented the user interface for showing the Astrological sign in the character creation screen, without writing any code to make their sign affect their behavior: The testers immediately started reporting bugs that their character&#x27;s sign had too much of an effect on their personality, and claimed that the non-existent effect of astrological signs on behavior needed to be tuned down. But that effect was totally coming from their imagination!
They should call them Astrillogical Signs!<p>The create-a-sim user interface hid the corresponding astrological sign for the initial all-zero personality you first see before you&#x27;ve spent any points, because that would be insulting to 1&#x2F;12th of the players (implying [your sign] has zero personality)!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ffzt12tEGpY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ffzt12tEGpY</a><p><pre><code>    From: &quot;Gavin Clayton&quot; &lt;gavinc@eidosnet.co.uk&gt;

    Subject: No other game has done this...

    &gt; Hi... no need to reply to this cos it&#x27;s just a whimsical thought :-)
    &gt; 
    &gt; When I first got the game I tried to make my own family, trying to get 
    &gt; their personalities accurate too. When making myself, my dad and my 
    &gt; sister, I attributed points to all the personality categories, and I 
    &gt; found I had points left over. But when I made my mum I ran out of 
    &gt; available points and was wishing for more -- I wanted to give her more 
    &gt; points than are available. It made me realise for the first time in 
    &gt; years how much I love my mum :-)
    &gt; 
    &gt; Now what other game has ever done *that*? :-)

The first two chapters of <i>Building SimCity</i> are dedicated to non-computer simulations for this reason. Vannevar Bush and his analog instruments, like the differential analyzer, are the subject of chapter 2. Bush (and others) argued that good tangible models were excellent complements to, and sometimes superior to, abstract symbolic representations. For this reason he and his colleagues grieved the transition to digital computing.<p>For example, he writes in <i>Pieces of the Action</i> (p. 262) of &quot;an example of how easy it is to teach fundamental calculus,&quot; about a mechanic with a high school education who learned calculus by working on the differential analyzer. &quot;It was very interesting to discuss this subject with him because he had learned the calculus in mechanical terms ‐ a strange approach, and yet he understood it. That is, he did not understand it in any formal sense, but he understood the fundamentals; he had it under his skin.&quot;<p>I think this is fascinating stuff, and chapter 2 goes deep into the subject.

Some designers push clichéd narratives, stereotypical characters, and institutionalized prejudices that normalize and encourage homophobia, sexism, racism, bigotry, and violence. Others like Will Wright conscientiously use it for good.<p>Ian Bogost defined the “Procedural Rhetoric” game design philosophy as an unholy blend of Will Wright and Aristotle, that explains how people learn through rules and processes, analyzes the art of persuasion, and focuses on conveying ideology by crafting laws and rules within games.<p>“I developed my own design philosophy that I called procedural rhetoric, an unholy blend of Will Wright and Aristotle.” -Ian Bogost, Video Games Are Better Without Characters<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Procedural_rhetoric" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Procedural_rhetoric</a><p>Ian Bogost, Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames.<p>Procedural rhetoric or simulation rhetoric[1] is a rhetorical concept that explains how people learn through the authorship of rules and processes. The theory argues that games can make strong claims about how the world works—not simply through words or visuals but through the processes they embody and models they construct. The term was first coined by Ian Bogost in his 2007 book Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames.[2]<p>Procedural rhetoric analyzes the art of persuasion by rule based representations and interactions rather than spoken or written word. Procedural rhetoric focuses on how game makers craft laws and rules within a game to convey a particular ideology.<p>[1] Frasca, Gonzalo (2003). “Simulation versus Narrative: Introduction to Ludology.” In The Video Game Theory Reader.

Its procedural rhetoric promotes inclusivity, diversity, personalization, and tolerance, and supports self-expression, creativity, storytelling, and sharing. Players imprint their own identities, families, homes, communities, and stories into the game, and share their own personal emergent narratives using online community tools like The Sims Family Album and The Sims Exchange.<p>mistermann: The intuition of a conspiracy theorist is not useful nor interesting nor falsifiable, by definition.

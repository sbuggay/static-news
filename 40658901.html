Evidence also suggested Newmaster embellished or simply invented findings or accomplishments, as well as claimed credit for work by others.</i><p>What I find puzzling about this kind of stories is that the pattern of behavior is usually obvious to all who know the person. Yet, it&#x27;ll take years before they&#x27;re found out. We all know people like Newmaster. They may not be scientists, but we recognize the more than usual tendency to exaggerate their accomplishments, the padding of the truth, the selective amnesia about giving credits where it&#x27;s due. Even if you&#x27;re just getting to know them, hang around just for a bit and you&#x27;ll see it, even about meaningless stuff. It&#x27;s what they do.

There were several factors that protected the person:<p>1. They were charismatic, charming, and likable. Fun to be around. But they also had an angry&#x2F;mean side that started to come out when things weren&#x27;t going their way. People around them were trained to do things that brought out the fun side and avoid things that brought out the mean side.<p>2. They built their circle out of people who were impressionable and had a lot to gain by being part of the circle: Early career people, people desperate to climb the ladder, and people who wanted a lot of praise. There was an implicit understanding that as long as you didn&#x27;t rock the boat, you just had to put up with everything for a couple years before pivoting to your dream position. If you exposed the person, your own resume might look questionable, so you had to go along with it.<p>3. Anyone who actually questioned them was marked for destruction. They would do everything in their power to discredit you, undermine your work, interfere with things you were doing, argue against promotions, and otherwise bring your career to a halt. It was all done out in the open, as a warning shot to anyone else who questioned it. People notice.<p>For a famous example, look into the Lance Armstrong story. He didn&#x27;t just cheat, he tried to destroy the lives of anyone who might get in his way. He&#x27;s a charismatic celebrity, so to this day he continues to whitewash his history by being nice and likable. Even after everything that has been revealed and admitted, people will <i>still</i> jump to his defense by substituting a lesser narrative and defending that. The common defense is &quot;Yeah, well, everyone in cycling does doping!&quot; even though doping is one of the least concerning things Lance Armstrong did.<p>Another upsetting factor is that people develop parasocial relationships with these grifters and will go to great lengths to dismiss or downplay their problems. Look at the recent issues with Andrew Huberman for a good example. Not only has his grasp of science been called into question on many topics, but his personal life has been exposed as being quite different than the ultra-righteous fatherly figure that he plays on his podcast. Yet despite this, people who love his podcast will rush to his defense and try to downplay the problems. Like the above story, people try to downplay the revelations about his personal life as if he made a mistake and &quot;cheated on his girlfriend&quot;, when the actual allegations are more far-reaching and establish a chronic pattern of dishonesty.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40663477" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40663477" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">A_D_E_P_T</span><span>|</span><a href="#40660140">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40667033">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40663477">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40663477">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The notion that DNA barcoding could have been used to identify supplement ingredients at scale was always very unlikely.<p>To make 1kg of a common type of gingko extract, you take 20kg of dry plant matter, grind it all to a very fine powder, extract it in a boiling solvent (often hexane or methanol), filter it under pressure, boil off as much of the solvent as you can, and then you spray-dry or freeze-dry it.<p>This process would leave essentially <i>no intact DNA.</i><p>I think that the &quot;DNA barcoding&quot; notion was formulated by somebody who didn&#x27;t understand how extracts are made, and the media just ran with it.<p>What&#x27;s funny is that rice flour is used as a common filler ingredient in supplements.

Glenn Begley, a biotech consultant working at Amgen, and Lee Ellis, a medical researcher at the University of Texas, found that only 11% of 53 pre-clinical cancer studies had replications that could confirm conclusions from the original studies.[79] In late 2021, The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology examined 53 top papers about cancer published between 2010 and 2012 and showed that among studies that provided sufficient information to be redone, the effect sizes were 85% smaller on average than the original findings.<p>---<p>One of the most interesting things in modern times is that China now has a higher life expectancy than the US, yet working conditions can be difficult, Traditional Chinese Medicine is still widely practiced, there is extremely widespread poverty, and access to modern healthcare is relatively limited. I&#x27;m certainly not appealing to that traditional medicine, homeopathy or anything of the like. Rather I&#x27;m appealing to some sort of nihilism - that I think we know far less than we think we do.<p>SSRIs would be the best example of this - as the actual experimental evidence for their efficacy leaves them comparable to placebos, yet people treat them as the bleeding edge of treatment for the plethora of disorders they&#x27;re proscribed for, to say nothing of their tremendous side effects. When we look back in time at all the stupid things people did, we often forget that those things were also seen as the bleeding edge of expert treatment at the time. No less than JFK&#x27;s sister [2] was lobotomized as was the latest treatment for psychological issues at the time, with the result one could expect. And that was scarcely ~80 years ago.

So, unless you are at an academic institution, you can&#x27;t get access to any raw data that contains personal information. Raw data will be often poorly annotated and you will need to spend weeks to figure things out, and sometimes significant computing resources to preprocess it.

The amount of time and energy I&#x27;d need pre-LLM&#x27;s to do this makes this a million miles away from &quot;a waste of time&quot;.<p>And even if LLM&#x27;s get no better, we&#x27;re good at finding the parts that work well and using that as leverage. I&#x27;m using it to build and check datasets, because it&#x27;s really good at extraction. I can throw a human in the loop, but in a startup setting this is 80&#x2F;20 and that&#x27;s enough. When I need enterprise level code, I brainstorm 10 approaches with it and then take the reins.

Of course, I can guess in advance which design will turn out well.  I <i>have to</i> guess, or else I wouldn&#x27;t know which design to try implementing first.

In the meantime, though, people often talk about using AI like a &#x27;junior engineer&#x27;, where you think up a design yourself and then delegate the grunt work to the AI.

The only type of developer an LLM’s output comes close to is a fresh junior usually straight out of university in their first real development job, with little
practical experience in a professional code-shipping landscape. And the majority of those juniors improve drastically within a few weeks or months, with handholding only at the very start and then less and less guidance. This is because I teach them to reason about their choices and approaches, to question assumptions, and thus they learn quickly that programming rarely has one solution to a problem, and that the context matters so much in determining the way forward.<p>A human junior developer can learn from this tutoring and rarely regress over time. But the LLM’s all by design cannot and do not rewire their understanding of the problem space over time, nor do they remember examples and lessons from previous iterations to build upon. I have to handhold them forever, and they never learn.<p>Even when they use significant parts of the existing codebase as their context window they’re still blind to the whole reality and history of the code.<p>Now just to be clear, I do use LLM’s at my job. Just not to code. I use them to parse documents and assist users with otherwise repetitive manual tasks. I use their strength as language models to convert visual tokens parsed by an OCR to grasp the sentence structure and convert that into text segments which can be used more readily by users.

This is probably more true at the SMB level for now than actual enterprise, both for technical and internal politics reasons, but I expect it to spread.<p>As a direct example from myself, I now acquire and run small e-commerce brands. When I decided to move my inventory management from Google Sheets into an actual application, I looked at vendors but ultimately just decided to build my own. My coding skills are pretty minimal, but sufficient that I was able to produce what I needed with the help of LLMs. It has the advantages of being cheaper than buying and also purpose-built to my needs.<p>So yeah, basically the tl;dr is that for internal tools, I believe that LLMs giving non-developers sufficient coding skills will shift the build vs. buy calculus squarely in the direction of build, with the logical follow-on effects to companies trying to sell internal tools software.</div><br/><div id="42435027" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42435027" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">achrono</span><span>|</span><a href="#42434184">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42434625">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42435737">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42435027">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42435027">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Long-time enterprise SaaS PM here, and sorry, this does not make any sense.

The best results I&#x27;ve managed to realize on our codebase have not been with ChatGPT or IDEs like Cursor, but a series of processes that iterate over our full codebase multiple times to extract various levels of resuable insights, like general development patterns, error handling patterns, RBAC-related patterns, extracting example tasks for common types of tasks based on git commit histories (i.e. adding a new API endpoint related to XYZ), common bugs or failure patterns (again by looking through git commit histories), which create a sort of library of higher-level context and reusable concepts. Feeding this into o1, and having a pre-defined &quot;call graph&quot; of prompts to validate the output, fix identified issues, consider past errors in similar types of commits and past executions, etc has produced some very good results for us so far.

When the goal can be adequately specified[1] the task of hooking up the pieces to achieve that goal is fairly mechanical. Just like the business of tracking trades in markets and extracting directional flow and then anticipating the flow by enough to make a profit is something trading algorithms can do.<p>What trading software has a hard time doing is coming up with new securities. What LLMs absolutely cannot do (yet?) is come up with novel mechanisms. To illustrate that, consider the idea that an LLM has been trained on every kind of car there is. If you ask it to design a plane it will fail. Train it on all cars and plans and ask it to design a boat, same problem. Train it on cars, planes, and boats and ask it to design a rocket, same problem.<p>The sad truth is that a lot of programming is &#x27;done&#x27; , which is to say we have created lots of compilers, lots of editors, lots of tools, lots of word processors, lots of operating systems. Training an LLM on those things can put all of the mechanisms used in all of them into the model, and spitting out a variant is entirely within the capabilities of the LLM.<p>Thus the role of humans will continue to be to do the things that have not been done yet. No LLM can design a quantum computer, nor can it design a compiler that runs on a quantum computer. Those things haven&#x27;t been &quot;done&quot; and they are not in the model. The other role of humans will continue to be &#x27;taste.&#x27;<p>Taste, as defined as an aesthetic, something that you know when you see it. It is why for many, AI &quot;art&quot; stands out as having been created by AI, it has a synthetic aesthetic. And as one gets older it often becomes apparent that the <i>tools</i> are not what determines the quality of the output, it is the <i>operator.</i><p>I watched Dan Silva do some <i>amazing</i> doodles with Deluxe Paint on the Amiga and I thought, &quot;That&#x27;s what I want to do!&quot; and ran out and bought a copy and started doodling. My doodles looked like crap :-). The understanding that I would have to use the tool, find its strengths and weaknesses, and then express through it was clearly a lot more time consuming than &quot;get the tool and go.&quot;<p>LLMs let people generate marginal code quickly. For so many jobs that is good enough. People who can generate really good code taking in constraints that the LLM can&#x27;t model, is something that will remain the domain of humans until GAI is achieved[2]. So careers in things like real-time and embedded systems will probably still have a lot of humans involved, and systems where every single compute cycle needs to be extracted out of the engine is a priority, that will likely be dominated by humans too.<p>[1] Very early on there were papers on &#x27;genetic&#x27; programming. Its a good thing to read them because they arrive at a singularly important point, &quot;How do you define &#x27;Which is better&#x27;?&quot; For a solid, qualitative and testable metric for &#x27;goodness&#x27; genetic algorithms out perform nearly everything. When the ability to specify &#x27;goodness&#x27; is not there, genetic algorithms cannot out perform humans. What is more they cannot escape &#x27;quality moats&#x27; where the solutions on the far side the moat are better than the solutions being explored but they cannot algorithmically get far enough into the &#x27;bad&#x27; solutions to start climbing up the hill on the other side to the &#x27;better&#x27; solutions.<p>[2] GAI being &quot;Generalized Artificial Intelligence&quot; which will have to have some way of modelling and integrating conceptual systems. Lots of things get better then (like self driving finally works), maybe even <i>novel</i> things. Until we get that though, LLMs won&#x27;t play here.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42437361" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42437361" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">irunmyownemail</span><span>|</span><a href="#42436868">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42437350">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42437969">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42437361">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42437361">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;See if you can match the above confidence from pre-automation traders with the comments displayed in this thread.

It may not just be LLM&#x27;s. To another comment you are betting against the whole capitalist systems, human ingenuity and billions&#x2F;trillions? of dollars targeted at making SWE&#x27;s redundant.<p>3) I think it can disrupt only knowledge jobs, and be some large time before it disrupts physical jobs. For SWE&#x27;s this is the worst outcome - it means you are on your own w.r.t adjusting for the changes coming.  Its only &quot;world changing&quot; as you put it to economic systems if it disrupts everyone at once. I don&#x27;t think it will happen that way.<p>More to the point software engineers will automate themselves out before other jobs for only one reason - they understand AI better than other jobs (even if objectively it is harder to automate) and they tend not to protect the knowledge required to do so. They have the domain knowledge to know what to automate&#x2F;make redundant.<p>The people that have the power to resist&#x2F;slow down disruption (i.e. hide knowledge) will gain more pricing power, and therefore be able to earn more capital taking advantage of the efficiency gains made by jobs being redundant from AI. The last to be disrupted has the most opportunity to gain ownership of assets and capital from their economic profits preserved. The inefficient will win out of this - capital rewards scarcity&#x2F;people that can remain in demand despite being inefficient relatively. Competition is for losers - its IMV the biggest flaw of the system. As a result people will see what has happened to SWE&#x27;s and make sure their industry &quot;has time&quot; to adapt particularly since many knowledge professions are really &quot;industry unions&#x2F;licensed clubs&quot; who have the advantage of keeping their domain knowledge harder to access.<p>To explain it further even if software is more complicated; there is just so much more capital it seems trying to disrupt it than other industries. Given IMV software demand is relatively inelastic to price due to scaling profits, making it cheaper to produce won&#x27;t really benefit society all that much w.r.t more output (i.e. what was good economically to build would of been built anyway in an inelastic demand&#x2F;scaling commodity). Generally more supply&#x2F;less cost of a good has more absolute societal benefits when there is unmet and&#x2F;or elastic demand. Instead costs of SWE&#x27;s will go down and the benefit will be distributed to the jobs&#x2F;people remaining (managers, CEO&#x27;s, etc) - the people that dev&#x27;s think &quot;are inefficient&quot; in my experience. When it is about inelastic demand its more re-distributive; the customer benefits and the supplier (in this case SWE&#x27;s) lose.<p>I don&#x27;t like saying this; but we gave AI all the advantage.

The idea was humans really <i>suck</i> at writing code, but we&#x27;re really good at modeling and creating specifications. Tools like Rational Rose arose during this era, as did Booch notation which eventually became part of UML.<p>The problem was it never worked. When generating the code, the best the tools could do was create all the classes for you and maybe define the methods for the class. The tools could not provide an implementation unless it provided the means to manage the implementation within the tool itself - which was awful.<p>Why have you likely not heard of any of this? Because the fad died out in the early 2000&#x27;s. The juice simple wasn&#x27;t worth the squeeze.<p>Fast-forward 20 years and I&#x27;m working in a new organization where we&#x27;re using ArchiMate extensively and are starting to use more and more UML. Just this past weekend I started wondering given the state of business modeling, system architecture modeling, and software modeling, could an LLM (or some other AI tool) take those models and produce code like we could never dream of back in the 80s, 90s, and early 00s? Could we use AI to help create the models from which we&#x27;d generate the code?<p>At the end of the day, I see software architects and software engineers still being engaged, but in a different way than they are today. I suppose to answer your question, if I wanted to future-proof my career I&#x27;d learn modeling languages and start &quot;moving to the left&quot; as they say. I see being a code slinger as being less and less valuable over the coming years.<p>Bottom line, you don&#x27;t see too many assembly language developers anymore. We largely abandoned that back in the 80s and let the computer produce the actual code that runs.

Military&#x2F;aerospace&#x2F;datacomm&#x2F;medical type technical development.  Where you were building very complex things, that integrated into larger systems, that had to work, with teams, and you used higher-level formalisms when appropriate.<p>2. &quot;MIS&quot; (Management Information Systems) in-house&#x2F;intranet business applications.  Modeling business processes and flows, and a whole lot of data entry forms, queries, and printed reports.  (Much of the coding parts already had decades of work on automating them, such as with WYSIWYG form painters and report languages.)<p>Today, most Web CRUD and mobile apps are the descendant of #2, albeit with branches for in-house vs. polished graphic design consumer appeal.<p>My teams had some successes with #1 technical software, but UML under IBM seemed to head towards #2 enterprise development.  I don&#x27;t have much visibility into where it went from there.<p>I did find a few years ago (as a bit of a methodology expert familiar with the influences that went into UML, as well as familiar with those metamodels as a CASE developer) that the UML specs were scary and huge, and mostly full of stuff I didn&#x27;t want.  So I did the business process modeling for a customer logistics integration using a very small subset, with very high value.  (Maybe it&#x27;s a little like knowing hypertext, and then being teleported 20 years into the future, where the hypertext technology has been taken over by evil advertising brochures and surveillance capitalism, so you have to work to dig out the 1% hypertext bits that you can see are there.)<p>Post-ZIRP, if more people start caring about complex systems that really have to work (and fewer people care about lots of hiring and churning code to make it look like they have &quot;growth&quot;), people will rediscover some of the better modeling methods, and be, like, whoa, this ancient DeMarco-Yourdon thing is most of what we need to get this process straight in a way everyone can understand, or this Harel thing makes our crazy event loop with concurrent activities tractable to implement correctly without a QA nightmare, or this Rumbaugh&#x2F;Booch&#x2F;etc. thing really helps us understand this nontrivial schema, and keep it documented as a visual for bringing people onboard and evolving it sanely, and this Jacobson thing helps us integrate that with some of the better parts of our evolving Agile process.</div><br/><div id="42436231" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42436231" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">taylodl</span><span>|</span><a href="#42431397">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42435175">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42436502">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42436231">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42436231">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As I recall, the biggest problem from the last go-around was the models and implementation were two different sets of artifacts and therefore were guaranteed to diverge.

They simply aren&#x27;t accurate enough and they tend to generate more code faster which ends up needing more maintenance.<p>Advice #1: do work on your own mind.  Try to improve your personal organization.  Look into methodologies like GTD.  Get into habits of building discipline.  Get into the habit of storing information and documentation.  From my observations many developers simply can&#x27;t process many threads at once, making their bottleneck their own minds.<p>Advice #2: lean into &quot;metis&quot;-heavy tasks.  There are many programming tasks which can be easily automated: making a app scaffold, translating a simple algorithm, writing tests, etc. This is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to real SWE work though. The intricate connections between databases and services, the steps you have to go through to debug that one feature, the hack you have to make in the code so the code behaves differently in the testing environment, and so on.  LLMs require legibility to function: a clean slate, no tech-debt, low entropy, order, etc.  Metis is a term talked about in the book &quot;Seeing Like a State&quot; and it encompasses knowledge and skills gained through experience which is hard to transfer.  Master these dark corners, hack your way around the code, create personal scripts for random one-off tasks.

Despite what you see on twitter and HN and YC batches, most successful companies are started by people in their 40s.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42435571" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42435571" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">indigoabstract</span><span>|</span><a href="#42431540">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42431769">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42435665">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42437239">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42435571">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42435571">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s good advice, but not easy to follow, since knowing what to do and doing it are very different things.<p>I think that what he means is that how successful we are in work is closely related to our contributions, or to the perceived &quot;value&quot; we bring to other people.<p>The current gen AI isn&#x27;t the end of programmers.

I don&#x27;t give a fuck anymore maybe, or I do and I am too demoralised to confront it.</div><br/><div id="42438717" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42438717" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sleazebreeze</span><span>|</span><a href="#42437090">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42439355">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42438717">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42438717">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t quite get this.

Skills are just the buy-in.<p>Getting and nailing a good opportunity opens doors for a fair bit, but that&#x27;s rare.<p>So the vast, vast majority of future-proofing is relationship-building - in tech, with people who don&#x27;t build relationships per se.<p>And realize that decision-makers are business people (yes, even the product leads and tech leads are making business decisions).  Deciders can control their destiny, but they&#x27;re often more exposed to business vicissitudes.  There be dragons - also gold.<p>To me, the main risk of LLM&#x27;s is not that they&#x27;ll take over my coding, but that they&#x27;ll take over the socialization&#x2F;community of developers - sharing neat tricks and solutions - that builds tech relationship.  People will stop writing hard OS software blogs and giving presentations after LLM&#x27;s inter-mediate to copy code and offer solutions.  Teams will become hub-and-spoke, with leads enforcing architecture and devs talking mostly to their copilots.  That means we won&#x27;t be able to find like-minded people, no one has any incentive or even occasion to share knowledge.  My guess is that relationship skills will be even more valued, but perhaps also a bit fruitless.<p>Doctors and lawyers and even business people have a professional identity from their schooling, certification, and shared history.  Developers and hackers don&#x27;t; you&#x27;re only as relevant as your skills on point.  So there&#x27;s a bit of complaining but no structured resistance on the part of developers to their work being factored, outsourced, and now mediated by LLM&#x27;s (that they&#x27;re busily building).<p>Developers have always lived in the shadow of the systems they&#x27;re building.  You used to have to pay good money for compilers and tools, licenses to APIs, etc.  All the big guys realized that by giving away that knowledge and those tools, they make the overall cost cheaper, and they can capture more.  We&#x27;ve been free-riding for 30 years, and it&#x27;s led us to believe that skills matter most.  LLM&#x27;s are a promising way to sell cloud services and expensive hardware, so there will be even more willingness than crypto or car-sharing or real estate or whatever to invest in anything disruptive.  We rode the tide in, and it will take us out again.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42435505" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42435505" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gt0</span><span>|</span><a href="#42439355">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42439362">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42435505">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42435505">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I use Copilot a bit, and it can be really, really good.<p>It helps me out, but in terms on increasing productivity, it pales in comparison to simple auto-complete.

LLMs are not a game changer like some other thing have been since I&#x27;ve been programming (since late 1980s). Just going to Operating Systems with protected memory was a game changer, I could make mistakes and the whole computer didn&#x27;t crash!<p>I don&#x27;t see LLMs as something we have to protect our careers from, I see LLMs as an increasingly useful tool that will become a normal part of programming same as auto-complete, or protected memory, or syntax-highlighting.

I think yes. As an analogy I think hackers in this way can be seen like a virus and the human immune system. Low exposures and in healthy systems allows the body to develop antibodies and fight off bigger attacks and&#x2F;or when the body is weaker. But too much and the host is permanently damaged. But no viruses and the immune system becomes weak and fragile too.<p>Personally, I think if we want to get the former immunity boosting we should be promoting ways for people to hack on systems in non-malicious ways. Bug bounty programs. Clear paths to responsible disclosure. All that jazz. Accidents will happen and some will go too far, but intent does matter. But we also hear on HN about how people have found vulns, reported it, and the response is to sue the person disclosing for hacking. Even if this is exclusively untrue (lol), if it is widely believed then what incentive does someone have to report a vuln if they find it? Because they sure have incentives to do malicious things with that information.<p>I&#x27;m big on morals and sticking to them. But at the same time I don&#x27;t think we can have a functional society where people&#x27;s only incentive to do the right thing is that warm and fuzzy feeling inside, especially when there are incentives to do the wrong thing. Maybe we should reward good behavior instead of bad behavior...</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41746374" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41746374" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mmsc</span><span>|</span><a href="#41746332">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41746626">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41746374">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41746374">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;He said the average age of anyone arrested for a crime in the U.S. is 37, while the average age of someone arrested for cybercrime is 19.<p>Indeed.

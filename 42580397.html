I consider this a worse outcome than a copyleft that is unenforced. It also encourages malicious enforcement (e.g. Oracle v. Google) that runs contrary to the goals of FOSS.<p>- Due to some very specific peculiarities of US law, regular users can sue companies that don&#x27;t follow the GPL, because the source code disclosure requirement makes you a third-party beneficiary of the copyright license (which in US law is a contract).<p>The last one is a bit unfair to the article because the rulings in question happened after it was published. But it obviates the biggest benefit of centralized ownership - clear and unambiguous standing to sue. If things were the opposite - i.e. the courts said third-party beneficiaries can&#x27;t sue and only owners can - then there would be an argument for keeping ownership of critical parts of the project in an entity with no conflict of interest against enforcement.<p>Even then, I don&#x27;t see why ownership has to be centralized. Under US law, joint owners of a single copyrighted work both have standing to sue. Having more owners means more people with standing. In lieu of a classic CLA with a single point of failure, you could have a policy of accepting any code that is either owned by the developer itself (after their employment contracts have been vetted) or any of a number of trustworthy FOSS organizations who are committed to enforcing GPL. All parties would have standing to sue individually and could additionally sue as a class in a single action.</div><br/><div id="42600368" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42600368" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Tomte</span><span>|</span><a href="#42599940">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42600109">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42600368">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42600368">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; because the source code disclosure requirement makes you a third-party beneficiary of the copyright license<p>Isn‘t this an open question and a main point in the Vizio case where trial is still a few months off?</div><br/></div></div><div id="42600109" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42600109" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Thorrez</span><span>|</span><a href="#42599940">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42600368">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42600261">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42600109">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42600109">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Centralizing copyright ownership in a single entity grants that entity the ability to lock down the project at any time and defeat the copyleft (e.g. Oracle killing off OpenSolaris).<p>I don&#x27;t understand how copyright ownership of FOSS code would impact an entity locking down the project.

  I see what you mean. The original developer can engage
  in a practice that blocks coopertation.

  By contrast, using some other license, such as the ordinary GPL,
  would permitt ANY user of the program to engage in that practice.
  In a perverse sense that could seem more fair,

  On balance, using the AGPL is better.</code></pre></div><br/><div id="42600571" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42600571" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">immibis</span><span>|</span><a href="#42598715">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42599480">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42599704">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42600571">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42600571">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why do you believe that the contributor benefits more from contributing to a project than the project does?</div><br/></div></div><div id="42599704" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42599704" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">KPGv2</span><span>|</span><a href="#42598715">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42599480">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42600571">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42598953">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42599704">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42599704">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; how about you give them the copyright<p>under US law, this is an impossibility.

But it matters when that source-code gets republished, say, under a source-available license, after having been under MIT&#x2F;BSD&#x2F;APL2, in which case, that&#x27;s illegal, unless the company owns the copyright to do so.<p>As an example — if you have a file with a copyright header saying the code is licensed under a permissive license, you can&#x27;t just change that header to a different license. There&#x27;s even a famous case about it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;undeadly.org&#x2F;cgi?action=article&amp;sid=20070913014315" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;undeadly.org&#x2F;cgi?action=article&amp;sid=20070913014315</a><p>It all comes down to copyright. If you copy a piece of code that&#x27;s not trivial, even if the license allows you to copy and reuse that piece of code, you&#x27;re not suddenly the copyright owner of that code. Permissive licenses are permissive, but they do have restrictions, and most importantly, with copyrighted works, excluding the fair use cases that depend on legislation, you can only do what the license allows you to.<p>So, no, code licensed under permissive licenses can&#x27;t be re-licensed as proprietary, even if it can be incorporated in proprietary works.

Your take that it’s unethical seems to contradict with nearly 200 years of American IP law, or even further back to the 1400s in English common law where non competes were considered unjustifiable restraints on trade.<p>In the United States IP rights go to the inventor and most must be explicitly transferred to an employer. The whole point of the patent office is to encourage inventors to invent and not allow corporations to own everything and prevent competition. Although some companies have attempted to rig the system to prevent competition, ultimately the law has come down to foster competition (see the recent defeats of patent trolls)<p>And as the other commenter here points out, there are so many cases where someone working at a company discovers a way to improve business in the industry they are employed in, that could compete with their current employer, and that employer is unable or unwilling to devote resources or compensate for it. Huge swaths of US innovation or driven by such things. Probably the most iconic example is Steve Wozniak inventing the Apple I while he was working at HP, which HP refused to acquire and support causing Steve to resign and start Apple.<p>I also write this as someone with a name on a patent I chose to transfer to a company I helped found for an invention I helped create while working there.

In the US contract law pretty much says if you signed it, you agreed to it, then it holds, unless the law overrides it. For example, you could sign a contract that says you are now an indentured servant, but that violates the law, so would be unenforceable (at least in the US since 1917). However if it says the equivalent of “any code you write on your personal time is our property” you basically agreed to that being the case and you’d have to consult a lawyer in your state before making a determination if that contract would hold up in court. The best assumption prior to that would be to assume it is valid.<p>In addition, the FTC recently banned non competes country wide, which went into effect in September 2024.  There have been a number of challenges to the ruling that have yet to work through the legal system, so it’s best to consult your states laws for the time being.<p>But outside of that, if a company in the US is telling you that your software that you can prove you developed on your personal time on your personal property is somehow theirs, and you are certain you never signed such a non-compete or an assignment agreement that covers work on your personal time; then find a new company to work at. They are basically bullying you. If your employee contract is so ambiguous regarding copyright assignment of software written on your own personal time and assets as to not be certain, find a new company as well, as they are probably incompetent. (You’d probably be safe however, as Contra proferentem in the US is a rule that states an ambiguous contract term should be construed against the drafter of the contract)<p>In fact, in the US, the author always owns the copyright. So in fact the company has to put in place an agreement that outlines that your code copyright is transferred to them. If you pay someone to write software, without such an agreement, the author will still actually hold the copyright. The company can use “work for hire” but since that means they have to prove that they hired you specifically for what your wrote, that it was written in the “scope of employment”; most employers who know what they are doing will have you sign an assignment agreement. Without an assignment agreement; if you write something they didn’t hire you to write and you didn’t agree to assign the copyright to them, you own it.<p>In fact, if a company also wants to patent something that you’ve invented or been part of inventing, they need to get you to file a patent assignment with the USPTO. This may or may not be outlined in your employment contract, but the assignment still needs to be made. You could refuse, most likely at the cost of your employment, however the patent rights would still remain with you the inventor. Not even work for hire would transfer patent or trademark rights.<p>All that said, it should be obvious, however it’s probably best pointed out.. if you copy any code that is owned by the company (code written by another employee or that you transferred ownership of to the employer) then you’re committing copyright infringement and can be held liable.

Free software is very much not about that. Free software is a syndicalist movement <i>by software developers</i>. Software developers have taken control over computing infrastructure, we develop it on our own terms. We have settled on a decentralized model, which shares openly, without constraint.<p>People with the hierarchical mindset hate another party taking ownership because that’s something they don’t have control over. They would be happy to have you hunched over a keyboard desperately typing while they bark orders at you, regardless of whether or not that produces anything of value. Linux and GCC are both inspired products that grew in the cradle of copyleft, they are excellent because of their open development. Meanwhile, large corporations are happy silo themselves into unproductive morasses and play ritualistic political games [1].<p>Copyleft benefits users because it produces better software. Enforcement is the only card to play to make sure that continues. Unfortunately our reaction to licensing has been immature. When asked about licensing, we’re happy to throw up our hands and say “I don’t care about that” (see WTFPL) and carry on with development as if some helpful person from legal will do the legwork for us in exchange for our wonderful output. The fact is, legal is still in the 19th-century as far as intellectual property is concerned, and are happy to respond in a formal and threatening way to anything that challenges their hegemony. We have to work with our colleagues in the legal community, educate, and give them a place in our decentralized world. Otherwise, we’ll just be workers fighting for our slice of the pie in a rat race, commanded by people who are happy with consistent mediocrity.

(Now, maybe I couldn&#x27;t be a waiter at one of the fanciest restaurants.)  There is nothing unethical about being a waiter.

They might pay you enough that you can work full time on it, maybe even hire more contributors, maybe just enjoy life.<p>If you&#x27;re against this, then logically you are also against permissive licenses which allow all this and more. Even <i>Stallman</i>, the most extreme free software proponent alive today, found this to be too extreme. He didn&#x27;t consider permissive licenses to be immoral, therefore he isn&#x27;t against this.<p>I even emailed him to confirm. AGPLv3 is better because only the copyright owner gets to do it, nobody else. Permissive licenses allow everybody else to do it, no questions asked. They just give away all the leverage, completely free. One of the biggest wealth transfer in history, from well meaning developers and straight into the pockets of corporations.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42598600" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42598600" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">globalnode</span><span>|</span><a href="#42599487">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42598600">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42598600">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">ive always wondered about open source, it seems to me like its a pretty good deal for companies</div><br/><div id="42599494" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42599494" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bruce511</span><span>|</span><a href="#42598600">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42599969">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42599494">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42599494">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It is an excellent deal for companies.

I spent all my school and college life absolutely hating it --- writing was too hard.<p>Now I use it when I really need to pay attention to detail. It compels me to slow down and that is how I absorb material better. Further, I realized it is most useful when I am reading &#x2F; thinking on my own, whereas live classroom note-taking disconnects me from the topic. So now I just listen through live lectures and only jot down keywords at points of confusion and&#x2F;or insight.<p>This applies to code too. From time to time, for difficult topics, I will hand-copy code from textbook examples, and also hand-evaluate them on paper before typing the thing into the computer to see if it works. Even if I am following along by typing directly in my Emacs, I always type out any demo &#x2F; sample code; never copy-pasting.

If you read, for example, Kimon Nicolaides, who was writing before any of the modern research on handwritten vs typed, he encourages students to progress to slower and slower contour drawings(outlines drawn without looking at your paper). The reason to use this approach is because it makes drawing more linguistic in nature: you &quot;read&quot; the line and instruct your hand to move slightly in a direction. You can&#x27;t look back and check, so you have to know by feel how much you moved. Repeating this makes you extremely aware of tiny differences between lines, so you end up with good control over proportions as a result. Of course, you could get around this study and use a method like tracing, and get a very detailed outline. But then you wouldn&#x27;t develop any awareness of what you&#x27;re looking at.<p>So when you go slow and engage more senses and muscles, you aren&#x27;t taking &quot;better notes&quot;, you&#x27;re making your brain linger on the content longer and in more depth. It&#x27;s borderline useless if it&#x27;s a business meeting that you&#x27;re notetaking, but it&#x27;s also potentially very helpful for developing the language of shapes and lines, math symbols, molecular diagrams, etc. A lot of study recommendations now say, &quot;take the notes twice&quot;. Once in lecture, just letting your hand move without understanding and reducing anything that&#x27;s lengthy and repetitive to a shorthand symbol. And then a second time when you are at home, allowing yourself to go slowly and develop more comprehension as a mode of study.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39367888" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39367888" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Tor3</span><span>|</span><a href="#39365876">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39366537">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39366285">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39367888">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39367888">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, I just can&#x27;t believe in this handwriting good - typing bad idea.  For what it&#x27;s worth, I can&#x27;t handwrite fast enough to follow my thoughts, and therefore I make errors. Typing gives me no such problems.<p>But the other thing is - as soon as I start (or started, back when I was a pupil&#x2F;student) taking notes, I stop learning. Everybody always insisted that &quot;you have to take notes!&quot;, so I tried that sometimes - and it was a disaster. Didn&#x27;t learn. Had to go over the notes and trying to learn from that. Not good at all.<p>When I didn&#x27;t take notes I could focus 100% on what was shown and said, and I <i>learned</i> it. I <i>understood</i> it, to the extent that there was nothing to remember (just like you don&#x27;t have to remember that an apple will fall, if given the chance). So, when class was over, I <i>understood</i>. Easy on the brain.<p>Obviously there are equations and pure facts. Those you should simply look up when needed. That&#x27;s how we were thought in my college anyway - learn how to find what you need, when you need it.<p>For other things - not attending classes I mean - I most definitely prefer using a keyboard (designs, thoughts about designs etc). Handwriting would be the worst for this.<p>TL;DR - my own experience absolutely tells me that typing is at least as good, probably much better, than handwriting, and it&#x27;s all a red herring anyway because taking notes is detrimental to deep understanding. Keep that to the absolute minimum, and it can be useful, but only then. And for that, it makes no difference what writing method you use.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39366285" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39366285" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sircastor</span><span>|</span><a href="#39365876">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39367888">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39366410">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39366285">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39366285">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Adjacent, but I found my journal writing really took off after I switched to typing it.

Regions of the pages are broken into numbered blocks. Index is written back-to-front with each entry containing at least a timestamp and block number.

Each index entry is its own numbered row. Index entries may need their own numbers so I can come back later to group. I may not even index if I&#x27;m really rushed until later as long as I mark my regions I can index it all later. Not hard to count them up.<p>An example of an index entry:
&quot;56 2024-02-13@22:30 39.1 hn&quot;<p>where the format is: &quot;&lt;index entry #&gt; &lt;timestamp&gt; &lt;page #&gt;.&lt;region #&gt; &lt;keyword&gt;&quot;<p>I would have to linearly search if I haven&#x27;t yet updated my groups in a meta index that spans notebooks e.g. &quot;showerthoughts: 3.30.3 9.42.1 10.3.2  ... &quot; where the format is &lt;book #&gt;.&lt;page #&gt;.&lt;region #&gt; or more concisely &lt;book #&gt;.&lt;index #&gt; I&#x27;ve done both before. I prefer the latter when my index has lots of columns that are more helpful (such as bigger notebooks and I always label my columns so I don&#x27;t confuse myself because not all my notebooks are the same format depending on size).<p>There&#x27;s always time for indexing and metaindexing later and I find it relaxing. Sort of like washing the dishes. It&#x27;s a discipline thing, but doesn&#x27;t have to be perfect. If I had a bunch of old unindexed books I&#x27;d start by just broadly labeling the books first (mostly&#x2F;all school, mostly&#x2F;all work, mostly&#x2F;all personal, etc.) and then lazily drill down into pages and regions and keywords as I actually need the info. Just as long as I didn&#x27;t waste the effort I took to find things the hard way and be sure to index it&#x27;s better than no index at all... wabi-sabi and all that.<p>Also worth pointing out I don&#x27;t have separate books for topics. Fuck that it&#x27;s going on whatever paper I&#x27;ve got on hand and I&#x27;ve even stuck loose pages into books later. As long as the actual content has matching numbers on it (in the corner) the index will keep track. I number it according to where I&#x27;m gonna stick it or just n+1 non-loose soon-to-no-longer-be-blank pages&#x2F;regions. I truly treat paper like disk space and write whatever whenever. It really freed me to think that way. If the index is lost it&#x27;s not unrecoverable either, just tedious.<p>Pretty sure I picked up the habit of decimal numbering in like the 3rd grade. I had teachers whose assignments were like that: &lt;assignment #&gt;.&lt;problem #&gt;<p>i.e. &quot;Did you turn in homework 5.1 through 7.15? No?! You&#x27;re going to the office if you can&#x27;t sit in the hall to finish it by the end of class!&quot; Thought all teachers were like that.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39366357" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39366357" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">the-mitr</span><span>|</span><a href="#39365876">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39364882">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39366357">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39366357">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For young children the problem of writing with hand is twofold. First there is not enough motor control, children spend anywhere between 2-4 years to learn &quot;good&quot; handwriting. Some never get this even as adults. The physical strain of writing with hand is so much that there is no scope for reviewing or editing it, making it better. In fact it is given as a punishment &quot;write this 100 times!&quot;. As adults we typically use typed stuff which we can edit, review and rewrite with much ease using word&#x2F;text processors. This allows cognitive as well as physical affordance for the users. Now young children, by forcing them to handwrite, are denied both these affordances. Typing allows children to overcome the physical aspect of typing and focus on the content. I have had first graders  touch-type in both Devanagari and Roman scripts just with 3-4 months of accessing the One Laptop Per Child. This immensely increased their vocabulary as well as expressiveness. When asked to handwrite the same, they would struggle even to construct simple sentences. Handwriting is a technology which was crucial in the past because we did not have a better alternative. Now that we have better alternatives they should be promoted and used. Studies like these muddy the waters. Did the authors of the study themselves only used handwriting to do this study themselves because it is beneficial ?

He gave me, as he gave his students, a pencil he preferred which as I recall had a diameter about 1.5x a regular pencil. It was also slightly softer, around 2B.<p>As I recall his explanation was that the larger pencil required less motor skill precision, which lead to  more relaxed fingers hence reduced strain. The softer graphite also required less pressure, again reducing strain.<p>As I recall he had found the reduction in strain really helped kids get comfortable with writing by hand.</div><br/><div id="39366726" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39366726" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">animal_spirits</span><span>|</span><a href="#39366357">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39366486">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39366641">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39366726">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39366726">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I remember as a kid I also had bigger pencils.

If I&#x27;m typing out notes, it&#x27;s totally fine -- I pay attention perfectly, maybe even better because I&#x27;ve even got it outlined in sections.<p>I&#x27;ve always been baffled at how some people remember things better with writing.

The mind is on the path between the eyes and the hands. So when you copy something, it must go through your mind!<p>For me this is definitely true. Maybe it&#x27;s like that because when I was growing up we still didn&#x27;t have smartphones, tablets and widespread computer use at schools and everything was written on paper with a pen&#x2F;pencil. Most children and young people today probably don&#x27;t use such tools as much as we did? With that said, I do believe there&#x27;s something very real in the tactile and spatial feeling of writing on paper that does help learning and greatly improves memorising information. For myself it is definitely true. Maybe for a child today that would be an alien feeling? No idea.

Both use your hands after all.<p>True. Although the article is about writing on paper. I&#x27;m a pretty good touch typist and years of Vim have made me efficient with the keyboard. My typing is much faster than my writing. I&#x27;d say that even if I am thinking deeply about a subject, if I&#x27;m copying the text via typing, it I&#x27;ll be a lot faster than writing. On the other hand writing gives me the opportunity to slow down. Maybe you&#x27;re right that both should work equally if I&#x27;m invested mentally in the material, but then I&#x27;ll have the internal pressure to type faster which might hurt that. As a physical motion typing is rather static when compared to writing, so I do believe an actual difference exists.</div><br/><div id="39365357" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39365357" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jwells89</span><span>|</span><a href="#39365023">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39365206">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39365785">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39365357">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39365357">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The speed difference between the two has been a point of friction for me in a couple of different scenarios.<p>It was something of a problem in university. While Iâm not a particularly slow writer, Iâm not a fast one either and as such it was often a struggle to keep up with what the professor was saying and putting up on the chalkboard when taking notes. Trying to summarize and write succinctly helped some but Iâd still sometimes end up far enough behind that I ran out of mental âbufferâ to summarize in which would lead to rote copying, making things even worse. All in all I regret not picking up a laptop of some kind for those years, because even 15 years ago I was much faster at typing.<p>These days when I write notes for studying the slowness isnât an active problem, but more of a persistent irritation stemming from how much time is being spent that could be going elsewhere instead.

Our games were going to need a huge amount of memory. The Final Fantasy VI CG demo we made for the Siggraph exhibition took 20 megs all by itself. We thought that demo had a lot of visual impact, so there really wasn’t much question about which hardware we would use; if we were going to realize the promise of the demo we had shown at Siggraph, nothing but the CD-ROM format would suffice.<p>Another reason for choosing the CD-ROM was related to price. I think one of the big reasons the first Final Fantasy was favorably received by players, and the later games in the series gained so many fans, was that you could buy those games for around 5000 to 6000 yen. We tried to have the same pricing for Bahamut Lagoon, Gun Hazard, and our other later Super Famicom games, but using cartridge ROM meant those games had to be sold for over 10000 yen. New players did not flock to those games like they had before. If we used CD-ROM for Final Fantasy VII, we’d be able to have a 2-disc game at a price of 5800 yen. I was hoping it would be possible to make a game that could sell several hundred thousand copies.“<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shmuplations.com&#x2F;ff7&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shmuplations.com&#x2F;ff7&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38442393" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38442393" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chongli</span><span>|</span><a href="#38442015">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38442170">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38442643">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38443648">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38442393">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38442393">[56 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The N64 cartridge format was the biggest mistake Nintendo made with a mainline console. It was like building a formula one car with a gas tank the size of a thimble. The PS1 absolutely ate Nintendo’s lunch in that round of the console wars. Nintendo went from the undisputed champion of 3rd party libraries (with the SNES) to an also-ran.<p>Sure, Super Mario 64 and Ocarina of Time are classics.

This was also meaningful at the time the N64 was current because that was also the last time  period when pro wrestling was genuinely mainstream popular in the US.<p>Other than that, pretty much all of the games you&#x27;d actually want to play on N64 are Nintendo or Rare games.</div><br/><div id="38443264" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38443264" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">robinson7d</span><span>|</span><a href="#38442015">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38443100">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38443164">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38443264">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38443264">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You’re absolutely correct, but I’d love to hear more about why Rare is an exception. Is it just because they mostly made games for SNES before N64? If so my recollection was that SquareSoft and Enix (separate at the time, IIRC) were similar until PlayStation enticed them, and in our 20&#x2F;20 hindsight (FFVII and all) we wouldn’t bundle those Nintendo companies like we might consider Rare.<p>Again though, you aren’t wrong! Rare covers many of the non-Nintendo greats on N64 (GoldenEye! Banjo Kazooie! Donkey Kong 64! Conker, if you were in a fairly narrow range of maturity!), but they did some Sega before N64 and a lot of Xbox afterward, so I just expect there’s probably some interesting details left to expand here :)<p>If there’s not much to it other than that they were a shining star with a ton of Nintendo investment, all good.</div><br/><div id="38443311" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38443311" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chrisco255</span><span>|</span><a href="#38442015">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38443264">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38443164">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38443311">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38443311">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Rare worked closely with Nintendo on their titles. Nintendo provided top-level support for Rare. They had done fantastic with the Donkey Kong Country series on Super Nintendo, so Nintendo had a lot of trust in them and a great working relationship at a time when the company held their cards a little too closely to their chest. I think Nintendo&#x27;s dev tooling for the N64 was pretty weak and devs were struggling as it was with the transition from 2D to 3D in the crucial early years of the platform. That coupled with the capital intensity made it prohibitive for smaller studios to develop on. But Nintendo trusted Rare and fronted the capital to publish.

Playstation 1 had larger storage space and could take advantage of prerendered graphics and full motion pre-recorded video, but the actual real-time graphics were more limited on the PS1 than the N64. The N64 had also created the analog thumbstick, and although Sony would later copy and improve the design with the Dual Shock controller, initially N64 was a far superior platform for games with twitchy 3D gameplay like platformers and even first person shooters. Another factor was multiplayer. For party games, N64 was a superior experience, as up to 4 players could play at once vs. PS1&#x27;s two controller ports.<p>At any rate due to these factors you&#x27;d have to make various trade-offs when porting a game from PS1 to N64 or vice versa (cut back on multiplayer, reduce textures, adjust controls, compress audio, etc). There was also no such thing as a universal game engine like Unity or Unreal that could cross-compile for both platforms.

The Wii was used as a dumping ground by third parties and just got garbage while the 360 and PS3 got major releases. Wii U was completely ignored, and now the Switch&#x27;s third party content is either last gen ports or heavily downgraded versions of PC games.<p>Handhelds, of course, were different. The GBA, DS, and 3DS all had pretty large third party support and high quality support at that.<p>But that one mistake has hurt them for 30 years. They&#x27;ve had huge waves in hardware sales, but software sales by third parties will probably never reach what the SNES and NES had.

If you sacrificed on those and used lots of compression, you absolutely could build an RPG on the N64 that would stand up to whatever you could do on PlayStation.<p>However, nobody wanted to do that. The only RPGs we got on the N64 were Quest 64 and Paper Mario. The reason why requires diving into the development history of what <i>would</i> have been a third RPG for the system: MOTHER 3. To put it bluntly, they ran out of storage space, and pivoted to the N64 DD to get more. The custom floppy disks the N64 DD took could hold 64MB[0]. Even then, this wasn&#x27;t enough, so the game was then broken up into two parts: an N64 cartridge plus a DD expansion pack, which would give them 96MB in total to play with. MOTHER 3 would then continue in development hell before being canned and reborn as a Game Boy Advance title[1].<p>Fire Emblem was also supposed to release on the N64. However, unlike Itoi biting off more than he could chew with the N64, FE64 failed because the head designer, Shouzou Kaga, didn&#x27;t even want to touch the hardware. He&#x27;d stalled for time by working on Satellaview FE games[2] on the SNES, and then left Nintendo entirely right before Thracia 776 came out. He&#x27;d then release a totally-not-Fire-Emblem clone on PlayStation and get sued into oblivion for... basically telling all the games press that he was making Fire Emblem on PlayStation.<p>So that&#x27;s a 50% success rate for RPGs on the N64 - not a good look. Could homebrewers do better?<p>On prior Nintendo systems, cartridges executed in-place - that is, the CPU bus and game cartridges were wired up such that the game was effectively the system&#x27;s boot ROM. This also meant that the CPU address bus width would limit the size of the game without further bankswitching. On the N64, however, cartridges load into memory through the PI bus, which has a separate address space from the main MIPS CPU. PI bus uses 32-bit addressing, and the address range allocated to the cartridge would allow up to 3.75GB ROMs. Data storage devices that large would never exist during the lifespan of the N64, but building an N64 cartridge that large would be practical today. I suspect loading the ROM image into emulators or flashcarts wouldn&#x27;t be too difficult either.<p>And, of course, if you <i>did</i> manage to hook your N64 up to ridiculous amounts of storage, you could do crazy dynamic loading tricks like this[3]. If the N64 wasn&#x27;t limited by storage space, RPGs would have actually looked <i>better</i> than on PlayStation, and render in real time to boot.<p>[0] Cartridges were later produced at this size, notably for the N64 port of Resident Evil 2<p>[1] This did not actually fix the problems with MOTHER 3. If anything, it made them worse, because GBA cartridges are limited to 16MB without bankswitching. The game used significant amounts of compression to deal with this, which complicated efforts to make an English translation. MOTHER 3 would also not release until a month after the <i>DS Lite</i>, which meant that an official English release of the game was very much out of the question.<p>[2] The Satellaview was a SNES hardware addon that allowed downloading games off of satellite radio services operated by St.GIGA. Think of it like Nintendo&#x27;s equivalent to the SEGA Channel, except Japan-only because satellite radio didn&#x27;t even exist in the US yet.<p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Sf036fO-ZUk" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Sf036fO-ZUk</a></div><br/><div id="38442926" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38442926" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chrisco255</span><span>|</span><a href="#38442015">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38442679">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38442886">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38442926">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38442926">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh, I remember anticipating Earthbound 64 (Mother 3) so hardcore back in the day.

Ocarina of Time was an epic 3D game with all the size and scope and themes of an RPG, it just plays like an action adventure game. It relied on text and real-time cutscenes for storytelling, though (more efficient space-wise than audio and pre-rendered cut scenes).<p>I think it was mainly the capital requirements of developing on the 64. If I recall, the tooling was rough and 3rd parties were largely developing in the dark prior to the release of the 64. I think a lot of hardware details were still being sorted out in the year leading up to the 64&#x27;s release. There wasn&#x27;t much lead time for 3rd parties to start on games. Nevermind that most game developers at the time had very little 3D gaming experience and the engines had to be basically built from scratch (you couldn&#x27;t just boot up Unreal or Unity).</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38442886" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38442886" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rcfox</span><span>|</span><a href="#38442015">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38442170">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38442428">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38442886">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38442886">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There was actually &quot;RPG Tsukūru Super Dante&quot;, an RPG maker on the Super Famicom in Japan in 1995.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38442428" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38442428" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">phendrenad2</span><span>|</span><a href="#38442015">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38442886">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38442258">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38442428">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38442428">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I seem to recall reading that Nintendo forbade 2D games for the N64, because they were desperate to keep up with the 3D hype around the Playstation, and didn&#x27;t want it to be seen as somehow less capable than the Playstation (which, ironically, had many 2D games)</div><br/><div id="38442635" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38442635" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chrisco255</span><span>|</span><a href="#38442015">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38442428">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38442606">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38442635">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38442635">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s not true.  There were several 2D games made for N64, including Yoshi&#x27;s Story, which was made by Nintendo themselves, as well as Bomberman 64 (Japanese version), Bust-A-Move 2, Worms Armageddon, Mortal Kombat Trilogy, etc. It&#x27;s just that most developers chose to go with 3D at the time because it was the new hotness. The vast majority of the library of both systems were 3D.<p>The N64 was an expensive platform to launch on though. It was a lot more capital intensive to do a game on the N64, because the cartridges had wholesale costs of $15-20 to produce, plus licensing fees to Nintendo. Sony on the other hand had a cheaper licensing model and CDs could be mass produced at pennies per copy.<p>The problem is simply that the RPG genre was dominated by Square and Enix. And Square famously abandoned Nintendo after they abandoned the CD format that was originally planned for the N64. In fact, Nintendo had licensed the CD tech from Sony for early prototypes of the N64, and may have inadvertently created their most formidable competitor by doing so. The CD format was superior for doing large pre-rendered graphics and for higher quality sound tracks and audio files. Since these components were more useful for complex storytelling and cutscenes, Square decided to stick with Sony after the split with Nintendo.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38442606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38442606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kemayo</span><span>|</span><a href="#38442015">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38442428">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38442635">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38442716">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38442606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38442606">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In fact, the PS1&#x27;s 2d games tend to stand up <i>much better</i> to modern sensibilities than its 3d games.<p>You can still play Castlevania: Symphony of the Night now and it looks pretty fantastic, whereas something like Tomb Raider has some compromises you&#x27;ll need to accept...<p>Some further examples: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=D9Nk2lTRD5Y" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=D9Nk2lTRD5Y</a></div><br/><div id="38442691" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38442691" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chongli</span><span>|</span><a href="#38442015">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38442606">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38443455">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38442691">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38442691">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">SOTN is one of the best games on the PS1 and arguably one of the best games of all time.

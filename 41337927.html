If I draw a circle and put two dots in it and a curve below the two dots, your brain will immediately recognize these shapes as a human face (smiley face). That means somewhere in your brain there is a mechanism to recognize faces. I believe in everybody&#x27;s brain there exists such knowledge and reflexes that may become more prominent under the effect of some drugs - there is nothing unusual about that. 
I do believe this is very mysterious and interesting, and that it must be researched so we can learn more about it. But I find it wrong and dangerous to try to theorize that there is &quot;something out there bigger than our brain&quot;. Like no, it is all in our brain - but that does not make this issue any less interesting. Brain is capable of great many things and great number of things can be revealed to an individual when their brain is functioning differently under some drugs. I just don&#x27;t think this hints towards some metaphysical world of wonders that is otherwise hidden from our normal state of mind.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41365178" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41365178" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mathieuh</span><span>|</span><a href="#41365617">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41364553">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41365178">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41365178">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree with Sacks. While taking large doses of LSD or DMT I had experiences with what felt like otherworldly entities, or a sense that some cosmic revelation was imminent, but once I&#x27;d come down I didn&#x27;t think something had been revealed to me or that I had been in contact with some supernatural plane, I just thought &quot;wow I was really fucking high&quot;.<p>It was never a visual manifestation of a recognisable shape, it was just a sense that there was another consciousness in the room with me. I never saw machine elves or anything, I just felt strongly that there was a benevolent female presence in the corner of the room. Why I felt it was female I can&#x27;t say but in the moment I was absolutely certain.<p>I am almost pathologically sceptical and I have absolutely zero belief in anything metaphysical. I believe that capability is simply not within me. I can see how other people would believe that there is something beyond though.</div><br/><div id="41365541" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41365541" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">0xEF</span><span>|</span><a href="#41365178">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41365503">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41365541">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41365541">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My experience was similar; no direct contact with entities, but the certainty that <i>something</i> was in the room with me and had no ill intent toward me.<p>I ended up trying DMT a few times, and decided (at least for awhile), that the brain was a &quot;chemical radio,&quot; able to be tuned to the different frequencies of reality with these substances.

And from what I can tell most of the experiments in actually living these different lives in the 60s and 70s failed because when it comes down to it, communal living requires idealism, commitment and hard graft. Those last two are often missing and the first fades.<p>I&#x27;ve had my &quot;I am one with the fabric of the universe&quot; moments. I&#x27;ve seen things of great beauty on psychedelics, I&#x27;ve had thoughts twist and turn in impossible ways... but in the end it would take extraordinary evidence to persuade me it&#x27;s anything other then the subjective experience brought on by a drug twisting my brain. From the article -<p>&gt; If people say they’ve talked with angels or dead ancestors, should we dismiss them as raving, drug-addled trippers?<p>No, because that&#x27;s prejudicial and dismissive, but we probably should think of those experiences in terms of an internal psychedelic journey conjured up by the brain on drugs, rather than some sort of extrinsic interaction with the universe. At least until someone comes up with something other than speculation as evidence.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41364553" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41364553" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">md224</span><span>|</span><a href="#41365178">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41364628">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41364553">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41364553">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Once, after injecting himself with a large dose of morphine, he found himself hovering over an enormous battlefield, watching the armies of England and France drawn up for battle, and then realized he was witnessing the 1415 Battle of Agincourt...

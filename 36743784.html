I didn&#x27;t realize Claude 2 was so good at working with PDFs natively. I wonder if they&#x27;re doing anything special? Is this just due to larger context length they have?<p>Also, biased opinion on my part: I&#x27;m especially interested in watching how these things affect data science and data literacy as a whole. Code interpreter is a game changer in my opinion, the most powerful tool that I think deserves all the press it is getting. Also: I released an open source code-interpreter for data (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;approximatelabs&#x2F;datadm">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;approximatelabs&#x2F;datadm</a>) and even though I know how to code and use Jupyter daily, I still find myself doing analysis with it instead.<p>All in all, it does seem like the different models and agents are gaining &quot;specialization&quot; skill is actually good for the user (rather than just using a single jack of all trades super chat model). Even though GPT-4 takes the language model crown, there&#x27;s still specialization that matters and improves quality for different tasks as discussed here.<p>I wonder if in 2-5 years we&#x27;ll all use &quot;a single&quot; AI chat interface for everything, or every specialization continues to &quot;win at its own vertical&quot; and we just have AI embedded inside of every app</div><br/><div id="36744309" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36744309" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ehnto</span><span>|</span><a href="#36744018">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36744211">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36744309">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36744309">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think they necessarily need to specialize, as certain information is only available in the context of the domain.

Doing the math is doing the language. I&#x27;m not sure which part is &quot;easy&quot;. Even setting up problems is often incredibly difficult. This is where many physics students often struggle, despite having strong math skills there&#x27;s a challenge to describe the problem to be solved. Even strong mathematicians often struggle to translate between mathematics and their native spoken language. Though 3B1B is quite good at doing this, though there is quite a lot of simplification to goes on due to the target audience. Like I said to the sibling comment, do not mistake how powerful and impressive language is. It created our modern world and there&#x27;s a reason it is more important to us than even our phones. But all languages, including math, are never complete. They cannot describe everything, unfortunately. But I thought my name would have indicated that I was well aware of this notion.<p>&gt; &quot;Where do the zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie?&quot; is way way more than just vocabulary<p>And a language isn&#x27;t just vocabulary.

No one said it is just games either. I think you&#x27;re turning what I said into something else. Languages are incredibly impressive and powerful things. I feel like you&#x27;re making languages appear simple and of low utility. But language has been one of the, if not the most, powerful tool humans have ever created, especially when you consider written language. The latter allowing us to pass along information asynchronously through time and space. Do not miss the power of this tool just because it is something we use so frequently. There&#x27;s a reason we use it so frequently.<p>The reason we use the language of math is because it is so precise. But you just described a turing machine without using math. Keep in mind that physics is also a language. Physics is an ever evolving model, a description of our reality. But it is not more than that, a model. But all models being wrong does not equate to models being useless. Physicses (yes, there are multiple ones), are clearly quite powerful and useful models that have enabled us to do quite amazing things as well. But I&#x27;m also not going to start programming in Brainfuck or with Magic cards. But I do have a deep passion for mathematics and it is something I use every day and spend quite a lot of time learning even outside my work.<p>Your argument demonstrates the usefulness of mathematics, but does not demonstrate that it isn&#x27;t a language. I also would like to remind you that you can create pretty useless algebras. Maybe also checkout Wolfram&#x27;s section on recreational mathematics. Maybe also dig into my name sake&#x27;s multiple theorems. Most people misunderstand the results, but I don&#x27;t think it diminishes their worth, they are quite important and amazing. And the incompleteness theorem is deeply related to turing completeness as well as superposition and a famous logic paradox.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37865803" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37865803" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jebarker</span><span>|</span><a href="#37864686">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37865743">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37867616">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37865360">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37865803">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37865803">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Why go back to school when you already know how to research?<p>There&#x27;s a couple of reasons I can think of. One is that if you want to do fundamental research in a particular field then you probably need other people to work with and that&#x27;s mostly going to be in academia and PhD is the pathway. The other is that if you take a break from academia after a PhD it&#x27;s really hard to come back. Three PhDs does seem extreme though!<p>I&#x27;m sort of in the latter position. I did a PhD in math, have spent 15 years in govt and industry but a part of me wishes I could go back to pure math research. I think the only path to do that would probably be to do a PhD in a related field such as theoretical physics.</div><br/><div id="37868405" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37868405" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">godelski</span><span>|</span><a href="#37864686">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37865803">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37865360">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37868405">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37868405">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Interesting. I totally get the desire to have collaborators but at the same time I&#x27;m particularly burnt out on academia.

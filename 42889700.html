And your prognosis, if I am to understand correctly, is overall good.<p>This Sunday marks the fourth anniversary of my wife&#x27;s passing at just 46 years old. She had unending nausea, and major motility issues. They also thought gastroparesis at first, and her doctor and surgeon even developed a surgery just for her, which I understand they won awards for. It helped her for about 2 months,  and she started regaining weight, but her symptoms- unable to hold down food of any kind- returned.<p>From there things just got worse. G-J tube feedings with formula. Then TPN, which her body also rejected. And then... the actual starving. Her body refused any sort of nutrition from any source, even directly into her bloodstream.<p>Doctors essentially gave up. She was on hospice for quite a while. She had started off as a large woman and when she passed, she weighed about 55lbs.<p>I tell you this not to scare you or make you worry, but to make sure you&#x27;re grateful for the health you do have, OP.<p>They never did figure out what was wrong with her. Official cause of death was &quot;malnutrition.&quot; Right. Gastrointestinal mysteries such as yours, and hers, really underline the fact that as much as medicine does know about the human body, there is an infinite more that they don&#x27;t know about it.<p>Best of luck to you.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42890530" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42890530" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">GlenTheMachine</span><span>|</span><a href="#42896798">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42890645">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42890530">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42890530">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So my kid has ARFID. I am not a doctor, but what I have learned is that eventually, anything that causes nausea associated with eating can progress into ARFID, even if the original underlying cause resolves. ARFID is technically an eating disorder, like anorexia, but it isn&#x27;t related to poor body image; it is, basically, a food aversion to, well, food. All food, or nearly all. This is what happened to my kid; there’s an underlying disorder that can be treated with meds, but when not treated causes nearly constant nausea. Once we diagnosed and treated the underlying cause, the nausea didn’t go away. My kid&#x27;s brain had learned to associate eating with being sick, and that association persisted even when the original illness resolved.<p>My kid at one point was admitted to the hospital for two weeks because said kid had lost so much weight. They inserted a gastric tube, and kid discovered that kid did not become nauseous when fed through the tube. We knew kid had ARFID, but this was ah “a-ha” moment for kid, because it showed kid irrefutable proof that the problem was not a physical issue with kid&#x27;s gut. It was very clearly related to the experience of eating. Kid has subsequently learned to “eat through the nausea” as described in the post.<p>That&#x27;s what this sounds like. There was likely an underlying physical cause of the nausea; that cause may or may not have resolved, but the nausea is now it&#x27;s own thing. The OP indicates a series of consults with a behaviorist; I would imagine being screened for eating disorders is what that was about, but ARFID is not a common eating disorder, and may or may not have been considered.</div><br/><div id="42891572" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42891572" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mncharity</span><span>|</span><a href="#42890530">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42891086">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42891572">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42891572">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Fwiw: Strenuous winter activities (eg mountain hiking and camping) can more than double baseline calorie demand.

This person definitely falls outside the usual mechanisms of nausea. I’m always interested in this stuff because managing post operative nausea and vomiting is a huge part of anesthesia. I made a protocol for our ambulatory surgery center using a newer dopamine base drug Amisulpride. Works great for most people. The best one is Aprepitant which is an NK1 inhibitor, pretty cool mechanism, works great for chemo nausea and is super effective for anesthesia related nausea BUT is very expensive. I wonder if anyone offered this patient Droperidol. It’s a cousin of  Haloperidol minus the anti-psychotic and sedating effects. It was pulled off the market due to a black box warning that it could cause QT prolongation and a potentially fatal heart arrhythmia but turns out that data was bad and for nausea doses it prolongs the QT interval no longer than many other drugs we allow on the market. I’d say #1 drug for anti nausea is Aprepitant (Emend), #2 success is Amisulpride, #3 Zofran, #4 scopolamine patch. Each has a totally different mechanism.  Funny enough I had a patient today who failed all those except Emend (we don’t have it on formulary cuz of cost).  You know what worked? 25mg of IV Benadryl. The guy was STILL there at 3pm after being first knee replacement case at 7AM, still puking. Tried everything, even 50mg IV Dextrose. Nope.  But IV Benadryl got him out the door in 20 minutes. Totally weird.<p>Reglan is a really shitty drug, like of all the dopamine mechanism drugs it has the worst side effects. I never give it.

This ultimately describes a lot of functional GI conditions.<p>With central hypersensitivity, chronic pain, chronic migraine, and cyclic vomiting, one of the goals becomes resetting the sensory nerve volume back to a normal level. Meditation, therapy, etc., can all have a role. Often, antidepressants are often used at lower doses since they modulate peripheral nerves too.<p>FWIW, you may want to ask your current primary or GI&#x2F;neurologist about cyclic vomiting syndrome and whether to trial a TCA (first line treatment, amitriptyline has the most evidence)</div><br/></div></div><div id="42890622" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42890622" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smittywerben</span><span>|</span><a href="#42893808">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42891777">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42890622">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42890622">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I apparently have a food allergy.

Said another way, I would recommend OP eat a bag of gluten and see if they end up in the hospital you&#x27;ll have your diagnosis in 15 minutes and then there&#x27;d be no argument.<p>I&#x27;m not speaking about you specifically, parents get the cutting out X&#x2F;Y&#x2F;Z food wrong with their kids all the time. It makes people afraid of eating instead of afraid of what they&#x27;re allergic to. Unless you maintain a strict food journal which I don&#x27;t have time for why not just take 2x dose of Zyrtec (I&#x27;m just a happy customer) for a week, then try the gluten&#x2F;paleo&#x2F;soylent&#x2F;steve jobs diet.<p>Edit: I am not a medical doctor and taking an antihistamine to mask a food allergy is probably dangerous but I&#x27;m still testing myself. OP said they tried Dramamine, which is an antihistime. I&#x27;ve taken that along with many antacids including Nexium and Pepcid which are also antihistimine. Maybe mast cell disorder is what doctors have to call it so someone with a peanut allergy doesn&#x27;t read this and reaches for zyrtec and a bowl of peanuts and throws out their epipen. That&#x27;s why I mentioned the pollen cross-reactivity because I think my body is just overreacting so I&#x27;m making the executive decision to suppress it. It&#x27;s been 8 months or so, I&#x27;ve not taken a single Nexium, only a couple pepcid which for my family is basically cured. I moved somewhere with less pollen because I don&#x27;t like taking pills all the time.<p>Edit-Edit (I&#x27;m really focused on this topic lately): The bottom line is that I reduced my cetirizine use from 15–20 mg&#x2F;day to about 5 mg&#x2F;day by moving to a place with less pollen.<p>If you&#x27;re experiencing something similar, pay attention to any systemic symptoms and listen to your body. I had eliminated almost all food from my diet to control my gastric issues. But my left ear was having tinnitus. They checked it, they said my ears are very clean and thought it might be middle ear problems. They gave me a list of antihistimines and a nasal steroid (flonase) to try. I channeled my oppositional energy and thought, &quot;Well, if they want me to try it…&quot;<p>So I bought the entire list they gave me, I took cetirizine once a day, loratadine twice a day, and occasionally a fexofenadine pill (along with my usual double dose of Nexium, which I was desperate to discontinue) plus the Flonase for good measure.<p>I started cetirizine to manage tinnitus and dizziness, which are entirely separate systemic symptoms that I had never associated with my gastric symptoms or food.<p>A few days later, my ears cleared, and all my gastric&#x2F;reflux symptoms disappeared. I quit all antacids on the same _day_. When my middle ears drain, that&#x27;s my canary in the coal mine. It had worked so well that I wondered how long I had been suffering before I moved to Pollenville in the first place and just didn&#x27;t notice.<p>Thanks Pollenville.

It&#x27;s a very difficult area to work in because non-specific GI symptoms can be the result of a wide range of things, from physical obstructions to nervous system problems and even stress.<p>This blog post is great because the author keeps an open mind. One of the challenges with functional conditions that can possibly overlap with mental health is that some people (not this author, speaking generically) become extremely defensive at any suggestion that the condition might be related to stress, anxiety, or depression. My friend has a whole strategy of asking questions about the person&#x27;s life, job, relationships, and life changes around the time the condition started. With surprising frequency, patients will remember the start date of their GI conditions specifically because it happened near something stressful (death in the family, layoffs, new job, etc.). I don&#x27;t think this applies to the blog author, but keep in mind for anyone else reading this with similar symptoms.<p>Stress-triggered conditions have a bad property of becoming self-reinforcing. The initial stressor might be gone, but the person is stressed about the constant problems with their conditions. Understandably so!<p>She says it&#x27;s common to have people spontaneously get better when they get a new job, go on a long vacation, enter a new relationship, or other large life changes. It&#x27;s also common for patients to start SSRIs with another provider and &quot;coincidentally&quot; the GI symptoms get better. It&#x27;s also common for other providers to blindly prescribe medications that worsen GI symptoms if they aren&#x27;t paying attention.<p>The hard part for her broaching the subject with patients who don&#x27;t want to hear it. There&#x27;s a huge resistance to any path of inquiry that patients think as &quot;all in your head&quot; diagnoses. It&#x27;s understandable, but at the same time most people don&#x27;t understand that your nervous system operates throughout the body (not just the &quot;head&quot; or brain) and the activity of the GI system is heavily modulated by the nervous system.</div><br/><div id="42896163" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42896163" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">trainspotter</span><span>|</span><a href="#42891777">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42891130">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42896163">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42896163">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great comment and matches my experience exactly.

That&#x27;s going to quickly translate into 1x person working at 5x efficiency putting 1-4 people out of work. It&#x27;s not hard to find accounts of people who have already lost their jobs-- such stories have popped up here on HN.<p>Sure, you can argue that the jobs are simply displaced, and others will emerge requiring different skills than AI can easily perform, but that doesn&#x27;t negate the reasonable <i>panic</i> individuals in jobs will feel. The article cites off-shoring as an example, but that&#x27;s actually my point: I know various people who were ~55-60 when offshoring hit they industry or company. They were displaced and never found a new career-- their expertise was in areas that other corps were also outsourcing. I saw plenty of individuals hop to another company only to have their job and the new corp ofshored a few years later. Then if they&#x27;re lucky &amp; near the finish line they can take early retirement, but if they&#x27;re a bit short of that mark they worked jobs that paid minimum wage+$1-$7&#x2F;hour. Apart from other people I came across, I knew several such individuals when I worked a big box retail book store (when those were still relevant) during my college years.<p>So yeah, even if the author is correct that job loss or displacements are temporary, that&#x27;s still a process that takes a minimum of 10-20 years. Retirement age minus 10-20 years is a whole heck of a lot of the population that are in jobs right now that can be automated of 3-5x&#x27;ed by a single person. Panic, or at least anxiety, is a rational response to that. Sure, a person should learn the new tools ASAP to be one of the 1x-now-5x workers but there&#x27;s just not enough slots for everyone.</div><br/><div id="36224512" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36224512" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nirui</span><span>|</span><a href="#36222973">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36223831">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36224512">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36224512">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; It&#x27;s not hard to find accounts of people who say they&#x27;re 2x, 3x, 5x more efficient in their work now.<p>What does &quot;making some one 5x more efficient&quot; actually mean anyway? Does it makes people enjoy their lives more, or it just makes few people work harder while leaving the others hanging without income?<p>Let me bring up another point just popped up in my head: AI don&#x27;t really need to be the perfect replacement to a human worker for them to replace the human worker, instead, it just need to be good enough to make economical sense for the employer to switch labor strategy.<p>We the market has already been trained to accept reduced product quality during the past decades as companies adjusting their production strategies. It is only reasonable to assume that we will accepting it further.<p>So even if AI technology cannot maintain the same level of quality standard we often suffer today, it is still well within the realm of possibility that companies will just replace their workers with AI and then expect the market to lower it&#x27;s expectations more.<p>&gt; The stakes here are high. The opportunities are profound.<p>I guess time will tell...<p>While I at it, another thing:<p>&gt; AI will not destroy the world, and in fact may save it.<p>Well, you can save the world many many times over, and then you can still save it once more and even more. But the world can&#x27;t really take too many destruction. One or two extinction level events might just done it for good.<p>Also, AI don&#x27;t even need to be sentient or have the ability to reason it&#x27;s way towards world destruction. In fact, it might not even know what the f it&#x27;s doing, all it needs is the capability to do so and some calculations to line things up.<p>I&#x27;m not really very optimistic about it, obviously.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36223831" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36223831" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mock-possum</span><span>|</span><a href="#36222973">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36224512">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36223651">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36223831">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36223831">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It’s also not hard to find people (see: me) in industries where AI has been prophesied to be exceptionally disruptive, saying that actually, meh, it’s not going to mean much ultimately.<p>I’m a programmer, and sure, I’ve asked ChatGPT to write some unit tests, and I’ve encouraged CodePilot to suggest some function signatures, but - it’s still ‘just’ a novelty, and it is wildly out of reach of ‘disruptive.’ It’s not doing anything I couldn’t do, and it’s not doing anyone not at my level would know what to do with.

Even if this would lead to less employees needed, it will take a few years before the effects will be seen. It&#x27;s a quite slow process:<p>1. A sufficiently large part of the work force has to learn it and start using it in an efficient manner.
2. It has to be noticed, measured and evaluated as being more efficient by management.  
3. Management has to decide to lay off people instead of being happy with the improved efficiencies and possibly higher profits.
4. Lay-offs take time. From step 3 to actually taking action can take time, and from the actual notice to the person being in the job seeking market also often takes many months.</div><br/><div id="36224483" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36224483" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">versteegen</span><span>|</span><a href="#36222973">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36224279">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36224114">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36224483">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36224483">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Those are only the first steps.

AI is like cancer.<p>It&#x27;s not one thing, it&#x27;s many things, and anything that we believe will replace our brain power, or be put in charge of something large enough to be dangerous. At the same time ML, DL, and LLMs et al are all in use around us and some have been for years and decades. Whether it&#x27;s simple use of Linear Regression, Principal Components, Nearest Neighbors, SVM, Random Forests, LS-TM, or now Transformers and Stable Diffusion it will find its way into hundreds and then thousands of products and tools used by many millions of people. It will hide in plane sight, until eventually something really bad happens, something that makes people fear it more than the quarterly profits it generates.<p>I&#x27;m not really an AI fear monger. I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s the biggest threat we currently face. It&#x27;s a tool like internal combustion, antibiotics, debt based currencies, or nuclear power. I don&#x27;t think we had a good idea how any of them would ultimately create challenges and require regulation or even create dangerous stability. I doubt we do with AI either even though we&#x27;ve had decades of books, movies, and video games warning us of various possibilities.<p>We won&#x27;t cure it, but maybe we can tame it. Will it be the garbage it generates, some other tools it lets us create, growth too fast for most people to cope, a band-aid that masks real solutions, I don&#x27;t know... and I don&#x27;t think anyone does.</div><br/><div id="36222548" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36222548" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LucioRAA</span><span>|</span><a href="#36219989">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36221296">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36215425">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36222548">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36222548">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Cancer is an exceptionally powerful analogy. The best I&#x27;ve yet to come across.<p>Tools like AI won&#x27;t save or improve the world, as it has never been the original goal. If it was, then, as one of the commenters above pointed out, we would&#x27;ve done it with the technologies&#x2F;systems we already had.<p>AI&#x27;s goal to save the world is no more than the cancer cell&#x27;s goal to save the host organism (it is not in its capacity to think that far, nor has it been in ours so far either). The goal is to maximize local gain, efficiency, power, and control.<p>AI is yet another tool to make status quo more efficient. The problem is not AI; the problem is status quo. Thus, its cardinal applications will lean exceedingly toward militarization, state control, social engineering, propaganda, corporatism, hyperconsumerism, and further colonization of human and natural communities. AI just makes this so much more efficient. The result is predictable; this is how complex systems collapse. It will be fortunate if the collapse occurs before the technology is powerful enough to sustain the system semi-permanently, rendering any immune resistance ineffective until the host environment is eventually terminated.<p>I think the future, if we are to have one, is not AI (or any other post-human substitute). The future is human. AI is a good indicator of the greater existential crisis that we are facing. Let&#x27;s face it, we are fundamentally uncomfortable with being human. So it is a good wake-up kick in the butt for us.<p>[P.S. I noticed an interesting trend on H.N.: the most poignant and thought-provoking comments are constantly downvoted and flagged.

I came across examples of sentiment analysis being used at Walmart and Target. They have big and conspicuous cameras in every one of their stores now. Most people assume it is for shoplifting mitigation, which it is. But that is not all. They can use it to track individual customer&#x27;s paths through the store and then use cameras at the checkout to analyze your facial expression and rank your mood. They use this data to optimize their store layouts.<p>The other use case was at high-end retail stores. Places like Luis Vuitton, Hermes, etc. They have facial recognition to log high spenders. If you drop 10k at Coach and then go down the street to Valentino their security system will recognize you and highlight you as a VIP customer. A specialized customer assistant then comes out to give you personal attention, maybe to invite you to the private shopping experience.<p>I learned about these in 2017 I believe.

All the same, reading HN politics, it often seems that a spectrum is presented that spans from freedom to state oppression.
There are democracies where the public will not accept the state using power for its own benefit, but is comfortable with the state enforcing the social contract, because there is a stronger sense that this is defined democratically.

But even the smartest animal you&#x27;ve seen is far dumber than the average human being (except visitors at national parks operating trash cans). I mean you can teach many kinds of animals quite a bit, but eventually you hit physical limits of their architecture.<p>Even humans have limitations. You can learn the most when you&#x27;re a child, and you do this in an interestingly subtractive method. Your brain is born with a huge number of inner connections. As we learn and age we winnow down those connections and use a far lower portion of our energy output on our mind. Simply put we become limited on how much we can learn as we age. You have to sleep. You get brain fog. You end up forgetting.<p>With A(G|S)I there are many questions unanswered. How far can it scale? Myself I see no reason it cannot scale far past the human mind. Why would humans be the most optimized intelligence architecture there is? It seems evolution would create that. When you ponder on the idea that something could possibly be far more intelligent than you, you have to come back to the thought on your pets. They live in the same reality of you, but you exist on an entirely different plane of existence due to your thinking abilities. What is the plane of existence like for something that can access all of humanities information at once look like? What is the plane of existence like for something that can see in infrared, ultraviolet, in wireless, in context of whatever tooling it can almost instantly connect to and work with, something that can work with raw data from sensors all over the planet feeding data back to it at light speed?<p>Now, you&#x27;re most likely correct in the sense before we get some super ASI that is far beyond us, we&#x27;ll have some AGI just good enough to power someone greedy and cause no shortage of hell on earth.

If war isn’t that anymore, won’t it be much more frequent and casually started as a result?</i><p>Yes (usually), to the first question.  The second begs the question though.<p>Wars are destructive and enormously expensive. Only a tiny fraction of human leaders wielding a disproportionate amount of power have the agency to start wars, and they do so in order to pursue specific (but varied) objectives.  Since the cost is high, no one does this lightly (even the &quot;crazy&quot; ones, because they would already have lost power if they weren&#x27;t smart and calculating).<p>AI may provide avenues to enhance the efficacy of wars.  It may also provide avenues to enhance other strategies to achieve those objectives.  In all cases, we can expect AI will be used to further the objectives of those humans with the power to direct its development and applications.<p>It is therefore ludicrous and self-interested speculation to claim that AI will reduce death rates.  Andreessen signals this with the preface &quot;I even think&quot; so that he can make the claim without any later accountability. The reality is, future wartime death rates may or may not decrease, but even if they do, we likely won&#x27;t even be able to credibly attribute the change to AI versus all other changes to the global geopolitical environment.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36217945" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36217945" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lisasays</span><span>|</span><a href="#36215645">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36217776">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36218472">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36218340">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36217945">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36217945">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>That said, isn’t the point of war also that it’s horrible and barbaric?</i><p>Of course - that&#x27;s precisely the point.

This can take the form of access to new resources (whether that be land, access, air space, whatever) or to form a buffer between one country and another. There&#x27;s probably other reasons, simply like ego in some cases.<p>There are other ways to expand powerbases too - such as China&#x27;s heavy financial and infrastructure investment in Africa and South Pacific nations, or attempting to undermine another country&#x27;s social structures.

The teachers were overworked with huge class sizes and they spent so much time helping kids simply graduate that they had no time to help any student who was average or above. If you learned in a non-standard way, forget about it. Forget &quot;cookie cutter individuals&quot;, half the time the teachers would show up and not actually teach (they&#x27;d put some music on and work on other things.) &quot;perfect tutors&quot;? In an era before digitized gradebooks, teachers could give you whatever scores they wished, no accountability. One big function of standardized testing is to push teachers to be accountable. Even the teachers that were trying their best just didn&#x27;t have the time to do any more than the absolute basics.<p>I studied for SATs and AP exams by downloading textbooks from filesharing websites and studying those. Wikipedia filled in the gaps for non-STEM subjects. Nobody at my school could help me. At the time all the teachers and councilors knew is that I was going to be okay without any help from them, at least better than the other kids. I knew that nobody succeeded where I grew up and I needed to look outside to level myself up to succeed.<p>I can only see AI tutors as much better than the nothing that often is public education. The status quo is just overworked, ineffective teaching. Being able to bounce off questions from an AI tutor when it&#x27;s late and you&#x27;re up with homework and your parents either can&#x27;t help or are hostile to your educational goals (the reality in a low income area) would go a long way. Of course the reality is that maybe AI tutors aren&#x27;t actually coming and all we&#x27;ll get are LLMs trained on the contents of school textbooks, but even that is a lot better than what we have now. The important problem will be making sure that <i>everyone</i> gets access to these AI tutors and not just the privileged in the elite schools who were going to be funneled into an elite college anyway.<p>Would it be best if we were able to shrink class sizes and have world-class teachers for children? Of course. Are countries going to be willing to pay the tax burden needed to make this happen? Probably not. In the meantime it&#x27;s best for the poor kids to have the cookie-cutter, AI tutor while the wealthy have their own private tutors. It&#x27;s not very different from the status quo today except the poor kids have nothing.</div><br/><div id="36221607" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36221607" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tjpnz</span><span>|</span><a href="#36215645">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36220236">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36220642">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36221607">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36221607">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you live in a country which doesn&#x27;t value giving everyone a good education to begin with, how will this be better?

Take the Internet. A lot of people who were around in the 1990&#x27;s thought it was a great thing at the time. Perhaps it wouldn&#x27;t be the great equalizer, but it would reduce the barriers to access information. Consider the Internet today. It is undoubtedly better at reducing the barriers to access information, yet I doubt that many people have such an optimistic view of the technology. We discovered that it is just as good, perhaps even better, at distributing junk information. We discovered that the information becomes consolidated in a limited number of hands. The technology itself hasn&#x27;t fundamentally changed. Even the use of the technology hasn&#x27;t fundamentally changed. It simply took time for the distributed to become consolidated. It was almost certainly a given that this would happen as wealth facilitates growth and growth attracts people who wish to exploit it for wealth.<p>Does that mean the world is worse off because of the Internet? Probably not. Even if it was, I&#x27;m not sure I would want to give it up because I remember the hurdles I faced before the Internet was nearly universal. That said, I do believe we should be conscious about how we use it and skeptical of those who present hyper-optimistic views of new technologies. While some may be genuine in their visions, we also have to factor in those who wish the exploit it for their own benefit and to the expense of others.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36217000" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36217000" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rprenger</span><span>|</span><a href="#36215002">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36215219">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36215249">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36215328">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36217000">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36217000">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The printing press.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36215328" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36215328" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fsflover</span><span>|</span><a href="#36215002">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36215219">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36217000">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36220512">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36215328">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36215328">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">(GNU&#x2F;)Linux?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36220512" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36220512" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JohnFen</span><span>|</span><a href="#36215002">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36215075">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36215219">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36220512">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36220512">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Even if it is available to all people.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

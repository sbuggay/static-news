I&#x27;m so glad that Tom Conrad is an engineer by training. I hope he can turn this mess around.<p>The key technical change that broke Sonos was abandoning their reliable UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) system for device discovery in favor of mDNS, while also shifting from direct device communication to a cloud-based API approach. This new architecture made all network traffic encrypted and routed through Sonos cloud servers (even for local operations), adding significant overhead and latency, especially for older Sonos devices with limited processing power. They also switched from native platform-specific UX frameworks to a JavaScript-based interface while moving music service interactions through their cloud instead of direct SMAPI calls, resulting in slower performance and reduced functionality.<p>For a more extended discussion, see this excellent LinkedIn post from Andy Pennell, a principal engineer at Microsoft with a deep technical understanding of Sonos systems. He created one of the most successful third-party Sonos apps for Windows Phone and worked directly with Sonos on their official Windows Phone 8 app.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;pulse&#x2F;what-happened-sonos-app-technical-analysis-andy-pennell-wigwc&#x2F;?trackingId=kSfNh0CXT2OTCTbZ%2FYpQrA%3D%3D" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;pulse&#x2F;what-happened-sonos-app-techn...</a></div><br/><div id="42690249" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42690249" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jedberg</span><span>|</span><a href="#42690034">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42690453">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42690249">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42690249">[82 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think having a sales person in charge was the problem.<p>The problem is the fundamental disconnect between what&#x27;s good for users and what&#x27;s good for the company.

Photos had a perfectly fine interface with tabs that got changed into a long list of often redundant categories. Thankfully it can be customized a bit.
New control center (wifi toggles etc.) was replaced with a customizable grid of widgets that is buggy, slow and looks ugly and unprofessional in comparison with the old interface. Gimmick.
Home screen icon size and color is customizable now and it looks out of place. Gimmick.
If you have a dark theme enabled then icons in settings become themed and look different than icons on the home screen with is weird and inconsistent with the rest of the interface.
All animations were reworked and feel like crap. There is a delay to every action and it feels like animation smoothness takes priority over interface responsiveness. Home screen swiping animation stutters every time.
Even though there is not a single new feature available for EU users other than the interface changes the entire OS feels sluggish, bloated and unfinished.
Performance is terrible. This update made my iPhone 12 slow down to a crawl. Feels like running Vista on a Windows XP machine and since they dropped security updates for iOS 17 I had no choice but to upgrade. This combined with the recent news about iPhones listening to people at homes makes me want to get rid of my phone entirely.

The consumer, in enterprise level markets, is hardly ever the team or individual in charge of operating the technology. The consumer is the manager, or managerial team, looking to check boxes and shuffle numbers and spend $X on Y department, for which they get rewarded for a wide array of arbitrary outcomes, almost none of which have anything to do with the practical impact of the product in question on the people who end up most affected by the purchase.<p>If an engineer with a solid understanding of the product being sold is in charge, he&#x27;s in the best place to rein in the sales and marketing teams, and to direct development based on customer reality.

I&#x27;ve been in the sales position before, handling the people in charge of making the purchasing decision, selling them bells and whistles they absolutely didn&#x27;t need, but giving them the emotional satisfaction of a &quot;successful&quot; transaction, leaving with a sense of victory, that translated into a strong relationship and many years of repeat sales, with incremental upselling over time.<p>Good sales, ethical sales, aren&#x27;t parasitic. A vast majority of sales in todays markets, <i>especially</i> in enterprise markets, are parasitic. The salespeople are interchangeable. The ones that make the most money are the ones most willing to be parasitic. The sales script is targeted and tailored to the intended audience, which in most large companies, is several degrees of separation from the eventual user of the product. You don&#x27;t need to know what the end user needs. You need to know what the person in charge of buying wants, and that&#x27;s ultimately emotional validation, hope, a sense of &quot;innovating&quot;, a feeling of victory in pricing negotiations, being respected and treated well, and so forth. You can run them through the wringer with sales engineers and migrations after the contract is signed, and even if the end user and the product engineers recognize that your product is the wrong tool for the job, that won&#x27;t matter if the buying manager is emotionally satisfied with the transaction. People will bend over backwards to justify what they know is &quot;right.&quot;<p>A salesperson CEO will make more money, but will make the world a shittier place, because they&#x27;re the cotton candy of management. They&#x27;ll burn credibility and reputation in exchange for profit, kick the can down the road for someone else to clean up the mess later.<p>Sure, in a healthy, respectable, ethical, functional company, you&#x27;d be right, and the CEO would also be the best salesperson for the product, because they&#x27;d know it, and the customers, inside and out, and be able to explain and demonstrate exactly what was necessary and why, and justify all the costs and benefits.<p>This is a world that has Goodharted the measure of success - profit - and empowered people in the execution of shitty behavior. The market rewards higher profits and punishes &quot;failures,&quot; often completely out of sync with quality and merit.<p>We don&#x27;t live in a good world - companies that behave like you describe would be wonderful. We live in a thoroughly enshittified world, and a whole lot of people &quot;earning&quot; a whole lot of money are in between you and any meaningful change.<p>From Apple and Microsoft on down, companies want endless, infinitely increasing returns year over year, and they will do anything that isn&#x27;t explicitly illegal to get it. They&#x27;ll also do illegal things if the cost of getting caught is less than the profit earned. Alignment with end user needs, benefit to the consumer - these are far down the list of things meaningful to the systems and people making decisions on how money is spent. The job of a salesperson is to understand that system, and exploit it for the benefit of their company.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42693690" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42693690" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scarface_74</span><span>|</span><a href="#42690034">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42690458">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42690896">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42690613">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42693690">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42693690">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Engineers are in a better position to understand what the customer wants and needs<p>As an engineer, I had no idea about:<p>- what the utility companies wanted when I was working for a SaaS company  that printed and processed bills<p>- what the field service techs wanted when I was writing software for ruggedized windows ce devices<p>- what the railroad car owners or repairmen wanted when I was working for a company creating a SaaS (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;public.railinc.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;CRB_ProceduresManual.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;public.railinc.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;CRB...</a>)<p>- I knew nothing about what the healthcare industry needed in the three SaaS companies I worked for including software for health care workers dealing with special needs kids<p>- the various “enterprises” mostly in the edtech or state and local government space in consulting.</div><br/><div id="42694079" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42694079" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rezistik</span><span>|</span><a href="#42690034">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42693690">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42690613">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42694079">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42694079">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In all of your examples you&#x27;re working at a company, ideally the person running the company had that domain expertise.</div><br/><div id="42694369" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42694369" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ako</span><span>|</span><a href="#42690034">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42694079">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42690613">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42694369">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42694369">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No, the person running the company has expertise running companies.

It&#x27;s called a &quot;12v trigger.&quot;<p>THX introduced the trigger port to allow one amp to start other amps. Before that amps would have a 110V passthrough socket.<p>THX trigger is a mono 1&#x2F;8th inch &#x2F; 3.5mm TS plug. Each device usually has one 12V in and a 12V out. While it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;ll output 12V at up to 30mA[1]. Due to current fluctuation and the low max amp it&#x27;s recommended to use an opto-electronic isolator at the input.<p>THX originally introduced it to allow for home cinema surround. At the time commercially available amps only supported 2 channels, so the first THX systems had one receiver decoding the dolby signal, providing a line level output that you&#x27;d connect to multiple stereo amps. Due to the currents required the 110V passthrough wasn&#x27;t an option, so 12V trigger was born.<p>Before 12V trigger existed the IR&#x2F;Remote port, which allowed you to connect an external IR receiver to TVs, VHS recorders and Amps. This used the same plug, but would modulate the IR remote signal directly.<p>You could also use this to connect multiple devices and allow them to send remote control codes to one another. But that feature disappeared quickly due to limited compatibility.<p>In computers 12V trigger and remote ports inspired the I²C based DDC standard for VGA monitors, which allowed turning them on or off or changing settings. DVI and DisplayPort kept DDC as is, while HDMI expanded DDC into the CEC standard, which also allows controlling volume or sending media controls in a standardized way. Nowadays 12V trigger is mostly being replaced by HDMI CEC.<p>________________________<p>1.

Almost nobody is buying legitimate stereo systems anymore, and the ones that are out there (at almost any price) are mind-bogglingly incompetent. I&#x27;m shocked that Sonos is even a going concern at this point, although I suppose it is because of what I relate below.<p>The home-audio market is consolidated into a tiny number of manufacturers masquerading under once-proud brands they bought. The crippling incompetence of the products themselves is depressing.<p>A few years ago my Denon A&#x2F;V receiver crapped out and I decided to go &quot;upmarket&quot; and get an NAD T758. I accept a bit of quirkiness from a smaller name, but &quot;quirkiness&quot; doesn&#x27;t come close to describing the design and functionality defects that plagued this thing. Everything from baffling menu navigation (not kidding: Pressing Enter did not select a menu entry; you were supposed to use an arrow key) to the fact that it would only pass 720p video because it reported erroneous EDID info to HDMI devices. It didn&#x27;t pass the info from the connected display device; it just provided its own EDID blob to everything, which reported a max resolution of 720p.<p>The NAD also featured Dirac processing, which I shelled out for to get the full license and spent hours with a test mic profiling my room and speakers. Then... it would just lose the entire configuration. Deleted off the receiver. &quot;We haven&#x27;t been able to figure out why this happens,&quot; said NAD. In fact, in several years they never fixed a single one of the crippling defects I encountered and reported.<p>But NAD isn&#x27;t the only shitshow in town. Let me address the biggest impediment to whole-home audio (or even multi-zone audio): manufacturers&#x27; bizarre conceit that anyone can use secondary zones that only play ANALOG sources. The NAD was crippled by this stupidity, as is the top-of-the-line Pioneer I bought to replace it.<p>In the case of the NAD, I addressed this defect by running RCA cables across the back of the receiver, from its preamp outputs to a CD-player input; and assigning that input to Zone 2. Why the hell didn&#x27;t NAD just do that internally with a switch?<p>On the Pioneer, it&#x27;s actually worse. There ARE no preamp outputs. It has THREE zones, one of which I can tie to the main one but the third, yep, can only play analog sources.<p>All I want to do is play the same shit on ALL MY SPEAKERS. My living-room ones, my patio ones, and my backyard ones. All I need is A, B, and C speaker switches. But NOPE. As far as I can tell, nobody makes this. Nobody addresses the 99% use case for multiple &quot;zones.&quot; There are at least NINE AMPS in my receiver, but I can&#x27;t play the same source on three pairs of speakers.<p>BTW, I did build a patch bay with switches, to wire the secondary zone in parallel with the first... but this overloaded one pair of amps in the NAD and destroyed the entire receiver. Yep: NAD doesn&#x27;t have a simple overload breaker. They just burn the entire amplifier board up; that&#x27;s the breaker. Unfuckingbelievable.<p>But back to the main issue: Who is seriously going to dick around trying to select sources and adjust volume to each zone (with what, by the way, an app?) on one receiver instead of simply buying a bookshelf system for every remote room you want to play music in? I sure as shit wouldn&#x27;t, and I&#x27;m the kind of person who ran digital cables under my house to an equipment closet so I could have a proper surround setup in my living room. I have a projector and home-built screen, but even I would never bother with the stupid usage scenario Pioneer, NAD, and the two other makers envision:<p>This scenario revolves around nonexistent people who are going to put on a RECORD or TAPE, then go to the other side of their house or down to their rec room for half an hour... and then come running back to the other side of the house to flip the record or tape over.

Competition is.<p>Sonos has been around for many years now. When it launched, smartphones weren’t dominant. To control a Sonos you had to buy a controller specifically for it. It had its own wireless networking because WiFi wasn’t dominant. To use it with WiFi you needed to buy a separate bridge.<p>Online music services weren’t a thing like they are now. Music collections were on your local hard drive.<p>Back then the main competition for Sonos was paying a pro to hard-wire a speaker system into your house. I saw one of these about five years ago. Built into the wall in the kitchen was a cassette tape deck.<p>All that has changed. Now there are wireless speakers from JBL, Apple, Amazon, Bose, Google, and at least a dozen others. There’s Bluetooth. There’s AirPlay.<p>The Sonos app was ok for its time, but it’s an outdated model now. But at least the app used to be good at controlling Sonos. Now it’s not even great for that.<p>Without that outdated app model, there’s no reason to buy Sonos. Just pick from…anybody else. Many are cheaper and sound just as good. They don’t rely on an app, which is good-just use Airplay or Bluetooth.<p>As bad as the app is, it’s not a trigger of the decline of Sonos. Is just a symptom of it. The company has no future. Thus its release of headphones that don’t even integrate well with the Sonos system.

I have plenty of other things to nerd&#x2F;worry about and I just want my music to play.<p>I did have a period of instability after I moved some Sonos speakers around, and I must say their tech support was pretty good (this was maybe four years ago). They looked at my logs and told me it was a weak signal issue, which I thought was ridiculous and initially dismissed... but after digging some more and troubleshooting my home signals, it turns out they were right.<p>Old Sonos with old S1 app is still great for me! It really pains me to see how far they have fallen.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42694327" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42694327" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">leonseled</span><span>|</span><a href="#42689257">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42689291">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42689507">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42694327">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42694327">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">All this negative feedback had me second-guessing as well.

(I currently have to use the &quot;Sonos S1&quot; app because I have one older device that is not supported by the new app.)  It sounds good (to me) when everything is working, but honestly the reliability has never been that great.  After first buying it, I eventually learned that you <i>really</i> want to buy one of their &#x27;hubs&#x27; (the one I have is the Sonos Boost) and have that plugged into your wired ethernet network.  Otherwise, at least in my hands, things just don&#x27;t work very reliably.  (You can also, I am told, plug a single speaker into your wired network and achieve much the same effect, but for reasons it was easier for me to buy the Boost.)  But even now when you select a new song&#x2F;album&#x2F;playlist, it seems to take a weirdly long time for it to start playing and have the album art show up on the phone, and sometimes it just fails and you have to try again (the 2nd time almost always works, FWIW).  But it is really nice to have decent-sounding on-demand music throughout your home at the touch of a (few) button(s).  I hear that bluOS and HEOS are decent alternatives, but they don&#x27;t seem to be as popular as Sonos, and I&#x27;ve never seen a convincing demonstration that they would work better for me.  And of cource there&#x27;s the lock-in factor: Replacing all my Sonos equipment would be pricey at this point.  I used to get really mad about lack of cross-manufacturer interop when I was younger and poorer, but nowadays I&#x27;m willing to stomach it if it means that stuff just works.  But it&#x27;s continually irksome that equipment at these prices isn&#x27;t 100% glitch-free.</div><br/><div id="42690615" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42690615" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">javier2</span><span>|</span><a href="#42689257">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42689823">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42690547">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42690615">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42690615">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I got a bluOS device just as a networked amped for my 25 year old speakers.

Similarly, it needs to be zero setup for anyone else on my wifi network (wife, kids, friends). WiiM covers that perfectly.<p>Granted, there is some work there if you don&#x27;t already have speakers. I personally think Spotify is a great product. I just don&#x27;t want my speakers running an operating system. I have speakers as old as 25 years that work perfectly with the WiiM. No point in adding additional tech in a speaker that works perfectly as-is. My biggest worry (which Spotify has been pretty good about) is that the speakers work over WiFi and at some point, will be sunsetted.

Many millions of dollars are missing.<p>Banks have to follow strict rules to account for where all the money goes. But the way fintechs work, they usually just have one or a couple underlying &quot;FBO&quot; accounts where all the pooled money is held, but then the fintech builds a ledger on top of this (and, as the article points out, to varying levels of engineering competence) to track each individual customer&#x27;s balance within this big pool of money. In Synapse&#x27;s case, their ledger said the total amount of all of their individual customer balances ended up being much more than the actual funds held in the underlying FBO accounts. Lots of folks are assuming fraud but I&#x27;m willing to put money that it was just a shitty, buggy ledger.<p>FWIW, after seeing &quot;how the sausage is made&quot;, I would never put money into a fintech depository account. Use a real bank. Fintechs also often put out the fake promise that deposits are FDIC insured, but this only protects you if the underlying bank goes belly up, not if the fintech loses track of your money.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;zennonkapron&#x2F;2024&#x2F;11&#x2F;08&#x2F;what-the-yotta-saga-reveals-about-fintech-shortcomings&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;zennonkapron&#x2F;2024&#x2F;11&#x2F;08&#x2F;what-th...</a></div><br/><div id="42272258" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42272258" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">superzamp</span><span>|</span><a href="#42270266">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42270315">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42272258">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42272258">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Coincidentally written something about this yesterday [1], but the gist of my take summed up is that the nature of accounting oriented data models doesn’t help when dealing with multiple FBO accounts.<p>The main problem is that accounting defaults to full fungibility of monetary amounts represented in a ledger, which has the effect of losing track of the precise mapping between assets and liabilities, so you end up in a position where you simply cannot tell precisely to a bank _who_ are the actual customers they owe money to.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.formance.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;engineering&#x2F;warehousing-promises">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.formance.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;engineering&#x2F;warehousing-promis...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42270315" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42270315" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mrfox321</span><span>|</span><a href="#42270266">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42272258">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42271715">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42270315">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42270315">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">At a big co I worked at, the lack of consistency between trading systems caused money to (dis)appear (into)out of thin air.<p>Prior to one of these hiccups, I hypothesized, given how shitty the codebase was, that they <i>must</i> be tracking this stuff poorly.<p>This led to an argument with my boss, who assumed things magically worked.<p>Days later, we received an email announcing an audit one one of these accounting discrepancies.<p>JPMC proposed using crypto, internally, to consistently manage cash flow.<p>Not sure if it went anywhere.</div><br/><div id="42271731" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42271731" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">im3w1l</span><span>|</span><a href="#42270266">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42270315">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42270639">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42271731">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42271731">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If its for internal why not just use a normal append only log. x amount transferred from account y to account z.

Where before only Peter had a dollar (or a dollar IOU, which are supposedly the same), now Pere AND Steve, Steve2, up to SteveN all have a dollar IOU. This leads to an inflationary pressure.<p>Now it is true that upon the Catherine&#x27;s repaying of the debt, these extra dollars will go away. However, in reality there is no such thing as negative dollars. The supply of money has been increased by the bank.<p>An objection could be raised that Catherine&#x27;s extra demand for money to pay off her debt will exactly offset the extra supply of money. This is nonsense! Everyone demands money all the time. If Catherine did not demand money to pay off her loan, she would demand money in order to satisfy her next most urgent want which could be satisfied by money. The increase in the demand for money is negligible.</div><br/><div id="42271924" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42271924" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">namaria</span><span>|</span><a href="#42270266">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42271180">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42271299">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42271924">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42271924">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your mistake was saying Synapse merely did what banks do.

I never built a double entry accounting system but decades ago I did build a billing system for a internet&#x2F;telcom startup that grew to a modest 8 figures revenue.<p>By accident and not knowing any better as a young dev, I ended up building the billing logic from day one, and for better and worse building it in two places in the system (on a consumer-facing billing webpage, and on a separate backed process that generated invoices and charged credit cards.)<p>It turned out to be remarkably hard to keep them in sync.  We were constantly iterating trying to get traction as we burned down our capital, releasing new products and services, new ways of discounting and pricing (per use, per month, first X free, etc), features like masterpayer&#x2F;subaccounts for corporate accounts, user-assignable cost centers, tax allocation to those cost centers with penny allocation, etc such that new wrinkles and corner cases would keep popping up causing the numbers on my two screens&#x2F;methods not to match.<p>Being personally responsible for the billing, I would go over all the invoices by hand for a couple days each month to insure they matched before we charged the credit cards and mailed out printed invoices as a final check to prevent mistakes. There was always&#x2F;often some new problem I&#x27;d find affecting one or a small handful of customers which I would then fix the code before we billed. I never felt good letting go and not doublechecking everything by hand.<p>I thought about refactoring the billing logic to occur in one place to eliminate these mismatches and my manual crosschecking, but after a lot of thought I realized I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with a single codebase and liked having two codebases as it helped me catch my own errors. I then just made it easier and easier to run automate and crosschecks between the two.  The billing code was a little too gnarly to be proud of, but I was very proud of the outcome in how accurate our billing was, the lack of complaints and many near misses we avoided for many years. I do feel twinges of guilt for the complexity I left my successors but I still don&#x27;t really regret it.<p>After that experience, the motivation for double entry bookkeeping has always made a lot of sense to me.

The basic concept is Assets==Liability (plus Equity). Where positive Assets are entered on the left hand side (debit). And positive Liabilities are entered on the right hand side (credit). In accounting, debit and credit just means left and right.<p>1. Merchant takes out a loan for $5,000 and receives $5,000 in cash.
 • Assets (Cash) increase by $5,000 (Debit).
 • Liabilities (Loan Payable) increase by $5,000 (Credit).
 • Equity remains unchanged.<p>2. Merchant buys inventory for $1,000 cash.
 • Assets (Cash) decrease by $1,000 (Credit).
 • Assets (Inventory) increase by $1,000 (Debit).
 • Total assets remain unchanged, and liabilities and equity are unaffected.<p>3. Merchant sells all inventory for $1,500 cash.
 • Assets (Cash) increase by $1,500 (Debit).
 • Assets (Inventory) decrease by $1,000 (Credit) (recording cost of goods sold).
 • Equity (Retained Earnings) increases by $500 (Credit), representing the profit ($1,500 sales - $1,000 cost).<p>4. Customer1 deposits $500 in cash for future delivery of goods.
 • Assets (Cash) increase by $500 (Debit).
 • Liabilities (Unearned Revenue) increase by $500 (Credit).
 • Equity remains unchanged.<p>5. Customer1 transfers half of the future delivery of goods to Customer2.
 • No changes to assets, liabilities, or equity occur at this point. The merchant’s obligation to deliver goods (reflected as Unearned Revenue) is still $500 but now split between two customers (Customer1 and Customer2).

It was a constant source of annoyance when I was sole-trading for a bit, because what happened was something like this:<p>I&#x27;d be quoted a day-rate. That was what I was actually going to get paid, one day. But then I&#x27;d be told to bill it as an hourly rate. And then actually to bill it as 7.5 hours.<p>But I wasn&#x27;t <i>told</i> what the hourly was - the hourly was whatever my day rate was, divided by 7.5. So this led to the problem that it produced an irrational number as a result.<p>Technically this should&#x27;ve been fine...except no one I dealt with knew or cared about this concept - they all used Excel. So if I rounded the irrational to nearest upper cent (since that&#x27;s the smallest unit which could be paid) they complained it didn&#x27;t add up. If I added a &quot;correction item&quot; to track summing up partial cents, they complained it wasn&#x27;t part of the hourly.<p>In the end I just send python decimal.Decimal to maximum precision, flowed through invoices with like 8 digits of precision on the hourly rate, and this seemed to make Excel happy enough. Of course it was completely useless for tracking purposes - i.e. no one would ever be able to pay or unpay 0.666666666667 cents.<p>Because what&#x27;s not in employment contracts that really should be? Any discussion on how numbers are to be rounded in the event of uneven division. You just get to sort of guess what accounting may or may not be doing. In my case of course it didn&#x27;t matter - no one was ever going to hold me to anything other the day rate, just for some reason they wanted to input tiny fractions of a cent which they actually couldn&#x27;t track.<p>And it&#x27;s not an idle problem either: i.e. in the case of rounding when it comes to wages, <i>should</i> it be against the employee?

If you go back to early Silk Road and Mtgox you can see some shocking things. Like the founders were posting questions on Stackoverflow about database basics. They then ended up building systems with race conditions (withdrawal code for both systems.)<p>See, if you&#x27;re an engineer (from a web background) you might think that using a regular backend language with a relational DB would be fine. But this service is typically optimized for concurrency. That might sound amazing. But what you really want is a simple queue. This ensures everything is applied in order and makes it impossible to accidentally have transactions execute on stale state. Plus, a queue can be executed amazingly fast -- we&#x27;re talking Nasdaq scales. If you use a standard DB you&#x27;ll end up doing many horrible broken hacks to simulate what would be trivial engineering had you used the right design from the start.<p>You&#x27;ve got other things to worry about, too. Financial code needs to use integer math for everything. Floating point and &#x27;decimals&#x27; lead to unexpected results. The biggest complexity with running large-scale blockchain services is having to protect &#x27;hot wallets.&#x27; Whenever an exchange or payment system is hacked the target is always the funds that sit on the server. When the industry began there were still many ways to protect the security of these hot wallets. The trouble is: it required effort to implement and these protocols weren&#x27;t widely known. So you would get drive-by exchanges that handled millions of dollars with private keys sitting on servers ready to be stolen...<p>Today there are many improvements for security. New cryptographic constructs like threshold ECDSA, hardware wallets, hardware key management (like enclaves), smart contract systems (decentralized secret sharing... and even multi-sig can go a long way), and designs that are made to be decentralized that remove the need for a centralized deposit system (still needs some level of centralization when trading to a stable coin but its better than nothing.)<p>I would say the era where people &#x27;build&#x27; ledgers though is kind of over. To me it appears that we&#x27;re organizing around a super-node structure where all the large &#x27;apps&#x27; handle their own changes off-chain (or alternatively based on regular trust.) The bottom layer will still support payments but it will be used less often. With more transaction activity happening on layers above. I think its still important to scale the chain and make it as secure as possible. Bitcoin has a unique focus here on security above everything else. Making it ideal for long-term hedges. For every day stuff I can&#x27;t think of any chains that have more credible R &amp; D than Ethereum. They seem to even have been doing research on the P2P layer now which traditionally no one has cared about.</div><br/><div id="42270438" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42270438" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thaumasiotes</span><span>|</span><a href="#42270310">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42269965">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42270438">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42270438">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Financial code needs to use integer math for everything.

Airports already require a lot of land for handling a relatively small number of passengers. As building additional runways is often not feasible, the only way to increase passenger capacity is using bigger aircraft.<p>I fly between Helsinki and London often enough. On that route, the aircraft is typically either an A320 or an A350.</div><br/><div id="38360639" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38360639" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jillesvangurp</span><span>|</span><a href="#38354413">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38354540">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38360639">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38360639">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s true for big airplanes. Small ones need a lot less runway. Which means they can land at smaller airports. Some of the electrical VTOL planes under development currently don&#x27;t need airports at all and can take off from pretty much any flat surface.<p>The size of jet planes is dictated by fuel cost. Fuel is expensive. Large planes expend it more efficiently. But they are also loud and pollute. So people don&#x27;t like them too close to where they live. When you use fuel by the thousands of liters per flight, it starts to add up in terms of cost. It&#x27;s also why private jets are only for rich people. They burn hundreds of liters of expensive fuel per flight. Add to that the maintenance and staffing and you are looking at eye watering amounts per flight.<p>Hydrogen is of course not cheap currently but it might drop in price substantially as renewable energy gets cheaper. At that point a few smaller planes might be cost competitive with a larger jet fueled plane. But still, there are lots of logistical challenges related to getting large quantities of hydrogen to fuel planes. I doubt it will be very economical or practical any time soon.<p>My pet theory is actually that most short haul flight will shift to small, autonomous, electrical planes. They&#x27;ll wipe out three of the largest cost factors in aviation: fuel, staffing, and  maintenance cost (much less complex mechanical systems). They&#x27;ll fly point to point rather than hub to hub; or at least tiny airport close to your origin to tiny airport close to your destination. If you want to fly further, you can just chain a few hops. It will work like an uber pretty much.<p>Inter continental flight is a different challenge. At least short term it&#x27;s not feasible to do that with battery electric. Synthetic fuels and hydrogen look promising for that. But I wouldn&#x27;t discount electric for that either long term. If battery breakthroughs keep on happening and we get some fancy solid state batteries delivering 2000 watt per kg or so, that whole game changes as well.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38354540" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38354540" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stuart8ol</span><span>|</span><a href="#38354413">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38360639">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38357355">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38354540">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38354540">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah there will be some slot constrained routes that will certainly need to stick to the larger aircraft sizes, but many that can benefit from the flexibility of a smaller aircraft size if the operating cost was low enough.

What we do have is an opportunity to be much quieter, but there is always a penalty to pay in terms of size. For example, unlike a battery aircraft, we still have to provide the fuel cells with air and we can do that with large quiet ducts or small noisy ones - but larger ones take up valuable real estate and ultimately add weight to the system.

Direct combustion gets you a much greater specific power of propulsion, and the technology for turbine engines is so optimised that it sounds like a really attractive option. We expect we can get higher efficiency with fuel cells and the engine maintenance costs will be lower as fuel cells and electric motors operate at low temperature. Both of these cost drivers lead to a lower CASM.</div><br/><div id="38357708" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38357708" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">genman</span><span>|</span><a href="#38354402">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38354483">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38359830">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38357708">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38357708">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have seen claimed that the system with battery powered electric engine would become practically maintenance free.

Turbine blades are intrinsically expensive, made of titanium and operate at high temperatures under high loads. Electric motors have much simpler operation and when made at scale, can really benefit from a replace after 20,000 hours model, instead of a overhaul every 1800 hours, with 200hrs inspection intervals, which we see in some turboprop engines. Fuel cells and batteries are much the same, replace after a certain life, and with built in tolerance to failures. Unfortunately, with fuel cells, as opposed to batteries, we still have some balance of plant that will need maintained, compressors for example, however unlike a turbine engine, they don&#x27;t operate at high temperatures and are a smaller part of the system, so we can design for much longer lifetimes that you can get away with in a turboprop. All this leads us to estimating 65% saving on engine maintenance. Battery electric companies are going after more like a 90% saving.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38359830" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38359830" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fakedang</span><span>|</span><a href="#38354402">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38355711">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38359830">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38359830">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are you the guys from Australia who were asking about Aerospace opportunities as an Australian company here on HN some time back?</div><br/><div id="38359954" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38359954" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stuart8ol</span><span>|</span><a href="#38359830">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38355711">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38359954">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38359954">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No that wouldn&#x27;t have been us.

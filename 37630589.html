Mark Twain &amp; Thoreau grew up definitely not in the upper class. Same for Nathaniel Hawthorne.<p>Dostoyevsky was not from wealth<p>Mary Shelley was wealthy. Jane Austen &amp; Emily Dickinson were upper class - but not wealthy. But neither were highly successful during their lifetimes. The Bronte sisters were somewhat well off - less so than Austen and Dickinson - but not from a long-line of wealth, and even they weren&#x27;t very successful in their lifetime!<p>Tolstoy AFAIK was the only super successful independently wealthy writer from the time. Poe, Melville, Henry James, and Victor Hugo were definitely well off, but &quot;wealthy&quot; seems like a stretch.<p>If you look at today - it is definitely not true. JK Rowling is by far the most successful author of the generation, and she was arguably poor before finding success with Harry Potter.<p>Suzanne Collins worked her way up from the bottom and had very middle class life before success with The Hunger Games.<p>Maybe you mean the majority of authors have not-poor spouses?

I donât write that reading cotton-candy fiction is bad, but it could be read as implying it. Itâs not bad, itâs just that itâs also not <i>better</i> than a bunch of other activities <i>just because</i> itâs reading. Most reading that happens (the optional reading, anyway) isnât some lofty activity thatâs a ton âbetterâ than, say, watching TV. <i>And that is ok</i>.<p>&gt; Then self-esteem is tied to that activity and now that by default means its more prestigous or intellectual or important or what have you.<p>Iâm sure motivations vary, but I definitely get a sense of insecurity behind a lot of the âlook at me, Iâm a <i>reader</i>! You should be a reader too, reading makes you better!â stuff. Which, fine, whatever, but Iâm sure there are a few folks out there who buy that messaging while <i>not</i> managing to get into reading for pleasure, and who feel bad about it, but they really shouldnât. <i>Can</i> you truly expand your horizons and, maybe even, a little, become a better person through reading or whatever else it is that people suppose reading does thatâs good for you? Yeah, I think so. Iâd agree with that. I think Iâve gotten a lot of good out of many books Iâve read. Is that what most folks are up to most of the time theyâre reading? LOL no. Whatâs got more viewers, the latest sublime, expertly crafted, dense, soul-scouring, literary-and-literate gem of a Cannes darling (âand this oneâs <i>really</i> good, I swear, itâs not just award baitâ), or the latest Marvel movie? How many who watch the latter will watch a <i>single</i> film this year that really demands their full attention and yields more and more good Zen food (if you will) the harder you interrogate it? Not many. Readingâs the same. Which is Ok!<p>&gt; For what it&#x27;s worth, I think a book can still be improving even if its written in simplistic language and grammer because a book has the ability to tell a story from another humans perspective. We all lack that ability and I think we all could use a bit more empathy in our lives.<p>One of my sins in this thread is that Iâve been sloppy with implying âhard-to-read languageâ means âgood bookâ. To be clear, I definitely donât think a book must be good if the language is complex or âelevatedâ, and I donât think all good books have complex language. I do think some excellent books with complex or elevated language couldnât be much simplified without doing them great violenceâthat they really needed the complexity, by which I donât necessarily mean opaque <i>Finneganâs Wake</i> stuff, but maybe just something a tad trickier than Goosebumps. What I <i>do</i> think is that really good books are <i>usually</i> harder to read, and harder to appreciate, in some sense, than the average airport novel, but that can be because a bunch of what theyâre doing has to do with things many readers arenât tuned-in to (theme, careful word choice that youâll miss if youâre not reading closely, really subtle character work, that kind of thing), or because it assumes certain background reading has been done to get the full effect, or something of that sortâand maybe, but not necessarily, also because it includes sentences with multiple clauses, and more-than-rarely employs paragraphs longer than a quarter-page with little repetition or restatement of context, in which youâll get lost if youâre used to skimming.<p>Meanwhile, I genuinely love a few picture books that canât have more than a few hundred words each, and think theyâre truly great. Can they do as much as a stompinâ big novel? Can they do the same things? Nah, but I mean hell, how many stuffy literature teachers have assigned <i>Le Petit Prince</i>? More than zero, and with good reason. Iâll gladly read <i>Madeline</i> solo, slowly, drinking in the words and pictures, and kinda meditate on lifeâthat thingâs a whole <i>mood</i>. Good shit. Not everything with simple language is bad, and nothingâs bad <i>just because</i> the language is simple.<p>â¦ and, just because this threadâs been a mess in part due to my sloppiness, the above is not intended as some exhaustive exploration of all the ways and for-whom a book might be either good or bad.

Of course that isnât strictly tied to age (though there will be a certain correlation).<p>I just mean that most adult fiction reading is adults reading YA because they want something easy that they <i>donât</i> need to think much while reading, that <i>doesnât</i> challenge them, often to the point of being written in the first person because itâs harder to track context in 3rd, and harder to orient oneself within a 3rd person narrative voice (not to overstate the difficulty, but it does require closer attention and asks more of the readerâand Iâm not joking or pulling this out of no-where, ask some readers, ask some editors, ask some agents, enough of the market considers 3rd too hard to read and will skip books that arenât in 1st, itâs a real consideration in planning a book). Or reading bodice-rippers literally written from a template (you donât put out five novels a year without some effort toward developing <i>efficiency</i>). Or re-reading their favorite Harry Potter book for the sixth time.<p>What would I suggest instead? Anything else thatâs not very challenging and passes the time pleasurably! Watch a reality show or whatever. The latest Netflix drama. Play some Super Mario Bros. These folks arenât working their way up to âbetterâ literature, theyâre just having a good time. Which is ok!<p>Again, itâs not a <i>problem</i> that the activity is low-value if thatâs what someone wants. Itâs fine and normal to want easy entertainment, at least sometimes. Lots of adults read exclusively or almost-exclusively for that kind of low-effort entertainment, and <i>that is OK</i>. They donât need to replace it with reading <i>War and Peace</i> or doing calculus problem sets or something. Those are probably âbetterâ activities if your goal is improvement, assuming youâre ready for those kind of things. But that doesnât need to be your goal, and itâs ok if thatâs not what someoneâs looking for in the books they read.<p>According to what sells, most people just want an easy story with few or no words they hadnât learned by junior high, and a narrative thatâs clear and leaves little to inference (and certainly doesnât <i>rely</i> on it!) They want short sentences, that donât force them to keep much context on their head.<p>They arenât working their way up to works that might stretch their abilities, theyâre looking for books comfortably within their existing abilities. <i>And that is OK</i>. But the notion that reading may take place thatâs about as low-value as trash TV, and that <i>thatâs probably the majority of adult reading</i>, seems to bother some enough that they want to paint reading as <i>per se</i> virtuous, valuable, et c. Meanwhile, itâs not any more so than listening to music is. Two people listen to several thousand hours of music, one comes out the other end able to hum <i>Mmm Bop</i> by Hansen, and thatâs about the extent of what they took away; the other is familiar with the song and can also tell you how its rhythm is connected to Senegalese folk music and the harmonies reminiscent of early French polyphonic choral hymns. The music-listening wasnât <i>per se</i> equally valuable from the widening-oneâs-horizon perspective, <i>but both may have enjoyed themselves</i>. Whatâs weird is deciding to plaster âMUSIC LISTENERâ on your tote bag as if that by itself means anythingâfor either of these subjects, really.<p>That so many folks end up with a fairly low reading level, as adults, is telling: if they remain readers regardless, as many do, theyâre probably avoiding works that might force them to get better at it, or else surely theyâd markedly improve over <i>decades</i>. I donât think itâs a coincidence that most folks also stop getting much better at math around 7th or 8th grade, itâs just that for whatever reason we see admitting that as Ok and admitting to being a poor reader as nearly unthinkable. I think thatâs about the time both get really uncomfortable for a lot of kids, and they realize they can just <i>stop</i> and skate by on what they have, and theyâre not really wrong. I donât think most of them who nonetheless enjoy reading are working toward tougher books any more than I think someone who likes sudoku puzzles is working toward solving PDEs.

Albeit for me, it&#x27;s because these books are challenging on a craft&#x2F;architectural level.<p>The Spear Cuts Through Water by Simon Jimenez is a time travel story, kind of, through the lens of a descendant of the protagonists of the main novel, kind of. It&#x27;s a fantastical ancient story told to a descendant by an aging relative in relatively modern day, and while that story is told it is also told to the reader as if it&#x27;s actually happening, and then timelines are crossed over.<p>The Saint of Bright Doors by Vajra Chandrasekera is about a guy who starts a support group for the almost-chosen-- people who, by happenstance, weren&#x27;t chosen by prophecies. Like literally it&#x27;s like &quot;yeah, so my sister was chosen to herald the apocalypse, but I still have visions of angels and I have to drink myself to sleep&quot;, &quot;yeah, my cousin was chosen to kill my godfather, I&#x27;m just stuck with chainsaws for hands&quot;. But it&#x27;s much more dissociated, and much more unattached-- and the reason for this becomes clear at the very end.<p>I recently finished The Archive Undying by Emma Meiko Candon. That book is full of characters with ambiguous identities, characters with ambiguous motives-- everyone is hiding who they are from everyone else, not in a murder mystery way but in a complex conspiracy format where everyone actually has their own mini-conspiracy going on. Of course this is in the context of &quot;giant mech-god corpse is being resurrected to fight mech-god monsters&quot;, so there&#x27;s a fundamental awesomeness. But, y&#x27;know, when god-AIs can jack into your brain, or connect brains to each other, or jack into each other, the story can no longer hold linearity in an easy sip read.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37650132" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37650132" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zaphod12</span><span>|</span><a href="#37649187">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37649389">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37649219">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37650132">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37650132">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">hmm, I know people brag about books they haven&#x27;t actually read, but Book #3 of the Atlas Series is not out until January.

This change was prompted by my desire to experiment with high-end hardware and a 4K multi-monitor setup in a tiled environment. Surprisingly, the switch turned out to be a game-changer, boosting my productivity significantly, with around 90% of my tasks now occurring in the terminal. Traditional criticisms of terminals, such as memorization challenges and lack of guidance, no longer apply, thanks to modern features like auto-completion, interactive history, suggestions, and plugins like Git integration.

I went that route for a while. What this misses, however, is that the biggest problem with the desktop interface is that we&#x27;ve substantially increased application complexity and laptops (and even smaller devices) won. As a result, we&#x27;re trying to answer the question &quot;how we fit our skeuomorphic paradigm in a diminutive form factor&quot;. The inspiration involved much larger actual desks and tables where you can freely arrange several documents that are each visible and can be reached at a glance. If you&#x27;re maximizing the window for a document for reasons beyond helping you focus, then your workspace <i>ahem</i> your screen is too small.<p>The screenshot is 1920x1080. Screens are sold using buzzwords like &#x27;HD&#x27;, &#x27;UHD&#x27;, and &#x27;retina&#x27; that evoke a sense of image clarity. I spent years telling my dad that I liked higher resolutions because it meant more &#x2F;space&#x2F; and he couldn&#x27;t grasp what I meant. He was stuck on associating higher resolution with clarity until I bought him a 43&quot; 4k monitor, and he used it for a while. Even at 1.5x scaling, suddenly, he was able to view multiple pages of a document clearly at the same time without even scrolling. This isn&#x27;t at all a normal desktop setup or the kind of setup that desktop environments are optimizing for or advocating.

A 4k monitor is much better, but at normal desktop sizes it is still inferior to printed paper, so for big monitors even better resolutions are needed to recreate the same experience that has been available for hundreds of years when reading printed books. A 4k monitor can match the retina resolution only for very small screens or for desktop monitors seen from a great distance, much greater than a normal work distance.<p>Similarly, any non-stupid drawing applications must not specify any dimensions in pixels, but in proper length units or in units relative to the dimensions of the screen or of the windows, and then the sizes will be the same everywhere, but all graphical elements will be more beautiful on a 4k monitor.<p>This was already elementary knowledge more than 30 years ago, and recommended since the most ancient versions of X Window System and MS Windows. I do not even know when this modern &quot;fractional scaling&quot; junk problem has appeared and who is guilty of it.<p>I have switched to using only 4k monitors with my desktops and laptops, on all of which I use Linux (with XFCE), about a decade ago, and during all this time I never had any kind of scaling problems, except with several professional (!!) applications written in Java by incompetent programmers, which not only ignore the system settings, so they show pixel-sized windows and fonts, but they also do not have any option for choosing another font or at least another font size (so much for the &quot;run anywhere&quot; claim of Java).</div><br/><div id="37453535" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37453535" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kaba0</span><span>|</span><a href="#37451592">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37453393">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37452384">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37453535">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37453535">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Now try 2 screens with different pixel densities.

It would have been better if pixels would have never been exposed in any graphics APIs after the introduction of scalable font rendering and scalable drawing, removing thus any future scaling problems, but it was tempting to provide them to enable optimizations, especially during times when many were still using very low resolution VGA displays.<p>However such optimizations are typically useless, because they optimize an application only for the display that happens to be used by the developer, not for the display of the final user.

There are about 10 apps I use regularly, and they launch and get bound to a particular workspace on startup. My screen remains uncluttered, with one app filling the viewport, and a single keystroke to switch to the other apps I use.  It&#x27;s pretty close to perfect for my use cases.<p>Lastly, these WMs are all configured through text files, so your exact configuration can be stored in dot files in git.  In my case I use Nix, so I can redeploy my exact setup on any machine without any manual configuration.</div><br/><div id="37452358" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37452358" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">0x38B</span><span>|</span><a href="#37451316">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37451955">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37452358">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37452358">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sway is fast, minimal, and flexible.

Those face a really hard problem. It took too many years to get 3D CAD and drawing up to a tolerable level. 
Selection in a cluttered 3D environment took a long time to solve.
Most user-level GUIs are addressing a far simpler problem.<p>I&#x27;d just like to have borders back. They don&#x27;t have to be big, or shadowed. Just present. I&#x27;m tired of overlapping borderless consoles in Ubuntu.
Of web sites where there&#x27;s a scrollable area with no border. Multiple scrollable areas with no border, as with Discord. Buttons with no indication of the live area. This stuff is borrowed from phones, but does not scale well to larger screens and more controls.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37450952" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37450952" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pengaru</span><span>|</span><a href="#37451130">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37450952">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37450952">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s quite the wall of text I won&#x27;t be reading...</div><br/><div id="37451077" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37451077" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MrVandemar</span><span>|</span><a href="#37450952">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37451077">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37451077">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Put it in reader-mode and up the line-height.

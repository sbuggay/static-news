It doesn&#x27;t have emotions, it has interlocking sets of incentives (sales bonus plans, executive compensation based on beating last quarter&#x27;s numbers, etc) which collectively and incrementally nudge the behavior of their employees towards unethical shortcuts. This tendency can be temporarily reined in by regulations, civil suits, strong-willed executives and employees, or a company culture that prizes integrity and longer-term results. When those restraints don&#x27;t apply strongly enough, this behavior kicks in.

Certainly no longer than 50 years.<p>Of course there is no reason, but 10 years seems about right to me for all of them.

Sure, then their own 10 year old versions would appear as a competition to Adobe, and that would hurt a lot compared to the current situation, but then it is their job to be better. Etc. How do all of this benefit the society?<p>Copyright laws were created originally by the society to support artists and research, but they are way too long, mostly are just used for rent-seeking, and they restrict our lives.

Bootstrapping a business is a lot of work. It can be years before you earn even a paltry sum. A good chunk of that 10 years is spent earning nothing.

I also don&#x27;t see how investing in the creation of something that others find valuable is &quot;rent-seeking&quot;. You&#x27;re completely free to ignore that body of work. Nothing is restricting you from creating your own.<p>You see the free exchange of art without remuneration in this hypothetical future as a way to drive down costs.

It&#x27;s an invented legal restriction we put on ourselves. Copyright is an imposition on some very basic freedoms, we just all agree that some amount of imposition is worth it to support artists and their art. Art is so valuable to us that we censor ourselves for it.<p>What I&#x27;m seeing with our current copyright system is that it&#x27;s hurting a lot more than it&#x27;s helping. Artists are routinely getting screwed over by large corporations, while other artists are silenced entirely. Amazing creative works are prevented from being brought into the world, and have been prevented from even being preserved.

A key difference between today and the two thousand years that came before is you can make a perfect replica of the source material. Selling a bit-for-bit copy of a song or book is fundamentally different than oral traditions of story telling or an acoustic cover of a popular song.<p>I&#x27;m not saying copyright is perfect. DMCA takedowns for songs playing in the background of live newsworthy events or video game play throughs aren&#x27;t helping the author&#x2F;creator. Legal battles over songs that coincidentally sound the same are silly to me as well.<p>I&#x27;m less sold on the value of remixing art. It can be done well, but often feels like a lazy attempt at capitalizing on the original creation.<p>We don&#x27;t have to agree on any of that. The person I was replying to seemed to be making the argument that copyright terms were bad because he&#x2F;she&#x2F;they wanted to buy a copy of whatever on the open market where hypothetically everything is public domain. I can&#x27;t comprehend the level of entitlement that leads to someone saying they should have free access to another person&#x27;s work and then claims without evidence that this will spur innovation or creativity. To me, it seems clear the lack of copyright would just rapidly accelerate the decline of the humanities. Artists struggle enough. The patron model of the Renaissance is gone. The modern day minstrel can&#x27;t afford rent and food. Copyright is central to how they earn a living and about the only protection they have against parasites that add nothing from taking everything.<p>I&#x27;m all for revisiting and revising modern copyright law. I just think tossing it all together is going to hurt society. Whatever new duration we choose should reflect the reality of just how long it can take to build a business&#x2F;following&#x2F;audience. Ten years seems way too short; I see artists deciding the risk:reward ratio makes it not worthwhile.<p>Maybe that means only the &quot;true&quot; artists will persist, but my experience with open source software suggests otherwise. There&#x27;s some remarkable open source software out there given away freely by volunteers, but there&#x27;s also a whole body of software that benefits society that only gets written because the rights holder can afford to make an investment that volunteers can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t.

There is one oddity in the US which is that Section 203 of the Copyright Act grants the author of a work the right to cancel &quot;the exclusive or nonexclusive grant of a transfer or license of copyright or of any right under a copyright&quot; up to thirty-five years after the grant or transfer occurred (only applicable to works not created &quot;for hire&quot;). So you could argue under that until 35 years have elapsed the work isn&#x27;t truly in the public domain because the original author of the work has the statutory right to reclaim its copyright.<p>That said, could the author here have used Section 203 to revoke DC&#x27;s license? I see section 203 requires that &quot;Notices of termination may be served no earlier than 25 years after the execution of the grant or, if the grant covers the right of publication, no earlier than 30 years after the execution of the grant or 25 years after publication under the grant (whichever comes first).&quot;<p>So maybe the author could have waited a few more years and done that?</div><br/></div></div><div id="37522164" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37522164" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kibwen</span><span>|</span><a href="#37521069">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37521839">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37523680">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37524571">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37522164">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37522164">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The other way around.

The only thing I&#x27;m aware of in US law is that you have to make some kind of &#x27;overt act&#x27;, which just means you have to actually intend to make something public domain. I think posting two Substack posts detailing contractual breaches and bad faith at DC as motivation qualifies.<p>Germany and Japan don&#x27;t recognize public domain dedications in the law. However, this isn&#x27;t a German or Japanese creator we&#x27;re talking about - Bill Willingham is American. And <i>generally speaking</i>, the Berne Convention is just a promise to treat other countries&#x27; copyrights the same as your country would, not an obligation to provide more copyright to foreign works than domestic ones[0]. I doubt Germany is going to ultimately enforce copyright that has already evaporated in America, especially on behalf of DC, a party that doesn&#x27;t actually own the copyright in question and only has an exclusive license.<p>What&#x27;s really going to complicate this is the nature of the agreement between Bill and DC. DC could argue that an exclusive license is equivalent to copyright transfer. Copyright is corporate Calvinball, so we could see American courts trying to roll back the public domain dedication purely for the sake of submission to monied interests. I could see all sorts of stupid arguments being adopted by judges that want to see DC win and artists lose:<p>- Well <i>actually</i>, he was trying to revert rights from DC by making his work public domain, but he didn&#x27;t follow the notice period requirements, so the dedication is null and void<p>- Well <i>actually</i>, the publishing agreement constitutes an effective copyright transfer, so he&#x27;s just releasing DC of their obligations to him, so DC now owns Fables in perpetuity<p>- Well <i>actually</i>, Bill Willingham didn&#x27;t draw the art[1], so you can&#x27;t put Fables on Project Gutenberg, Standard Ebooks, or Wikimedia Commons, all you can do is have all the male characters in your folklore be one man named &#x27;Jack&#x27; and nothing more<p>As far as I&#x27;m aware, &quot;artist burns down the copyright on their work to moot a publishing agreement&quot; is uncharted legal territory. How any of these arguments would fare would depend on the exact text of the DC Comics publishing agreement Bill signed, which isn&#x27;t public, and Bill probably can&#x27;t proactively publish it. If he can, he should. Otherwise you&#x27;d only learn how much he can actually disclaim iff you get sued by DC and are able to bring the contract into the scope of discovery, which isn&#x27;t exactly guaranteed.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rule_of_the_shorter_term" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rule_of_the_shorter_term</a><p>[1] Copyright is not only viral, but also <i>leprotic</i>: every new instance of creativity accrues a separate copyright on that part of the work that is owned by that creator insamuch as it can be separated from the whole.

such disgracefully unethical ways as to make the bargain worthless.
There are honest, small publishers out there, but sadly they&#x27;re a
dwindling pool.<p>It is also pleasant to read such a mildly written yet firm account of
&quot;the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back&quot;. I am very interested in
&#x27;thresholds&#x27; as part of system dynamics, for example in flocking,
public movements and revolutions. Single actor tipping points such as
Rosa Parks taking a &quot;white&quot; seat are fascinating from a technical,
cultural and systematic view.<p>I sense we have moved from a general &quot;anti-capitalism&quot; to some even
more powerful latent undercurrents in tech, where disaffection with
big-tech and surveillance capitalism is poised... for what exactly I
don&#x27;t know. But somewhere out there is a smart, mischievous hacker who
will sow the seminal event. Well done to you Bill Willingham.</div><br/><div id="37520512" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37520512" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">raybb</span><span>|</span><a href="#37520340">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37531484">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37520512">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37520512">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wouldn&#x27;t call Rosa Parks a single actor.<p>&gt; In shorter words, Miss Rosa Parks&#x27;s decision to stay in a forward seat was the first move in a planned boycott of the bus company and the city law, a campaign organised long before by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and run by a young, bland, handsome black parson, name of Martin Luther King Jr, who while I was in Montgomery, flew in from Atlanta twice a week to buy little vans for use by the boycotters.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;2008&#x2F;oct&#x2F;04&#x2F;9" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;2008&#x2F;oct&#x2F;04&#x2F;9</a></div><br/><div id="37520564" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37520564" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">raybb</span><span>|</span><a href="#37520340">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37520512">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37520612">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37520564">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37520564">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">On that note, I&#x27;ll just mention I think that I read a short book called &quot;Mutual Aid&quot; by Dean Spade that really gave me some more ideas for what a world looks like where communities are really taking care of each other and don&#x27;t have so much emphasis on doing everything yourself.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openlibrary.org&#x2F;works&#x2F;OL20892439W&#x2F;Mutual_Aid" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openlibrary.org&#x2F;works&#x2F;OL20892439W&#x2F;Mutual_Aid</a></div><br/><div id="37520657" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37520657" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nonrandomstring</span><span>|</span><a href="#37520340">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37520564">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37520612">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37520657">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37520657">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great share, Thanks.

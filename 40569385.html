You have assumed that the ideal situation is to use all of the chips in your collection.  A better solution is to ask, what is the most playable breakdown for the poker games I am playing.  If I am playing 25c&#x2F;50c no limit hold&#x27;em with 8 players... and a typical buy-in of $20 per player... as an experienced poker host at these limits, I maintain that the ideal breakdown is:
12x 25c
12x $1
1x $5<p>If you have a set with 100x of white, blue, red, green, etc... your total number of chips used for 8 players is:
96x white (25c)
96x blue ($1)
8x red ($5)<p>If players lose all of their chips... they can re-buy with $5 (red) chips and make change from the players that have all of the lower denomination chips.<p>What I have proposed above is a proper solution if you want to play poker.</div><br/><div id="40577217" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40577217" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Raidion</span><span>|</span><a href="#40577161">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40578365">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40577217">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40577217">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Also an experienced poker player, and this is 100% correct.<p>Ideally you want to use common casino chip colors (though these are somewhat fungible) and just shift orders of magnitudes.<p>If 1BI is 20 bucks, you can make it equivalent to a $200 BI at the casino, which really only uses 2 colors 95% of the time: whites for 1 dollar, reds for $5. Deeper games might need a $25 (green) or even $100 (black chip). So whites in your home game are 10c, reds are 50c, greens are $2.50, blacks $10.</div><br/><div id="40578198" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40578198" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ryandrake</span><span>|</span><a href="#40577161">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40577217">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40578365">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40578198">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40578198">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As someone who has run many, many home games, including cash and tournaments, also consider how easy it is to stack a fresh buy-in. Having 6 of one color, 5 of another, 3 of another, 8 of the next... Yuck. Many ways to make a mistake. If I&#x27;m doing a tournament where the starting small blind is 25, then I&#x27;m going to ALWAYS use:<p><pre><code>    8 qty 25 chips = 200
    8 qty 100 chips = 800
    4 qty 500 chips = 2000
    N qty 1000 chips = N000, where N controls how much the starting stack is.
</code></pre>
When I&#x27;m preparing a bunch of new stacks, I mostly just have to deal with stacks 4 or 8 high, which can be measured next to each other in under a second. Also, the first two colors add up to 1000 exactly, and the first three colors add up to 3000 exactly, simplifying the math. Also, standard chip racks hold stacks of 20 chips, so the first three colors can be pre-built and stored in the racks. If I&#x27;m doing a cash game, with $0.25&#x2F;$0.50 blinds, I use the same formula as above, but divide by 100. Just as easy.<p>For a $1&#x2F;$2 cash game, I&#x27;m going to ALWAYS use:<p><pre><code>    20 qty $1 chips = $20, for blinds
    N qty $5 chips for the rest of the buy-in
</code></pre>
And that&#x27;s it. Since again, standard chip racks hold stacks of 20 chips, these can be set up in seconds. Later in the game, we can break out the $25 chips.<p>Also +1 to using &quot;standard&quot; casino chip colors. In the US, $1 is almost always white, $5 is almost always red, $25 is almost always green, $100 is almost always black, and so on. Don&#x27;t confuse people.<p>Buy your chip set based on how you allocate your chips when playing, don&#x27;t allocate your chips based on whatever chip set you happen to have.</div><br/><div id="40578425" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40578425" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">banannaise</span><span>|</span><a href="#40577161">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40578198">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40578365">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40578425">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40578425">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m never going to have 500s and 1000s in the same chip set, but in that case you just fill it out with 500s and introduce a larger denomination chip if you&#x27;re playing deep stacks.</div><br/><div id="40579834" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40579834" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ryandrake</span><span>|</span><a href="#40577161">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40578425">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40578365">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40579834">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40579834">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yep, totally valid option to leave out the $1000s.

This group has gotten optimal breakdowns for various games (from 5¢&#x2F;10¢ up to nosebleed stakes) down to a science, through actual hosting experience. The collective number of hours hosted by these members is astronomical.<p>A standard notion is that you rarely need more than 4-6 denoms for most games, with really only 3 of those in any quantity of 100 or more for a one-table cash game.<p>Also, that the jump between chip denominations functionally should be 4-5x the next lowest denom.<p>So for example, a typical cash set meant to work for games ranging from 50¢&#x2F;$1, $1&#x2F;$2, and $2&#x2F;$5 could make do with denoms of 50&#x2F;1&#x2F;5&#x2F;25&#x2F;100.<p>For any given stakes, there is a “workhorse” denomination, and that’s the chip type you need the most of (e.g. $5 chips on 1&#x2F;2 games).<p>The only real divide among this group is those who like to use the fewest possible chips which is still comfortable, without change having to be made too often, vs. those who think poker is more fun with lots and lots of chips on the table, even if many are unnecessary.<p>The idea of assigning non-denoms (i.e. chips with no value printed on them) all sorts of unstandard but “optimal” amounts is I suppose an interesting intellectual exercise, but in practice seems nuts.<p>… Especially considering that chips are typically sold with existing amounts printed on them.

    - For each color, (color quantity * number of players) must be less than the total number of chips of that color
</code></pre>
Theoretically any combination adhering to these constraints would be valid, but it wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be &quot;nice.&quot; The main idea behind the &quot;niceness&quot; constraints are to choose denominations that are easy to remember and easy to work with. To that end, there are a number of requirements and soft constraints that nudge the optimizer towards better denominations if it can. For example, a few are:<p><pre><code>    - One chip value should be the small blind, and try to minimize the number of chips required to make the big blind
    - Chip values should try to be multiples of a set number ($0.25 by default, tunable in the UI)
    - Chips above $1 should be multiples of $1
    - Chip values should try and be multiples of smaller chip values so that change can be made in as many ways as possible
    - Distribute as many chips as possible so that people have big stacks to play with
</code></pre>

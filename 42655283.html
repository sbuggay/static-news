I had no idea WTF &quot;objects are like nouns and methods are like verbs&quot; was trying to teach me. I just wanted to make my computer do things.<p>Around 14-15 I started playing around with my TI-84 calculator writing simple programs. The TI-84 used a form of BASIC where I could write a program that took INPUT and plugged it into an equation and print it to OUTPUT, and it felt so much more approachable than the neo-neo-platonist OO lectures I&#x27;d watched. From there I gradually started writing more complicated code until I eventually started to get why programmers would define functions to stop repeating themselves, or why they might implement custom types.<p>&gt; So it&#x27;s not that these are the most crucial concepts, but you want people to &quot;fail fast&quot; and have a sense if they&#x27;ll succeed in the major within the first year<p>I&#x27;d instead posit that so many people &quot;fail fast&quot; with OO because they go into their class being interested in programming, but have no idea wtf is even going on with programming and drop it, because they&#x27;re forced to learn all this inane trivia [0] and write all this boilerplate (define a class, methods, observability, return by value vs ref) they don&#x27;t understand before they can even run a program. They think maybe they&#x27;re stupid or not a good fit for programming and drop it.<p>IMO a better teaching language would be one that lets you opt-in to OO and functional features but also lets you write really simple programs like &quot;take a number, multiply it, and print it&quot;. I think that&#x27;s why Python is so popular these days. It helps that the lack of semicolons&#x2F;curlies, optional typing, and modifiers [1] removes so many distractions and gotchas that stymie absolute novices.<p>I also think most CS educators do a very poor job explaining CS concepts to beginners without realizing it. &quot;Methods are like verbs&quot; is absolute nonsense without a moderate to large amount of computer science knowledge to contextualize it. Some of my teachers were actually pretty good, and I also don&#x27;t remember much acknowledgement that programming didn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to be this way but that the language&#x2F;tool was designed that way because that abstraction comes in handy. That&#x27;d probably help a lot in retaining students who successfully suffered through their first semester of CS 101 in Java but hated it so much they decided to swear off programming.<p>[0] Always start your program with &quot;public static void main(string[] args)&quot; ! Don&#x27;t worry, that&#x27;ll make sense in a year, or in six years when one day on the toilet at your software engineering job you realize that it really was a static function returning void that took string[] args<p>[1] Static and Foo&amp; are justifiable, although static should arguably be implicit for a beginner language. Forcing students to learn about final, const, val&#x2F;var, public&#x2F;private, etc. early on is just stupid. I never understood why these were actually useful, or had a good reason to use them, until I&#x27;d already graduated.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42680255" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42680255" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chris_wot</span><span>|</span><a href="#42679929">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42680246">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42678174">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42680255">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42680255">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you are going to teach OO in Java, I fail to see why teaching design patterns is so awful.</div><br/><div id="42680263" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42680263" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tptacek</span><span>|</span><a href="#42679929">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42680255">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42678174">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42680263">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42680263">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I mostly point it out as a reason why teaching OO as a fundamental is a bad idea in the first place.</div><br/><div id="42680808" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42680808" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">andrewstuart</span><span>|</span><a href="#42679929">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42680263">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42678174">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42680808">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42680808">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But OO <i>is</i> a fundamental, even if it isn’t longer gospel.<p>OO is important and if I’m three years of computer science there’s no time to teach it then you have to ask what you’d heck they are doing.<p>OO is everywhere and it’s an important software concept and is the right solution for certain classes of problem.</div><br/><div id="42681306" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42681306" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tptacek</span><span>|</span><a href="#42679929">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42680808">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42678174">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42681306">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42681306">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I disagree?

Nobody will ever compare the outputs of the two systems, so nobody will ever know.<p>Let me instead suggest that one question we should ask is: What kind of students will be successful in the new system? What kinds of students will not?<p>One interesting thing aspect of the former curriculum is that (IMO) it provides an entry for students who are not entering with a lot of pre-existing knowledge. One of the criticisms of &quot;old school&quot; computer science teaching is that it privileges students who already have exposure to the material... The former curriculum is not the <i>only</i> way to level the playing field, but it certainly does provide <i>a</i> more level playing field for students who might not even be sure about the major.<p>I will stop with the suggestion that (IMO) pre-existing experience is definitely not the best indicator of future developer quality, so I value a curriculum that does not select for this.<p>(Caveats: never saw the new curriculum, it could be just fine, there are lots of other ways to accomplish this goal, but still...

Students (and their parents) often have opinions which language is &#x27;better&#x27; to learn. In forming these opinions, the definition of &#x27;better&#x27; can often be vague and driven by limited insight. One strong aspect commonly cited is the perceived usefulness of a language in the &#x27;real world.&#x27; If a language is widely used in industry, it is more likely to be seen as a useful language to learn.&quot; Kölling&#x27;s recommendation? &quot;We need a new language for teaching novices at secondary school and introductory university level,&quot; Kölling concludes. &quot;This language should be designed explicitly for teaching [...] Maintenance and adaptation of this language should be driven by pedagogical considerations, not by industry needs.&quot;<p>While noble in intent, one suspects Kaplan and Kölling may be on a quixotic quest in a money wins world, outgunned by the demands, resources, and influence of tech giants like Amazon — the top employer of Northeastern MSCS program grads — who pushed back against NSF advice to deemphasize Java in high school CS and dropped $15 million to have tech-backed nonprofit Code.org develop and push a new Java-based, powered-by-AWS CS curriculum into high schools with the support of a consortium of politicians, educators, and tech companies.

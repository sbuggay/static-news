If we wanted to build a new Göttingen, how would we do it? What factors allowed Göttingen to exist? For most of a century, Germany was leading in most scientific and academic fields, but what allowed this? When we think of the Golden Age of physics we are thinking of a cultural event that had its center in Germany, but why? And why has Germany been so dull and flat ever since? Clearly, building a liberal democracy is not enough to ensure such a cultural event. Much of Germany was liberal but non-democratic during its golden age, as other places were, but what made Germany special at this time?</div><br/><div id="41091604" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41091604" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chromanoid</span><span>|</span><a href="#41088364">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41088401">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41091604">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41091604">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Göttingen is still a top 200 university, and as far as I remember a talk by Jens Frahm has the highest density of living Nobel Laureates.

Junior professorships are more rare and more difficult to get into. The result is always the same, a full professor that controls his field locally and lots of expendable badly-paid postdocs working for him. Access to funding is also much more limited, which in turn restricts the capacity of said postdocs to pursue their own ideas, even while working under the umbrella of the professor.<p>In the US, tenure-track assistant professorships are much more common and requirements to apply are more flexible. Seed grants for junior faculty members are also common and not too hard to obtain. The result is a lot more freedom to explore. Basically, it is the same issue as with technology. EU suffers from over-regulation and control by some rent-seeking elites.</div><br/><div id="41090805" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41090805" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jltsiren</span><span>|</span><a href="#41088364">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41090129">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41091718">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41090805">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41090805">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My experience is different. The main advantage of the American Academia is the availability of entry-level faculty positions. Success rates for funding applications are also higher. On the other hand, PhD students and postdocs are less independent from their supervisors than in Europe. They lack the usual protections as employees you would expect in Europe, and it&#x27;s not as easy for them to get independent funding. Students and postdocs are also paid better than in the US (relative to what they would get outside the academia).<p>I&#x27;m not sure about the status of academic freedom. Administrators, politicians, and donors seem to have more influence in the US, and the entire academia seems to be more politicized.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41091718" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41091718" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bboygravity</span><span>|</span><a href="#41088364">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41090129">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41090805">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41091117">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41091718">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41091718">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Isn&#x27;t it much simpler than that?<p>US research receives 20 percent more funding relative to Europe (2017 data).

That goes for both Europe and the US I suppose.<p>Example: I&#x27;m in Europe with a bachelors degree working as a freelancer (engineer) and probably make 300 to 500 percent more than people who work their ass off for decades in academia.

The US used to be the bastion of free global trade but they resigned. Anything that relies on things like network effect or branding will become local because countries can enforce it. If some country has the engineering capacity to build a website where people post texts and media and others like and share that media then the American version wouldn&#x27;t be allowed.<p>Therefore, the US economy will become as powerful as having about 300M citizens, not as global power.

The trading on the same rules is something that EU fixed a lot but the EU is still fragmented and this makes EU companies  anaemic because they can&#x27;t get huge without going global.

Others who didn&#x27;t necessarily emigrate to Europe did spend much time there:  Paul Robeson, John Coltrane, Lillian Smith, Alain Locke, and Ethel Waters amongst them.<p>You can also see patterns in movement of creative and technical talent <i>within</i> the US. There is of course the Great Migration from the South to northern, mostly industrial cities.  California collected creative and technical talent from across the country, to a much greater extent than already established and notable Eastern states with large cities (New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, ...).  In some specific cases (the establishment of Hollywood), we know that lax patent enforcement and ready escape to Mexico was a strong draw for the early film industry against Edison&#x27;s lawyers.  I suspect that in addition to the much-ballyhooed physical climate, reduced social strictures, ease of land development, and rapidly-growing metro regions particularly near Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area, contributed.  There&#x27;s also of course the WWII and post-war &#x2F; Cold War military economy which played a tremendous role.<p>You also saw organisations such as RAND moving wholesale to the West in the 1950s, for a combination of factors:  more space, closer to major aerospace operations.  Entire families were shipped west by railroad.<p>My hypothesis is that intellectual and creative talent seek freedom, in both positive (opportunity) and avoidance of negative (oppression, suppression, abuse) senses.  As much as we talk of capital being more mobile than labour, <i>creative</i> labour being concentrated in a few individuals is <i>especially</i> mobile, and quite sensitive to conditions of oppression.  One obvious risk shares some parallels with a paradox of transportation infrastructure:  as transportation improves, formerly greenfield &#x2F; undeveloped regions become developed <i>and land values explode</i> such that <i>further</i> improvements in transportation become exceedingly expensive, both financially and politically.  In the intellectual and creative realms, moats and ramparts, institutional rigidities, commercial and political allegiances, etc., emerge, which actively retard further progress.<p>The challenge is in identifying where new regions (in the physical and geographic sense) of opportunity might be emerging.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41088133" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41088133" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">slicktux</span><span>|</span><a href="#41087985">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41089629">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41088835">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41088133">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41088133">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is something I always say and amazed by.

Many Germans were put into forced labor (&quot;Reichsarbeitsdienst&quot;, ...) to support the build-up of the military and the military economy.<p>Large amounts of weapons had to be developed and produced: for Heer, Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine.<p>The goal was to be ready for a large-scale war in the East in just 4 years.<p>With the war started, the economy was mostly a state-directed war economy, private or not. Even though there were large private companies they were all directed to work for the war economy.<p>The Nazis themselves were also involved in large scale industrial production. The Concentration Camps were also producing for the military. &quot;Vernichtung durch Arbeit&quot; (-&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Extermination_through_labour" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Extermination_through_labour</a> )<p>That the Nazis were supported by leaders of the German industry did not mean that the Nazis were interested in privatizing, market economies or such. There was one goal: reorganizing the German economy to build-up and run the large scale war in the East. The goal was to colonize and enslave East Europe. Finances were concentrated on the war economy and other economic activities were no longer important or even possible. Companies involved would profit from it financially and expand. Companies involved in private sector activities would have a hard time. For example finances and raw materials was with priority allocated to the military economy.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41090185" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41090185" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">racional</span><span>|</span><a href="#41088659">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41089695">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41090265">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41090185">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41090185">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">He was similarly evil of course.

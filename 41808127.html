Although physics does its best to explain things, those explanations are more like guesses than known facts. A theoretical physicist can have their life&#x27;s work undone simply because someone else comes up with a better guess, or experiment says no. You spend your life working on SUSY and then... nope. Even very established knowledge can be overturned.<p>People will say &quot;that&#x27;s science&quot; and indeed that&#x27;s fundamental <i>physics</i>, but other fields don&#x27;t really work like that.<p>In chemistry and biology, certainty isn&#x27;t in such short supply. Nobody is asking &quot;but <i>is</i> DNA a double helix?&quot; Researchers take a problem, they attack it, then they publish the results, it gets replicated (or not), and the set of knowledge grows.<p>Mathematics is more similar to chemistry and biology insofar as mathematical knowledge takes the form of an ever-growing set of proven facts generated by research. Take a problem, prove it, other mathematicians check it, the set of knowledge grows.<p>Fundamental physics has issues because the &quot;check&quot; stage now often costs millions or billions of dollars (build a particle accelerator, neutrino detector, gravitational wave detector, satellite, etc), and even then it might not give a definitive answer. Just look at the g-2 situation where they notice a discrepancy, they spend millions of dollars trying to determine if this single discrepancy is real, and then someone publishes a paper &quot;haha I recalculated it, you just wasted your time&quot;.<p>Not a criticism of fundamental physics because clearly that&#x27;s just how it is.

But they&#x27;re different enough that studying them may break the impasse.<p>I see (1) as largely limited by the budgets and technology needed to build things like particle accelerators and spacecraft.<p>For (2) you have to decide whether to only explore mathematics that defines physical reality, or whether to also allow exploration of non-physical systems. For example, you might explore a universe that is almost physical but has time machines. Restricting the search space to only physically realistic systems is a significant constraint, so there&#x27;s a debate to be be had about how much weight to give it.</div><br/><div id="41814193" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41814193" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ordu</span><span>|</span><a href="#41811668">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41816929">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41814193">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41814193">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; physics is stuck at a local optimum.</i><p>I think I heard somewhere that the trouble with string theory is it can describe anything if you tune it just in a right way. It reminds me of epicycles, they also had this property, you can add more and more epicycles to describe literally any observation data.<p><i>&gt; Way (1) is what kicked off quantum mechanics. Way (2) is what kicked off Newtonian mechanics.</i><p>Hmm... What was the way that kicked Copernicus to redraw epicycles with the Sun in the center? I mean, is there some notes on these? For example, Newton took as granted that celestial bodies move by elliptical orbits, and somehow he guessed that the gravitation law has r^2 in its denominator, and so he invented calculus to prove, that if you have r^2 in the denominator then you&#x27;ll get elliptical orbits. The question where Newton got his guess it remains open for me, but back to Copernicus, what was his way?<p>Maybe he thought how movements of planets will look if seen from the Sun, and so he had redrawn epicycles to take a look, and he got circles? (I&#x27;m not sure that it could work this way, I propose this answer to my question just to give an example of the kind of an answer I&#x27;d like to have).<p>I ask this question for two reasons.<p>1. I believe that Copernicus advanced the science not with surpising physical observation and not with mathematical advances, to me it seems more like surprising mathematical observation. I&#x27;m not sure what was that observation exactly.<p>2. Can one apply techniques of Copernicus to the modern physics? I suspect that it will not. I&#x27;m sure physicist already tried everything and there were (is) a lot of them and they are pretty smart people, so it is highly unlikely that Copernicus can help them in any way. But I&#x27;m still curious, what Copernicus would do? Would he tried to imagine how electron flying through a double-slit might observe scientists-observers? Or maybe it would try to feel the pain of a black that may believe that the whole universe is falling on it? I bet that the true Copernicus idea would require to use some pretty hard mind-altering substances, and I like such ideas.</div><br/><div id="41816285" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41816285" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">canjobear</span><span>|</span><a href="#41811668">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41814193">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815410">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41816285">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41816285">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Copernicus used the same circular-orbit-plus-epicycles system as Ptolemy, just the orbits were centered around the sun (kind of---each planet had its own circle, with the sun only approximately in the middle).

I know that Sabine did use this title for click-bate purposes that she is now mostly doing YouTube videos (she had horrible experience that unfortunately not rare in scientific community [1]). I understand that the field of particle physics which is the corner stone in fundamental physics is not showing the great advances that it used to have a couple of decades ago. But I think people really don&#x27;t understand that the field is still advancing and although these advances are less catchy to be reported in mainstream (and don&#x27;t get traction if posted on HN) it is not dead or dying.<p>There is a reason why we had a particle data group updating the PDG [2] each two years (you can order physical copies for free but please don&#x27;t do if you don&#x27;t need one). People were writing about that since after the big discovery of Higgs boson (that was 12 years ago). We still have a lot of measurement and puzzles that is less about unification theory that people usually would talk about. Theory people are coming up with all different ideas even if some are not testable now but that job of theorist is mainly come up with ideas and help bridge the gap later.<p>I would suggest everyone interested in this topic to read the electroweak current chapter of the book called &quot;How experiments End&quot; [3] to understand a historical example to how we approached the standard model when it was first proposed. Most of the particle physicists will not work on supersymmetry, string theory and these catchy theories that people will hear about. Most of the work is advancing and answering (and raise questions) piece by piece. Here is an example of interesting results that help us answer some questions [4]. Also I&#x27;m not saying that the field had its own problems and can improve on many aspects. I&#x27;m just against these extreme and hot takes that claims it is in a crisis or dying.<p>for people who posted the comment from John Carlos, I like this toot&#x2F;tweet&#x2F;comment by Sven Geier [5] which was what John replied.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a particle physicist and have a skin in the game.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LKiBlGDfRU8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LKiBlGDfRU8</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdg.lbl.gov&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdg.lbl.gov&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;press.uchicago.edu&#x2F;ucp&#x2F;books&#x2F;book&#x2F;chicago&#x2F;H&#x2F;bo5969426.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;press.uchicago.edu&#x2F;ucp&#x2F;books&#x2F;book&#x2F;chicago&#x2F;H&#x2F;bo596942...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.symmetrymagazine.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;new-results-from-the-cms-experiment-put-w-boson-mass-mystery-to-rest?language_content_entity=und" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.symmetrymagazine.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;new-results-from-th...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathstodon.xyz&#x2F;@SvenGeier&#x2F;113284011925646281" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mathstodon.xyz&#x2F;@SvenGeier&#x2F;113284011925646281</a></div><br/><div id="41817028" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41817028" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">randomNumber7</span><span>|</span><a href="#41815554">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41811200">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41817028">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41817028">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Seems like you are not downvoted on HN for rational argumentation.<p>I still think sabine has a point.

&quot;Carlo Rovelli is fine with the theory being untestable for practical purposes. So now the situation is that either the theory is falsified or its not falsifiable...&quot;<p>Is Carlo Rovelli fine with it not being testable, in that he is fine with research continuing even though it can not be tested with up coming experimental set ups?  That is reasonable lots of research goes on for long periods of time with out experimental verification. From a funding point of view it makes sense to allocate more money to things that have a tighter feedback loop though. If Sabine was going to expose howe much money was going to these topics and where it could be better spent that would be worth watching.<p>Or is Carlo Rovelli ok with the theory being unfalsifiable in the sense that that he is ok with the research not being science?  This is the straight forward meaning of Sabine&#x27;s words, but are a negative attack, and one that would come off as a personal attack to many scientists I have known, one that she does not back up with anything immediately and then goes on to make more negative comments like &quot;and Carlo complains to me because he thinks I do not understand his genius&quot;.<p>Ok if Sabine was going to expose Carlo Rovelli as someone who was not really practice science but was getting paid to be a scientist that would be awesome to watch and learn about.  That does not happen.<p>&quot;everyone who works on this just repeats arguments that they all know to be wrong to keep the money coming&quot; - accusation of scientific fraud and defrauding the government.<p>Ok what percentage and total amount of founding is going to this? Is there anyone who has come forward?  It would be awesome to watch something that exposed something like this. That does not happen either.<p>~3:19 - Arguments saying loop quantum gravity require space to be quantized, but they can not be lorentz invariant without having the quantization go to zero volume, according to Sabine, and no one has done that and extracted back out loop quantum gravity.<p>I am experimentalist and this is not my area.  I would want to see a link to a paper&#x2F;book etc. The analogy to the angular momentum operator comes off as a good place to start investigation&#x2F;research but is treated dismissively, anologies like this often do not apply in the end but can still be useful.<p>3:53 ~ &quot;length contraction should make that minimal area smaller than minimal proof by contradiction&quot;<p>Ok that does not seem like the gottcha that it is laid out to be. Interesting stuff happens where their are apparent contradictions in physics.  If experimental&#x2F;observational evidence about A produces theory TA and experimental&#x2F;observational evidence about B produces theory TB and they contradict each other in conditions C that is an interesting point to study look in to etc.  This may not be interesting for other reasons, but the apparent contradiction does not make it obviously non interesting.<p>~4:27 ~ &quot;this can&#x27;t work because these deviations would inevitably so large we&#x27;d have seen them already&quot; -<p>Why did Sabine talk about it being a mathematical contradiction if you can make the theory work, but it leads to physical phenomenon that we do not observe?<p>I can not make those two arguments jive in to a cohesive whole.

If you want a better one, she very rarely gets any of her facts wrong.<p>Now let&#x27;s go point by point.<p><i>Is Carlo Rovelli fine with it not being testable, in that he is fine with research continuing even though it can not be tested with up coming experimental set ups?</i> He is arguing for a version of the theory that can&#x27;t be tested, is continuing to do research on it, and presumably thinks that he is doing science.<p><i>If Sabine was going to expose howe much money was going to these topics and where it could be better spent that would be worth watching.</i> Discussing how these things wind up getting funded would be a very different video. And would not likely be interesting to most of her audience.<p><i>Or is Carlo Rovelli ok with the theory being unfalsifiable in the sense that that he is ok with the research not being science?</i> Presumably he thinks that he is doing science. Sabine&#x27;s opinion clearly is that this isn&#x27;t really science. However she only claims her opinion as her opinion, not established fact.<p><i>Ok what percentage and total amount of founding is going to this?</i> Again, that would be a very different video. In 10 minutes for a general audience, you have to make decisions about what you will and will not cover. It&#x27;s not a valid criticism of her that she made a choice. Particularly in a video that she disclaims as a personal rant.<p><i>Arguments saying loop quantum gravity require space to be quantized, but they can not be lorentz invariant without having the quantization go to zero volume, according to Sabine, and no one has done that and extracted back out loop quantum gravity.</i> This is not according to her, this is according to an argument that comes from Lee Smolin. A region of space that has a specific amount of area will, according to special relativity, have a smaller area according to an observer that is traveling fast enough. By having the velocity as close as you want to C, you can make the area arbitrarily small. So your choice is to violate Lorentz invariance, or have arbitrarily small areas. If you violate Lorentz invariance, the speed for light will depend on the wavelength.<p>As her previous video at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZlHvW6k2bcM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZlHvW6k2bcM</a> said, this prediction of Lee Smolin has been tested to extremely high precision, and the predicted effect was not seen. That version of LQG has been falsified. The alternative supported by Carlo Rovelli is that you need to average out over quantum areas in all reference frames. This is a neat idea, but in several decades, nobody has made it work. Until someone can make it work, LQG can&#x27;t produce any testable predictions.<p>Please note that John Baez, who worked on LQG for 10 years, specifically complimented her presentation of this particular issue. Her description of where research stands is accurate.<p><i>I am experimentalist and this is not my area. I would want to see a link to a paper&#x2F;book etc.</i> Rants generally do not come with properly cited references. That said, the previous video that this refers back to is based on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2402.06009?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2402.06009?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_med...</a>, which is one of the experimental tests showing that Lee Smolin&#x27;s prediction is false.<p><i>The analogy to the angular momentum operator comes off as a good place to start investigation&#x2F;research but is treated dismissively, anologies like this often do not apply in the end but can still be useful.</i> It was a good place to start. After 20 years of research that has failed to turn that idea into anything workable, most people would conclude that this is an analogy that will not apply in the end. But apparently Rovelli gets mad at anyone who doubts that it will work out. One of the triggers for this rant was whatever Rovelli said to her in private. Personally, I excuse her for being human here in her reaction.<p><i>Ok that does not seem like the gottcha that it is laid out to be. Interesting stuff happens where their are apparent contradictions in physics.</i> No, it really is the gotcha it claims to be. It&#x27;s directly inside of the math. This demonstration is no different than, say, proving that sqrt(2) is irrational by proving that if you start with the smallest fraction that equals it, you can find a smaller one.<p>The conclusion of that gotcha is exactly what she said: if there&#x27;s a minimal area then you can&#x27;t have Lorentz invariance. And conversely, if you have Lorentz invariance, then you can&#x27;t have a minimal area. Experimentally, we have tested for the Lorentz invariance to be expected from a minimum area based on the Planck length. It does not exist. And therefore there isn&#x27;t Lorentz invariance.<p><i>Why did Sabine talk about it being a mathematical contradiction if you can make the theory work, but it leads to physical phenomenon that we do not observe?</i> Her previous video (that triggered the nasty emails)_made this point more clearly. She&#x27;s saying that there is a mathematical contradiction between having minimal areas and Lorentz invariance. This forces us to choose to have one or the other. Minimal areas leads to a testable and now falsified theory. Lorentz invariance has yet to lead to a theory that doesn&#x27;t blow up with unnormalizable infinities, let alone one which can produce a testable prediction.<p><i>I can not make those two arguments jive in to a cohesive whole. Not that it can not happen, but I can not from this video and that is the conclusion, or similar, I normally reach when watching Sabine&#x27;s videos and why I do not watch or recommend them generally.</i> Is that Sabine&#x27;s fault, or yours? This video is much lower quality than her normal ones. And yet absolutely none of what you think are flaws, do I think is one. Every one of your objections has an answer that jives. And the conclusion is agreed with by John Baez, whose background on this specific topic is much stronger than yours.<p>Perhaps, rather than looking for things to complain, you should try figuring out what she actually said. In my experience it is logically internally consistent.

After 20 years of research that has failed to turn that idea into anything workable, most people would conclude that this is an analogy that will not apply in the end.

Personally, I excuse her for being human here in her reaction.<p>You are making some assumptions here and empathizing with Sabine, which is understandable. Arrogant Physics professor gets mad when someone questions their pet theory is not unrealistic but is not headline worthy either.  Does it matter if he was mad? Is this any different than any other celebrity spat? If not, that is not what I read HN for.<p>&gt; Rants generally do not come with properly cited references.<p>I know it was a rant, I saw the labeling. That does not help make it good material for HN or lead HN commenters to interesting and curious comments though.  The reverse is often true regardless of the source of the rant.<p>&gt; No, it really is the gotcha it claims to be. It&#x27;s directly inside of the math. This demonstration is no different than, say, proving that sqrt(2) is irrational by proving that if you start with the smallest fraction that equals it, you can find a smaller one.<p>Physics is not practiced like math though, so it is different. A contradiction in physics theories is not the same as saying true = false in math. Experimental evidence and observation rule the day until we find the fundamental laws of physics, after that it will be more like math(well at least some physics will).<p>&gt; Her previous video (that triggered the nasty emails)_made this point more clearly.

Lorentz invariance has yet to lead to a theory that doesn&#x27;t blow up with unnormalizable infinities, let alone one which can produce a testable prediction.<p>Comments like this, and much of what you said before this, lead me to think Sabine&#x27;s pervious video would be less likely to cause me to write a comment like I did.<p>&gt; Is that Sabine&#x27;s fault, or yours?<p>Nothing I have said is about Sabine being at fault of something.  I can stand corrected if something I wrote was too misleading though.<p>&gt; This video is much lower quality than her normal ones.<p>This seems like it would argue against Dang giving this Sabine video an exception.<p>&gt; Perhaps, rather than looking for things to complain,<p>That is not what happened here. My response was to Dang about giving this video a exception and the comment on &quot;sensational style&quot;.<p>&gt; you should try figuring out what she actually said.<p>And if I was having a conversation with Sabine or if I was corresponding with her then both people are responsible for reaching out to cover any communication gaps.  That is not what this is, this was Sabine&#x27;s rant as labeled by her and you.<p>&gt; Even though it skewers some sacred cows.<p>I do not think Sabine&#x27;s videos &quot;skewer sacred cows&quot;.

&gt;
&gt; However extracting truth from what you said is trivial if you believe that what she reports as fact, is fact. And what she reports as her opinion, is her opinion.<p>So the level of doubt and or critical thinking I apply to Sabine&#x27;s videos is not much different than what I would apply to a physic paper out of journal and I feel like I can often apply less than what I apply while reading many popular science articles.  That is no where close to the level of trust I would put in to a well grounded physics text book though.<p>This sort of doubt is critical to most people while reading journal articles, double checking, verifying, not assuming ground truth for what a paper says to uncover hidden assumptions, mistakes, and differing interpretations.<p>~&quot;Just believe&quot; is not conductive to learning science and is not going to make for curious or simulating conversation.<p>&gt; If you pick any 5 videos you want, I&#x27;d be happy to help you spot check them. Just like I did with this one.<p>You did not extract the value from this video though.  You reference other resources to try and get the value.  I am not interested in doing something similar with her other videos.<p>&gt; 1. Your point about settling physics with experiment is not applicable here. The result is about what the math will predict if you make a specific assumption in a specific mathematical model. Testing that is like trying to test the frequency with which 1+1 gives you 3. It&#x27;s a question of logic. What becomes a question of experiment is whether a particular model is a good description of reality.<p>If physical reality does not, can not matter to resolving a question, your question may not be about physics. This one point is not enough, like I said original, by itself, to make the apparent contradiction obviously non interesting.<p>&gt; 2. She may not be skewering cows that are sacred to all of physics. But a lot of her videos skewer cows that are sacred to some group, and she&#x27;s constantly getting an earful about it.<p>Is the earful about any sacred cows though? Are their other viable explanations  You may have evidence for you conclusion, but it is not here.<p>&gt; I think it is very important to be aware how easily branches of science become pseudoscience.<p>Sabine asserts this has happened to quantum loop gravity but doe snot show it. If I thought what she said was true and I wanted to make convincing case I would have to go out and do considerable research and put together a case, I could not simply reference this video.<p>&gt; And with John Baez&#x27; support, it&#x27;s clear that her complaint is more than simple sour grapes.<p>Sour grapes normally means that when someone can not have something they want they go negative on it instead. Does this saying even apply here? Nothing in the video made me think she was sour about anything.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41812501" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41812501" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">j_crick</span><span>|</span><a href="#41814764">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41812134">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41813660">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41812501">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41812501">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When I read the submission title here I immediately wondered if it was Sabine again and, well, there she was.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41813660" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41813660" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">knowitnone</span><span>|</span><a href="#41814764">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41812501">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41811209">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41813660">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41813660">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">she said some outlandish stuff in one video - I don&#x27;t remember which.

Sciulli and Steven Frautschi, and chaired by Richard D. Field.[21][22]<p>In the mid-1980s, Wolfram worked on simulations of physical processes (such as turbulent fluid flow) with cellular automata on the Connection Machine alongside Richard Feynman[29] and helped initiate the field of complex systems.[citation needed] In 1984, he was a participant in the Founding Workshops of the Santa Fe Institute, along with Nobel laureates Murray Gell-Mann, Manfred Eigen, and Philip Warren Anderson, and future laureate Frank Wilczek.[30] In 1986, he founded the Center for Complex Systems Research (CCSR) at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.[31] In 1987, he founded the journal Complex Systems.[31]<p>From 1992 to 2002, Wolfram worked on his controversial book A New Kind of Science,[4][33] which presents an empirical study of simple computational systems.

Wolfram&#x27;s conclusion is that the universe is discrete in its nature, and runs on fundamental laws which can be described as simple programs.

So really this argument just suggests we shouldn’t study quantum gravity at all.

The invention of the nuclear bomb scared a lot of people, it made them scared of physics.  What else might physicists turn up that could change the world in dramatic ways?  Anti-gravity?  Ray guns?  Other dimensions?  Travel to other worlds?  All bad for business, no one is going to buy your airplanes or air craft carriers if they can buy an anti-gravity machine.  So physics was suppressed by both business and government.  Physicists were given &quot;safe&quot; work to do (ITER, quants) that would occupy them and keep them from exploring wild stuff.  Grant financing was controlled so that only safe research would be conducted.  It would be fairly invisible to the world, just a few high level decisions would determine how the funding was directed.  I get the impression that if this was indeed a conscious decision that it&#x27;s starting to fall apart as younger generations take over and become frustrated with the direction of physics.  They weren&#x27;t there when the A-bomb was invented, and nuclear weapons have not been on peoples minds much for a long time, most people have not lived in a time when one was used.  So they see interesting topics and want to explore them and encounter resistance from more established scientists.  It&#x27;s a conspiracy theory because it would involve some buy-in from a fair number of physicists to make it work, but a lot of physicists when I was getting my BA in physics were very loudly saying &quot;never again&quot; about atomic weapons and felt it had tarnished the whole profession.  It&#x27;s very difficult to say what humanity would be capable of handling in terms of radical new inventions.  Anti-gravity could solve many large problems, but it might make it even easier to destroy Earth.  Once new knowledge exists it is hard to suppress it.  Stopping it from from ever existing seems easier.  I guess we&#x27;ll find out if physics has been suppressed if the dam breaks and new ideas start proliferating.  The nature of the new physics would be a big clue as to whether research in it was suppressed.  I&#x27;m reminded of Elon Musk, he seems to have had really radical success in some very stagnant industries, just by trying instead of accepting limits, and being able to fund his ideas himself.</div><br/><div id="41815060" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41815060" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ManuelKiessling</span><span>|</span><a href="#41814406">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815796">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41815060">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41815060">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The theory stops working imho if you take competition into account.

There is precedent for this, say in electronic warfare or cyberwarfare.  As soon as you reveal your uber virus, anyone can take it apart and modify it for their own purposes.  So you don&#x27;t reveal it except as a last resort.  Competition doesn&#x27;t come into play then, everyone hides their secret weapons and never uses them unless they have to, and tries to make sure information in that area is suppressed.  However, as I say in other comments, this may have been a bottom up conspiracy, not a top down conspiracy, though it may have moved to the top as the scientists themselves gained power.  But the fear would still exist at all levels; sure your anti-gravity gun gives you an advantage, but what if it eventually causes random micro black holes to appear near where you use it, obliterating infrastructure before evaporating?  We just don&#x27;t know what the repercussions of new technologies will be, and while the risks have seemed low in areas like software, the risks seem higher with fundamental new physics.  People are historically pretty bad at predicting how technology&#x2F;science will play out in the long term.  AI was a joke for a long time, until it wasn&#x27;t.  The internet was hailed as revolutionary, but it seems very different than it did in the year 2000.  It&#x27;s a lot like computer security, you can imagine the possibilities, but you probably can&#x27;t imagine ALL the possibilities.  It takes time and collaboration to scope out what it is that is new that can now be accomplished.  That uncertainty scares some people and excites others.

There has been an international component to physics research cooperation.  It seems not inconceivable that physicists in many countries, meeting at paper conventions and such might have agreed and recruited each other to try to prevent the next atomic bomb type invention.  So while competition between countries is certainly real, competition between scientists might be somewhat different.  You&#x27;d think there would be some people who would pursue it regardless, but they&#x27;d probably have to work with a team, and not everyone on the team may have supported the goals.  It&#x27;s just a theory, but it has some plausibility.  Perhaps there are people everywhere who have decided not to be part of endeavors that could be disruptive and they&#x27;ve done us all a favor or have kept us from discovering the secrets of the universe.  Who knows?  The ethics of science has been mostly left to chance and individual decisions.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41815072" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41815072" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">theendisney4</span><span>|</span><a href="#41814406">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815796">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815359">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41815072">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41815072">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Perhaps this is of interest to you.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yTiztUNrhhM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yTiztUNrhhM</a></div><br/><div id="41816071" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41816071" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rapjr9</span><span>|</span><a href="#41814406">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815072">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815359">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41816071">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41816071">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;d heard the name LaRouche but I&#x27;ve never read his history:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lyndon_LaRouche" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lyndon_LaRouche</a><p>Quite astounding, he seems to have been both woke in some ways (climate change) and fundamentally misguided.

Starting in 01950, 01995, 02010?<p>If we&#x27;re talking about 01995, it&#x27;s conceivable that, say, the US and CERN could coordinate to suppress research into hafnium bombs, AVLIS, antigravity, or whatever.  If we&#x27;re talking about research much prior to that point, though, you&#x27;d have to include the Russians in the conspiracy.  Probably not just any Russians, either; probably Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Andropov, Tsar-Bomba-era Sakharov, and his successors.  And, on the other side, people like J. Edgar Hoover, JFK, McNamara, Kissinger, Johnny von Neumann, and Teller.<p>I don&#x27;t want to say it&#x27;s literally <i>impossible</i> for Brezhnev or his underlings to have made a secret agreement with Kissinger and Teller to suppress the development of theoretical physics in order to keep the world predictable.  But I do think it&#x27;s pretty implausible, and there would have been an enormous incentive to cheat on any such secret agreement.<p>In the 01990s, though, it could have become plausible.  But, remember that that&#x27;s also when Pakistan became a nuclear weapons state, shortly followed by North Korea in 02006.  And the People&#x27;s Republic of China has had nuclear weapons since 01964, so they evidently had significant physics capabilities that they were willing to use for warfare (which was a huge priority; Mao reorganized the country&#x27;s economy to resist an anticipated US invasion), and they dominated the TOP500 supercomputer list until this year, when they withdrew from it in apparent protest against the efforts of the USA to reverse their technological progress with a worldwide system of export controls.<p>So I think there&#x27;s maybe a ten-year window when this could have happened somewhat, about 01992 to 02002.  Both before and after that, there are too many countries with strong physics communities that are too bitterly opposed to make such cooperation plausible.</div><br/><div id="41816148" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41816148" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rapjr9</span><span>|</span><a href="#41814406">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815359">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815978">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41816148">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41816148">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Reading the comments here my thinking has been revised.  I&#x27;m no longer suggesting the elites were conspiring, at least initially, I&#x27;m suggesting the physicists were conspiring for ethical reasons.  Some of them may have moved up the ladder and reached positions of some power.  Physics is magic to most people, hiding possibilities in math and technicality seems possible.  Anyone who has written code professionally has probably been faced with similar decisions, biases can be encoded, and you have to decide how you are going to approach these things.  For example, do you add a race field to the medical database or not?  In 1990 it was often left up to the programmer.  Sometimes things are decided far below the level of the people running the show.  Regardless, I do think my theory is far fetched, innate curiosity seems likely to have caused some people to explore further regardless of the risks, and an overt conspiracy that eventually reached high levels seems likely to have been soon discovered.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41815978" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41815978" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">carapace</span><span>|</span><a href="#41814406">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815359">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41814850">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41815978">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41815978">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Some secrets keep themselves.</div><br/><div id="41817534" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41817534" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">082349872349872</span><span>|</span><a href="#41814406">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815978">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41814850">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41817534">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41817534">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>&quot;The universe is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper.&quot;</i> —EP</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41814850" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41814850" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway14356</span><span>|</span><a href="#41814406">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815046">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41814850">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41814850">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">long ago i coin: scientific physics<p>an analogy with astrology and astronomy fits perfectly.<p>Remember those great men who did groundbreaking work that completely changed the fabric of society?

I will not give Sabine more YouTube views, justifying clickbait titles. 
Below is just  my opinion.
There are certainly issues in theoretical physics. I think particularly string theory was a massive waste of effort in physics and to some degree illustration of failure of the whole system.
Despite that most of other physics I would say in sensible shape, it is just harder to make progress given that we have to push to higher energies, more accurate measurements etc. 
The question whether there will be major advance in fundamental physics to some degree depends on new discoveries. Many people are pushing, but it is not guaranteed.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41817512" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41817512" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">meindnoch</span><span>|</span><a href="#41815046">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41817512">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41817512">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I knew from the title it&#x27;s gonna be Sabine Hossenfelder.

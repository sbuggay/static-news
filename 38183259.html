Let&#x27;s disregard for a moment the spy agency&#x27;s wet dream that this law introduces (likely fully intentionally). The more benign intent of this law is to prevent foreign entities from the EU (Mozilla, Google, Apple) from having the final say on whether two kinds of EU organizations (site operators and root CA operators) can successfully reach their clients.<p>Of course you in your capacity as a consumer don&#x27;t care whether I trust the same root CAs as I do. But a site operator very much cares whether all of their target audience trusts their site, and by extension the root CA that they are paying, and would like for their government to guarantee this trust.<p>The theoretical problem that this law is theoretically intended to protect from is browser vendors imposing hostile requirements on certificates which cost EU companies money and&#x2F;or access to clients. It&#x27;s a form of protectionism, ultimately.<p>Of course, the law is clearly being influenced by EU members&#x27; security agencies as well, who would love to have the ability to issue fake certificates for any site on the internet. With this new law, they would only need to infiltrate&#x2F;coerce&#x2F;fool their local root CA and local auditors, and they&#x27;d get free reign over encryption everywhere in the EU at least.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38185611" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38185611" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hotnfresh</span><span>|</span><a href="#38184641">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38187557">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38184805">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38185611">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38185611">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Spinning Chrome off and keeping enough daylight between Google and the new entity to have any hope of it meaning anything legally-speaking, would likely require Google to stop pushing Chrome like a heavily-indebted crack dealer on all their other properties.

Government mandated Root Certificate Authorities...<p>&gt; I could end this blog post right here because anyone reading this will understand the significance of such a statement, and just how much of a catastrophically bad idea that is, but it gets worse.<p>At the end of the day, (other than the EV-like âadditional attested attributesâ, which have been tried and were not a success), this makes quite a bit of sense: the EU <i>is</i> the authority as to the mapping from foobar.eu to whatever logically lives there. Norway is the authority mapping foobar.no. The US likewise controls .us, etc.  So, if the EU says that foobar.eu maps to some public key, who is Google or Mozilla or Apple to question it?<p>Of course, all of this is ignoring massive technical issues.  DNSSEC really does map domain names to attributes (but not individual names!) in a verifiable manner, and DANE can extend it to HTTPS, but DNSSEC is massively problematic. And the CA &#x2F; WebPKI system is a baroque mess that is, finally, sort of under control.  And the actual leaked text of the proposal does not respect any of what got the CA system under control.<p>I can imagine a situation in which the EU (through its qualified agents) could attest, cryptographically, which CT or its equivalent, that a domain name <i>in .eu</i> maps to a given certificate, and browsers should accept that. Except this is pointless â browsers <i>already</i> accept the equivalent of this.<p>IMO it would be more valuable for the EU to do the converse: require that browsers <i>not</i> accept a .eu certificate without attenuation from the EU. Raise the bar, donât lower it!

I even much more trust a first connection validity vouched for by an actual government, especially say from Finland than I would trust one vouched for by just some random company.<p>As for tofu, you do realise attacking it requires capturing and changing ALL traffic, forever, to be effective, as as even though SSH doesn&#x27;t do it, it&#x27;s super easy to add forward secrecy to it with a signature update mechanism.<p>And once you have tofu, you are set.

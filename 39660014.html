I’ve used Japanese saws, chisels, and other tools for many years. It has always seemed to me that efficiency and skill are the driving forces behind many traditional Japanese woodworking practices. They tend to be very efficient in using metal and wood, paying for this efficiency with greater skill requirements for the tools and techniques. This means they often need complicated tools or joinery to achieve the same things that a European carpenter may have solved by adding another oak beam, more metal bracing, or a longer saw.<p>For example, the article talks about the bimetal construction of this saw, using expensive and rare high-quality steel only for the teeth (this efficient use of rare metal is also the driving force behind the design of the katana). This is harder to make than a full-steel tool.<p>Japanese saws are typically very thin, again requiring much less metal. This means that the saws cut on a pull stroke, rather than a push stroke like European saws. Since the saw is much more flexible this requires more skill. But you end up with a very thin kerf and minimal waste.<p>Much traditional Japanese carpentry involves complex joints made of hardwood, not typically fastened with metal (e.g., nails, screws). The amount of slop you’d see in an 18th-century metal-fastened European joint would have been unthinkable to a contemporaneous Japanese carpenter.</div><br/><div id="39676154" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39676154" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">steve_adams_86</span><span>|</span><a href="#39675700">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39676755">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39676154">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39676154">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To your last point, some of the joinery used at that time was absolutely beautiful and required levels of skill many modern wood workers will never  attain.

I’m nothing like good at wood working, but it was humbling anyway.

Me? If I’m in a rush I can make a perfectly serviceable joint with pocket screws, good enough for many applications. That takes far less than 1% the time to make a durable wood-to-wood joint.<p>Durability is the other thing. Much Japanese architecture was very open to the elements, and the joints had to hold solid with seasonable movement. A simple metal fastener like a screw will not do that. Even in a climate-controlled environment most metal-assisted joints are ephemeral compared with simple old tech like wood-to-wood joints and hide glue.<p>There’s also a lot to be said for craft <i>for the sake of it</i>. Once you have every other problem solved — efficiency, cost, durability — why not make it beautiful? I don’t think this extends to every human endeavor. Ornament is often a hazard to maintainability (e.g., an old Bugatti, a new Ferrari, most software), but not always. This type of joinery is complex <i>so that it is maintainable</i>, which is fascinating to me.</div><br/><div id="39676564" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39676564" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yial</span><span>|</span><a href="#39675700">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39676382">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39676327">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39676564">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39676564">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Part of it has to do with when different adhesives were developed in Japan.<p>If you don’t have adhesives, you use more complex joinery to achieve results.<p>But I believe it was also a desire to have beautifully crafted strong joints.<p>However, rice glue is surprisingly strong when used correctly.<p>WOOD JOINTS

the
authors&#x27; comments. The purpose of this book
Nowadays, joints are made using metal parts. The splices and connecting joints have become much simpler. It si now possible to construct large wooden structures using standard processes. However, the uncertain properties of wood have brought forward the problem of weakening of the joints.
This work goes back to the fundamental of joining. It is recommended to all technicians and also to architects and engineers.

Both have been continuously blown off by engineers since the dawn of my career, 30 years ago. Both are powerless to hold engineers accountable and especially Tech Writers don&#x27;t get any credit even though most customers rely on them completely. Engineers think they&#x27;re too good and too busy to do technical writing for documentation, but then blow off technical writers who want to do the work for them and just need a few hours to understand features, etc.<p>I had an idea 10 years ago to hire a bunch of English majors as interns for the summer to bootstrap a big technical writing project, but that got shut down almost immediately. No engineer values tech writers, because they envision themselves as large great white sharks, and the tech writers to them are just bottom feeders that exist in their ecosystem.</div><br/><div id="38429722" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38429722" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">verletx64</span><span>|</span><a href="#38428883">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38429152">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38429722">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38429722">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Technical writing is a difficult skill to be proficient at, so I think dedicated technical writers are needed in many companies. I’ve also not really seen writers be “blown off”. More often I see an absence entirely of writers, but that’s usually more to do with budgeting more than anything else. Where I’ve had writers working with me, we’re generally thankful to have someone proficient at it handling things.<p>With that said, I don’t really see the English major idea panning out well, just as bootstrapping a project with a bunch of CS grads probably wouldn’t. The study and analysis of literature is tangentially connected with technical writing for commercial purposes.<p>They can, of course, become good technical writers over time, but a huge component of what writers bring is an understanding of the audience. It goes beyond being able to write well, and academic writing is different from commercial writing.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38429152" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38429152" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rapnie</span><span>|</span><a href="#38428883">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38429722">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38429279">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38429152">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38429152">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It helps when tech writer is (semi)embedded with the agile team.

It can also be used to tackle &#x27;docs debt&#x27; when issues on the tracker are explicitly dedicated to transfer fuzzy-knowledge-in-experts-head into docs, in order to catch up. If you don&#x27;t plan docs efforts well in sprints, you get devs thinking &quot;Oh no, annoying tech writer is coming to my desk to distract me, and I&#x27;m so busy&quot;.

I did a hell of a job but the job was hell. My manager actually put a co-worker in a choke hold at a customer site while they were transitioning their bank to the system. This was way back when, and I put way to much effort into my work; they were dragged along and the whole thing was thankless.<p>That said, I managed to rewrite 800 pages of small bank management documentation into 600 pages of well-formatted, _readable_ manual. I don&#x27;t know if it was worth it, I was in Lincoln, NE and I didn&#x27;t have anything better to do. I dropped the readability statistics from freshman in college to freshman in high-school and I&#x27;m sure the customer was more the latter than the former. Not to judge, I never met a customer that wasn&#x27;t worth helping.<p>Am I especially good at writing? Not in my opinion. You&#x27;ll quickly find it is a target rich environment. The manual I edited could not resist saying, &quot;Put the applicable value into the blah-blah input&quot;. Of course, what other value would you put there?<p>Back then, there were some serious efforts in the field to generate multiple deliverables from a single-source. I have no idea if anyone thinks of that anymore. I&#x27;ve been developing ever since and I haven&#x27;t worked on a product that even thought they needed a manual. That banking software was written for an IBM mainframe and ran in an emulator so it could work in Windows and it didn&#x27;t even have the worst user interfaces I&#x27;ve seen since.<p>Maybe this is a career? I dunno, the author of &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; was a technical writer, he also spent a stint in a mental institution. Maybe it was the software he was documenting?<p>I can&#x27;t say.

Joplin is a note-taking app, Asciidoctor is a processing&#x2F;publishing tool for AsciiDoc, and groff is mostly for publishing CLI docs&#x2F;man pages.<p>Most technical writers work in either DITA XML, AsciiDoc, reStructured Text, or Markdown. Aside from using oXygen for XML, you&#x27;re probably in VSCode or some other open-source plain text editor with a plugin to preview the output.<p>That content often lives in a git repo, or alongside code in a monorepo. It goes through a publishing tool like the DITA Open Toolkit, AsciiDoctor, Sphinx, a static site generator, etc.<p>Translation typically involves Gettext&#x2F;Poedit at some point between a variety of frontends, though scaling that is often how tech writing teams wind up going down the DITA XML rabbit hole.<p>&gt; Lauren Pritchett: &quot;When I was writing more frequently I liked to write in Atom or something like that in Markdown, then put it in a Markdown-to-HTML converter and plop it into Drupal…&quot;<p>No. No! This is nonsense. In technical docs you absolutely have to have a publishing pipeline that doesn&#x27;t include a manual copy-paste step into a CMS order to scale. In technical blogs you&#x27;re authoring closer to the CMS. This makes zero sense.<p>&gt; I really enjoyed working with LibreOffice because of the ability to create templates, repeat processes, ebooks and cheat sheets…<p>There are mature and popular open-source tools to do all of those things in AsciiDoc&#x2F;rST&#x2F;Markdown that are easier and better at scale than LibreOffice. Even DITA and the DITA-OT can do most of this, though working with XSLTs sucks.<p>Notably, Pritchett&#x27;s background is primarily in marketing content, whitepapers, blogging, and traditional book publishing, not product docs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hilgspritch.github.io&#x2F;work.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hilgspritch.github.io&#x2F;work.html</a><p>&gt; ... (git and Markdown is) not intuitive, I much prefer Google Docs<p>If you&#x27;re doing technical product or dev documentation work, you might be in Google Docs as a bridge with product and marketing, and maybe you legitimately prefer GDocs review tools for editing early drafts of prose.<p>But if you&#x27;re writing documentation, then writing docs as code in the same tools and processes ships the docs alongside the implementation. If you can&#x27;t become competent using git, you&#x27;re going to struggle mightily in non-marketing tech writing roles.<p>If you&#x27;re documenting software, and even if your team isn&#x27;t writing docs as code, you still need to be able to understand git and fundamental concepts of it well enough to work with the product you&#x27;re documenting. Your publishing pipeline is probably using a combination of git, CI, and cloud storage, and if your team doesn&#x27;t have anyone on it who can understand those things then you aren&#x27;t shipping docs as fast as you could be. Very few non-marketing technical writers make it these days without being competent in git.<p>-<p>Also, more generally there&#x27;s no disclaimer that the moderator of the talk spends a chunk of it talking up a blog that his own consulting company runs and prominently sponsors.</div><br/><div id="38427804" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38427804" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">spondylosaurus</span><span>|</span><a href="#38427614">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38429095">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38427804">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38427804">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Very few non-marketing technical writers make it these days without being competent in git.<p>At least in the software industry, agreed.

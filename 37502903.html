Those colored paddle switches and dark bezel with LEDs behind them screamed “computer”. Only thing missing was a reel to reel tape drive.<p>In contrast to the Altair, it was actually more subdued and less substantial. “Just” a bunch of toggle switches and lights. Could have been anything. Maybe an elaborate model railroad control panel. Industrial, perhaps, but not necessarily a computer.<p>The IMSAI was my first contact with computers. The one we had was built as a student project the year before. It had a keyboard, video, an open chassis 9” monitor (no touching!), 8K of RAM, and the ubiquitous cassette interface.<p>My instructor taught me BASIC in a hour and left the lab, leaving me to flail the rest of the evening. I forgot something fundamental and couldn’t get anything to work. (It was expressions.)<p>He answered my question the next day, I “aha’d” and that was the last formal instruction I had for computers for 3 years until I took Fortran in college. All self taught through books, magazines, etc. Alone, I had no one really to talk to. For whatever reason I never really talked to my instructor about it again.<p>I ditched my first class playing with that thing.<p>We never turned it off, if you did you had to type in, oh, 30-50 bytes of hex code into the monitor so you could load BASIC from cassette. I tried to use the front panel to do it once, that got old very fast. It didn’t work.<p>Next year we had several PET computers donated, and I never touched the IMSAI again.  I spent a lot of time on the PETs. I routinely broke into the room that housed them in the library, climbing up and in through the window.<p>But the IMSAI, that was my black monolith in the swamp, that just happened to be blue, that touched me first.</div><br/><div id="37506388" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37506388" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">preisschild</span><span>|</span><a href="#37505815">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37505599">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37506388">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37506388">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Maybe an elaborate model railroad control panel.<p>Damn, now I want an IMSAI8080 to control a model railroad</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37505599" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37505599" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dang</span><span>|</span><a href="#37505815">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37506349">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37505599">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37505599">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Related:<p><i>Miniature IMSAI 8080</i> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35960604">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35960604</a> - May 2023 (1 comment)<p><i>IMSAI 8080 computer (2004)</i> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23176125">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23176125</a> - May 2020 (15 comments)<p><i>IMSAI 8080 replica</i> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21876042">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21876042</a> - Dec 2019 (5 comments)<p><i>IMSAI – The Computer Film Star of War Games</i> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=10033325">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=10033325</a> - Aug 2015 (5 comments)</div><br/></div></div><div id="37506349" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37506349" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">russellbeattie</span><span>|</span><a href="#37505599">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37504619">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37506349">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37506349">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">First, if you want to know more about the company behind the IMSAI, there&#x27;s a long section in chapter 3 of <i>Fire In The Valley</i> [1] about IMSAIs founding through to its demise. It&#x27;s an interesting lesson about what happens when salespeople run tech companies:<p>&gt; <i>Meanwhile, IMSAI had grown quickly and showed no signs of decelerating. The company already occupied two buildings on Wicks Boulevard in San Leandro; administration, sales, marketing, and engineering were located in one building, and production and support in the other. Millard had assembled a driven organization, a fact nowhere more apparent than among the sales team in Building One. Telephone salespeople like Bill Lohse came in promptly at 8 A.M. and, after a brief meeting, got on the phones and stayed there, logging every call until lunchtime. Lohse would take an hour off, during which time he compared notes with other sales representatives on how many thousands of dollars of equipment they had sold that morning. Then he’d jump back on the phones again, making calls until the end-of-the-day sales meeting.</i> ...<p>&gt; <i>Building Two was where reality came in. Selling a million dollars’ worth of computers and building a million dollars’ worth of computers are two different things, and the production people had trouble keeping up with the orders. ...</i><p>Second, I highly recommend this playlist on YouTube from a guy who restored his IMSAI to working condition. I learned a ton about the basics of an Altair class machine - how it worked, what common boards were used, and how it connected to things like printers and displays, etc. [2]<p>1 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Fire-Valley-Birth-Personal-Computer-ebook&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00QHFAEDK&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Fire-Valley-Birth-Personal-Computer-e...</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PLXDK0MeyK4ZjnpbqshdqWuBJL8THk8eep">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PLXDK0MeyK4ZjnpbqshdqWuBJL...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37504619" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37504619" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">NoZebra120vClip</span><span>|</span><a href="#37506349">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37504619">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37504619">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Okay, going to hook this up with a couple 8&quot; disk drives and an acoustic coupler, then we can find a BBS with lots of games to play.

By 1983, the IMSAI was old, and 8” floppies had been replaced with 5” floppies.<p>The intention was to show that David, as a school kid, couldn’t afford high-end equipment and was using hand-me-down, or second hand equipment.<p>To most viewers today, that distinction is lost, as it’s all almost equally in the past.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

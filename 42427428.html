The main argument put forward in favor of professional languages is crossover: if a student learns a language in class, they may be able to use that language professionally. The author then argues against that main point.<p>I think students should be taught in &quot;professional&quot; languages, but crossover is not my main reason. Rather, it&#x27;s that professional languages have an enormous corpus of examples that students can look up. If a student is learning on a teaching language without much adoption, there&#x27;s just not much else a student can do but use the materials that part of the course. Teaching languages don&#x27;t let students expand their universe of examples.<p>I agree with the author&#x27;s point about real insight coming on learning the second (and third, etc.) language and systems. But I don&#x27;t find it as a compelling point in favor of teaching languages - quite the opposite. To me it means there&#x27;s no need to obsess over first languages.<p>Designing programming languages is fun. Designing a programming language which meets some platonic ideal of teachability is moreso because it feels possible to &quot;solve&quot; the design and craft the perfect jewel of a language. But I&#x27;m unconvinced it&#x27;s useful research.<p>For the record, my first language was C++, and I&#x27;d default to teaching beginners in Python.</div><br/><div id="42439606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42439606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vishnugupta</span><span>|</span><a href="#42436177">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42436228">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42439606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42439606">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My hot take on this topic is that one should introduce programming through spreadsheets, Google sheets or even MS excel.<p>Assuming it’s done at the high school level students can immediately find value in using it for household budgeting, school or business inventory management, small business accounting, event management and what not.

Also, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just the keyword-heavy syntax of language like PASCAL or Modula-2 that make them easier to learn than, say, C&#x2F;C++. They also discourage quirky, terse expressions (favorites of advanced C&#x2F;C++ devs) that can be difficult for beginners to understand.<p>Beginners face an uphill battle: not only are they being introduced to abstract concepts like data structures and flow control, but they have to deal with the language syntax. You can&#x27;t do much to alleviate the former, but you can make the latter a bit easier by picking a language with a more straightforward, plain syntax.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42436918" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42436918" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">markhahn</span><span>|</span><a href="#42436003">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42436022">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42436918">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42436918">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">odd to publish such an article with so many undefended opinions.<p>for instance, that low-boilerplate is somehow worse than high-boilerplate languages because the boilerplate somehow builds character (&quot;teaches important lessons ... from the start&quot;).  this insipidly assumes boilerplate is necessary for encapsulation and modularity.  yes, the directness of Python does make it better than Java.<p>similarly, there seems to be a peculiar theory of learning here: both that learning many languages is a goal, and that you should Do It Right from the start.  suppose the goal is to learn concepts, and it&#x27;s perfectly fine to iteratively use a single language, starting with a simple subset.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42436022" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42436022" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dr_dshiv</span><span>|</span><a href="#42436918">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42436244">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42436022">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42436022">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Genuinely curious about how LLMs and tools like bolt.new will change programming education.

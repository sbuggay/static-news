It helped a bit that I did finite element analysis professionally at that time which involved a lot of 3D modeling as well.<p>About 15 years ago there was a small hype where photographers offered the service of 3D printing small figurines of you and your loved ones. I found one that gave me the 3D data. It was just a point cloud and hard to process back then.<p>Around the same time I had to get an MRI and talked the technician to give the data. Again it was hard to work with back then, but I learned a lot about DICOM.<p>More recently I asked my dentist for the 3D scan data they are doing there and he was happy to give it to me. It&#x27;s just my mouth and teeth, but it&#x27;s excellent data that worked straight in Blender.<p>I also experimented with the LIDAR of my iPhone a lot. I use Polycam for that, but mostly for spaces and objects. About four years ago a colleague who makes masks for his LARPing asked me to help him with that, but the resolution is too low for a head and face. Depending on your aspirations it could be good enough for full body scans. Especially since Polycam can do photogrammetry now besides the LIDAR scans, but I have not used that enough to form an opinion yet.<p>Speaking of apps, there is also Face Cap which can export the data from iPhones front facing facial recognition hardware, including facial expression animations in 3D. This is the data that Memoji use in the background.<p>By far the biggest progress we had is in software in my opinion. Blender is fantastic for working with models of all sorts, including human body models. There are many free base models you could fit for your needs (the ones Blender Studio offers are excellent and free), and there is MPFB2 if you want a generator. Apart from Blender there is still MakeHuman which progressed a lot in the last decade.<p>When it comes to services there are a ton that offer photogrammetry, 3D scanning and motion capture.<p>We live in exciting times and it was never that easy to create a model of your body.<p>EDIT: Regarding existing services, this was also a hype about 15 years ago along with the figurine services. I believe in Munich, where I live a company that offered it was called xsuits, or similar. When I search for this I find a lot of dead services and companies. Seems to have been just a fad, which is sad, because I think it is a really good idea.<p>While searching I found youlittle.com which offers 3D full body scans and sell you the processed data and edited models in various forms. Maybe something like that is the easiest and most convenient route.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

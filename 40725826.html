Which UNESCO demonstrates.<p>The problem is the Holocaust was the first time industrial techniques were applied to killing large groups of citizens. The unique evil is the tools, bureaucracy and mundanity of mass murder. The horror was kids in the wrong family tree being shipped off to well engineered gas chambers - not the details of ideologies and personalities. We&#x27;re already forgetting the more important lessons of not designating internal citizen groups as the out-group (if we ever learned it) and not building up those registers labelling for one bad government to use.<p>&gt; The Historical Figures App allowed users to chat with prominent Nazis such as Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels, and falsely claimed that individuals such as Goebbels were not intentionally involved in the Holocaust and had tried to prevent violence against Jews.<p>I mean really. This is a nonissue. Hitler and Goebbels aren&#x27;t unique evils and there isn&#x27;t any point remembering them as people; at this point they are more rhetorical symbols then people.

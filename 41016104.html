However, it NT wasn’t remotely as stable as Netware at that time either. 
Then we got to watch as Novell slowly went insane competing and buying WordPerfect and doing all sorts of other crazy moves.
I still wish that Novell had taken all of its money and bought VMware when they were just working on GSX&#x2F;ESX (now vSphere).

I also worked with Novell to update their training material.<p>I remember the first release of NetWare 386 very well; it was a breeze to install, but the early version had a bug and if you unplugged the 10Base2 coax from the server it would crash. Apparently, the routine to display a warning message on the console had an issue. Novell issued a patch NLM.<p>I had one site that experienced random crashes, but it was not the aforementioned bug. Long story short: After about two months of sleuthing, working with Novell and Compaq, camping on site and driving to&#x2F;from the office to site (about 2hr each way), I found that it was a mains spike caused by a dishwasher right up against the server room wall in the next room.<p>The fix was to move the Compaq server, which was actually a large desktop model, on its table to the opposite end of the server room.</div><br/><div id="41017798" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41017798" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stevekemp</span><span>|</span><a href="#41017233">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41020568">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41017798">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41017798">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I remember working in random IT companies, back in the early nineties, where our &quot;servers&quot; were a collection of random desktop machines running Linux.<p>At the time I think we had one Sun E450, and 20-30 random desktop hosts.

Those were the days...though my memories are mostly of the prior (286) version.<p><i>After</i> you got it working right, NetWare was rock-solid.  Though if you weren&#x27;t seriously experienced with NetWare, the &quot;got it working right&quot; could be difficult to distinguish from &quot;went through Hell&quot;.<p>But once MS&#x27;s OS&#x27;s grew up enough to cope with running a serious fileserver, NetWare was doomed.  Didn&#x27;t matter that MS OS&#x27;s were pretty mediocre.  Their business strategy was good and ruthless, they had vastly more money, NetWare was a lone-niche product, and Novell wasn&#x27;t very good at either business strategy, nor bigger-picture technical management.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41018128" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41018128" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dura00</span><span>|</span><a href="#41017370">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41020731">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41018128">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41018128">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And lets remember the best feature of NetWare: ncsnipes.</div><br/><div id="41019143" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41019143" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mixmastamyk</span><span>|</span><a href="#41018128">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41020731">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41019143">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41019143">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Netwars game was my favorite, then syscon? and filer&#x2F;salvage.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41020731" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41020731" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">andrewstuart</span><span>|</span><a href="#41018128">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41017378">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41020731">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41020731">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hard to grasp now but Netware was really exciting technology at the time.<p>It was also arguably the most advanced server on the Intel platform.<p>There was a moment in time when it looked like Novell might become THE corporate back end server technology and all sorts of servers were built to run on Netware. I think there was Oracle and Lotus Notes and CC Mail and some others<p>However, Novell for whatever reason simply didn&#x27;t make Netware robust.  Netware needed to be memory protected and have task preemption and it did neither, making it unsuitable as a server.  Why they refused to do this is unclear.  I seem to recall reading that Drew Major didn&#x27;t have the technical chops to make it happen.  I also recall reading that Drew Major believed that task preemption and memory protection were slow, and that speed was more important.<p>Also, Netware was late to the party with TCP&#x2F;IP support - they were all in on IPX&#x2F;SPX and in the end TCP won the entire protocol game, sending IPX&#x2F;SPX, XNS and other common network protocols to the dustbin.<p>Anyhow Microsoft came along with Windows NT and OS&#x2F;2 and stomped on Novell and since Netware wasn&#x27;t up to the job, the show was over.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41017378" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41017378" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">annoyingnoob</span><span>|</span><a href="#41020731">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41017378">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41017378">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I got my CNA in about &#x27;92.

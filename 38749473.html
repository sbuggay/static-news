This is Terry Tao&#x27;s blog and not a VC&#x27;s microblog. The very first block of text is a quote from &quot;I want to be a mathematician&quot;. He is purely talking about how to approach mathematics at a level sufficiently close to the frontier. What he is saying is that when you are taught something like optimization theory, the definition of convexity is presented to you in the first lecture. A &quot;stupid&quot; question to ask is what makes convex functions special. After thinking a lot about this question, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that convex functions are functions that are trivial to optimize but the converse is not true. Not all function that are trivial to optimize are convex functions. There are then plenty of questions like which other classes are easy to optimize. In Terry&#x27;s words, &quot;the answers to these questions will occasionally lead to a surprising conclusion, but more often will simply tell you why the conventional wisdom is there in the first place, which is well worth knowing.&quot;. Another example I ran into was the notion of metric spaces and completeness. It is &quot;stupid&quot; to ask what happens if you get rid of completeness. Stupid because you were just taught completeness for a reason. Trying to understand gives you a whole new appreciation than being presented the formal definition refined over many years.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38749741" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38749741" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vegetablepotpie</span><span>|</span><a href="#38751820">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38752222">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38749741">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38749741">[31 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One of the things that separates ordinary people from smarter people is the topic of this article, the ability to imagine new concepts, questions, ideas.

While he was somewhat appreciated in India (not at any high level though), when he reached out to professors in the UK, the first several thought he had no ability to become a mathematician. They were used to seeing mathematical proofs, and Ramanujan not providing any made him appear fraudulent. The only one who understood his brilliance was G.H. Hardy, also considered an eccentric by his peers.<p>In Ramanujan&#x27;s words, &quot;an equation for me has no meaning unless it expresses a thought of God&quot;. In mathematician circles of the early 20th century, this was an obscene statement. Even today, can you imagine a researcher in any field saying something like that, and being taken seriously?<p>Yet Ramanujan is probably one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. In Hardy&#x27;s word, he had &quot;never met his equal, and can compare [Ramanujan] only with Euler or Jacobi&quot;.<p>To think that &quot;we&quot; (whoever you mean by that) can recognize sheer talent of Ramanujan&#x27;s type is, frankly, arrogant. If anything, the ivory towers are even more enclosed - research is more and more about the quantity of publications, not about the quality of ideas. A recent Nobel Laureate stated that if he had not received the Nobel Prize, his university would have probably fired him, for lack of a consistent publication record.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t agree with your statement.

We can call up people in different latitudes and compare lengths of shadows or positions of the sun and stars.<p>I&#x27;m guessing when you say they &quot;can&#x27;t explain how we know that&quot;, you&#x27;re discounting photo and video evidence that they&#x27;ve seen; you&#x27;re discounting the flight trajectory maps they see on planes; you&#x27;re discounting the nature shows and documentaries they&#x27;ve watched; you&#x27;re discounting the fact that any other explanation makes no fucking sense; you&#x27;re discounting the history they learned about Magellan. There&#x27;s no reason to say that none of that is evidence. They&#x27;re not blindly following like sheep, they have an enormous body of evidence in front of them and there is no counter-evidence.

A bunch of authors got together to write the worst book possible. It has pretty much every kind of awful prose in existence, including an early case of AI generation.<p>For awful but readable books:<p>Most anything by Dan Brown, but for the audience here, Digital Fortress will make you tear your hair out in frustration if you know anything at all about cryptography. The climax of the book seems to be made for a movie and is a completely nonsensical sequence in which people stare at a screen showing attackers breaking through a firewall, as if it were a wall that can be slowly drilled through.<p>For me that was the book that did it. If Dan Brown couldn&#x27;t take 10 minutes to research the simplest basics of the subject he based his book around, imagine what the quality of the rest of the work is like.<p>Ender&#x27;s Game I rate as a fairly enjoyable but puerile teenage power fantasy. But after that comes Speaker for the Dead, which to me is absolutely awful. Ender turns into this insufferably saintly martyr, who acts as some sort of Gordon Ramsay, only fixing an awful colony instead of a restaurant. Everyone in the book is insufferable and a complete moron, except for Ender of course who knows how to fix all those awful people. Oh, and it justifies domestic abuse.<p>And maybe Battlefield Earth. I&#x27;ve never read the entire thing, but here&#x27;s a quote:<p>“His valet! In the rush of getting him off, his clumsy damned valet had put the wrong boots on him. Oh, when he got home ... when he got home he would have the oaf punctured! Worse.

These are works created by artists who arguably have either (1) too little exposure to prior art, or (2) too inexperienced with core skills of writing. So, in terms of my field, these artists probably (1) didn&#x27;t expose themselves to enough music, or read enough music, or (2) didn&#x27;t practice how to construct and write music enough times that they&#x27;re comfortable. Examples of &quot;uninspired&quot; works include student works (i.e. practice works written by people to gain skills), works whose only purpose is to make money and there is no other consideration (this is probably very debatable), or works created by people who are unreasonably unexposed to the prior art (e.g. someone who has sufficient writing skills who is writing a novel, but really only read 2 novels before.)<p>Second &quot;bad&quot; category is what I would describe writing that is too stylish where aesthetic choices aren&#x27;t appealing. This is when creator (1) is sufficiently exposed to prior art and (2) is experienced enough to produce works similar to prior art. Now, this gets very tricky because the problem with these works -- i.e. what separates them from Category 1 -- is that the work itself needs to convince the observer of these qualities, which can oftentimes be very hard. Unfortunately, I cannot give examples from literature, but to give an example from the history of music writing: oftentimes people listen to works of Schoenberg and they complain it sounds horrific, dissonant, random and ugly etc etc... However, if you look at the work closely, you&#x27;ll find choices that are only consistent with thorough understanding of the prior art and an experimental desire to create something entirely novel. Now, it is &quot;ugly&quot; (for some, of course) but it is well-informed. In other words, it convinces most that the artist was able to create something &quot;prettier&quot; but for whatever reason decided not to.<p>Unpacking this is important when consuming &quot;bad art&quot; because each category teaches you something else.<p>When you consume Category 1 &quot;bad art&quot; you need to pick up (1) in what ways this work is unaware of prior art, and (2) in what ways this creator is inexperienced. This can be crucial to understand points where you struggle. E.g. you look at some student works, and you see consistent patterns that diverge from prior art -- consistent patterns are not explained with creativity. This can be a good reminder to work on these skills.<p>When it comes to Category 2, it&#x27;s more complicated. This kind of art can be jarring, but can be the most useful kind of art you can consume to perfect your skills. These can show prior experiments, and how various styles work. You don&#x27;t have to enjoy it, but it will be useful to see. E.g. slow movies may not be your favorite, but if you&#x27;re filmmaker you likely want to sit through the entire &quot;2001&quot; movie.<p>Ultimately, it&#x27;s up to you, and up to your relationship with your art. I personally consume a lot of art I dislike and think it&#x27;s important to expand my understanding how things work. An artist is not just the work, but also the entire lifetime spent on observing, and critically thinking about other humans&#x27; art. So, the answer ultimately lies in you.</div><br/><div id="37415656" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37415656" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">woolion</span><span>|</span><a href="#37414840">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37415357">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37415631">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37415656">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37415656">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great analysis, that hits a number of very good points!<p>In particular it&#x27;s interesting that you call the first category &quot;uninspired&quot; rather than &quot;lacking skills&quot;. A lot of people equate this &quot;uninspired&quot; category with &quot;lacking in personal expression&quot;. Typically a really skillful artist can generally make something absolutely mechanical _feel_ personal, whereas an unskilled artist cannot make anything sound personal. There are also specific genres that skew the perception in one way or the other, that will change the threshold of skill for something to be considered &quot;personal&quot; or not.<p>The second category is interesting if you can identify how problems introduced by the rule-breaking elements could be solved. Any &quot;art rule&quot; solves a problem, and determining an alternative solution for it can lead to a breakthrough. Keyword is &quot;can&quot;, there&#x27;s a lot of experiment required.

The characters were one-dimensional clichés who died just as quickly as they arrived. There was no continuity at all, no foreshadowing, and a snap ending. Even more impressively, suspension of disbelief was impossible because it jumped around like a fucking ping-pong-ball without any purpose, detail, or depth; saying &quot;fuck you&quot; to the entire genre of magical realism. In addition, it was marketed as a sci-fi western romance novel mystery adventure detective novel. Also, they had a terrible editor. But thankfully, they also had a terrible literary agent, so no one but a retired grandmother of 5 read it after purchasing it without thinking for 50 cents at the library&#x27;s book sale. The end.<p>PS: Also, have a plain dust jacket. Never nuclear pink, orange, or yellow.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

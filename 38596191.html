To get a good job you have to publish lots of papers. To publish you have to have statistically significant results. To get into top journals you need surprising results. You see other people in your field playing fast and loose with their data and getting rewarded for it. Why not exclude that one problematic subject from your data analysis? Without them the p-value (from a regression on a carefully chosen eight of your eleven measured variables) drops to .038, and you can publish...<p>It’s not that nobody thought to teach the scientists about corrections for multiple comparisons or the dangers of picking observations to exclude as outliers based on what gives you the result you want. They learned all those things. But it’s so much harder to get results when you’re not willing to play games with the data, and they need results. The people who do try to play by the rules wash out, either by choice after getting fed up with the fraud they see all around them or by failing to publish N papers in top journals.</div><br/><div id="38598818" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38598818" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">abyssin</span><span>|</span><a href="#38596865">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38597062">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38597110">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38598818">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38598818">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">[delayed]</div><br/></div></div><div id="38597110" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38597110" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chongli</span><span>|</span><a href="#38596865">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38597062">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38598818">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38596970">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38597110">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38597110">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why aren&#x27;t we cleaning house?

Schools (at least my school) really expected you to learn fundamentals as their tests would not just be a variation of the problems taught in the lectures but a unique twist on the concept itself.

In addition, most college majors do not need it, they need an understanding of statistics, and a much better understanding of &#x27;business math&#x27; and algebra. I think dividing kids into two or more tracks does not hurt them, because they can always take extra course work in college if they ultimately decide they want to pursue STEM. Where it hurts them are the standardized tests, this seems to be the issue.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38597556" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38597556" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">antod</span><span>|</span><a href="#38596911">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38597157">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38597205">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38597556">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38597556">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Same experience 17 yrs earlier and not in the US.

In an argumentative essay you could hide flawed thinking with wordplay and any ways the logical accuracy of the argument only forms a small part of the grade but with advanced math there is no place to hide flawed logical thinking…there being a single correct answer, and the fact that math is a language that is designed first and foremost to eliminate ambiguity, means it’s hard to get away with sloppy thinking.<p>Advanced math that isn’t necessarily useful in your college career is absolutely essential to teach high quality thinking.<p>A statistics course, on the other hand, will almost certainly devolve into the practical and the useful, so much like high school physics will not teach thinking but simply knowing how to apply the right formula at the right time.

Honestly it looked quite a lot like the math that I learned in school, give or take. I took exactly the same school math subjects.<p>The one noticeable difference was that my kids did virtually no proofs. When I was in school, my district used a &quot;new math&quot; curriculum that introduced sets in first grade, and included derivations and proofs. (I&#x27;d call a derivation a lightweight proof). High school geometry was almost 100% proofs, and it was a class that a lot of students remembered as their favorite.<p>My kids: No proofs. They solved lots of problems where they were expected to inspect a problem, choose an algorithm, then crunch through it to an answer.<p>Proofs were what made math come alive for me. I could crunch numbers in science class, or on a computer, as I learned programming in 11th grade. I ended up majoring in math, and then added a physics major as well.<p>Math is an extremely confusing and fraught topic for parents, because we all viscerally know it&#x27;s important for some reason, but nobody can really put their finger on why. Some parents treat it as a form of obedience training, or expect that it will magically confer special thinking skills. We know math is a sorting hat for getting into vaunted STEM programs in college.<p>Very few people use their school math after they finish school. In school, it&#x27;s treated as a tournament, to reach &quot;levels&quot; and get good &quot;scores.&quot; Many of the brightest kids are repelled by this. I would have been.<p>The college math topics are the same as they&#x27;ve been for 50 years. A number of years ago, in between jobs, I taught an introductory math course at a Big Ten university, and the students didn&#x27;t touch a computer for the entire course. My office didn&#x27;t have a network connection.<p>If it were up to me, I&#x27;d add a lot more computation and data work to K-12 math. And I&#x27;d bring back proofs. I envision a balance of four quadrants, not in any particular sequence, but perhaps in a cycle:<p>1. Arithmetic, which is symbol manipulation up through calculus<p>2. Computation, which is using computers to solve problems<p>3. Working with data<p>4. &quot;Theory&quot; which I associate with proofs and abstract topics<p>My advice as a parent is, first, be prepared for them to follow their own interests. This might include not being interested in math. Be prepared to help them deal with the competition, and to not let it cause them to lose interest. Next, treat it as something interesting and fun at home, separate from grinding through problems.</div><br/><div id="38597008" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38597008" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jmye</span><span>|</span><a href="#38596854">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38596948">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38596982">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38597008">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38597008">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’d just add to this excellent comment that, when I was in school a few decades ago, we also did essentially no proofs.

You either have the mental capability to turn a problem into a set of instructions that can be coded (and then grind through the syntax and language specifics) or you don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not that young anymore, so my first formal programming course was in college (at the time when pretty much every stem student had a computer at home, some even a laptop for college), but it was just like this... with zero correlation to math grades, some would understand the concept and break the &quot;idea&quot; down to basics programmable steps, and some would get stuck at the &quot;design&quot; phase.<p>Also, this was basic programming... eg. fibonacci sequence, so they could explain recursion after that. Basically, some would understand &quot;ok, I have to start at zero and go on, but i don&#x27;t need to remember just the last two numbers, so two variables, previous and previousprevious, and a loop,...&quot; (and then debug the for loop since it starts at zero, and &lt;= was used for n or whatever), and some would get stuck in a mental loop, if they have a &quot;n&quot;, how do they get the previous two numbers, if they need previous numbers for those too.<p>So this is way before the level of patterns and generalizations, where you need the subject matter knowledge to even know, if you should fit the curve to a straight line or some higher function.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

Perhaps it is too basic for anybody that has a few hundred games of chess under their belt but if you know nothing about the game, it is a great way to get into it. As the author say, low level chess is about learning patterns and short-term strategy (what should I do the opening, how to checkmate with a rook, etc.) and this app teaches exactly that, in a gradual way.<p>Not affiliated, just a happy and now paying user.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38692917" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38692917" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">washmyelbows</span><span>|</span><a href="#38693169">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38692832">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38692917">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38692917">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Only about 10% of players ever gain more than 100 points, and only about 1% of players gain more than 200 rating points given years.&quot;<p>This seems like a wild claim.

Your brain goes completely into pattern matching mode and lose out on the actual interesting tactical analysis you can do when you&#x27;re taking a bit more time. I have been queueing up daily games instead and it&#x27;s nice. Games take a month to resolve but if you just continuously add to the queue that&#x27;s good.<p>EDIT:<p>&gt; I learned a bunch of openings with White for 6 months or so, also via Chessable. Amazingly I won more games with Black, where I had learned nothing, than with White. I got frustrated with this, and switched my openings entirely. It had literally no impact on my rating, and I continued to improve.<p>I felt this so much recently. I got kind of obsessed with the Evans gambit, and would still lose to people who would play into the gambit and let me go down the lines I knew well. I&#x27;d just flummox later on.

Chess is a very overrated game that&#x27;s overglorified to the limit and it&#x27;s an unhealthy addiction for a lot of people and I think modern media needs to stop flaunting Chess as something of a high-horse type of thing.<p>To put simply, I believe Chess is good as something of a brain exercise for when you&#x27;re younger or if you are a parent and want to develop your child&#x27;s logical thinking and that&#x27;s it, no more and no less.<p>So what happens if you take Chess further?<p>People don&#x27;t know when to stop and I&#x27;ve seen with my eyes this happen because there was this kid at Chess tournaments who was a much better player than I am, however the kid just lived Chess, there was nothing else to the kid, he was socially very unintelligent &amp; awkward, didn&#x27;t really do much anything else since his parents shoved him to Chess when he was 6 and made it a daily routine thing for him to focus on Chess and his school studies. Gradually, Chess took over his entire identity and he&#x27;s now a titled player and from people who see him on an everyday basis, they all still don&#x27;t say much about this now-adult other than that he&#x27;s still just focused on Chess. The general sentiment of everyone who knows this kid is just pity because it&#x27;s just a very one-dimensional life. He achieved success but it sacrificed a lot of his childhood, and for what?<p>Chess players, even titled ones don&#x27;t really make a lot of money from tournaments and if you want to be good at it and play at tournaments, you have to dedicate basically all your time to it and have good discipline to keep at it, day after day. There&#x27;s the coach hustle but that also requires you to  be at least above average and also I haven&#x27;t met a coach who&#x27;s not just living Chess so it&#x27;s about the same, you still get sucked into this lifestyle.<p>Chess at a higher level is pretty draw-ish and ultimately a memorization contest. Most strong players will not slip up if given a slight advantage and they will be able to convert this slight advantage into at least a draw. Strong players already have a good grasp on tactical motifs and can spot opportunities easily but that&#x27;s where Chess theory comes into play. There&#x27;s many openings and every opening has variations, which have optimal moves and then of course inaccurate moves and blunders. Just Sicilian theory is enough for someone to spend years of their life memorizing moves and building a repertoire.<p>Ultimately, Chess doesn&#x27;t get more fun the stronger you get and that&#x27;s counter-intuitive because people want to get better. I played Chess for a few years both casually and professionally, I won some tropheys and have some medals to show for it. I beat titled players (2300+ rated) but I quit all of it to focus on software engineering because Chess got boring. For me, Chess got to a point where further improvement depended on memorizing opening theory, middlegame theory and endgame theory. Just memorize and nothing more. I refused to do that so I often drawn&#x2F;lost games in situations where I played less than ideal moves and my opponent knew the theory to punish my very slight inaccuracy. What I liked in Chess was the calculation, so something like Fischer Chess (Chess960) was fun but did you know people actually made theory even for that? So games got more and more boring, in casual games I would purposefully play bad moves to throw my opponent off their theory and to get into unknown territory in terms of tactics. I&#x27;d do that just to try to make the game fun again, but obviously I was burned out and there was no coming back from it.<p>In my country I am friends with a lot of Chess people. I saw a lot of things, like titled players throwing games for .. $10-$20. They spent about 20-30 years of their life to get good at Chess and now they have to throw games for money. Do I want to be that guy? How does it feel to study and play something for 30-40 years then just have to throw games for $20? Probably awful.<p>Also, general health-wise, most Chess players I know are sedentary, playing Chess isn&#x27;t really healthy as you are sat in a chair for hours on end. It&#x27;s very competitive, which can lead to stress and stress just leads to burnout often.<p>To end this post, I want to say that I luckily didn&#x27;t keep on this path. In my opinion, life needs variety and so I have done much more and I am happier than the years I spent on Chess. Studied hard, got a job as a software engineer, went on many vacations, enjoyed food &amp; drinks everywhere, had friends&#x2F;love come and go, played many games, read books and watched movies and I just lived a more fulfilling life than my past Chess lifestyle because it&#x27;s frankly, a stark contrast between the two.<p>TLDR: Trying to logically explain my distaste for Chess in modern times.</div><br/><div id="38693329" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38693329" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sph</span><span>|</span><a href="#38693230">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38693389">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38693329">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38693329">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sounds like you have terrible experience with being forced to explore one&#x27;s talent for the game, but I dont think that deep of an history with it can provide an objective assessment of the game: any hobby taken to the extreme, maniacal and methodical level stops becoming a hobby, and turns into work. There is this widespread notion that the deeper you go, the more enjoyable it is and it is utter nonsense. Even in gaming, the concept of minmaxing, which is antithetical to <i>enjoying</i> a game, is encouraged, but all it does is turn a fun pastime into spreadsheets and hard effort for asymptotic gain.<p>On the other hard I had ignored the game for all my adulthood because I felt, <i>in my ignorance</i>, that it was a game too hard to get into.

I thought that an average smart person and particularly someone with a scientific background could reach that resalt in one or two months.<p>My experience.

I have no idea of my ELO then, there was no internet in the early &#x27;80s.
I have not played for roughly 40 years. I few years ago I started playing on lichess and my ELO is now around 1700 (with a peak of 1900).

The others who were on this job because the compensation was hefty - they were likely to opt out to a manager. I am not saying that hobby-devs are better people or co-worker.

As a result, despite being offered lead positions several times, I’ve always declined.

This is worth so much for a company. Developers in the middle of their careers are dangerous: they can achieve a lot, but they can easily veer off on a tangent and spend months on some interesting challenge instead of on what the business needs.<p>If every developer moved &quot;up&quot; to management after a few years, only mediocre programmers would be actually writing code (which is partly true). I&#x27;ve become chief engineer recently, but I had already been leading other developers for a while... but I keep writing lots of code, despite frequent interruptions to assist others... I can see how others often go in undesired directions if not guided back to focus on what is important. I am very glad my company has recognized that I can do that but knows me well enough to understand my strong point is coding, not managing. I am sure Apple and many other companies are also aware that a very experienced developer still writing code with others is worth a lot more than in some miserable (for them) management position.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36028542" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36028542" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">oefrha</span><span>|</span><a href="#36027943">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36028080">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36026983">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36028542">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36028542">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In (one) theory, pressuring everyone to always move up results in everyone eventually stuck in a role they are not good at.</div><br/><div id="36028606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36028606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">amelius</span><span>|</span><a href="#36027943">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36028542">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36026983">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36028606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36028606">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Peter principle.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36026983" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36026983" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cheschire</span><span>|</span><a href="#36027943">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36028682">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36026983">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36026983">[15 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I once had a PM who told me coding was just a stepping stone to them in their career.

Well-performing code was highly valued at that company.

There is whole lot of rest of the life out there. Go where you want, how you want to, immerse yourself into something only as much you want, there doesn&#x27;t have to be a scale of &quot;passion&quot; you have to conform to.<p>It is so tiring and frustrating to keep encountering this mindset so often. Luckily my generation is genuinely starting to stop giving a fuck about this and the newer generation is more vigorous in rejecting of &quot;your work has to be your passion&quot; regressive mindset.</div><br/><div id="36027665" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36027665" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">linguae</span><span>|</span><a href="#36027298">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36027555">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36028051">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36027665">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36027665">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I understand this point of view.  Unfortunately, for those who entered computing out of a passion for it, it’s difficult to work for employers or managers where computing isn’t a passion.  This leads to all sorts of practices that suck the joy out of programming (e.g., Leetcode, meetings, KPIs, PIPs, certain design decisions, etc.), reducing it to a corporate “monkey dance.”  Maybe I have rose-colored glasses, or maybe I’m simply expecting too much from employment, but it seems to me that back in the 80s and 90s there was a lot more passion in the field compared to today.  The pressure and the constraints are enough to make me want to change occupations at times away from computing and treat it as solely a hobby or as a side venture, except I can’t think of any other occupation that pays enough to live in America’s expensive cities that doesn’t require returning to graduate school and getting into five or six more figures of debt for a professional degree.</div><br/><div id="36027745" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36027745" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bruce511</span><span>|</span><a href="#36027298">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36027665">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36028012">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36027745">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36027745">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think you&#x27;re getting vloser to the root issue.<p>You can work with passionate people.

Not because I want to offload people who are just looking for a quick buck onto those fields, but because I sometimes find that people with the right skills just take the long way around to transition into those roles. (I&#x27;ve even seen this happen once with a UX designer, but I think artistic people mostly know to try for those roles.)
People don&#x27;t really consider the fact that it is a successful industry, but there are more roles in the industry than just developer.

The real problem is how LOUD money has become in &#x27;tech&#x27; in the last several decades. When I started undergrad ~10 years ago, at a small school not known for anything Math or CS, there were still a lot of students who entered the CS program because they heard, from their family the internet or the world at large, that it was &quot;a good job&quot;. (This also stems from college being seen as &#x27;job prospect&#x27; improvement as opposed to something for learning, but that discussion lies elsewhere.)<p>I got lucky that I liked it. Most of them would drop out of the program &#x2F; transfer to a different area of focus within a year or so. There were probably somewhere around 50-60 people in my low level CS courses. My graduating CS cohort was 9.<p>Despite liking it, I still find little desire to tinker on things outside of work. A large part of it is that it _is_ my job. I don&#x27;t want to work, then go home and &#x27;work&#x27; for &#x27;fun&#x27;.<p>The other part of it is, as mentioned by others here, the parts of software a lot of us enjoy the most aren&#x27;t usually what we get to focus on, in one way or another.<p>&gt; I want to work with more people who LOVE software and find the development of machines and the code that runs on them as fascinating as I do. Unfortunately, its less and less these days.<p>I get the impression most of this is going to be exclusive to small projects, teams, and in particular startups.

It both was and wasn’t like the day job I had left behind.<p>This is one reasons I got disillusioned with FIRE and the concept of early retirement. Programming was my first love. There might be phases where I just get sick of technology, but most of them have proven to be temporary. It&#x27;s the best, the most versatile medium of my creative energy. I don&#x27;t plan to stop doing it ever. What I actually dislike is the corporatisation of programming—JIRA Tasks, PRD, Stand-up meetings, Stakeholder meetings.<p>I don&#x27;t want early retirement. I want to work in a small team with a good product vision and a strong shipping culture. But it has proven to rare in my professional experience. For me, alternative is to keep taking breaks. Few months, once in a while, to work and experiment on my own ideas.

The number of projects where success depends on skill and passion, and this is actually understood&#x2F;realized by anyone, isn&#x27;t large.

During my high school and undergraduate years I was inspired by stories of researchers at Bell Labs and Xerox PARC who invented so many fundamental technologies and had a profound impact on computing.  I was also inspired by the great computers of the past (especially NeXT) and was excited about each and every release of Mac OS X.<p>Now that I’m more than a decade removed from my undergraduate years, I find myself disillusioned with the state of computing and research these days.  Neither Apple nor Microsoft seem to care about pushing personal computing further anymore; it’s about maintaining and strengthening their cash cows.  Google, Meta, and Amazon don’t impress me like they did a decade ago, when I used to joyfully study the research papers describing the interesting infrastructure they built.  The days of places like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC where researchers generally had free reign to pursue their ideas are long gone; industrial research today is very business-focused, where researchers are required to put the interests of the company ahead of their personal research interests.  Academia is no better; the competition is high (especially at research universities), the pay is low (especially at teaching universities), and there are pressures not only to publish regularly, but to raise grant money, which naturally curbs research freedom.  This is the world I find myself navigating; I found myself training and striving for a career that no longer exists.<p>I’m still thinking about long-term plans for me to pursue the type of career that I want despite today’s environment.  America’s high cost of living makes FIRE difficult for me unless I decide to “grind Leetcode” and join a FAANG to optimize my compensation, and even that strategy may be obsolete in 2023 due to layoffs and hiring freezes.  Alternatively, I’m thinking about one day starting a bootstrapped business, one that is profitable enough to be able to fund my living expenses and to provide healthy wages and benefits for my staff.  One day I’ll make enough money to where I can enough savings to be able to pursue my own research projects without having to worry about publish-or-perish pressures or about business matters.  I’d like to also teach on the side, though due to low adjunct wages I don’t want to pursue that as my main job.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36027003" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36027003" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">deepzn</span><span>|</span><a href="#36026913">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36027071">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36026985">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36027003">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36027003">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There are many interpretations and meanings of this Japanese phrase called Ikigai but in a basic sense it means &quot;life purpose&quot;.

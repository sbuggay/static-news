No-one, not even the smartest human, can <i>dwell</i> in more than a few places at once because to dwell in a place is as much about the people and emergent social structures there as it is about the tech. Maybe we dwell in one or two places, and then <i>skim</i> the rest, to do integration work. We become &quot;users&quot; of these other spaces, visitors, not natives. The OP is unusual because they dwelt in so many places, which is quite rare, I think.<p>Most people don&#x27;t <i>dwell</i> anywhere, I suspect. I wouldn&#x27;t feel too bad about pulling back - it actually sounds exhausting. Maybe one day you&#x27;ll rejoin a particularly important space, and focus on really being part of that group long-term.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35926039" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35926039" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">solatic</span><span>|</span><a href="#35926373">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35925735">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35926039">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35926039">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Broadly speaking, I&#x27;ve found two kinds of mailing lists: help-focused, and develop-the-next-version-focused.<p>Help-focused mailing lists lead to quick boredom and burnout for anyone who isn&#x27;t deeply invested in the growth of the underlying project, e.g. core maintainers who use the questions to improve the project documentation, or who is otherwise paid to respond, e.g. professional support.<p>Development-focused mailing lists have a strong tendency to turn into bikeshedding. Everybody who joins the mailing list is entitled to voice their opinion, everybody who subscribes to the mailing list is forced to listen to that opinion, and moderators have little power (outside of bans, which are rarely employed due to reputational risk to the moderator) to coerce the topic of discussion back on track to a more productive place. So core maintainers are incentivized to move development discussion to a more private forum, which is hidden from you.<p>Eventually, I realized that what I actually wanted was (a) use boring, battle-tested tech, where I typically don&#x27;t need minute-by-minute updates since any such updates are focused on extreme edge cases that probably don&#x27;t apply to me, (b) subscribe me to feature-focused + security-focused release notes that I can skim on the relatively uncommon occurrences that there is actually a new feature&#x2F;security release, (c) subscribe me to bug-focused release notes on bugs that I&#x27;ve explicitly opted-in to be notified on, because I&#x27;ve encountered those bugs, (d) a private forum to discuss day-to-day development on the projects that I&#x27;m actually working on (and that my colleagues are actually working on).

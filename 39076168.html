They aren&#x27;t on the lookout for straight arrows to hire, they&#x27;re on the lookout for people who can be blackmailed to steal information. Once things like simple weed possession became nothing more than a small civil penalty, there wasn&#x27;t any way to use the threat of exposure as a way of blackmailing someone.

The FBI fires gay people, so they had to fire them to prevent them from leaking information because of possible blackmail. But once they stopped firing them for homosexuality there was no need to fire them because of fear they might be blackmailed because of the possibility to fire them. It&#x27;s probably true for gambling, but the rest sounds like whitewashing.

Half of silicon valley allegedly is micro-dosing all sorts of things and apparently benefiting from that. Steve Jobs famously advocated using LSD.  The Vietnam war famously had a lot of drug abuse. WW II soldiers and leadership were consuming epic amounts of amphetamines. And that wasn&#x27;t just the Nazis.<p>Companies aren&#x27;t testing for this because they couldn&#x27;t care less. Drugs isn&#x27;t killing their business and they like having access to smart people who might fail a test. The main reason testing is more common in the public sector is not that drugs are bad but that the optics of people using drugs has negative political consequences when political leaders are waging this war on drugs. Also with drugs being illegal, using them necessarily means breaking the law and interacting with criminals. Which looks bad politically as well.<p>Remote work is different. People and companies disagree about the effects but a lot of companies seem to prefer having their people not work remotely. Not because of the way it looks but because of at least the perception of its impact on productivity. Whether you agree with that or not doesn&#x27;t matter. Some people are concerned about it and acting accordingly.<p>The inequality here relates mainly to the value of the work people do. Just like companies don&#x27;t like losing access to people who are smart and may use drugs, they also don&#x27;t like losing access to people who have valuable skills that insist on working remotely. So they allow some people to work remotely. But of course some skills are more valuable than others so the inequality mainly relates to how easy it is to replace people with more compliant ones.</div><br/><div id="39076585" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39076585" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">freddie_mercury</span><span>|</span><a href="#39076395">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39076541">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39076688">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39076585">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39076585">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Perhaps a reason for this is that not everybody agrees that drugs are all that bad<p>As an explanation, this is implausible to the point of impossible.<p>The same employers drug test lower-level employees but (e.g. in the warehouse) but don&#x27;t test other employees (e.g. in the office).<p>Amazon drug tests warehouse workers but not AWS engineers.<p>It is difficult to come up for a coherent theory for that that includes &quot;as an organisation, we don&#x27;t think drugs are all that bad&quot;</div><br/><div id="39076650" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39076650" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chii</span><span>|</span><a href="#39076395">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39076585">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39076679">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39076650">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39076650">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">obviously it is the belief of upper management that low level workers cannot be trusted to behave and work to their maximum if they&#x27;re on drugs, while the &quot;elites&quot; require such drugs to reach their maximum potential.</div><br/><div id="39076684" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39076684" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">calvinmorrison</span><span>|</span><a href="#39076395">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39076650">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39076679">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39076684">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39076684">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No its because usually low level jobs require you to operate heavy machinery like driving a truck or operating a forklift or work on the floor of the factory, or being around those things.

If you think about retail and food service, people churn in and out fast. The culture evolves quicker than you’d normally expect because of the people changing and many adaptations to new management, policies, technologies, etc. It’s become common place for workers to just not be present at all in these settings. Nobody to ask where to find something and certainly nobody trustworthy enough to ask about a products features&#x2F; or for a recommendation. The employees on the floor are likely preoccupied by something else like stocking shelves and it’s as if you’re interrupting them to ask as any question. So new employees come on board and they’re never taught how to help customers. Then they get promoted and maybe they know the POS the best but they can’t deal with customers well. They’re responsible for hiring and training new hires. So since they don’t value customer service, they don’t mind when new hire wants to wear AirPods while stocking. Now suddenly everyone is wearing AirPods while working. So you literally are interrupting them as a customer. They have to pause their podcast to have you repeat the question you already asked 3 times while trying to get their attention. It’s likely they don’t know how to help you if you really do need help did solving your problem is not their default, they think shrugging and saying I don’t know is acceptable and you’re on your own.<p>This happens over and over and now a workforce that’s too ambivalent to be productively helpful to customers experiences. Not even proactively in common sense ways. An example I’ve run into a couple time from quick service food joints goes like this. I order a fountain drink with my food. Pay, walk to drink machine that’s out of order. I ask clerk if there’s anything else to drink, they say no. I then ask why they sold me a fountain drink if they know machine is broken? I tell them I want a refund. They say they don’t know how. Takes 15 minutes and a manager to get the refund. As I’m waiting, cashier continues selling fountain drinks to customers in line.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39076673" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39076673" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">starttoaster</span><span>|</span><a href="#39076502">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39076604">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39076782">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39076595">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39076673">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39076673">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Neither paid well at all, and never did I get this sense of jealousy.<p>You might just not be one of these people. For some people, the feeling of being on your way to work is an existential dread. Or like you&#x27;re leaving your life behind to live a different one that you don&#x27;t generally enjoy for a while. Some of those people would likely do anything to avoid that feeling. I think for those people, working from home is epic. You get to go to work every day on what feels more like your terms and your life, whatever that life may be. Instead of molding myself into the image of my work environment every day, I can mold my workplace more into myself. Feeding me into:<p>&gt; but it was far from the giant sun lit home offices people seem to imagine.<p>For some people, the ideal working conditions are a dimly lit basement, believe it or not.<p>&gt; [The generally unhappy state of front line workers yesteryear and this one.]<p>Just 10 years ago, I was working front lines at a Super Target, making 15 cents above my state&#x27;s minimum wage, which amounted to something like $8.50&#x2F;hour. I&#x27;m in general a fairly.. well &quot;stoic&quot; might be the nicer word.. person, so faking a smile for the sake of a stranger&#x27;s comfort would have cost me more in energy than my employer was paying me, if that makes sense. That&#x27;s not to say I&#x27;m a jerk to people on purpose, by any means. But if I&#x27;m in a bad mood because I left for work at 4:30AM to make barely more than enough for a room to rent, peanut butter sandwiches, and my cell phone bill, it would have been difficult to summon the strength. This is mostly just to say that I agree with your observation, but I empathize more with the employees than the customers who feel they were under-helped.<p>Observations from someone who will be entering the middling ages soon.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39076595" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39076595" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hutzlibu</span><span>|</span><a href="#39076502">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39076555">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39076604">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39076522">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39076595">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39076595">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;I don&#x27;t think those are the kinds of jobs that have workers that expect to work from home.&quot;<p>I think especially for forklift drivers and alike - this is about to change.

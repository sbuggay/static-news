This may be slightly off-topic, but I&#x27;m pretty serious when I suggest getting feedback and ideas from an Indian aunty&#x2F;uncle who has done and helped arrange or take primary roles in weddings in their families. Here in India, for all significant events, there is always an aunt&#x2F;uncle who knows everything, and everyone asks that person.<p>Looking at the website and seeing Tables numbered less than ten by default, I realized this targets people who invite their best friends and relatives and strictly choose who they want to see at their events.<p>One of my friend’s father was that uncle. I once asked him how he knows everything and can organize everything. He writes a lot and writes them down and refers to those writing when he thinks. If I asked him something, he is thinking about his notes in the back of his mind. Once, he gave me directions to go and send out over 50 paper invitation cards. My journey was precise and in perfect sequence, including the cow traps to avoid, the gates I might encounter, and the homes with dogs (so I call out before entering). This is in the 90s, with no phone, while I ride a bicycle to deliver those invites with no marked address on roads I had never traveled, in an Indian rural town.</div><br/><div id="38852016" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38852016" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">teejae</span><span>|</span><a href="#38851103">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38846983">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38852016">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38852016">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yea, I would love to hear from one of those aunty&#x2F;uncles!

A few remarks from that experience that might be helpful:<p>1. Versions matter - she&#x27;d often make a draft and want to tell me &quot;ok tell me if you like this better than the previous version&quot;. Id just compare the cells above to the cells below.<p>2. We organized people based on common interests - these people are very into music, these are very into home renovations, these people work in tech...etc. Tagging people with &quot;attributes&quot; and letting the system try optimize for as much overlap as possible would have been amazing.<p>3. Warn me of duplicates - sometimes in the copy paste madeness, we&#x27;d double up someone.<p>4. Import - We almost missed someone due to me skipping a line in the initial transription of their name into the spreadsheet.<p>5. At the end of the day guests need to find their seat. I made a QR code that linked to a website where people could type their name to find their table (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;andrewmcgrath.info&#x2F;wedding" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;andrewmcgrath.info&#x2F;wedding</a>) we didn&#x27;t want to use a big board, it was 1 more thing to make (the website was a 2 hr project i did the day before) and the QR codes were just print outs we put in dollar store photo frames at the entrance, the bar and at the end of the day...we got great feedback over this.

We had a lot of Andrew&#x27;s (including me) but we didn&#x27;t have any identical matches if we included last names (which fortunatly everyone had). I guess as long as you can acknowledge them and have the warnings go away that would be enough.<p>Checkout the UX of the auto-complete for that website i made. My goal was so it would basically find your table as quick as possible, and the website is designed only for phones as i assumed the number of guests that brought a laptop would be somewhat limited :P<p>I considered turning that website into it&#x27;s own little startup, but frankly, the idea of running a business with no repeat customers (or...with a duration between purchases so low that i&#x27;d basically be acquiring them every time) was not very attractive to me.

It&#x27;s a task that must be a opinion for wedding planners, since the couple have to do it, and they put it off (cause its hard).<p>Making it friction free for the couple (the planner pays, the couple use a planner assigned login), plus making it easy, allows the planner to gather the information from the couple, and then keep pushing plans at them.<p>A simple guest-list integration (suggested, invited, rsvpd) seems like the next step, and I expect diet requirements etc.<p>Then again I expect this software already exists and existing planners already use it, so this route may be full. Do some research first.<p>I agree that &quot;plan your own wedding&quot; .com would be hard to sell because it&#x27;s one-time customers so acquisition cost us high, and lifetime value per customer is low.

Then we used that physical layout at the entrance to show people where they are seated. Most of the work was actually cutting out the names, finding them in the pile, physically placing them, ... So I guess if someone just made a beautiful drag-and-drop UI and let the user do the optimization work, and ignore implementing all the &quot;smart stuff&quot;, that would work for many people.

This is only an asymptotic argument. For &quot;small&quot; size, these problems can be tackled. People routinely solve this type of problem (namely: mixed-integer optimization problems), with up to hundreds of thousands of variables, to proven optimality, in a matter of minutes (see [1]).

Additionally, dogs and kennels are both color-coded and certain types of dogs can only stay in certain types of kennels. Some dogs cannot share a kennel at all; kennels have a max limit of 1, 2 or 3 dogs; and some kennels are premium-priced.<p>In practice, the &quot;optimal&quot; solution depends on what you&#x27;re optimizing for. In my case, it was maximizing the number of dogs that could board on any given night. This involved looking for open paths - since dogs can be moved around daily if necessary. Then rule out any based on the constraints: Prevent enemy conflict, limit to max occupancy, etc. After that, the preference is for boarding them in a kennel with a friend if possible, however there are trade-offs here in whether this creates too many extra moves... e.g. if a friend is coming in for one night of a dog&#x27;s 7-night stay, we don&#x27;t prefer to move. So the third priority, which occasionally overrides the second priority, is minimizing the number of moves which add work for employees. To do that, we look for the longest stretch open at each move branch, ranking them by number of friends descending, barring any with enemies.<p>As you can imagine, this was way too complicated and branching, so the system prunes the option tree at each <i>necessary</i> move down to a few dozen possibilities and continues down each of those paths, then ranks all the paths for the user to choose from.<p>In other words, a lot of the decisions for optimizing it (in the non-mathematical sense) were about limiting its output to a manageable number of reasonably good choices. Enemies create a hard limit on the number of spots available.

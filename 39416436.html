If you put in the time on the questions, which was inherently fun, the people who match highly with you are almost always extraordinarily good matches, with very good response rates. My initial response rate was something absurd, and when I got unprompted inquiries they were great. Rather than play a numbers game, I picked my spots and fully customized my messages, and it paid off. Positive experiences abound. Everyone constantly complains that it is gone.<p>&gt; So, what if we simply created it again, the way it used to be? Do not reinvent the wheel, unless the wheel is lost, in which case by all means go reinvent it, people need wheels.</i></div><br/></div></div><div id="39417323" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39417323" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">account-5</span><span>|</span><a href="#39417386">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39417319">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39417323">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39417323">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I definitely don&#x27;t have 57 to 73 minutes to read this article.

I had a relationship that affected me horribly in college, that took me 2 years to get over. Whatever you&#x27;re thinking of, it was worse, and totally ruined my trust in people.<p>Then I was like eh, fuck this shit because I was in early career and couldn&#x27;t afford to get mentally messed up again like that. So that was another two years. Cue Covid where I was busy trying to get a startup off the ground and dealing with the simultaneous end of the world and then financially recovering from not getting said startup off the ground.<p>Then, I got into my groove again and now I&#x27;m doing superbly. In fact I am probably only really ready and able to date now. So we&#x27;re talking 2016-2024, 8 years of singleness.<p>I was (honestly still could be) very content being single, it&#x27;s pretty great. I do whatever I want, whenever I want. I have a few close friends for my support and a few more social acquaintances I do stuff with. I make a lot of money for a 29 year old, I have hobbies and workout regularly. Honestly, as a person I feel pretty complete. I don&#x27;t strongly feel like I need another person to complete me, but I do want another person in my life now.<p>I suspect a lot of people have just had a lot of heavy shit going on for the last bit of time, and like, the responsible thing isn&#x27;t to throw your heavy shit onto someone else. Aside from that it takes a lot of energy, focus and caring to grow a relationship and like that&#x27;s really hard to do when you&#x27;re busy picking yourself up off the floor or just trying to stay treading water.<p>Anyway, fast forward to the current dating scene. It kind of blows. Online dating is entirely asymmetric for guys, and interactions are low quality. I get like 3-5 matches a week which as I hear it is a pretty good rate for a guy. Of those matches the quality of conversation is non-existant. &quot;You&#x27;re cute, let&#x27;s grab coffee.&quot; is what I&#x27;ve been defaulting to now because out of 20-25 matches in the last month I&#x27;ve had literally one engaging conversation. I totally understand why people self select out of that nonsense. I&#x27;m just starting to go to events now, because I have no issue walking up to someone and asking them out and at least this article shows that should be a way more sane way to date.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39417244" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39417244" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">earlone</span><span>|</span><a href="#39417378">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39417244">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39417244">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As the great american philosopher Dan Bilzerian once said: &quot;Guys nowadays work 5 times harder to get a woman 20 times shittier than their grandfather got 50 years ago&quot;. This article doesn&#x27;t say anything relevant in today&#x27;s world. It says that men suck at relationships. Really ? thanks for the generalization. Like no women suck at relationships ? Like most women are good enough with sex to retain their partner ? Have you never met women having no decent skill to bring to a healthy relationship while expecting everything from the guy ? What about the evolution of the nature of relationships ? what about social networks &amp; dating sites failing to match compatible people to maintain their business model ? What about society expecting men &amp; women both working at least 40 to 50 hours per week and are still expected to have fun together in their spare time ?

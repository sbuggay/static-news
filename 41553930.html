Now with a few years of distance from this essay, I feel like AI is still in a zone where most &quot;non-human interactions&quot; are almost more recognizable. The internet at large seems to have gotten pretty good at spotting AI art and LLMs posting on sites. I&#x27;m not sure I can exactly describe what it is about the GPTbots, but they remain fairly obvious.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say we&#x27;re not still headed for something like this. I do think some of the most sensitive to this sort of crass misuse of platforms already got off when human-created ads and bots started becoming prevalent, so the question is if LLM-based bots are notably worse in a way that people care about differently.<p>I&#x27;m already a few steps down the &quot;logging off&quot; path at this point, but it&#x27;s unclear to me that I&#x27;m not the outlier here. I worry that there&#x27;s many people who are lonely and don&#x27;t have a better way to interact socially where they&#x27;re totally fine talking to some catfishing LLM that wants their money in some way or other.<p>It seems clear to me that a disconcerting amount of LLM startups are started by people who are, or are willing to take money from, people who see a relentlessly positive&#x2F;comforting&#x2F;sexually open faux human as their best way forward in life. Every week brings some new &quot;it&#x27;s a social network where everyone&#x27;s an LLM that&#x27;s nice to you&quot; or &quot;this app is your best friend&quot;. It just feels predatory to me in a way where even if it&#x27;s well intended, it feels like an admission or exploitation of a serious ill in our society.</div><br/><div id="41599183" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41599183" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">magic_hamster</span><span>|</span><a href="#41598788">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41598844">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41599183">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41599183">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The internet at large seems to have gotten pretty good at spotting AI art and LLMs posting on sites<p>I beg to differ. We are at a point where it&#x27;s almost impossible to know both art and conversation are AI generated. New models like Flux Pro will definitely fool you easily, this is it. The latest LLMs are also very good especially in short interactions to the point it&#x27;s impossible to know.

The rendering is impressive and looks like the output of a larger organization or a dedicated professional. But it&#x27;s just that. It feels a bit like most people don&#x27;t really interact with art, except on ads, movie poster and the like. And I guess those images are good for being displayed on a screen.<p>Maybe this (cliche) analogy will help my point. Art is like sex.

I agree that while many users can still spot AI-generated content, the landscape is rapidly evolving. It&#x27;s interesting to consider how LLMs have become more integrated into our online experiences, and I share your concern about the potential exploitation of vulnerable individuals.<p>That said, I think it&#x27;s essential to acknowledge that not everyone views these AI interactions negatively. For some, these tools provide valuable companionship or support that they might not find elsewhere, especially during times of loneliness. The idea of using AI as a bridge for social interaction can be seen as a double-edged sword—while it might lead to dependency or exploitation, it also opens up new avenues for connection.<p>Ultimately, the challenge lies in how these technologies are developed and marketed. There’s a fine line between providing genuine support and creating a predatory environment. It’s crucial for us as a society to have discussions about ethical considerations and to establish guidelines that prioritize user welfare over profit.<p>--<p>This response should provoke a range of opinions, encouraging discussions on both the potential benefits and drawbacks of AI in social contexts.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m not convinced. Reminds me of Billy Madison&#x27;s speech about the Industrial Revolution and the puppy that lost his way. I&#x27;m sure there are other agents&#x2F;prompts that could do better.<p>My prompt:<p>&quot;Create a response that 50&#x2F;50 hacker news commenters would agree with:
I&#x27;m genuinely curious if this will play out... &lt;top-level comment&gt;&quot;<p>Edit: Just for shits though...<p>&gt; Can you describe the AI revolution using an analogy to the Puppy who Lost his Way?<p>&gt; Certainly! Here’s an analogy that describes the AI revolution through the story of a puppy who lost his way:<p>The Puppy Who Lost His Way<p>Once upon a time, in a bustling town, there was a curious little puppy named Max. Max loved to explore and was always eager to discover new things. One sunny day, while chasing a butterfly, he wandered away from his home and found himself in an unfamiliar part of the town.<p>At first, Max was excited. He met new friends—a wise old dog, a playful kitten, and a clever rabbit. Each of them showed him different paths, each leading to new adventures. Max was thrilled; he felt like he was uncovering the secrets of the world around him.<p>However, as he explored further, Max began to realize that not all paths were safe. Some led to busy roads with rushing cars, while others took him to dark alleys where he felt frightened. Max found himself overwhelmed, longing for the comfort of his home. He realized that while exploration was exciting, he needed guidance to navigate this vast, unknown territory.<p>Just when he felt lost, he encountered a kind, experienced dog named Bella. Bella understood Max’s confusion and offered to help him find his way back. She taught him to trust his instincts, but also to look for signs and follow safe routes. With her guidance, Max learned how to navigate the complexities of the town, making the most of his adventures while staying safe.<p>As Max journeyed home with Bella, he discovered that the town was filled with opportunities. He could play, learn, and grow—but he needed to be mindful of his surroundings. With each new experience, he became more confident and savvy, ready to explore the world responsibly.<p>The AI Revolution<p>In this analogy, Max represents humanity at the dawn of the AI revolution. The initial excitement mirrors our enthusiasm for AI&#x27;s potential to explore and enhance various aspects of life. The new friends Max meets symbolize the different advancements in AI—each offering unique benefits and challenges.<p>However, just as Max faced dangers in his exploration, society must navigate the complexities and ethical dilemmas posed by AI technologies. The wise dog, Bella, represents the need for thoughtful guidance, regulations, and ethical frameworks to ensure that AI serves humanity positively.<p>Ultimately, like Max, we have the opportunity to embrace the AI revolution, exploring its vast possibilities while remaining mindful of our path. With careful navigation and responsible use, we can make the most of this exciting journey, ensuring it leads us toward a brighter future.</div><br/><div id="41599597" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41599597" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">grey-area</span><span>|</span><a href="#41598788">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41599303">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41599342">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41599597">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41599597">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Failed on the first phrase.

And he wryly observes that the ad agencies “would gladly pay the reader, listener, or viewer directly for his time and attention if they knew how to do so.” The absurdity of this proposition underscores the essentially mediated nature of human attention.&quot;<p>The class clearly shows how Human Attention is over exploited way before AI showed up.<p>All Human Attention is mostly directed towards Consumption, Status Signaling and Accumulation of Wealth through Mass Media&#x2F;Advertising&#x2F;Marketing&#x2F;PR&#x2F;Influencers etc.<p>There are examples in history where Human Attention at large scales can be directed towards things other than Consumption, Status Signaling, Accumulation of Wealth. A big one is Gandhi and his influence on a huge variety of people to live a simple life.<p>But ofcourse the moment charismatic leaders like that exits the stage, the Attention Allocation defaults back to status quo.<p>So we need very different leaders and a very different kind of Media and Advertising ecosystem to cause shifts in how finite Global Human Attention gets allocated. Lot of imagination is required. Unfortunately our most imaginative minds are in service of financial overlords and rent collectors to sell the plebs new iphones and more Star Wars movies, &quot;experiences&quot; and merch.</div><br/><div id="41599608" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41599608" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dragontamer</span><span>|</span><a href="#41599558">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41599087">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41599608">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41599608">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are you fake?<p>I&#x27;m not fake.<p>--------<p>The discussion here isn&#x27;t about traditional media (which has a lot of fakeness yes.

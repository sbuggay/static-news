My advisor listened to it. I’ve never listened to it, but it’s 15 minutes of him being dismantled by a bear. You can hear his arm being separated from his body in it. It’s the worst possible way to go.<p>God, I remember watching the scene in &quot;Grizzly Man&quot; in which Werner Herzog listens to this exact audio recording. It&#x27;s over headphones, but you can still faintly hear the screaming. Even via proxy, it&#x27;s very hard to stomach.<p>In Herzog&#x27;s own words:<p>&gt; It&#x27;s the most terrifying thing I&#x27;ve ever heard in my life.

Yeah, often they make stupid decisions and go into things unprepared. But they are willing to go into the unknown in a way the vast majority of society is not. They are trying to experience the world as humans throughout history have experienced the world. And their experience ending in their death isn&#x27;t the condemnation that people seem to think it is. Because that&#x27;s where we all end up. And they reached that point by doing things that were not just outside of their comfort zone but the comfort zone of every normie in this country. They are easy to ridicule from the safety of a youtube video, but these people actually lived in these places and experienced these things in a way the vast majority of modern humanity never will. It&#x27;s easy to judge. It&#x27;s far more difficult to live in a way that defies society. Even when those lives are cut short, I think it&#x27;s worth exploring and celebrating.

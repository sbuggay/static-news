Also not everyone can afford an office room to &quot;close out&quot; work to a separate physical place (which is a typical reply when this topic brought up) and I don&#x27;t even think it counts.<p>I personally like working in office because it&#x27;s where I work, and then I go home and that&#x27;s my home. I don&#x27;t work at home at all (and it&#x27;s a company policy everyone knows that). But I live in Europe, work is a 30 min bicycle drive from home which I also enjoy.

So if you wanted to come in, you reserved a desk, if you wanted to stay at home, that was fine.<p>Then the diktat came down from corporate headquarters: Everyone must be back in the office, unless their contract specifically said remote work.  Pitchforks!  Loads of objection from all the people who had gotten used to working from home and quite liked it.  And of course there was the problem that we didn&#x27;t actually have space for everyone.<p>Then an opportunity came up to get rid of our sub-lease on the current property, which could potentially simplify the process of getting a newer, larger office that could accommodate everyone; so word went out that <i>everyone</i> was going to go back to WFH for a period of time.  Pitchforks again!  This time from all the people who didn&#x27;t enjoy WFH for all the reasons you mentioned.<p>In the end corporate has had to be satisfied with people coming in at least one day a week; and we&#x27;re squeezing more people into the current office while still looking for another office to move into.  But it&#x27;s interesting to see the dynamics you mentioned -- lots of people prefer to WFH, lots of people definitely don&#x27;t.<p>FWIW I&#x27;ve never had much trouble &quot;turning off&quot; work, even when I was using the same computer for work and personal things.  Now that I&#x27;ve got a corporate laptop, it&#x27;s even easier -- unplug it from the external monitor, close the lid, and forget about it until it&#x27;s time to open it again, be that overnight or over the weekend or over the holidays.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40509767" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40509767" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">croes</span><span>|</span><a href="#40509654">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40509827">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40509703">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40509767">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40509767">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;This article doesn&#x27;t mention people who don&#x27;t enjoy WFH because of the unification of the workplace and home<p>Maybe because companies seldom try to force people to work from home.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40509703" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40509703" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">leni536</span><span>|</span><a href="#40509654">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40509767">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40509851">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40509703">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40509703">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I appreciate that a barrier is desirable for WFH, but that can be established without having a dedicated physical space for that.

I don&#x27;t want to stay at home. I want to work where I&#x27;ll be most productive on that day. This can be my dedicated desk, my sofa, a Chinese buffet, the coffee shop around the corner, or one of the remaining WeWork offices.<p>There is also a whole different aspect to it, which imho is overlooked and underappreciated: <i>asynchronicity</i>.<p>When you build your organisation under the paradigm of <i>remote-first</i>, you can tap into a beyond-regional (= worldwide), distributed talent pool. Once you tap into that beyond-regional, distributed talent pool, however, you will get people with very diverse individual realities:<p>People who located in different time zones. People with kids. People with disabilities. People with second jobs. There are also people who are more productive in the mornings, others who just bang out amazing code late at night. People for whom this might change over time, sometimes during the course of the week. Other people who take Wednesdays off, but work Sundays instead. All kinds of things which happen at different times and are not entirely plannable.<p>To capture all these flavours of productivity, you need to also build an organization that works well with asynchronicity. Ideally, an organization that is <i>async</i>-first.<p>This means: as an IC &#x2F; manager you need to <i>agree on deliverables and time lines</i>, <i>overshare</i> information, submit <i>actionable</i> requests to your people, not require&#x2F;expect <i>immediate</i> responses, and make <i>explicitly stated assumptions</i> when needed.<p>With this in place you have an organisation that is truly resilient, high-bandwith (as <i>@paulgb</i> said), and works like a global mycelial organism instead of a rooted tree, independent of location or time.<p>That&#x27;s much more than to just &quot;WFH&quot;.<p>Source: Have worked with and lead teams from San Francisco to Manila.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40509716" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40509716" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">b3lvedere</span><span>|</span><a href="#40509839">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40509736">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40509716">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40509716">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;This finding is not unexpected.

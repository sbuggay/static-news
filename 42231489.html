Google still has a ton of C++ and they haven&#x27;t stopped writing it. It&#x27;s going to take ~forever until Google has left the C++ ecosystem. What <i>did</i> happen was that Google majorly scaled down their efforts in the committee.<p>When it comes to the current schism on how to improve the safety of C++ there are largely two factions:<p>* The Bjarne&#x2F;Herb [1] side that focuses on minimal changes to the code. The idea here is to add different profiles to the language and then [draw the rest of the fucking owl]. The big issue here is that it&#x27;s entirely unclear on how they will achieve temporal and spatial memory safety.<p>* The other side is represented by Sean Baxter and his work on Safe C++. This is basically a whole-sale adoption of Rust&#x27;s semantics. The big issue here is that it&#x27;s effectively introducing a new language that isn&#x27;t <i>C++</i>.<p>Google decided to pursue Carbon and isn&#x27;t a major playing in either of the above efforts. Last time I checked, that language is not not meant to be memory safe.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BjarneStroustrup&#x2F;profiles">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BjarneStroustrup&#x2F;profiles</a>

If something happens upstream, we expect the distro maintainers to patch out undesirable behavior, integrate changes into the system as a whole or warn us of changes. Most distros are the same in functionality: the choice of a certain distro is mostly a choice of which political institution (such as a business or non-profit) that we trust to maintain the interoperability of the OS.<p>Languages need to be more agnostic than a package manager requires because I should not have to rope another organization into my trust model.<p>Cargo already goes too far in encouraging a single repository (crates.io) for everything through its default behavior. Who maintains crates.io? Where is the transparency? This is the most important information the user should know when deciding to use crates.io, which is whether or not they can trust the maintainers not to backdoor code, and it is rarely discussed or even mentioned!<p>The default cargo crate (template?) encourages people to use permissive licensing for their code. So that is an example where you are already making implicit political decisions on behalf of the ecosystem and developers. That is alarming and should not be for the language maintainers to decide at all.<p>In C&#x2F;C++ you have a separation of the standard from the implementation. This is really what makes C&#x2F;C++ code long-lived, because you do not have to worry about the standard being hijacked by a single group. You have a standard and multiple competing implementations, like the WWW.

You could still use the compiler and the libraries from your OS, and build the code like that, or you could just reach out to an optional standardized tool that serves as a glue for all the external tools in a standardized way.<p>Yes, there are a lot of valid concerns with this approach as well, but personally for me, as a frustrated C++ developer, who is most likely going to still use the language for a decade to come, I feel like all the other languages I had mentioned in my previous post had addressed what is my biggest point of frustration with C++, so it&#x27;s definitely an issue that could be solved.

It comes from a time where everything on the OS was developed by the same group of people.<p>By dumping all the same file types in massive top-level directories, you need a separate program (the package manager) to keep track of which files belong to which packages and dealing with their versions and ABI and stuff. Each package represents code developed by a specific group with a certain model of the system&#x27;s interoperability.<p>GoboLinux has an interesting play on the problem by changing the directory structure so that the filesystem does most of the heavy lifting.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42232014" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42232014" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">moomin</span><span>|</span><a href="#42231844">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42231969">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42233528">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42232014">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42232014">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Honestly I donât know why more languages donât just adopt e.g. npm, maven or NuGet.

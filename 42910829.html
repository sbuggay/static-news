To be clear, that&#x27;s a 30% slowdown in <i>clinical, cognitive</i> endpoints.

The best we hope for is to prevent further damage. Amyloid is an initiating causal agent in the disease process, but the disease process includes other pathologies besides amyloid. So far, the amyloid therapies which very successfully engage their target have not yet been tested in the preclinical phase before the amyloid pathology initiates further, downstream disease processes. This is the most likely reason we&#x27;ve seen only ~30% clinical efficacy so far. I expect much more efficacy in the years to come as amyloid therapies are refined and tested at earlier phases.

There&#x27;s some evidence that avoiding&#x2F;properly treating microbial infection (particularly herpes viruses and P. gingivalis) can help, since amyloid beta seems to be an antimicrobial peptide which accumulates in response to infection. There may also be some benefit from managing cholesterol levels, as lipid processing dysfunction may contribute to increased difficulty of amyloid clearance.

There may actually be a grain of truth but now there is a backlash. I&#x27;d argue though that the mounds of alternative explanations that weren&#x27;t followed up on should likely get some priority right now since we know so little about them there is a lot to learn and and we are likely to have a lot of surprises there.<p>I see this as the same problem with UCT (upper confidence for trees) based algorithms. If you get a few initial random rolls that look positive you end up dumping a lot of wasted resources into that path because the act of looking optimizes the tree of possibilities you are exploring (it was definitely easier to study amyloid lines of research than other ideas because of the efforts put into it). Meanwhile the other possibilities you have been barely exploring slowly become more interesting as you add a few resources to them. Eventually you realize that one of them is actually a lot more promising and ditch the bad rut you were stuck on, but only after a lot of wasted resources. To switch fields, I think something similar happened to alpha-go when it had a game that ended in a draw because it was very confident in a bad move.<p>Basically, UCT type algorithms prioritize the idea that every roll should optimize the infinite return so it only balances exploration with exploitation. When it comes to research though the value signal is wrong, you need to search the solution space because your goal is not to make every trial find the most effective treatment, it is to eventually find the actual answer and then use that going forward. The trial values did not matter. This means you should balance exploration, exploitation AND surprise. If you do a trial that gives you very different results than you expected then you have shown that you don&#x27;t know much there and maybe it is worth digging into so even the fact that it may have returned less optimal value than some other path its potential value could be much higher. (Yes I did build this algorithm. Yes it does crush UCT based algorithms. Just use variance as your surprise metric then beat alpha-go.)<p>People intrinsically understand these two algorithms. In our day to day lives we pretty exclusively optimize exploration and exploitation because we have to put food on the table while still improving, but when we get to school we often take classes that &#x27;surprise&#x27; us because we know that the goal at the end is to have gained -some- skill that will help us. Research priorities need to take into account surprise to avoid the UCT rut pitfalls. If they had for the amyloid hypothesis maybe we would have hopped over to other avenues of research faster. &#x27;The last 8 studies showed roughly the same effect, but this other path has varied wildly.

Is that basic science?</i><p>Basic science in this context means research investigating the underlying disease process to develop knowledge of how it works mechanistically, <i>as distinguished from</i> (and as a precursor to) developing or testing treatments for the disease. This helps us direct resources in plausibly useful directions rather than merely taking shots in the dark, and it also helps us to interpret later clinical findings: e.g. if we see some cognitive benefit in a three-month trial, is that because the underlying disease process was affected (and hence the benefit might persist or even increase over time), or might it be because there was some symptomatic benefit via a completely separate mechanism but no expectation of a change in <i>trajectory</i>? For example, cholinergic drugs are known to provide symptomatic benefit in Alzheimer disease but not slow the underlying biological processes, so that worsening still continues at the same pace. Or if we see results that are statistically borderline, is it still worth pursuing or was the very slight benefit likely a fluke?<p>So a meta-analysis of ketogenic diets in Alzheimer disease is not basic science, though that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s useless. But what I&#x27;m saying is it&#x27;s really helpful to have a prior that the treatment you&#x27;re developing is actually targeting a plausible disease pathway, and the amyloid hypothesis gives us that prior for amyloid antibodies in a way that, to my knowledge, we don&#x27;t have for ketogenic diets.<p><i><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S127977072" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S127977072</a>...</i><p>Thanks, I just took a look at this meta-analysis. The studies with the strongest benefits on the standard cognitive endpoints of MMSE and ADAS-Cog — Taylor 2018, Qing 2019, and Sakiko 2020 — all lasted only three months, which makes me suspect (especially given the context of no theoretical reason to expect this to work that I&#x27;m aware of) this is some temporary symptomatic benefit as with the cholinergic drugs I mentioned above.<p>But it&#x27;s enough of a hint that I&#x27;d support funding a long-term trial just to see what happens.<p><i>If amyloid is truly the critical &quot;but for&quot; cause then how on earth is it possible that reducing amyloid burden doesn&#x27;t really make a difference?</i><p>I&#x27;ve argued elsewhere in the thread that it does make quite a difference, but there&#x27;s still a lot of work to do, and I&#x27;ve said what I think that work is (mainly: improving BBB crossing and administering the drugs earlier).</div><br/><div id="42914767" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42914767" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">msandford</span><span>|</span><a href="#42913151">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42914623">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42913762">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42914767">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42914767">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There was absolutely no theoretical reason that some moldy cheese would kill bacteria but thankfully Fleming noticed what happened and we got antibiotics.<p>There was no theoretical reason that washing your hands would do anything to combat the spread of disease and all the smart doctors knew otherwise.

 Which should be aggressively hinting that there&#x27;s likely some as-yet unknown causality that&#x27;s worth investigating. We don&#x27;t have to spend billions to do that.

The PI worked at a distant&#x2F;high level, but he was a good scientist and a skilled leader doing honest and valuable research, and had economies of scale that let him do more with the same research dollars. It was the least toxic and most creative and productive lab I’ve ever seen. Banning that type of lab would be to the massive detriment of scientific progress in my opinion.<p>I also disagree about banning consulting and startups for PIs- that is arguably where research ends up having the highest impact, because it gets translated to real world use. It also allows scientists to survive in HCOL areas with much less government funding. Frankly, I could make 4x the salary in industry, and if I were banned from even consulting on the side it would be much harder to justify staying an academic while raising a family in a HCOL area.<p>I am also very upset about academic fraud and have seen it first hand- but I think your proposed solutions would be harmful and ineffective. I’m not sure what the solution is, but usually students, postdocs, and technicians know if their PI is a fraud and would report if it were safe for them to do so, but they don’t have enough power to do so. Fixing that would likely solve this.

I&#x27;ve learned much of what I know about LLMs and generative AI on &#x2F;g&#x2F;. The toxicity&#x2F;chaos of the place is probably the main thing that enables it to continue to be a village for all these years. There&#x27;s more than one way to shear a sheep, and I don&#x27;t think the 4chan method is the best way to make a village, but a village make it does.<p>I just mention it here because it&#x27;s probably something that doesn&#x27;t occur to most people, and maybe it should be something we think about more. I think 4chan has a very interesting property in that the gatekeeping is <i>only</i> your ability to mentally filter every Nth (depending on the board) post being full of slurs. Outside of that it&#x27;s egalitarian and openly accessible to a greater degree than anywhere else on the internet, there&#x27;s value to that that people miss.</div><br/><div id="36305823" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36305823" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jlebar</span><span>|</span><a href="#36299923">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36301031">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36305823">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36305823">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think I agree with the principle of, if you can ignore the hate speech it&#x27;s actually a pretty egalitarian place.<p>Like you say, it&#x27;s <i>not</i> egalitarian towards those who don&#x27;t have an easy time ignoring the hate speech.  And, okay, in principle if the strength of one&#x27;s stomach for hate speech was randomly distributed to humans with no correlation to anything else, maybe that would not disqualify it as egalitarian.<p>But it&#x27;s not.  People who face discrimination and hate speech IRL will, on average, surely have less tolerance for it online than people who don&#x27;t.  I have to believe that women, racial minorities, religious minorities, and so on, feel much less welcome on a place like 4chan.  They&#x27;ve already spent their &quot;ignoring hate speech points&quot; ignoring someone harassing them on the subway.<p>So whatever it&#x27;s virtues -- and I&#x27;m willing to believe you there are some -- I don&#x27;t think that a place with this much toxicity can rightly be called egalitarian.</div><br/><div id="36307050" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36307050" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">somedude895</span><span>|</span><a href="#36299923">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36305823">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36307140">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36307050">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36307050">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I don&#x27;t think that a place with this much toxicity can rightly be called egalitarian.<p>You don&#x27;t make a village by welcoming anyone and everyone.

I would agree that 4chan as a community does house more polarized opinions than most online communities, though that seems to be largely a function of not having upvotes and allowing anonymous posting.<p>To your overall point, that this is a value difference between myself and the GP, I fully disagree.

I stopped browsing &#x2F;g&#x2F; years ago but I remember a distinct decline in the quality of discussion around Linux and FOSS topics as the board shifted to more towards more general consumer technology, FOSS threads naturally became lower effort and more memetic* as a result to compete with the influx of new users who didn&#x27;t care about this subculture. When Linus Torvalds announced that he would try to be more polite it gave some ammo to the anti-Linux culture and things deteriorated more. There was a particularly pertinent post around the attitude of NixOS users on &#x2F;g&#x2F; that reflects this period pretty well I think.<p>* This sort of trend isn&#x27;t unique to 4chan of course, the quality of discussion on hobby subreddits tends to decline when mods start allowing memes and low effort posts.

Let the user maintain it, let them run into the Scunthorpe Problem for themselves.  Rate-limit the spam, and be robust about that, but everything else is up to the individual.  And frankly, the people who have selected fragility as a kind of lifestyle rarely have much to offer a community anyway.<p>I say this as an Old who has watched communities arise, develop, and fold over decades, on platform after platform, protocol after protocol.  Most deaths are the kind of slow-motion suicide that in humans would be reflected in lousy lifestyle choices.

Everyone really had a place there and you could read and interact with every idea, viewpoint, etc. Then as it got popular, it got corporatized, politicized, etc. Journalists attacked it to make reddit align with their version of hell. Corporations attacked it to make it more amenable to foreign markets. Political actors attacked it to further their political interests. It became an insufferable propaganda shithole. Movies, music, sports, nfl, etc subs used to be interesting places for discussion. Then it became publicity platforms for movie and music studios, sports teams, etc. News subs used to be interesting places for open discussions. Then journalists got their meat hooks into it and now they are state propaganda. Even political subs used to be diverse places for political discussion. Now they are purely political propaganda probably run by political parties.<p>But I guess that&#x27;s the way it is with all social media. Once it gets popular, the corporate, news and state entities want control over it. Now, most major subs are just advertising platforms. Which is ironic since most of the subs ( news, movies, politics, etc ) started as a reaction against advertisements masquerading as news articles, movie reviews, sports commentary, political commentary, etc. Money&#x2F;power ultimately won and reddit became what it hated.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36300453" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36300453" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">benatkin</span><span>|</span><a href="#36299972">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36304460">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36300442">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36300453">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36300453">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Gah.

Reddit has shown that villages <i>can</i> tolerate a sustained large influx of strangers <i>if they are given the tools</i> to scale the onboarding process - ensuring people understand those shared values, and ensuring that bad-faith actors are identified and prevented from destroying the fabric of the overall community.<p>These tools exist - they are the ecosystem of API-based moderator tools! People have been iterating on them for years to serve the needs of the moderators of Reddit&#x27;s diverse communities. And these are the very tools that Reddit is destroying without providing sufficient replacements, without providing time to adapt, and with a remarkably sardonic and vitriolic corporate communication strategy.<p>I&#x27;m a member of multiple subreddits that are shutting down indefinitely because the thinly-stretched moderation staff is constantly under attack - by everything from karma bot farmers to politically motivated aggressors (including would-be infiltrators applying for moderation positions). The moderators&#x27; ability to use third-party apps was the only thing keeping the effective DDoS at bay.<p>And I truly don&#x27;t think that those moderators would ever say that the <i>number</i> of strangers was the problem, because the tools <i>did</i> scale, and they were able to provide supportive and positive communities to thousands of those &quot;strangers&quot; who would never have had access to those communities before.<p>I always saw Reddit as a model of how communities could scale beyond physical constraints - and how some of the learnings of scalable community governance could perhaps be ported to real-world scenarios. Now, people will read posts like OP&#x27;s and simply think that this was always impossible, and that&#x27;s just sad.</div><br/><div id="36301568" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36301568" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">evilotto</span><span>|</span><a href="#36300274">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36300594">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36301568">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36301568">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The article stated that explicitly as its central thesis, yet I came away with a different insight.<p>&gt; In this context, the defining trait of a village is that itâs group of people where the average interaction over time is with people youâve seen before.<p>What I find especially insightful in this description is that it applies to lots of communities at all scales, both online and off, as diverse as a childhood friend group, a technical project team, a corporation, or an alliance of world superpowers.  What defines the village is that the members you interact with are mostly the ones you have been interacting with.  Change happens, but it is gradual.<p>What destroys the village is whatever upsets that defining trait. In the article&#x27;s telling, a sustained influx of strangers is one way to kill it; there are others (for example, a large set of village members exiting, or the village splitting in two would also work.)  And as you rightly point out, a way to effectively manage that change can allow the village to survive, be it tools to manage onboarding, or gradual acceptance (ala SO&#x27;s points-based permissions), or a well-led corporate merger where changes are introduced gradually and with the buy-in of all participants.</div><br/><div id="36306688" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36306688" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lcrz</span><span>|</span><a href="#36300274">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36301568">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36300594">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36306688">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36306688">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the thesis is wrong.

No single moderation team should need to maintain all those subcultures with one single set of policies, nor do they have the same on-ramps and levels of traffic.

There might have been a couple dozen or a hundred people that hung out on that chat room back then, but it was fairly diverse in terms of age ranges and experience...at least as far as tech&#x2F;net early adopters could have been back then. I think I only met one person IRL from that chat room, but it was, in comparison to today, surprisingly chill. Not only that, but people just as a matter of course used pseudonyms and were careful about privacy. Knowing someone&#x27;s (temporary) IP address was already <i>a lot</i>.<p>But as the internet grew forums and news sites and blogs, I bounced around, and through, many. I lost interest in most of them before they got enshittified, but it does, in retrospect, seem that most suffered either of two fates: irrelevance, stagnation, and evaporation, or enshittification to one degree or another. I count among my past lives the past online communities that I participated in. I don&#x27;t long for those pasts but I do feel a loss that not only are those specific ones gone, but the striking inevitability of them all dying. It seems like a law--a tragic one at that.

This then extends in to related subreddits where the meme pops up when the triggering subject is talked about.<p>It just becomes so boring and predictable.</div><br/><div id="36301941" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36301941" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cjs_ac</span><span>|</span><a href="#36301369">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36301405">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36301941">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36301941">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Reddit has been a place for clever people to talk, but as it and its reputation grew, it started to attract not-so-clever people too. Cleverer people don&#x27;t respond as well to advertising, so if you want to make more money from your users, you want more of the less intelligent ones, and fewer of the more intelligent ones.<p>The standardised comments you mention are a way for the less intelligent to participate, and the upvotes they attract reflect the numbers of these users. The ones you&#x27;ve mentioned sound like a case of aping one&#x27;s betters; the ones I see most often are the vacuous &#x27;Putin must be defenestrated&#x27; comments that litter the Ukraine war daily threads, and are the worst kind of performative virtue signalling.<p>Reddit as a loss-making assembly of communities is dying; Reddit as a profitable set of curated feeds, a sort of TikTok that&#x27;s not just for short video, is rising.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36301405" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36301405" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">moron4hire</span><span>|</span><a href="#36301369">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36301941">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36299860">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36301405">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36301405">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This kind of thing is what kept me off of Reddit all these years.

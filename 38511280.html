While it never made it out of alpha, it had gotten some traction, and looking back, I am still proud of the architecture and design (not so much of the code, hehe).<p>One day, a developer from this random company in Connecticut (I am German and lived in Germany at the time) reached out to me in my project&#x27;s IRC channel, and asked if I wanted to interview. I did, and I got the job.<p>I moved to the UK, then to the US with my wife, and stayed with the company for 8 years. I got promoted from senior engineer to Sr. Principal Engineer and had an amazing time there. I now have a green card and live in CT with my 2 amazing children (with German and American citizenship).<p>I often think back about how much that project and that person who reached out to me changed my life. How different it would be if I hadn&#x27;t worked on my side project, if it hadn&#x27;t become semi-popular, or if he hadn&#x27;t reached out. Butterfly effect at it&#x27;s finest.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.syncany.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.syncany.org</a><p>Edit: Fun fact: Drew Houston (Dropbox CEO) emailed me at the time and wanted to hire me, but he didn&#x27;t respond when I emailed him back.

A lot of SV startups weren’t openly privacy hostile (or maybe the issue wasn’t took seriously enough).<p>But I felt that this &quot;dream&quot; was only upon developers at that time and it stoped sometimes after. In fact, in 2015, while on a trip to SF, I ate with a former French coworker who decided to live the dream and he was already saying to me that he wanted to come back in Europe because he couldn’t stand the ambiant culture anymore.<p>It wasn’t the job, he loved it, performed well, was well paid. It wasn’t even the people, he made some friends there, felt like people were genuinely nice.<p>But it was more the delusion about the SV-Life and the mismatch in cultural values and in the global society lifestyle in which he felt you were nothing to others &#x2F; to the society without money.<p>Now I do feel like that this sentiment about the US is now more mainstream in Europe even amongst those who never came in USA.<p>ps : I urge you to not read any criticism in my comment, I’m describing a general sentiment from the other side of an ocean, probably with a big bias.

FWIW I had two German bosses who emigrated to the US(one to California, one to Atlanta), so the US is clearly an attractive place for them and they say they loved it there just like GP.<p>The majority of Germans talking about how much they hate the US, have never lived there but they hate it nevertheless because it&#x27;s a populat thing to hate in Germany, and also they don&#x27;t work in tech, or need to rely on the welfare state, or are already from well off families where the lower local salaries make no difference. The ones working in tech who don&#x27;t rely on the welfare state, are quite open to the idea of moving there for the right money.<p>Sure, if GP was one of those Germans from a mid-upper class background with a nice inherited Bavarian house (unaffordable at any German working wage) then immigrating to the US makes no sense as he already would have enough prosperity at home, but if you have no wealth and want to build it, then working in the US tech sector is much better than working in Germany.<p>So no, a blanket generalization cannot be made of &quot;Germans wanting to move to the US&quot;, as that highly depends on their social&#x2F;wealth class and career.<p>Edit: seems I upset the apple cart with my comment.

The premise was that it would be like Mailbox (remember that flash in the pan email app?) but for finances. You’d swipe on every transaction to make sure they were categorized correctly. I even wired it up to my local bank’s very rudimentary API.<p>It was beautifully designed (thanks to some help from a designer friend) and I was really proud of the architecture and Objective-C code.<p>A large retailer reached out to me on LI and asked about a job. As part of the interview process they asked me to submit a code sample and I submitted basil. The senior dev in the interview commented that he didn’t have any negative comments about the code but instead spent the interview telling me the things he liked about it. It was so fun and gratifying to get that feedback and I got the job and worked there for seven years.

I am assuming that you are fairly green behind the ears? The thing about Big Tech companies is that they hire lots of developers. That’s in large part makes them Big Tech. “Having Apple on your CV” is not as prestigious as you’re making out. It doesn’t mean you have The Knowledge that makes you a ‘10x developer’ or whatever anywhere you work. In fact, it could mean that your mind has been poisoned by a Big Tech working style, and you’ve developed a bunch of habits that aren’t nearly as applicable to most other organisations.<p>I say this as someone that’s never worked for any tech company anybody has heard of, nor any hip SV startup.<p>It takes a particular sort of person to thrive in Big Tech. That isn’t just code for ‘really really really good’. It sounds like you still believe that it is. Plenty of ‘really really really good’ people wouldn’t do well at Apple, and plenty wouldn’t want to work there. I wouldn’t necessarily call myself ‘really really really good’, but I know that I don’t want to work at Apple. Not because I think I’m not good enough, not because k don’t think that I could keep up, and not because I don’t like their output as a company.<p>Putting companies in a pedestal the way that you are is ultimately damaging for the industry. It fosters the increasingly cringey “get a job at FAANG!!!” culture. I’m sick of my YouTube recommendations being poisoned with “here’s how you pass a system design interview at Google” BS. I implore you to stop putting companies on a pedestal.

We had a memorable evening at the office with the onsite shredder truck.

Mostly to scratch my own itch in that I wanted my personal VPS and DNS to be IaC and get some practice in Go and Terraform. It got a little traction with some people using it and I won some nice prices for best project in the competition the hosting company put out after upgrading their API to REST. After the competition I was also able to get an account with no billing for testing purposes, which made developing and integration testing a whole lot easier. Before that I could only test on resources I paid for myself or ask them nicely to refund if I made a mistake as they don&#x27;t do per minute&#x2F;hourly billing like other providers.<p>The project was eventually discovered by my (now former) employer who needed the same provider but did some searching before writing his own and discovered my project on Github. It landed me a job interview and eventually a job. I don&#x27;t think my project was the sole reason I got the job, but was more likely telling them I was operating in the niche they were looking for. Something that probably didn&#x27;t stand out as much in my LinkedIn profile to be noticed there. Or I hadn&#x27;t told it to enough people as there was some shared working history with others in the company. Enough to let them know they should hire me, but not enough to tell them I was someone they were looking for.<p>One of the contributors to the project also ended up at that company, I was asked about him during his interview and could give nothing but praise because I had been working with him on my project.<p>My 2ct is that whatever you do, make, patch, write, think up of, just put it out there. Even if it is not finished, create a repo and publish it, write a blog post, post it on a social. You never know who is searching for what and will find you that way.

For you youngsters, back then, back when we had dial telephones (tell us more Grandpa!), there were multiple &quot;mail networks&quot;, not just this fancy Internet you kids have.  Sendmail was a mail processor that could not only arrange to send and receive mail, but it could translate addressing between the different networks (ARPA, Bitnet, CSNET, UUCP, etc.)  The problem was, reading a sendmail config file was something like reading assembly code except you weren&#x27;t allowed to by vowels.  It was nearly all symbols -- executable line noise.  
I got tired of working with it - so I wrote my own sendmail compiler&#x2F;de-compiler of sorts just to work in English prose.  Got me my job at Sun.

Bored with marketing and sales, I decided to find engineering job.
To get up to the software development train, I started learning Java and created a small project as the playground. It was time of Web 2.0 &#x2F; AJAX hype, so I took Java Server Faces as the base and added dynamic functionality to it.
I did name project &quot;Ajax4jsf&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ajax4jsf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ajax4jsf</a>.
When it become less or more functional, I created couple demo applications, wrote several blogs about it, and mention it whenever I did found any resource related to Java and Web 2.0.<p>The goal was to find a job in Russia, but no one pay attention. Instead, the project got some traction in US, and company from here made me offer. So I continued the same side project as the full time job.
They did all work to provide visa ( and Green Card later ), and sell project to Jboss where it became &quot;richfaces&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;richfaces.jboss.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;richfaces.jboss.org&#x2F;</a> .<p>Decent success story, but keep in mind several points that made it happen:
- Project targeted a current hype wave.<p>- It was implemented with wide used technologies.<p>- A lot of time spent to promote it.<p>For the moment, there are two possible candidates to repeat : Large language models, and cryptocurrencies. But former is already eclipsed the later, so probably it&#x27;s the only candidate. 
There&#x27;s a little set of technologies used by LLMs, so this choice is oblivious ( keep in mind, the project supposed to demonstrate you skills in areas required by potential employer, so nothing exotic ).
When gold rush happened in Klondike, the total cost of the found gold was several times smaller than money spent on food, tools, whiskey, and whores. So it&#x27;s better to create some useful tools project ( like LangChain ).
And promote, promote, promote.

In other words, having solved a problem in Rust helps me write code that both solves the same problem in other languages <i>and</i> has clear, explainable, invariants. YMMV<p># OpenBerg<p>A long time ago, I started one of the first e-book software readers, called OpenBerg. Jim Gettys [1] got in touch with me by IRC to offer me a job working on it full-time for one year. I already had a job, so I declined.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jim_Gettys" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jim_Gettys</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="38512238" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38512238" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aleku</span><span>|</span><a href="#38514886">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38513466">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38512238">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38512238">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In 2003&#x2F;2004, during my undergrad, I observed a recurring trend in the university&#x27;s IT department. They struggled to retain Unix&#x2F;Linux engineers for more than three months, primarily due to two reasons: the university&#x27;s remote location (apparently engineers loved the city life) and the local telecom companies&#x27; at the time hired anyone who could type &quot;ls&quot; on a Linux shell. Recognizing an opportunity, I began self-studying FreeBSD and Linux, the operating systems used by the university for their internet services like DNS, email, and proxy servers. Before completing my degree, I applied for the sysadmin position at the uni. In the interviews, I was able to explain and answer even the hardest of questions. I was hired. I eventually went to &quot;ls&quot; elsewhere as well but this role, which I held for eight years, provided me with a foundational knowledge that I believe influences my career even to date!</div><br/><div id="38512346" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38512346" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">akoboldfrying</span><span>|</span><a href="#38512238">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38513466">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38512346">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38512346">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; eventually went to &quot;ls&quot; elsewhere<p>Poetic</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38513466" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38513466" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scarface_74</span><span>|</span><a href="#38512238">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38513718">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38513466">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38513466">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When I was at AWS working in the ProServe department, I got onto a popular open source project that eventually became a more official “AWS Solution”.  While much of the work came out of customizations I did for customers that got reintegrated into the project, I did spend some time working on features that just scratched an itch.<p>Once I found out how easy it was to put something through the open source process and have it posted to AWS Samples:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws-samples">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws-samples</a><p>I sanitized all of my customer facing solutions that didn’t have proprietary business logic and submitted them - 8 projects in all.<p>When the interviewer asked me what project was I most proud of, I discussed my contributions to the “AWS Solution” that I knew the company probably used or had at least heard of and my own related work that was open source that I knew was inline  with the strategy they were pursuing.<p>I’ve been at the company 3 months and I’ve already implemented and modified 5 of my 8 personal open source projects.  Two of the other three are based on now deprecated methods and once I dig into AWS Reinvent announcements, there may be better options out there than the AWS Solution.<p>All that being said, the last time a side project landed me a job and the last time I did anything “open source” before 2021 was 1995 when I was in college.  I submitted a HyperCard based Eliza clone to the info-Mac archive and AOL (this was 1995) and a professor from another college wanted me to integrate it in a HyperCard based Gopher server (kids ask your parents).<p>I don’t do side projects.  Anything I can’t afford  from my main job I don’t need or I need to get a job paying more.  For me, the same applies to learning new to me technology.  If I can’t learn it on my main job, I need to be getting another job.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38513718" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38513718" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dpc_01234</span><span>|</span><a href="#38513466">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38512658">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38513718">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38513718">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Back in 2005, when I was still living in Poland and working as a developer after graduating uni.

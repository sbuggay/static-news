Publishers and libraries can use other lending platforms if and when they emerge as stronger competitors. This article serves as a good overview: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openeducationalberta.ca&#x2F;ciicm&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;public-library-ebook-loan-limitations-and-licensing-agreements&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openeducationalberta.ca&#x2F;ciicm&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;public-library...</a><p>The problem is the publishers - they don’t always sign on to provide books to every new platform and don’t always release to every platform. But other platforms do exist: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bookriot.com&#x2F;comparing-public-library-ebook-platforms&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bookriot.com&#x2F;comparing-public-library-ebook-platform...</a><p>Bibliocommons, a vendor of library catalogue software, is unique in this space too. They can wrap other services for lending e-books so you “checkout” the same way across any service that provides books. Once upon a time, they even provided books to libraries to lend directly, as they had signed an agreement with S&amp;S and built their own lending platform.<p>But today the most prominent example of a library building its own ebook platform is probably SimplyE from NYPL. It’s an open source platform other libraries can run. Under the hood, I believe it continues to use OverDrive and other vendors, via OverDrive APIs that Bibliocommons originally pushed for, as well as freely available public domain books.<p>I suppose there is one thing to be thankful for - individual publishers haven’t tried to start their own competitor and force libraries to use a publisher system to lend books like academic publishers do. I don’t see that happening any time soon. The music industry tried it a few times but people like having content aggregators, so the only way that would succeed is either through easily implemented standards so every library can have an app like SimplyE or further consolidation of the publishing industry, which has been prevented so far, but that could always change in future.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40128864" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40128864" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">j45</span><span>|</span><a href="#40128164">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40128240">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40129277">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40129326">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40128864">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40128864">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Limiting or undermining literacy remains important to those who benefit from it.</div><br/><div id="40129186" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40129186" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nox101</span><span>|</span><a href="#40128164">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40128864">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40129326">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40129186">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40129186">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">what logic leads to this conclusion?

They could have sustained their brands on quality. Imagine a world where you wanted something good to read, and among all the garbage out there saw a title and went &quot;this one is by Simon &amp; Schuster, it <i>has</i> to be good&quot;.

Book publishers are terrible and they always have been. At least that is the case here in Denmark.<p>They game our library system, so that books they know won’t sell well but will be lent a lot at the libraries, like a lot of children books are priced ridiculously. These books are never actually put in stores, because why bother? But our libraries, have, to buy them and then pay fees to the publishing houses based on the individual book prices. I guess part of the blame goes to our politicians though.<p>The worst part is how they pay artists. Authors are paid poorly as touched upon in this article. But illustrators are paid criminally low rates. A children book with 50 pages of breathtaking art can earn you as little as $500 for months for work. Publishers pay your royalties by the size of your printed name on the front of the book. If your name isn’t there you get 0 royalties. If your name is smaller than the other names you get significantly less royalties. If your name is smaller, and, italic, you get almost no royalties and so on.<p>In general the model has never really worked for anyone except a few authors. There are the famous ones who sell a lot of books and then there are the ones who write a billion children’s books who actually don’t get the majority of their money from publishers but from the government compensation programs. But for the most part publishers have always run a business model akin to music streaming services where only a handful of Danish authors can actually make a living just by selling books. Mean while our publishing houses have been able to employ thousands and keep investors happy.<p>What a lot of artists and authors have done instead is to form smaller independent publishers. Which means you get 0 advertising and 0 product placement and so on, but ironically often will make you far more money than using the big publishers. These smaller indie publishers, and other creative ways of publishing like the article mentions, aren’t doing poorly. The big publishers are suffering. Thanks to the digital age.

For non-fiction you always had groups of people, typically academics and successful business people and politicians, who read tons and tons of books.

Not many I think. Today it&#x27;s more or less the same.

a) Font size is getting too small for me. Years ago I changed to large hardcover (sometimes large but softcover) versions instead of the smaller-sized books I used to buy, simply because the fonts are larger then. With the Kindle I can set the font size to what I want.
b) Weight and size. I read on airplanes, in hotels etc. I read a lot and I read fast, so I bring more than one book (and even that is too big and heavy, see a). The Kindle is king here.
c) Storage. I don&#x27;t have enough room for more books at home. I&#x27;ve sadly had to dump lots and lots and lots of books, even though I like to read the same books again (and again). Tried to sort out those most unlikely to get re-read, but..
I can&#x27;t even give them away. Used-book stores have more than they can handle.<p>As to the Kindle - I&#x27;ve never felt any urge to tinker with anything, except when I&#x27;m forced to: I set the font size, that&#x27;s one single operation, forget it (at least for that book). If I occasionally read at night I have to add some backlight. 
And that&#x27;s about it. I just read.<p>What I miss about paper books is the nice cover (color..), how easy it is to &quot;see&quot; the book (bookmarks, flip it open somewhere else and so on).

Around 2013-204, I started moving to eBooks, and Amazon Kindle played a significant role in my journey. But a couple of years later, I had an epiphany while discussing books with my daughter, “I never see you read books. You are just reading on your computer (kindle) or the phone and are not reading.”<p>Since then, I have returned to reading physical books with an approximate ratio of 1:5 against digital ones. I have kinda rule&#x2F;understanding with my daughters -- you have unlimited access to books that you can read, and you also get extra pocket money for reading them. Of course, it is OK not to finish a book, but in that case, a few cool-down days before buying another one.<p>Yes, buy and read physical books. I believe, the return is a magnitude higher for everyone than the loss it does to anything. If you have kids, read more physical books in front of them. Encourage them to read physical books. They are less distracting and help the kids focus.<p>Five years ago, I wrote a story about it.

The money’s in hard work at writing porn, or in big broad-audience grand slams, probably written at a junior high reading level, with a small niche supporting a handful of authors in writing based-on-a-true-story stuff (bonus if “true crime” connection) aimed directly at getting optioned for film or tv (but that one’s <i>very</i> hard to break into, studios have some go-to authors for that stuff and you ain’t one of them)</div><br/></div></div><div id="40121866" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40121866" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lrvick</span><span>|</span><a href="#40121223">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40121396">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40121866">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40121866">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Most books today are sold with DRM and when the DRM servers are deactivated the books stop working.<p>This happened with the Microsoft ebooks store and has happened with countless other DRM media.<p>Sometimes books are automatically revised, or censored.

But if you <i>don&#x27;t</i> pay, your books will appear in the &quot;organic&quot; results - after all the marketed ones - essentially destroying any chance of being seen.<p>This way Amazon can claim that their search results are fair and algorithmic, protecting them from accusations of monopolistic practices. AMS is a simple paid marketing service, not at all like a tax or protection money, right?<p>But what&#x27;s really happening is companies are paying just to make sure they&#x27;re included somewhere in the top results rather than the organic ones, which no one bothers to look at.<p>They do the same for their App Store search on Fire TVs.

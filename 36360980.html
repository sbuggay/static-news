It&#x27;s nothing like coming up with an algorithm or trying to solve a problem.<p>The only time I&#x27;ve found it has come close is when actually writing a hypothesis or review paper: having to read through the literature in order to come up with a coherent theory while juggling the concepts in my head.

For complex algorithms or prototypes I prefer to just power through and get the whole thing done to the prototype stage in half a day (or whatever it takes, depending on the complexity), then spend the next month (or whatever) fleshing it out. There are probably other ways of doing it that don&#x27;t require such cognitive effort at the beginning, but I find that for complex problems that&#x27;s sometimes the best way of solving them, at least in my experience, and it only involves significant mental effort for a very short period of time.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36366887" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36366887" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">timacles</span><span>|</span><a href="#36365002">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36365553">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36368224">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36366887">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36366887">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re asking if a guy whos like the equivalent of Michael Jordan in his field, except that he writes text in a box, is a atypical?<p>Who is even in the Carmack tier of programmers?

I will reliably perform my duties and try to be efficient at it, but I will NEVER let big corpos take away time from my life again just to improve some managers standing or bonus.<p>You can definitely find a good balance between fulfilling your position at or above expectations while respecting your personal life and health. I do not hesitate to take sick days, I prioritize my family and friends. Working 4 days per week has been show to drastically reduce sick days and other issues so while it might seem counterintuitive to some, I really believe that it&#x27;s actually beneficial for everyone.<p>Note: I typically have a weird productivity surge between sunset and 2am that never gets used for work, obviously.

When you hit a wall on one task, you could say “that’s it, I’m done for the day” and head home, or you could switch over to something else that has a different rhythm and get more accomplished. Even when you are clearly not at your peak, there is always plenty to do that doesn’t require your best, and it would actually be a waste to spend your best time on it. You can also “go to the gym” for your work by studying, exploring, and experimenting, spending more hours in service to the goal.<p>Absolutely true.<p>&gt; I think most people excited by these articles are confusing not being aligned with their job’s goals with questions of effectiveness. If you don’t want to work, and don’t really care about your work, less hours for the same pay sounds great! If you personally care about what you are doing, you don’t stop at 40 hours a week because you think it is optimal for the work, but rather because you are balancing it against something else that you find equally important. Which is fine.<p>And this is really the key to the whole shorter work week argument. I agree with John; if you are running your own company or initiative in an area you are passionate about, the 40 hour week question probably doesn&#x27;t even dawn on you. Why would you want to work less to achieve a goal you are ambitious to reach? If anything you are working <i>more</i> because you enjoy it and want to see more progress more quickly.<p>But <i>most</i> people working a typical job (even in tech) are not in a position to care deeply about their work and its outcomes - why that&#x27;s the case is a separate discussion and probably differs person-to-person. A good amount of those people might even be working on things during those 40 hours that are a <i>poor</i> use of their individual time due to bad management, bureaucracy, inability to work on things they want to, etc. These people are not able to work 40+ hours things that feel or are as important as other things in their life such as side projects, family, exercise, etc. And so the 5 day, 40 hour workweek feels incompatible with their life.</div><br/><div id="36364721" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36364721" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sangnoir</span><span>|</span><a href="#36361757">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36364916">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36364721">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36364721">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; But most people working a typical job (even in tech) are not in a position to care deeply about their work and its outcomes<p>Perhaps most people - after looking at their paystub - are acutely aware that their employer doesn&#x27;t deeply care about <i>them.</i> In my experience, there is a direct link between how much effort I put in going above and beyond in my work and how much higher (or lower) than average my salary was - with an inverse experience multiplier.

But there does seem to be good evidence that for larger samples of workers, reducing from a 40-hour week to 32 or similar doesn&#x27;t have much of a measurable impact on output (which implies productivity per hour worked has actually gone up considerably).
And, arguably more importantly, workers that have taken part in such programs generally report improvements in their health, sense of self-worth, &quot;happiness&quot; etc.  On that basis I&#x27;m definitely in favour of revisiting the expectation that a full-time job is ~40 hours a week, and understanding what can be done to help corporations and employees transition to fewer hours.<p>I actually think the harder problem is: should we extend the current concept of a weekend to be 3 days, or should we accept that the &quot;3rd&quot; rest day each week is different for everyone.

It seems that Carmack may actually be in support of that.<p>Working shorter days is not about maximizing the quantity of work but the quality. It is done when it is undesirable to have any work done that is below a certain quality, or just to increase worker happiness. Many people do their highest quality work after having sufficient rest, and then continue to do well building up context till they are burned out for the day.<p>It very much depends on the person though as some people gain more relevant short term memory context the longer they have been awake, and are able to create ingenious code in late hours more so than in their morning.<p>Basically, what it seems Carmack is arguing here is that he wants to get all the possible work out of all employees. Feel free to correct me John if that is not what you mean.<p>I personally don&#x27;t find it necessary to extract all possible work from employees, as I respect their free time and personal life. I value happiness of my workers over how much work they get done. Happy workers create better results imo.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36366546" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36366546" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ineedasername</span><span>|</span><a href="#36366703">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36366033">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36366546">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36366546">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don’t think it’s one size fits all. Carmack mentions some people just have 7 good hours in them a day. But you can’t just think in terms of day by day, even for the same person:<p>Sometimes I have 60 good hours a week in me, some days more or less than average to get there. I’m obsessed with an idea, driven to complete it.<p>And sometime I’ve barely got a solid 15 hours in me for the week, maybe for multiple weeks at a time. No simple answer for what leads me there, but the rest of my time is spent working on the absolutely more urgent things that can’t wait and then just trying to fill the other hours with things that aren’t completely useless, learning about current tech trends, trying to find something “shiny” to strike my interest that has at least minimal relevance to my field, etc.<p>I’m sure that averaged out my workplaces have received the value they paid for in my salary, but there’s peaks and valleys. And sometimes that even includes having a “screw it” day where nothing critical has to get done and I need a mental breather, time to clear my head from the day to day.<p>But that’s just me. Everyone will be different. Trying to make a universal paradigm of optimized productivity is a waste of effort. The best you might get are some general guidelines and enlightened flexibility.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36366033" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36366033" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tomxor</span><span>|</span><a href="#36366546">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36366161">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36366033">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36366033">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; it would make the world “less unequal” if everyone was prevented from working longer hours.

Equally, in the past I&#x27;ve done ludum dares for 24, I seem to remember once even getting close to 48 hours straight, and at the end I&#x27;m full of beans (or more so than you&#x27;d expect). Again, obviously interest plays a part here but what is much bigger in my opinion is that I know that at the end of that 48 hours, my work is done. I&#x27;m &quot;free&quot;. If I were to do 48 hours straight at my office job, I&#x27;d still be back in the next day, and the day after, and so on.<p>If the work has no end, what is the motivation to power through it?</div><br/><div id="36366176" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36366176" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LimitedInfo</span><span>|</span><a href="#36366161">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36367936">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36366176">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36366176">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think your last sentence is the reason for the obsession with starting your own venture.

Each officer always possesses two of these qualities.<p>Those who are clever and industrious I appoint to the General Staff. Use can under certain circumstances be made of those who are stupid and lazy. The man who is clever and lazy qualifies for the highest leadership posts. He has the requisite nerves and the mental clarity for difficult decisions. But whoever is stupid and industrious must be got rid of, for he is too dangerous.”<p>Carmack clearly falls into the clever and industrious bracket and his perspective is skewed by his own disposition.</div><br/><div id="36364358" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36364358" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">elijaht</span><span>|</span><a href="#36361747">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36362593">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36364358">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36364358">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Seems like napoleon said it too: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.johndcook.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;12&#x2F;27&#x2F;dumb-and-gets-things-done&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.johndcook.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2010&#x2F;12&#x2F;27&#x2F;dumb-and-gets-thin...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36362593" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36362593" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anotherhue</span><span>|</span><a href="#36361747">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36364358">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36362593">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36362593">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord 1878–1943</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

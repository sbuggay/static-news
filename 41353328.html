There was no increase in support tickets about pricing, which suggests users are overall less confused and happier.<p>Of course if you hide the fact that your product might cost a lot of money from your users, more of them will sign up. Whether they are better off depends on whether they end up getting a bill they are unhappy with later at some unspecified future date, or not. That&#x27;s not something you will figure out from a short-term A&#x2F;B test on the signup page. So this seems like totally useless evidence to me.<p>I see this dynamic frequently with A&#x2F;B tests. For example, one of my coworkers implemented a change that removed information from search result snippets. They then ran an A&#x2F;B test that showed that after removing the information, people clicked through to the search result page more often. Well, obviously, it makes sense that they might click through more often, if information they wanted which was previously in the snippet, now requires them to click through.

The next week, a more senior engineer removed all those columns and associated code, citing the YAGNI principle (“you aren’t gonna need it”). He was technically correct, there was no requirement for it on our roadmap yet.<p>But the original work had taken me maybe an hour. And the cost of keeping the data around was approximately zero. It seemed he didn’t consider that.<p>Guess who needed the columns to build a feature a year later? Yeah me, so I found myself repeating the work, with the additional overhead of prod DB migrations etc now that the product had users.<p>I guess my point is, sometimes it’s also wise to consider the opposite:<p>Would anything of value be gained if this or that chunk of it was removed?<p>In this article the evidence is clearly affirmative, but in my case, well it wasn’t so clear cut.</div><br/><div id="41354613" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41354613" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">infogulch</span><span>|</span><a href="#41354245">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41354568">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41354613">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41354613">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m sympathetic to your situation, but it&#x27;s possible that the senior was still right to remove it at the time, even if you were eventually right that the product would need it in the end.<p>If I recall correctly they have a measure at SpaceX that captures this idea: The ratio of features added back a <i>second time</i> to total removed features. If every removed feature was added back, a 100% &#x27;feature recidivism&#x27; (if you grant some wordsmithing liberty), then obviously you&#x27;re cutting features too often. 70% is too much, even 30%. But critically <i>0% feature recidivism is bad too</i> because it means that you&#x27;re not trying hard enough to remove unneeded features and you will accumulate bloat as a result. I guess you&#x27;d want this ratio to run higher early in a product&#x27;s lifecycle and eventually asymptote down to a low non-zero percentage as the product matures.<p>From this perspective the exact set of features required to make the best product are an unknown in the present, so it&#x27;s fine to take a stochastic approach to removing features to make sure you cut unneeded ones.

So they were entering a value literally 1,536x higher than they should&#x27;ve. Their actual usage would be calculated (by Pinecone) correctly and not be that high.<p>Vector dimensionality is a basic concept for AI engineers and QPS is a basic metric for DB admins, but Pinecone sees lots of users who are either new to AI or new to managing DBs or both.</div><br/><div id="41354044" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41354044" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">makeitdouble</span><span>|</span><a href="#41353671">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41353751">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41354344">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41354044">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41354044">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks !<p>&gt; where &quot;top-k&quot; is the number of results they want back.<p>Some systems will do that, so I get the confusion.

Pinecone is notoriously expensive compared to other vector database services. A horizontal price comparison reveals several better options in the market.
Removing the calculator doesn&#x27;t solve the core issue - it just obfuscates costs and makes it harder for users to compare options upfront. In my view, this approach merely reduces the comparison stage, potentially leading more uninformed users to upload data without fully understanding the pricing implications.
While simplification can be valuable, in this case it seems to benefit the company more than the users. A better approach might be to improve the calculator&#x27;s accuracy and usability rather than removing it entirely. Transparency in pricing is crucial, especially for B2B services where costs can scale quickly.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41354146" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41354146" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">raylad</span><span>|</span><a href="#41354112">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41354396">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41354146">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41354146">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I experienced something similar.

Customers need to know what the platform will charge and a way to compare platforms in general. If the only way to truly know how much something will cost is to run their code on it, then maybe that&#x27;s the thing that someone needs to implement.<p>There are big issues with this in the most-naive implementation in that people can easily abuse the ability to run code. That suggests that perhaps we need a benchmark-only environment where benchmarks themselves are the only thing allowed out of the environment. This may require a fair-amount of engineering&#x2F;standards effort but could be a game-changer in the space.<p>A framework for being able to run this on many platforms to compare performance and pricing would lead to customers generating packages for vendors to compete. Though, I suppose it could also hide some devilish details like step-changes in rates.<p>This same framework would be useful for other things too, like testing how implementation changes affect future bills. Also, how pricing changes between vendors might become more-advantageous over time.<p>Of course, the sales folks might balk because they would rather have a conversation with everyone they can.

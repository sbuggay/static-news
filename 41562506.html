Youtube cooks became a thing about fifteen years ago. People like Jamie Oliver started promoting first themselves and then others on Youtube and I sort of started watching that stuff to relax. The genius of this was that Jamie Oliver was of course famous but the people he promoted weren&#x27;t. They were just ordinary people that pointed a camera at themselves while they were cooking stuff. Quite a few of them are still on Youtube and have successful channels now. And of course others have come along. There are many thousands of people regularly uploading stuff. These days if I want to learn how to make something, Youtube is the first place to look.<p>It took me a ridiculously long time to realize that I could do some cooking myself. If you are a programmer (like me), my realization was that if I can follow instructions and implement some complex algorithm, cooking is a lot easier. And even the failures can be tasty.<p>Julia Childs was basically doing the same thing as these Youtube chefs but about half a century earlier. You can find quite a bit of her shows on Youtube. But it&#x27;s got a similar vibe to it: shot at home, very passionate about what she did, very relatable, etc. And it necessarily follows a similar format. She was funny, and no-nonsense. Very unglamorous too. And obviously very skilled. She was a middle aged woman by the time she got on TV. It was all about the food and her character.<p>I can&#x27;t say she was a huge influence for me because I never knew she existed until some Youtube chefs kept referring to her and I checked out some of her stuff.<p>Anyway, I loved the bit of information about her WW II career as a high level intelligence officer. Only makes her more awesome.</div><br/><div id="41599958" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41599958" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">datpiff</span><span>|</span><a href="#41598763">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41599812">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41599958">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41599958">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Jamie Oliver started promoting first themselves and then others on Youtube<p>He had multiple TV cooking shows before Youtube even launched</div><br/></div></div><div id="41599812" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41599812" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jstanley</span><span>|</span><a href="#41598763">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41599958">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41599383">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41599812">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41599812">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; It took me a ridiculously long time to realize that I could do some cooking myself.<p>What were you eating before you had this realisation?</div><br/><div id="41600006" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41600006" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jillesvangurp</span><span>|</span><a href="#41598763">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41599812">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41599383">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41600006">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41600006">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was cooking but not very well.

There were techniques and recipes that simply weren&#x27;t available to the English speaking world at the time. It&#x27;s different nowadays, especially with English being so much more dominant. It&#x27;s easy for us to find someone French doing a video in English. As of about 10 years ago there was still a bit more to learn if you learnt French, but the amount of stuff left is shrinking.<p>For anyone who wants to learn to cook my advice is not to learn recipes but instead learn ingredients, tools and techniques. Good books like Child&#x27;s <i>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</i> dedicate many pages to this before they get into recipes (this book incidentally sets out the ingredients better than any other cooking book or website I&#x27;ve ever seen). Where YouTube shines is the techniques. Books do an admirable job of describing kneading, but nothing beats seeing someone do it. That&#x27;s how we really learn this stuff, and must of us don&#x27;t have a parent to learn from these days. So watch YouTube videos, but pay extra special attention to what they are doing, more so than what they are saying (you could have just read that part).</div><br/><div id="41599863" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41599863" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dragonwriter</span><span>|</span><a href="#41598763">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41599383">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41599573">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41599863">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41599863">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; For anyone who wants to learn to cook my advice is not to learn recipes but instead learn ingredients, tools and techniques.<p>For anyone who wants to learn ingredients, tools, and techniques, my advice is to start by learning recipes, preferably from a source that explains both rationale and variations (<i>America&#x27;s Test Kitchen</i> cookbooks are pretty good for this.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="41599573" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41599573" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">maccard</span><span>|</span><a href="#41598763">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41599383">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41599863">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41599733">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41599573">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41599573">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; For anyone who wants to learn to cook my advice is not to learn recipes but instead learn ingredients, tools and techniques.

Using recipes is as important to a cook as reading programs is to a programmer. But the focus, if you want to <i>learn</i> to cook, should be on ingredients, tools and techniques. For a start, you will not enjoy making <i>any</i> recipe without a good knife. What&#x27;s more, your execution will be terrible if you don&#x27;t know what &quot;finely diced onion&quot; is supposed to be or how to make it, or how much &quot;salt to taste&quot; is. You won&#x27;t enjoy it and will forever think restaurant&#x2F;takeaway food is better than your own creations.<p>Recipes are always written at a particular level of abstraction. Most won&#x27;t tell you how to dice an onion, but many will tell you explicitly how to make a roux, without saying the word roux. Learning the basics means you can skim and assimilate recipes at a much higher level. Plenty of people can <i>follow</i> recipes but few can <i>learn</i> a recipe from first principles as there are far too many details. To <i>learn</i> a recipe you need to first learn the basics, then you find a recipe is rather easy to learn. Then once you can do that you have the power to tweak them or substitute ingredients etc. as necessary and&#x2F;or desired.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41599733" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41599733" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jillesvangurp</span><span>|</span><a href="#41598763">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41599383">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41599573">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41598040">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41599733">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41599733">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You are not wrong.

I wonder why YouTube doesn&#x27;t face this same problem. I know it&#x27;s very subjective, but I&#x27;ve managed to find a plethora of incredibly well made videos on YouTube. It used to have a much worse clickbait problem in the past but at least in the last few years I&#x27;ve usually been able to .<p>I suppose it comes down to 2 main differences.<p>1. It&#x27;s much easier to post a good looking but badly researched piece of writing than it is to make a good video. So it&#x27;s hard to tell before clicking or investing time in reading something that it&#x27;s good.<p>2. Google knows everything about a YouTube video&#x27;s metrics so can base recommendations off of much more information than it can over just the click through rate that it knows about articles on Google News. So articles with high click through rate will be recommended regardless of whether they&#x27;re actually high quality which incentivizes clickbait. Meanwhile a YouTube video with high click through rate but terrible audience retention won&#x27;t be recommended.</div><br/><div id="40208389" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40208389" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">b3orn</span><span>|</span><a href="#40206983">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40208316">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40208389">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40208389">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In my opinion there are lots of good looking but badly researched videos on YouTube.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40208316" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40208316" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nox101</span><span>|</span><a href="#40206983">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40208389">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40207511">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40208316">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40208316">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">youtube is full of crap news and crap tech stuff.

(And consequently the fast AI that is LLM which read <i>all</i> the journalism ever recorded)<p>It’s why it’s important that journalists focus on “this is true”.  It’s why science papers are journalism. It’s why it’s important that science papers are published solely on the basis of “is it true” not “does it follow a narrative (#).<p>This is the huge test for AI&#x2F;LLM;  If you state a thing, can you provide a link for why you know that. At the moment we just have “based on things I have read the thing is statistically most likely to be said (hence true).”<p>We really need “the truth”<p>(#) I am thinking here of things like archeology in Nazi Germany which switched heavily to publishing nonsense about Aryan people in different parts of world earlier than anyone else.

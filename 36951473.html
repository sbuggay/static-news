It&#x27;s easy for any one study to observe some pattern by chance (one black raven), but if repeated studies all show this pattern exists, then we kind of start to believe the pattern might be true.<p>Bayesian statisticians don&#x27;t use the falsification paradigm directly, but instead focus on estimation, and combining the evidence from multiple experiments to obtain &quot;tighter bounds&quot; on the estimated quantities of interest.

So in the most literal sense of the world, a deductive argument is not falsifiable.<p>Another example of non-falsifiability is verbal bunk that refers to poorly defined or undefined concepts. The claims are not specific enough that they can be investigated and found true or false.<p>E.g. &quot;The world didn&#x27;t exist yesterday; it came into being moments ago, with everything in it, including all your memories, and all of civilization and its apparent historic record.&quot; Okay, great; by what means of investigation can you tell that this is right? If this claim were false, how would the investigation inform you?<p>Claims about gravity are falsifiable if they are specific and testable. E.g. &quot;If I release this rock, it will move toward the ground and come to rest&quot; is falsifiable because in some imaginary world, it could happen that the rock instead flies up and away when released. The claim is specific: we can construe what kinds of events could be observed which would make it false, like that the opposite of what is predicted happens.

One obvious thing from this article - not all flours actually contain gluten - has an implication for how you evaluate your starters. If you are looking for your starter to double in size, which is something world + dog insists on in online recipes, you need a flour that contains gluten.<p>Flours like rye or whole wheat don&#x27;t have a lot of gluten relative to white flour. And there are a whole lot of online recipes recommending specifically those flours for feeding your starter. When you bake with such flours, you get a denser bread and when you create a starter with them, you&#x27;ll struggle to get them to double in size for the same reason. They&#x27;ll ferment and bake just fine. But there&#x27;s just a whole lot less gluten to hold the starter together. Of course there&#x27;s a wide variety of flours and milling techniques that determine how much gluten is actually in each flour. It&#x27;s entirely possible to have whole wheat with lots of gluten. Rye has less of it but still some. It all depends.<p>I tend to use rye and whole wheat for flavoring. I baked a 75% spelt, 20% whole wheat and 5% rye flour bread last week. Very tasty. And I got a good over rise out of it (using a Dutch oven, which I highly recommend). My starter is the bastard offspring of whatever I had around to feed it for the past seven years. I started it off on regular white flour from the super market. What you&#x27;d call all purpose flour in the US, I guess. And since then I feed it with whatever I have around. When I don&#x27;t use it, it lives in my fridge. For months on end. It ends up looking really sad. But then you feed it and it bounces right back. After observing that it was struggling to double in size with whole wheat or rye flour a few years ago, I now feed it with spelt flour. Which seems to work well. It&#x27;s a German 1050 variety. Which means it&#x27;s high in protein and gluten.</div><br/><div id="37912280" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37912280" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Pyramus</span><span>|</span><a href="#37911864">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37912094">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37912280">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37912280">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; When you bake with such flours, you get a denser bread and when you create a starter with them, you&#x27;ll struggle to get them to double in size for the same reason.<p>Sharing my personal experience: I use a 100% rye starter (wholemeal or, preferably, German type 1150 [1]) and my starter grows ~2-2.5x in volume. Gluten has an impact but is less important when you proof in a small container (same reason you would bake a high hydration rye bread in a tin). What is a lot more important is that a) the hydration is right, so the starter is not too liquid (in my case a bit less than 100%), and b) you feed the starter in a ratio of 1:3 old:new, or even 1:5.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hefe-und-mehr.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;2014&#x2F;03&#x2F;mehl&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hefe-und-mehr.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;2014&#x2F;03&#x2F;mehl&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37912094" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37912094" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fransje26</span><span>|</span><a href="#37911864">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37912280">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37911563">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37912094">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37912094">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What&#x27;s the obsession with having your starter double in size? I haven&#x27;t heard about it before.<p>I&#x27;m feeding my starter by weight, so that I can take the same amount out when I bake, and the volume of growth really doesn&#x27;t come into play.. I mix in whatever I have, mostly rye and spelt, sometimes wholegrain wheat, but it hardly ever doubles in volume and the bread comes out fine at the end of the process.<p>If you have a nice range of bubbles sizes forming in your newly mixed starter, you&#x27;ll be fine.</div><br/><div id="37912248" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37912248" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jwr</span><span>|</span><a href="#37911864">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37912094">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37912247">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37912248">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37912248">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Rye starter might not double in size, and that&#x27;s fine. In fact, mine usually go through a period of hyper-growth 2-3 days after they are initiated, but that is <i>not</i> when they are ready: if I make bread then, it comes out overly sour&#x2F;acidic. I learned to wait another 4-5 days until the starter stabilizes and stops growing like crazy, which gives me a better balance of bacteria and fungi.<p>Mind you, this is with a starter based on while rye flour. So, a side note: HN is predominantly US, and for some reason everybody in the US seems to think whole rye flour is only good for making pumpernickel. None of the bread-baking books I saw listed this simple recipe: 350g whole rye flour, 250g wheat flour, around 500ml water, 10g salt, 50g starter, let grow for 8h, bake at 210C for 1h10.<p>No kneading, no fuss, bread for busy people, and extremely tasty at that.

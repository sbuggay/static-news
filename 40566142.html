LotR is a fantasy world, and such worlds are filled with fantasies: imaginary things that are unrealistic and don&#x27;t need to be physically feasible.</div><br/><div id="40568505" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40568505" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">astrange</span><span>|</span><a href="#40567179">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40567230">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40568505">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40568505">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a stretch. I think the idea that LoTR is highly idealized&#x2F;idyllic is an interpretation made up by people who didn&#x27;t notice how carefully it&#x27;s written and thought he left it out!<p>Similarly, a lot of later grimdarker fantasy stories try to be &quot;Tolkein but with realistic tax systems and warfare&quot;, so something like ASoIaF tries to talk about those things more, but then messes up the actual details so it&#x27;s inconsistent. But if you follow the analyses on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acoup.blog&#x2F;author&#x2F;aimedtact&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acoup.blog&#x2F;author&#x2F;aimedtact&#x2F;</a>, the battles in LoTR are very carefully thought out and realistic (based on Tolkein&#x27;s personal experience) and Gondor&#x27;s feudalist system is also pretty realistic (based on his academic expertise). He just talked about the details less.<p>I would even say they&#x27;re grimmer than &quot;grimdark&quot; stories, half of the Gondor battle is about the enemy using psychological warfare tactics and the story ends with Frodo having to leave with the elves because he has PTSD.<p>(I further claim that the reason LoTR doesn&#x27;t have many women isn&#x27;t because he forgot about them, it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re doing household labor and Frodo doesn&#x27;t encounter them due to being something between a celibate priest and gay.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="40567230" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40567230" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jerf</span><span>|</span><a href="#40567179">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40568505">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40567627">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40567230">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40567230">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Even in-universe the Hobbits aren&#x27;t fully &quot;realistic&quot;; they are supported by the Rangers keeping the many and sundry threats of Middle Earth off of their borders.

So there was very little consideration for things economics and agriculture because it wasn&#x27;t that type of story, and those types of things aren&#x27;t important in fairy tales. And when he started to write the early drafts of The Lord of the Rings, he was still very much in that mode - it was intended to be a direct sequel to The Hobbit and the opening chapters have that much more light hearted feel to them.<p>But the story grew in the telling, and by the time he reached the end of of The Lord of the Rings he was far more invested in realism and consistency within the world - so was paying a lot more attention to this type of thing (including going back and editing and rewriting sections multiple times).<p>This is also very evident in his other writings. The first drafts of what would become The Silmarillion were very much more fantastical and mythic - we got stories of a flat world and very brief and vague descriptions of the Elves awaking under the stars before the Sun and Moon were made, and marching across the land. The versions of that same story he wrote towards the end of his life had a round world, and carefully planning out of the Elvish aging and reproductive cycles throughout the march, to work out how many generations would be needed for there to be a suitably large host.</div><br/><div id="40567724" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40567724" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">causality0</span><span>|</span><a href="#40567179">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40567627">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40569209">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40567724">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40567724">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Didn&#x27;t the world start as flat and then Eru made it round to keep Aman away from mortal eyes, being reachable only by those who could see the &quot;straight path&quot; like the elves?</div><br/><div id="40567810" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40567810" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">entuno</span><span>|</span><a href="#40567179">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40567724">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40569209">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40567810">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40567810">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In The Lord of the Rings and the published Silmarillion that&#x27;s correct.

There is substantial evidence supporting the statement that most violence is committed by people who know each other rather than by strangers. Here are some key findings from various sources:<p>- <i>Sexual Violence</i>: According to RAINN (Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network), the majority of sexual abuse cases reported to law enforcement show that 93% of juvenile victims knew the perpetrator: 59% were acquaintances, 34% were family members, and only 7% were strangers¹.<p>- <i>General Violence</i>: Data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) indicates that less than half of all violent crimes were committed by total strangers. A significant portion of violent crimes were committed by acquaintances, friends, and relatives⁵.<p>- <i>Homicide</i>: In 2004, only 23% of murders were committed by strangers, highlighting that a larger percentage of homicides occur between individuals who know each other⁴.<p>These statistics demonstrate that violence is more likely to occur within known social circles rather than between strangers. It&#x27;s important to note that these findings are based on reported cases and surveys, which can have limitations, but they provide a general understanding of the patterns of violence.<p>Source: Conversation with Copilot, 6&#x2F;3&#x2F;2024

It is one of the great contradictions of civilization and one of the great sources of its discontents, and Sigmund Freud even found a term for it: “the narcissism of the small difference.” As he wrote, “It is precisely the minor differences in people who are otherwise alike that form the basis of feelings of hostility between them.”<p>It&#x27;s just a part of the human condition, sadly, to hate others based on the smallest of differences.

When I asked my father that question, he pointed out that fairy tails often start with brothers &quot;setting out to seek their fortune&quot; and invariably have the youngest brother coming out on top.  The reason was the laws of primogeniture--the oldest son inherits everything, so in every generation, all of the younger sons had to do just that--go out and see if they could make something happen, because despite their privileged upbringing, they were going to get dumped out into the wide world to fend for themselves.</div><br/><div id="40572216" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40572216" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">082349872349872</span><span>|</span><a href="#40567416">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40567758">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40572216">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40572216">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>Class here is not as in-your-face as it is in Great Briton.</i><p>Only because you&#x27;re a fish in water.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40567758" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40567758" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">coldtea</span><span>|</span><a href="#40567416">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40567797">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40567758">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40567758">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;<i>The implication in both books and movies is that most Hobbits spent their time either farming or enjoying leisure time, but this makes little sense, when one considers what we know about premodern agriculture and what little of life and culture in the Shire.</i><p>That&#x27;s not even wrong.

The acquirer can keep the rest of the code closed sourced and integrate it into their own products all they want.

If some insulin pump uses proprietary firmware licensed from Johnson &amp; Johnson for some part of its operation, does Johnson &amp; Johnson lose its entire firmware licensing business as soon as one customer goes bankrupt? Or are they forced to become a B2C company and manage and sell licenses to millions of people it had no relationship with before? Is it weaponizable: pick a competitor, get them to license some software to a shell company of yours that makes a token device with it, fold the shell company, and now the competitor is required to give away their firmware to the public (and you)?</div><br/><div id="41816213" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41816213" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zulban</span><span>|</span><a href="#41815714">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815782">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815824">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41816213">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41816213">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Have you completely misunderstood the concept here?

On copyright (from which proprietary software is derived) I&#x27;m less convinced.<p>My argument is two-fold;<p>Firstly, copyright law is the only thing that allows Open Source and Free Software to exist. Copyright is the mechanism that grants an author control of their work, and is the mechanism that forces people building on OSS&#x2F;Free Software to release code.<p>You talk about &quot;ending proprietary software&quot;, which in turn means effectively removing copyright, since it removes the authors control over their source code.<p>Secondly, and from a completely different direction, killing proprietary software basically kills all the software people use.<p>Sure OSS is great at infrastructure. But it has performed poorly in becoming the software people care about. Without proprietary software there&#x27;s no Chrome, Google Search, Gmail, YouTube, Facebook, Netflix, MS office, Dropbox, AWS, et al.<p>In infrastructure there&#x27;s no iOS, Windows, Macs, Google services (aka Android as we know it) etc.<p>To argue that OSS has clones or replacements of this stuff is o miss the point that proprietary software created these products and markets. And for all the clones that may be out there most have &lt; 10% market share, actually most have &lt; 1% market share, because most clones are either poor refections or simply get their feature list from the proprietary work.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41816411" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41816411" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Rexxar</span><span>|</span><a href="#41815714">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41815782">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41816100">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41816411">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41816411">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Maybe it could be done by considering the technical dependencies as a debt toward customers that should be higher in the debt hierarchy.

The op is proposing that not all agreements made by a company should be void on bankruptcy.<p>Really, there are cases where this is obviously a change that needs to happen. Eg, if a company holds personal data, the agreements that allowed a company to obtain it should live across bankruptcy with the data, not be terminated if it is transferred.<p>This sort of arrangement is common in real property. For example, if you buy a house where you have to access it via  some other private land, the agreement that you can do so is arranged in such a way that it can&#x27;t be voided when that land is sold, even during bankruptcy. You can&#x27;t do that for data AFAIK (would love for a lawyer to comment). It needs to be enabled and made mandatory in cases like this.<p>There is some limited ability to do this: creditors can get a &quot;charge&quot; registered against intellectual property, so theoretically in the OP&#x27;s case one might be able to design a legal construct that would cause a bankruptcy court to give rights to some special purpose vehicle that is set up (in advance) to represent the patients.

If the company was no longer maintaining OEM parts for the older model device it might be prevented from using slightly different parts from newer models to repair the older model without basically needing to have the older device + new part be cleared as a completely different medical device. I&#x27;m speculating and this might not be entirely accurate.<p>Edit: actually it appears that the company marketing this device did not comply with an FDA order to conduct a postmarket surveilence study to asses its risks.<p>In September 2015 the &quot;FDA informed ReWalk that its noncompliance with the postmarket surveillance study deadline rendered the device misbranded.&quot; This is from a 2020 class action lawsuit against the company which was dismissed but it&#x27;s not clear to me that the misbranding issue was ever taken care of, which could be the reason the company was initially hesitant to provide service to the device?

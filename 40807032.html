They could have easily auctioned off&#x2F;sold very old content to someone else but that kind of thinking would be beyond their competency. It&#x27;s no wonder they go in such huge losses despite of having loyal audience and monopoly over unparalleled content. To this day I cannot get over the fact that there are literally millions documentaries out there made with a lot of love and hard work but only available through DVD or mailing in a check to some dude. Similarly, lot of my favorite music albums are still on cassette tapes and never digitized online by their creators. Fortunately, audience did digitized them nicely and uploaded over to torrents and that&#x27;s the only way to get them today. Same goes of out of print books and magazines. The producers of this content could have easily digitized it and uploaded over to some marketplace and made at least free coffee money for rest of their lives but surprisingly they just never get around doing it. IMO, it just expresses complete naivety and disregard to importance of their own content. They sure spent days and months of blood and sweat but can&#x27;t get around to do a last mile of uploading files.<p>There is a huge startup opportunity here for folks who are willing to chase these content and do the last mile on their behalf.</div><br/><div id="40808089" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40808089" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">onion2k</span><span>|</span><a href="#40807847">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40808444">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40808089">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40808089">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>They could have easily auctioned off&#x2F;sold very old content to someone else..</i><p>That assumes they own the exclusive rights to the content.

It&#x27;s like all these people who basically were in content distribution didn&#x27;t really wise up to the next, new thing in their business even as it happened in front of their eyes.<p>It&#x27;s pretty wild that Paramount+&#x2F;Disney+&#x2F;Peacock or whatever really struggle to get going, especially given that they provide access to top shows that people really want to watch. It&#x27;s like having Breaking Bad-esque product but really screwing up when it comes to wanting people to watch it.<p>Given the extent to which the tech behind streaming platforms -- storage, CDNs, tie-ups with telecoms -- have been standardized (and democratized, to some extent) by big players like YouTube and Netflix, you would think that a basic ad supported layer of any of these studio specific platforms would make many multiples of what they actually need to put in to setup a basic platform.<p>The tech&#x27;s cheap and they already have the content. Most of the older content would be relatively low traffic -- hell, most of these old topical Comedy Central late night shows barely broke a million views when they were new and I don&#x27;t think jokes about Saddam Hussein and GW&#x27;s folksy demeanor would click now. How much would it really cost for any big studio to let people view these archives? Am I missing something big that causes somebody like Paramount to go $14B in debt trying to get people to use their streaming service?

The only thing I would add is that it will be interesting to see if professional, medium&#x2F;high budget, polished, &quot;produced&quot; content will remain a stable and significant niche that is distinct from user-generated content. And does the high-production-value content directly compete with low-production value user-created content? And what percentage of a user&#x27;s consumption it will represent in the future? And does the pool of available time for an individual consumer grow to accommodate both?
To put it another way, on some level, all content competes for our time, so it&#x27;s all in competition. On a different level, a Twitch livestream or TikTok feels like an entirely different category of media from a scripted, high-production-value TV series or movie, and I want both in the world.<p>While traditional publishers may be losing % of daily media consumption - especially in younger age brackets - it&#x27;s unclear to me where this trend asymptotes. My intuition is that most people will spend some time on &quot;reels&quot; or livestreams (or whatever), some time on blockbuster movies, some on Broadway plays, and some time on scripted produced &quot;TV style&quot; content. Some will expand their denominator of total time to accommodate additional media sources, others will pick one over the other.<p>It seems there will be a degree of loss of market share as you allude to, but it&#x27;s unclear how dramatic it will be and where it stabilizes.<p>One thing is absolutely 100% for sure though in my opinion: media preservation should be deeply prioritized, and this news seems like a blow to that.</div><br/><div id="40808341" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40808341" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">soco</span><span>|</span><a href="#40807747">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40808228">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40808198">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40808341">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40808341">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yesterday was MTV News deleting their archive, right?

If you create a new version of Mickey Mouse based on the 1928 version in Steamboat Willy, it is difficult to make something that looks relatively contemporary without creating something that looks arguably derivative of the 1953 work “The Simple Things” or the 1940 work “Fantasia”. You could play it safe by using something that looks like a carbon copy of Steamboat Willy, but if your personal artistic vision involves a more contemporary art style, it is understandably difficult to make it unambiguously not a derivative of more recent depictions that are still under copyright.<p>For the Starcraft 2 example - in a thought experiment where the 14 year old “Wings of Liberty” version is now public domain but the 11-year old “Heart of the Swarm” expansion pack and current 9-year old “Legacy of the Void” version of StarCraft 2 are both still under copyright. You want to make a new single-player campaign which takes place after LotV and doesn’t retcon any canon events (many of which are still copyrighted).  A careful creator would probably understand they couldn’t make any references to Amon being reborn and defeated by Artanis, because that plot is from the still-copyrighted Legacy of the Void. But would you be able to write a storyline that contains any acknowledgements that Zeratul died? (Zeratul died at the hand of his friend, Artanis, due to some of Amon’s mind-control machinations during that same LotV campaign)<p>I think a creator would have to be careful precisely how their storyline acknowledges Zeratuls death. If its just a few characters generically lamenting the loss of a great&#x2F;controversial man…probably fine? What if the loss of their friend Zeratul was specified to have occurred “in battle” with no other specifics about the battle? I have no clue. If your storyline includes a tiny quip about Artanis dealing with unspecified guilt&#x2F;shame over Zeratul’s unspecified death … then that might be <i>technically</i> infringing until LotV falls out of copyright, because some people may feel that it’s <i>specific</i> enough to be definitely derived from the LotV campaign.<p>Note that all three of these similar examples are where a creator does in fact intend to create a derivation of copyrighted materials to create a sequel campaign to the uncopyrighted work which is still “in-canon” with respect to still-copyrighted works. Its just exploring where is the line of “how much derivation can you morally and&#x2F;or ethically and&#x2F;or legally get away with before at least one reasonable person genuinely feels you have elements that are unambiguously derived from still-copyrighted content?”<p>For “legally” getting away with something you have to consider the costs of successfully defending yourself against lawsuits from notoriously overly-litigious corporations like Disney&#x2F;Nintendo&#x2F;Blizzard. Are you so safe that you could get a summary dismissal or is there any reason it could qualify for awards of punitive damages under Anti-SLAPP laws?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40807741" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40807741" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">modeless</span><span>|</span><a href="#40807495">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40807513">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40807718">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40807539">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40807741">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40807741">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A better fix would be to make copyright last 5 years from the date of publication.

A quick google shows that it extends to 70 years past the life of the creator, [1] which means that it would be quite unlikely that an adult who receives artwork from the creator would live to see the time when it&#x27;s not under copyright. That is, even if the artist died the next day, it would be 70 years before the copyright expires.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.copyright.gov&#x2F;history&#x2F;copyright-exhibit&#x2F;lifecycle&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.copyright.gov&#x2F;history&#x2F;copyright-exhibit&#x2F;lifecycl...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40807860" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40807860" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">arrosenberg</span><span>|</span><a href="#40807495">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40807813">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40807868">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40807877">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40807860">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40807860">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No, because thats theft.

The LLM itself is already the most powerful app you can think of. Trying to hide it with a UI that looks a little more than what you are already familiar with is removing its expressive power.<p>&gt;&gt; There are no better examples than Stable Diffusion prompts.<p>StableDiffusion prompts are a terrible example for the power of modern LLMs, as StableDiffusion has extremely primitive understanding of language, unlike ChatGPT. With StableDiffusion you are really just laying keywords and concepts together hoping that something interesting will happen. The moment you ask it for anything even remotely complex it falls apart. Ask it to generate &quot;blue hair&quot; and it might give you blue hair, but it will also paint random other objects in the image blue. Even simple attributes don&#x27;t stick to the objects you assigned them to. Complex actions or expressions don&#x27;t work at all. You have to use ControlNet, in-painting and other tricks to create complex images. The language model of StableDiffusion just can&#x27;t handle it and the image generation itself is also lacking in generalization (i.e. you need custom trained models for specific styles or topics). It also doesn&#x27;t allow the iterative refinement that you can do in ChatGPT, you only get a single prompt.<p>Prompt engineering is a short term workaround for the limitations of the current models. But that is going away.

The code itself was a mashup of MS SAPI demo of &quot;controlled language&quot; interface and some tutorials for how to control WinAMP with WM_USER messages in WinAPI. I designed a little tree of commands, maybe 3 level deep, wrote the magic XML for it, some trivial C++ logic for driving the voice recognizer and reacting to identified commands (including one that held the recognizer two levels deep in the command tree, so I could issue multiple commands from a subtree without having to repeat two extra words for each).<p>The result of this couple afternoons of working on this (instead of learning for my maturity exams, as I was supposed to), was a system that, I kid you not, was more reliable and delivered more value to me than any of the current voice assistants. For one, its recognition was flawless. The typical interaction would look like:<p><pre><code>  $ Computer!
  &gt; &lt;appropriate beep from Star Trek: TNG, because of course
     doing this was 90% of my reason for building the program&gt;
  $ Music, Playlist Alpha
  &gt; &lt;appropriate confirmation beep, WinAMP begins to play&gt;
</code></pre>
I had commands for usual play&#x2F;pause&#x2F;resume, next&#x2F;previous, four playlist (alpha through delta), and volume control at different granularity (&quot;mute&quot;, &quot;one quarter&quot;, &quot;two quarters&quot;, &quot;three quarters&quot;, &quot;full&quot;, plus &quot;louder&quot; and &quot;quieter&quot; for IIRC +&#x2F;- 5% or +&#x2F;- 10% jumps). Plus some stubs for non-music thing that IIRC I never eventually implemented.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing: it worked <i>flawlessly</i>. It heard me across the room. It heard me through music so loud that it was uncomfortable to talk in. It never self-triggered (except that one person who managed to make a swear word be read as the wake word, a single case out of many who tried). It worked <i>fast</i> - I could complete the whole command chain in less time than Google Assistant takes to start listening after &quot;OK Google&quot;. The secret? Constrained grammar and <i>training</i>.<p>In order to use speech recognition in Windows back then, you had to turn it on and let it analyze a sample of your voice (offline! those were the days!), based on a recording of you reading some calibration text it gave you. This process was additive - you could repeat it to improve recognition accuracy. But a little known fact was that you could also <i>supply your own text</i> - and that was the other half that made the magic happen.<p>I created myself a training text, consisting of individual command words and their sequences, and trained the Windows speech recognition on it multiple times, under varying conditions. Specifically, I run:<p>{three locations in the room} x ({no background} + ({classical music, pop music, whatever was on FM radio} x {quiet playback, normal playback, very loud playback}))<p>training sessions. That&#x27;s 30 sessions of repeating the same text. Each one took maybe a minute or less, so I was done with it in about an hour. And after that training, no matter where I was standing in the room and what I was doing, the voice control system worked with near-zero false positives and near-zero false negatives. I say &quot;near&quot; because I had maybe two or three cases of each, over months of continued use. And yes, I could play music so loud you couldn&#x27;t talk in the room, and I could scream out commands, outshouting the music, <i>and it would work</i>. Try that with Google Assistant.<p>To recap: I had a system I hacked together in couple evenings, whose software was a relatively small tweak to a default example project (but done with love!) and hardware was hand-soldered from cheapest, locally-sourced parts, that did everything I wanted from a voice assistant, did it flawlessly, much faster than any of the voice assistants on the market today, <i>completely off-line, in 2007, on a mid-range PC, without noticeably taxing its resources</i>. This is why I occasionally rant that voice assistants are bloated and done backwards - all because they&#x27;re designed to suit vendor needs first, user needs second.<p>--------<p>But hey, I know a way Google, Apple, Samsung (!) et al. could fix the shitty performance of their voice assistants and dictation software. They need to fine-tune a LLM on a dataset made of target words&#x2F;sentences, and transcripts of them being misheard in great many ways. Then they need to feed the output of their voice-to-text pipeline through that LLM, so it can correct the text wholesale. That, or maybe, you know, do whatever Microsoft was doing in 2007 that made dictation work well and <i>offline</i>.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36502515" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36502515" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pprotas</span><span>|</span><a href="#36502059">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36503488">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36503132">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36502515">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36502515">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I ask my HomePod if it’s going to rain tonight and it tells me that tomorrow is sunny…</div><br/></div></div><div id="36503132" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36503132" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dustrider</span><span>|</span><a href="#36502059">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36502515">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36503705">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36503132">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36503132">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Add to this that voice assistants fundamentally got worse and worse as their makers tried to monetise, increase usage etc. it took cool tech and made it annoying.<p>I can see llms going much the same way.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36503705" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36503705" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">inciampati</span><span>|</span><a href="#36502059">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36502446">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36503705">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36503705">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;d like to take issue with the characterization of copilot as not needing textual prompting.<p>To get it to work, you need to use comments.

The solution here is clearly for the model to improve, and one doesn&#x27;t even need a leap of faith — just look at what OpenAI is already delivering!<p>Talking to a competent LLM is <i>nothing</i> like talking to bash or dos. I also get frustrated when I sometimes have to ask for the same thing in a slightly different way... but that&#x27;s <i>still</i> almost always faster than searching for the right button or submenu in most creation-oriented software. Whoever is waiting for Word or Google Docs to add a &quot;write this in business-formal email tone&quot; dropdown menu to the UI clearly hasn&#x27;t grokked the true shift we&#x27;re about to go through in computing.<p>Incidentally, I am often using ChatGPT to help me do more advanced &#x2F; rarely used tasks in software from Avid Pro Tools to Adobe Premiere. And I can&#x27;t remember a single time when doing this was slower or more frustrating than reaching out to either Google or the software&#x27;s own &quot;help&quot; section.<p>Of course we&#x27;ll have more input options. It makes tons of sense for things like image or video generation. I bet the models will also soon be outputting more and more &quot;interactive elements&quot; that will aid in refining results. But I have a feeling the opening text box (or, better yet, the open ears of a friendly audio assistant) is here to stay.</div><br/><div id="36503960" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36503960" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TeMPOraL</span><span>|</span><a href="#36502446">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36502539">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36503960">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36503960">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>Is it really that intimidating to have an empty text box on Whatsapp or your favorite SMS app?

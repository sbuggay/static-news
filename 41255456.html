In 4th&#x2F;final&#x2F;senior year there were various elective classes including Advanced Mathematics which I chose as a kind of masochistic challenge. The class was very small, and it turned out taught by a &quot;real mathematician&quot; who commuted from the Mathematics department every day. Even though I&#x27;ve had a great deal of mathematics education I think this was the only time the teacher was someone who did mathematics all-in (as in he created new mathematics, published papers etc.) as opposed to someone who had the job of teaching some field (sic) in mathematics.<p>He taught Galois Theory using its application to coding theory for worked examples. That class was something of a turning point in my life to be honest.
I&#x27;d never think of constructing a heptagon again, for example. Definitely avoided Duels, and Montparnasse. Ok joking aside, it caused the proverbial lightbulb to turn on in my brain, and helped tremendously in my career later when I ran into folks trying to seem smart because they understood ECC or ZKPs.
It was like the extreme opposite of those people who say &quot;I never used a single thing I learned in college&quot;.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41257973" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41257973" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">senderista</span><span>|</span><a href="#41262830">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41256797">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41257973">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41257973">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ian Stewart&#x27;s book is excellent for self-study and has some fascinating historical background.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.taylorfrancis.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;mono&#x2F;10.1201&#x2F;9781003213949&#x2F;galois-theory-ian-stewart" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.taylorfrancis.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;mono&#x2F;10.1201&#x2F;97810032139...</a></div><br/><div id="41259484" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41259484" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">susam</span><span>|</span><a href="#41257973">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41260323">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41259484">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41259484">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Galois Theory by Ian Stewart is an excellent book indeed!

And this is great! Further advances come from doing just this. But for pedagogical purposes, stuff sticks in the human brain so much better if we teach the journey, and not just the destination.

We had two calculus classes - one for engineers&#x2F;science and the other for business&#x2F;economics.<p>If you&#x27;re into Newtonian stuff or it&#x27;s relevant to your degree, then your approach is all great. What I consistently saw is people in degrees like biology (or even industrial engineering) had a harder time learning <i>because</i> of those physics applications in the book. They came in with one problem: Having trouble with the calculus. And then they discovered they had <i>two</i> problems: To understand calculus they suddenly had to understand physics as well.<p>You&#x27;d get students who were totally adept at differentiating and integrating, but would struggle with the problems that involved physics. Yes, it is important to be able to translate real world problems to math ones, but it&#x27;s a bigger problem when you don&#x27;t care about that particular field.<p>Same problem with the business students. Since all the tutors were engineering folks, they had trouble tutoring the business students because their textbook was full of examples that required basic finance knowledge (and it really doesn&#x27;t help that financial quantities are <i>discrete</i> and not <i>continuous</i>, adding to the tutors&#x27; confusion).<p>If you can find an application the student is interested in, then by all means, use that approach.

As a result I don&#x27;t bother too much; I&#x27;ve found it to waste more time than it saves. To be fair, the kinds of questions I would want a tool like this to answer are usually ones I would have to spend some time and effort hunting to answer properly, and I&#x27;m pretty fast and effective at finding information.<p>I haven&#x27;t tried asking too much about questions that I could trivially answer some other way. If what you want to know can be found in any intro undergrad textbook or standard dictionary (or Wikipedia), it&#x27;s plausible that it would be better able to parrot back more or less the correct thing. But again, I haven&#x27;t done much of this, preferring to just get hold of the relevant dictionary or textbook and read it directly.<p>I&#x27;ll give you an example. I just now asked chatgpt.com what Lexell&#x27;s theorem is and it says this:<p>&gt; <i>Lexell&#x27;s theorem is a result in geometry related to spherical triangles. Named after the mathematician Michel Léonard Jean Leclerc, known as Lexell, it states: ¶ In a spherical triangle, if the sum of the angles is greater than π radians (or 180 degrees), then the spherical excess (the amount by which the sum of the angles exceeds π) is equal to the area of the spherical triangle on a unit sphere. ¶ In simpler terms, for a spherical triangle, the difference between the sum of its angles and π radians (180 degrees) gives the area of the triangle when the sphere is of unit radius. This theorem is fundamental in spherical geometry and helps relate angular measurements directly to areas on a sphere.</i><p>This gets the basic topic right (&quot;is a result in geometry related to spherical triangles&quot;, involves area or spherical excess) but everything else about the answer, starting with the mathematician&#x27;s identity, is completely wrong.<p>If I tell it that this is incorrect, it repeats a random assortment of other statements, none of which is actually the theorem I am asking about. E.g.<p>&gt; [...] <i>In a spherical triangle, if you have a spherical triangle with vertices A, B, and C, and the sides of the triangle are a, b, and c (measured in radians), then: ¶ cos⁡(a)cos⁡(b) + sin⁡(a)sin⁡(b)cos⁡(C) = cos⁡(c).</i> [...]<p>or<p>&gt; [...] <i>In a spherical polyhedron, the sum of the angles at each vertex is equal to 2π radians minus the sum of the interior angles of the faces meeting at that vertex.</i> [...]<p>If you want to know what Lexell&#x27;s theorem actually is, you can read the Wikipedia article I wrote last year: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lexell%27s_theorem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lexell%27s_theorem</a><p>&gt; <i>every spherical triangle with the same surface area on a fixed base has its apex on a small circle, called Lexell&#x27;s circle or Lexell&#x27;s locus, passing through each of the two points antipodal to the two base vertices.</i><p>The problem ChatGPT has is that it&#x27;s not able to just say something true but incomplete such as &quot;I&#x27;m not sure what Lexell&#x27;s theorem is or who Lexell was, but I know the theorem has something to do with spherical trigonometry; maybe it could be found in the more comprehensive books about the subject such as Todhunter &amp; Leathem 1901 or Casey 1889&quot;.<p>Instead it just authoritatively spouts one bit of nonsense after another. (Every topic I have ever tried asking it about in detail is more or less the same.) The incorrect statements range from subtly wrong (e.g. two different things with similar names got conflated and some of the properties of the more common one were incorrectly applied to the other) to complete nonsense (jumbles of technical jargon strung together that are more or less gibberish). It&#x27;s clear if you read carefully about any technical topic that it doesn&#x27;t actually understand what it is saying, and is just combining bits of vaguely related material. Answers to technical questions are almost never entirely technically accurate unless you ask a very standard question about a very basic topic.<p>Anyone using it for any purpose should (a) be already pretty media literate with some domain expertise, and (b) be willing to carefully verify every part of every statement.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41262389" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41262389" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dgacmu</span><span>|</span><a href="#41256797">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41261727">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41263308">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41260072">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41262389">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41262389">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So, I&#x27;m a professor, and I have, um, really strong opinions about this. :-) Perhaps too strong and long for the current forum. But I&#x27;ll see if I can be brief.<p>ChatGPT is really, really good at providing solid answers of varying levels of detail and complexity to hyper-common questions such as those used in problem sets. This is one part of the skill set of a tutor, and it&#x27;s a valuable one.<p>When I interview TAs for my classes, however, I actually put a lot more emphasis on a different skill: The ability to get into a student&#x27;s head and understand where their conceptual difficulty or misunderstanding is. This is a very different skill, and it&#x27;s one that ChatGPT isn&#x27;t as good at, because we&#x27;ve gone from &quot;maximum likelihood answers from questions that are in the middle of the distribution&quot; into a wide range of possible sources of confusion, which the student may lack the words to explain in a precise way.<p>In the case of my kid, the PV=nRT question manifested as &quot;I don&#x27;t get it!&quot; (with more exclamation points).<p>Asking ChatGPT (well, copilot, since I have institutional access to that, but it uses ChatGPT) to help understand the problem: It digressed and introduced Boyle&#x27;s Law, threw in a new symbol &quot;I&quot; (ok, the 12 year old) had never seen for &quot;proportional to&quot;, and ... in some sense just added to the cognitive overload.<p>The human approach was to ask a question: Have you ever seen this equation before?

Oh! Well, let&#x27;s talk a little about gases..<p>Now, responding to ChatGPT and asking &quot;No, that didn&#x27;t help. Please ELI5 instead?&quot; actually produced a much better answer: An analogy using a balloon. Which, amusingly, is exactly how I explained the behavior of gases to her.<p>But even here, there&#x27;s a bit of a difference: In explaining it to her, I did so socratically:<p>&quot;Ok, so imagine a balloon. If you heat the air inside the balloon, what happens?&quot;<p>&quot;Um, it gets bigger, right?&quot;<p>&quot;Yup, ...&quot; (and now, knowing that she got that part, we could go on...)<p>That&#x27;s something you can <i>absolutely</i> imagine trying to program around an LLM, but it&#x27;s not a native way of interacting with it.<p>So ... I&#x27;d instead be a little more cautious here and say that ChatGPT potentially provides a really useful piece of what a human tutor offers, but it loses on the interactive exchange that helps much more rapidly zoom in on the source of confusion and correct it. Assuming that it&#x27;s right.<p>I think that for a particularly sophisticated consumer, it can be more valuable, but it requires knowing what you don&#x27;t know, in some sense: The ability to already isolate what you&#x27;re confused by. Once you know the question to ask, ChatGPT can often provide it -- again, assuming that some quirk of its training or your phrasing doesn&#x27;t cause it to generate an answer that&#x27;s wrong in some way.</div><br/><div id="41263323" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41263323" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CamperBob2</span><span>|</span><a href="#41256797">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41262389">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41260072">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41263323">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41263323">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wonder if you are getting very different results with Copilot relative to what I&#x27;ve seen lately from ChatGPT4o.

Fundamentally, you&#x27;re right that there isn&#x27;t really anything &quot;special&quot; about radicals. The reason I personally find the unsolvability of the quintic by radicals interesting is that you <i>can</i> solve quadratics, cubics, and quatrics (that is, polynomial equations of degree 2, 3, and 4) by radicals.<p>To say the same thing another way: the quadratic formula that you learned in high school has been known in some form for millennia, and in particular you can reduce the question of solving quadratics to the question of finding square roots. So (provided you find solving polynomial equations to be an interesting question) it&#x27;s fairly natural to ask whether there&#x27;s an analogous formula for cubics. And it turns out there is! You need both cube roots and square roots, and the formula is longer and uglier, but that&#x27;s probably not surprising.<p>Whether you think n&#x27;th roots are &quot;intrinsically&quot; more interesting than general polynomial equations or not, this is still a pretty striking pattern, and one might naturally be curious about whether it continues for higher degrees. And I don&#x27;t know anyone whose first guess would have been &quot;yes, but only one more time, and then for degree 5 and higher it&#x27;s suddenly impossible&quot;!</div><br/></div></div><div id="41258804" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41258804" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lanstin</span><span>|</span><a href="#41256797">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41257425">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41259263">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41258479">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41258804">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41258804">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They aren&#x27;t really special except that adjoining the solutions to a radical to a field make the associated group of automorphisms simplify in a nice way.

But fundamentally, we can define and use new functions to solve things pretty easily; if you get down to it cos() and sin() are an example of this happening. All those applied maths weird functions (Bessel, Gamma, etc) are also this. As well, the reason not to just use numeric solutions for everything is that there are structural or dynamic properties of the solutions of equations that you won&#x27;t be able to understand from a purely numeric perspective.<p>I think taking a specific un-solvable numeric equation and deriving useful qualitative characteristics is a useful thing to try. You have cool simple results like Lyapunov stability criterion or signs of the eigenvalues around a singularity, and can numerically determine that a system of equations will have such and such long term behavior (or the tests can be inconclusive because the numerical values are just on the threshold between different behaviors.<p>That&#x27;s one of the really fun things about taking Galois theory class - you get general results for &quot;all quintics&quot; or &quot;all quadratics&quot; but also you can take specific polynomials and (sometimes) get concrete results (solvable by radicals, but also complex vs. real roots, etc.).</div><br/></div></div><div id="41258479" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41258479" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">impendia</span><span>|</span><a href="#41256797">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41257425">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41258804">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41258002">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41258479">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41258479">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;d say one of the fundamental lessons of field and Galois theory is that they&#x27;re <i>not</i> intrinsically special.

Interestingly, my math professor asked the exact same question after teaching Galois theory and stated that he does not have a good answer himself. Let me try to give sort of an answer. :)<p>We have fingers. These we can count. This is why we are interested in counting. This is gives us the natural numbers and why we are interested in them. What can we do with natural numbers? Well the basic axioms allow only one thing: Increment them.<p>Now, it is a natural question to ask what happens when we increment repeatedly. This leads to addition of natural numbers. The next question is to ask is whether we can undo addition. This leads to subtraction. Next, we ask whether all natural numbers can be subtracted. The answer is no. Can we extend the natural numbers such that this is possible? Yes, and in come the integers.<p>Now, that we have addition. We can ask whether we can repeat it. This leads to multiplication with a natural number. Next, we ask whether we can undo it and get division and rational numbers. We can also ask whether multiplication makes sense when both operands are non-natural.<p>Now, that we have multiplication, we can ask whether we can repeat it. This gives us the raising to the power of a natural number. Can we undo this? This gives radicals. Can we take the root of any rational number? No, and in come rational field extensions including the complex numbers.<p>A different train of thought asks what we can do with mixing multiplication and addition. An infinite number of these operations seems strange, so let&#x27;s just ask what happens when we have finite number. It turns out, no matter how you combine multiplication and addition, you can always rearrange them to get a polynomial. Formulated differently: Every branch-free and loop-free finite program is a polynomial (when disregarding numeric stability). This view as a program is what motivates the study of polynomials.<p>Now, that we have polynomials, we can ask whether we can undo them. This motivates looking at roots of polynomials.<p>Now, we have radicals and roots of polynomials. Both motivated independently. It is natural to ask whether both trains of thought lead to the same mathematical object. Galois theory answers this and says no.<p>This is a somewhat surprising result, because up to now, no matter in which order we asked the questions: Can we repeat? Can we undo? How to enable undo by extension? We always ended up with the same mathematical object. Here this is not the case. This is why the result of Galois theory is so surprising to some.<p>Slightly off-topic but equally interesting is the question about what happens when we allow loops in our programs with multiplication and addition? i.e. we ask what happens when we mix an infinite number of addition and multiplication. Well, this is somewhat harder to formalize but a natural way to look at it is to say that we have some variable, in the programming sense, that we track in each loop iteration. The values that this variable takes forms a sequence. Now, the question is what will this variable end up being when we iterate very often. This leads to the concept of limit of a sequence.<p>Sidenote: You can look at the usual mathematical limit notation as a program. The limit sign is the while-condition of the loop and the part that describes the sequence is the body of the loop.<p>Now that we have limits and rational numbers, we can ask how to extend the rational numbers such that every rational sequence has a limit. This gives us the real numbers.<p>Now we can ask the question of undoing the limit operation. Here the question is what undoing here actually means. One way to look at it is whether you can find for every limit, i.e., every real number, a multiply-add-loop-program that describes the sequence whose limit was taken. The answer turns out to be no. There is a countable infinite number of programs but uncountably infinite many real numbers. There are way more real numbers than programs. In my opinion this is a way stranger result than that of Galois theory. It turns out, that nearly no real number can be described by a program, or even more generally any textual description. For this reason, in my opinion, real numbers are the strangest construct in all of mathematics.<p>I hope you found my rambling interesting. I just love to talk about this sort of stuff. :)</div><br/><div id="41260649" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41260649" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dataflow</span><span>|</span><a href="#41256797">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41258726">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41259299">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41260649">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41260649">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks so much, I feel like you&#x27;re the only one who grasps the crux of my question!<p>&gt; This is a somewhat surprising result, because up to now, no matter in which order we asked the questions: Can we repeat?

We always ended up with the same mathematical object.<p>I think this is the bit I&#x27;m confused on - we have an operation that is a mixture of two operations, where previously we only looked at pure compositions of operations (let&#x27;s call this &quot;impure&quot;). Why is it surprising that the inversion of an &quot;impure&quot; operation produces an &quot;impure&quot; value?<p>It&#x27;s like saying, if I add x to itself a bunch, I always get a multiple of x. If I do the same thing with y, then I get a multiple of y. But if I add x and y to each other, I might get a prime number! Is that surprising? Mixing is a fundamentally new kind of operation; why would you expect its inversion to be familiar?</div><br/><div id="41261625" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41261625" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fredilo</span><span>|</span><a href="#41256797">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41260649">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41259299">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41261625">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41261625">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What is surprising and what not is always very subjective.<p>Now that I think more about it, one could argue that everything you can do with inverting radicals can also be done by inverting polynomials. So You could look at radicals as the step after multiplication and at inverting polynomials as the step after radicals. With this may depiction that these are two competing extensions falls apart a bit.<p>My chain of argumentation was that one could expect that there is a single natural ever growing set of &quot;numbers&quot; starting with the natural numbers, then integers, then rational numbers, then real numbers, culminating in the real complex numbers and ever set is a superset of the previous one. This is the &quot;natural&quot; order in which they are taught in school and somewhat mirrors how they historically were discovered. In retrospect, this is obviously not true. Just look at the existence of rational complex numbers. However, when all you have are natural, integer and rational numbers, it seems like it could be true.<p>Let me try a different way of explaining why it is surprising to some.<p>In school, I learned that I can solve quadratic equations by combining the inverse operations of the basic operations that make up the quadratic polynom. This seems natural as it worked for solving the linear equations I had seen so far. Inverse of combination is combination of inverse. At some point the teacher showed the formula for degree three. Cubic radicals appeared. We were overwhelmed by it&#x27;s size but the basic operations used matched what we expected. The teacher said that degree 4 is even drastically larger with degree 4 radicals and we definitely do not want to see that, which is true. Nothing was said about degree 5 but it felt like it was implied that the pattern continues and the main problem with degree 5 is that our brains are just not able to handle the amount of operations that make up the formula.<p>Fast forward to university. Now the professor proves in the Galois theory course that, no, it&#x27;s not that you are too stupid to handle degree 5. It&#x27;s just that degree 5 cannot be handled this way at all. I am still unsure about whether my teacher in school knew that degree 5 is impossible or just assumed that he too is just too stupid.<p>I guess this mathematicians must have felt something similar back then. You learn about linear equations. All is easy and works. You learn about quadratics. After mixing in quadratic radicals, all is well again. You try to grasp cubics, and yes, with a lot of work this too can be learned. You think about quartics and after lots and lots of time come to the conclusion that yes it is possible but impossible to master the formula. It feels like the pattern should continue and the reason you don&#x27;t have a quintic formula with degree 5 radicals is not because it does not exist but because of it&#x27;s sheer size and just stating it would fill a whole book. Turns out, there is no such book.<p>Suppose you are a renowned mathematician back then who has failed for years to find a quintic formula. Now this teenager named Évariste comes along and fails too but says that it&#x27;s not because he&#x27;s too stupid but because it&#x27;s impossible. At first, this does sound like an excuse of a lazy student, doesn&#x27;t it?<p>Let&#x27;s say you are not surprised that roots of degree 5 polynoms cannot be computed using just addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and radicals. Does it surprise you that degree 4 polynoms can? Why does this work for degree 2, 3 and 4 yet fails for 5 and higher? I can see that one can argue that there is no reason to assume that it always works. However, at least learning the fact that it starts failing at degree 5 should be non-intuitive.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41259299" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41259299" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">glompers</span><span>|</span><a href="#41256797">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41258726">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41260649">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41261924">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41259299">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41259299">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yep!</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41261924" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41261924" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cionx</span><span>|</span><a href="#41256797">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41257425">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41258726">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41262455">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41261924">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41261924">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think these are two different questions:
- Why care about radicals?
- Why try to solve polynomial equations in terms of radicals?<p>For the first question:<p>Taking Nth powers is a fairly basic operation, which occurs all the time in mathematics.
Taking Nth roots is simply the inverse operation, so it is fairly natural to be interested in it&#x2F;having to deal with it.<p>For the second question:<p>Let’s pretend for a moment that we didn’t know how the quadratic formula looked like.
Could we nevertheless say anything about it?<p>The quadratic formula is supposed to give us the solutions to the equation a x^2 + b x + c = 0.
A special case of this general quadratic equation is x^2 - p = 0.
There are two ways of solving this specialized equation:
either by taking a square root, giving us the two solutions ±√p, or by using the general quadratic formula (with a = 1, b = 0, c = -p).
Both of these approaches need to give us the same results, since they are both correct.<p>This tells us that if we simplify the quadratic formula with a = 1, b = 0, c = -p, then a square root needs to appear.
How can this happen?
Well, the most basic guess is that the quadratic formula contained at least one square root to begin with.<p>Looking at the actual quadratic formula tells us that this guess is correct:
the formula uses the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and a square root.<p>We can repeat the same thought experiment for cubic equations, and we find that the cubic formula should probably contain third roots.
Looking up the formula confirms this suspicion.
However, it should be noted that the cubic equation does not only contain third roots, but also square roots.<p>The situation for the quartic equation is similar:
we suspect that the quartic formula contains fourth roots.
And thanks to our experience with the cubic formula, we may also suspect that the quartic formula contains third roots and square roots.
Looking up the formula, we see that it contains both third roots and square roots, but not (directly) any fourth roots.
(Our original idea breaks down a bit because fourth roots can be expressed as iterated square roots.
This makes it possible that the general quartic formula does not contain fourth roots, even though its simplified version will contain them.)<p>So what about a general polynomial equations of degree N &gt;= 5?
Our original observation tells us that a solution formula needs to contain some sort of operation(s) that, when the formula is applied to certain special cases, gives us Nth roots.
Just as before, the most basic guess is that the formula will contain Kth roots, and the previous examples suggest that one should expect K = 2, ..., N to occur.<p>Summary:
To find a formula for polynomials equations of degree N &gt;= 2, we are <i>forced</i> to use additional operations apart from the four basic arithmetic operations.
In certain special cases, these additional operations <i>need</i> to simplify to roots.
This suggests using roots in the formula, and the cases N = 2, 3, 4 support this idea.<p>Heuristically speaking, we are not trying to use roots because we want to, but because they seem to be the bare minimum required to even hope of finding a formula.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41262455" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41262455" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">raegis</span><span>|</span><a href="#41256797">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41257425">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41260293">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41262455">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41262455">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I&#x27;ve been shouting from the rooftops for years that math[0] courses need more context.<p>A slightly different perspective:  It used to be common for professors to teach a lot of history in graduate algebra courses.

I guess that there’s a tradeoff between making things accessible, and deeply understood, but I don’t know what to make of his opinion.<p>If the objective is to advance mathematics instead of making it accessible, then this is a somewhat reasonable position. The mathematical statements that a person can come up with is often a direct product of their mental image. If everyone has the same image, everyone comes up with similar mathematical statements. For this reason you want to avoid that everyone has the same picture. Forcing everyone to start with a clean canvas increases the chance that there is diversity in the images. Maybe someone finds a new image, that leads to new mathematical statements. At least that&#x27;s the idea. One could also argue that it just leads to blank canvases everywhere.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41257966" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41257966" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wging</span><span>|</span><a href="#41256797">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41257430">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41259329">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41257744">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41257966">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41257966">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Do you know how Dieudonné answered?</div><br/><div id="41260655" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41260655" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Koshkin</span><span>|</span><a href="#41256797">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41257966">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41257744">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41260655">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41260655">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>On foundations we believe in the reality of mathematics, but of course, when philosophers attack us with their paradoxes, we rush to hide behind formalism and say &#x27;mathematics is just a combination of meaningless symbols,&#x27;...

They ask: What can I not build with numbers? Studying these two questions is deeply related but also a constant source of frustration for engineers taking math courses designed for mathematicians by mathematicians.<p>Galois theory, is a theory of &quot;no&quot;. It ultimately serves to answer several &quot;Can I build this?&quot; questions with no. This makes it very interesting to pure mathematicians.

For those not aware, there is a general formula solving the quadratic equation (i.e. solving ax^2 + bx + c = 0). That formula has been known for millenia. With effort, mathematicians found a formula for the cubic (i.e. solving ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0), and even the quartic (order 4 polynomials). But no one was able to come up with a closed-form solution to the quintic. Galois and Abel eventually proved that a quntic formula DOES NOT EXIST. At least, it cannot be expressed in terms of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents and roots. You can even identify specific equations that have roots that cannot be expressed in those forms, for example x^5 - x + 1.<p>I took an entire course on it that went through the proof. It&#x27;s actually very interesting. It sets up this deep correspondence between groups and fields, to the point that any theory about groups can be translated into a theory about fields and vice versa. And it provides this extremely powerful set of tools for analyzing symmetries. The actual proof is actually really anticlimactic. You have all these deep proofs about the structures of roots of polynomial equations, and at the very end you just see that the structures of symmetries of certain polynomials of degree 5 (like x^5 - x + 1) don&#x27;t follow the same symmetries that the elementary mathematical operations have. Literally, the field of solutions to that polynomial doesn&#x27;t map to a solvable group: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Solvable_group" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Solvable_group</a><p>In almost the same breadth, it also proves that it is impossible to trisect an angle using just a compass and straightedge, a problem that had been puzzling mathematicians for millennia. It&#x27;s actually almost disappointing: we spent then entire course just defining groups and fields and field extensions and all this other &quot;abstract nonsense&quot;. And once all of those definitions are out of the way, the proof of the insolvability of the quintic takes 10 minutes, same for the proof of impossibility of trisecting an angle.</div><br/><div id="41260723" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41260723" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ForOldHack</span><span>|</span><a href="#41256560">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41257160">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41257391">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41260723">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41260723">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;the proof of impossibility of trisecting an angle.&quot;<p>It makes it into a silly little footnote, a very little footnote, I was both sad and disappointed when I read and understood it in an appendix.<p>Now back to Pi + e = Pie.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41257391" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41257391" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">koolala</span><span>|</span><a href="#41256560">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41257160">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41260723">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41258247">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41257391">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41257391">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Did the solution taking 10 minutes make it seem like it was all just semantics from old faulty definitions?<p>How do you personally imagine trisecting an angle now?

The proof took maybe 10 minutes, but it probably took another 10-15 minutes for the professor to convince us there wasn&#x27;t a logical error in the given proof. Though the situation was kind of the opposite of what you would thing. We understood field extensions and the symmetries of the roots of polynomials really well. What took convincing was that any formula using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, and rational roots would always give you a field extension that mapped to a &quot;solvable group&quot;. The proof is essentially:<p>1. Any field extension of a number constructed using those mathematical operations must map to a solvable group.
2. For every group there exists a corresponding field extension (this is a consequence of the fundamental theorem of Galois theory).
3. There exist groups that are not solvable.
4. Therefore, there are polynomials with roots that can&#x27;t be constructed from the elementary mathematical operations.<p>Basically the entire course is dedicated to laying out part 3, and the part we were suspicious about was part 1.<p>The one thing that is interesting about the proof is that it is actually partially constructive. Because there is no general quintic formula, but there are some quintics that are solvable. For instance, x^5 - 1 clearly has root x=1. And Galois theory allows you to tell the difference between those that are solvable and those that are not. It allows you to take any polynomial and calculate the group of symmetries of those roots. If that group is solvable, then all of the roots can be defined in terms of elementary operations. If not, at least one of the roots cannot.<p>&gt; How do you personally imagine trisecting an angle now? Is it possible to describe your new intuition of the impossibility in different human understandable terms that are also geometric?<p>So the trisection proof I don&#x27;t remember as well, but looking it up it isn&#x27;t very geometric. It essentially proves that trisecting an angle with a compass and straight edge is equivalent to solving certain polynomial equations with certain operations, and goes into algebra.<p>That said, Galois theory itself feels very &quot;geometric&quot; in the roughest sense of the term.

Spinoza says C is determined by G; Aquinas says there are many possible C&#x27;s for any given G. (Leibniz splits the difference and says there are many possible C&#x27;s, but in our particular case, our G has created the best[2] possible C.)<p>The reconciliation: let G and C be in an adjoint relationship, such that we have functions picking out the maximum C any given G may create, and the minimum G that can create any given C.<p>Now, if you are Aquinas, G is omnipotent, and hence has the possibility to create other C&#x27;s, but our C is the maximum[3] one.<p>On the other hand, if you are Spinoza, G determines C[4], so it is trivially maximal. (The maximum of a singleton being the unique element)<p>Does that make sense?<p>Question: do there exist Gods that are incapable of creating any creation, or Creations that are impossible for any god to create? If so, need we replace &quot;maximum&quot; and &quot;minimum&quot; above by LUB and GLB? What other situations (eg. gods or creations being only domains rather than lattices) would also require further abstraction?<p>:: :: ::<p>[0] my apologies for any non-standard notation. I tried to find a survey paper on &quot;Algebraic Theology&quot; so I could follow the existing notation, but failed to find any concrete instances in this (currently only platonic?) field.<p>[1] Spinoza is accused of &quot;pantheism&quot;: the heresy of identifying God and the Creation. Reading him according to a Galois-theoretic model, he would be innocent of this heresy, for when he says &quot;God, or, the Universe&quot;, he is simply using metonymy, for in his model God and Creation are dual, so (being in a 1:1 relationship) one determines the other. Note that in general, not only are duals not identical, they&#x27;re not even isomorphic.<p>[2] but cf Voltaire, <i>Candide</i> (1759)<p>[3] if you are Leibniz, the order in which it is maximal corresponds to the traditional &quot;worst&quot; &quot;better&quot; &quot;best&quot; order. I don&#x27;t know Leibniz well enough to say if he had a total, or only partial, order in mind; presumably in his model if there are several maximal &quot;best&quot; creations they would all be isomorphic?<p>Exercise for the reader: work out the Leibnizian metaphysical adjunction.<p>[4] turning this arrow around, C determines G, which explains why Einstein would say he believed in the &quot;God of Spinoza&quot;, and chose to base his research by thinking about C, unlike the medieval colleagues of Aquinas, who spent a lot of time and effort trying to work the arrow in the other direction, hoping to come to conclusions about C in starting by thinking about G.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

He talked about young physics students eager to learn about the fundamental nature of the universe and wondered that senior physicists weren&#x27;t eager to engage with these issues. I was interested to hear from someone dedicating themself to this field but the resulting conversation was so boring.<p>Copenhagen was messy because it introduced measurement as a separate process which is inelegant. The Everett interpretation preserves linear evolution but is messy because Schrodinger&#x27;s cat experiment ends up with two cats (which seems like a mischaracterisation of MWI but whatever). Bohmian mechanics is good because it doesn&#x27;t have the measurement problem and that Everettian weirdness. The conceit of having both particle and wave was brushed over because he didn&#x27;t feel like it was too strange.<p>I listened with increasing apathy to a discussion on vibes about untestable and mathematically equivalent theories and when I got home I read Scott Aaronson&#x27;s post &#x27;The Zen Anti-Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics&#x27; and knew it for the first time.</div><br/><div id="36568226" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36568226" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">meroes</span><span>|</span><a href="#36565252">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36567612">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36569572">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36568226">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36568226">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No way. BM is like the last vestige of physics as the study of nature in the way ancient Greeks&#x2F;Aristotle (grandad of much of science, father of biology and all) understood it. To go a-interpretational about physics is a two-millennia long paradigm shift. To me that’s why BM is so interesting. Non-local Hidden variables keep that tradition alive in a recognizable way.<p>The Greeks set us up for 2500 years of scientific progress in this vein. If probability becomes subjective (MWI) or we detach science from nature by going interpretation-less we have no concise foundation to propel science for years and years.<p>I’m  not saying this is a reason to believe BM, but it’s by far the most conservative and in line with how we made progress before.<p>QM really really did a number on most physicists. Like Nima-Arkani Hamed says, radical conservatism is the best approach in physics. Anything but BM is just radical when we have the history of science we do.<p>I don’t think BM is necessarily right like I said, but its role is fascinating in this respect.<p>Past ways can be over encumbering, as a mitigating factor to BM. But I think physics has yet to require complete paradigm shift that I see in other&#x2F;non interpretations.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36569572" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36569572" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">perlgeek</span><span>|</span><a href="#36565252">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36567612">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36563351">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36569572">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36569572">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I heard this interview as well, and found it quite fascinating, especially that there&#x27;s now an idea for an experimental test of pilot waves vs. other interpretations.<p>I didn&#x27;t consider pilot wave theory a serious contender, he kinda changed my mind.

(Less so today in that we live in an age of context collapse.) And yes, high modernism is, thank goodness, on its last legs. But there are actual reasons that there are divisions between art and science in terms of purpose and method. I&#x27;m open to the notion that we could use more art in science, but handwaving the distinction away like this strikes me as cheap mysticism, not a real argument.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m especially sensitive to this because I recently went with a friend to see Michio Kaku talk about his book &quot;Quantum Supremacy&quot;. Many in the audience were apparently impressed, and I&#x27;m told Kaku at one point really knew his stuff. But the talk I saw was a shambling mess, where basic errors of fact about quantum computing were used to justify technoutopian mysticism that was just a modern, high-tech gloss on quantum woo.

Schumacher&#x27;s critique on &quot;materialistic scientism&quot; and its limitations in the face of the unknown:<p>&gt; Since the findings of science, on account of its methodical restriction and its systematic disregard of higher levels, never contain any evidence of the existence of such levels, the process is self-reinforcing: faith, instead of being taken as a guide leading the intellect to an understanding of the higher levels, is seen as opposing and rejecting the intellect and is therefore itself rejected.<p>I appreciate that Bohm opened a door for me into a subject which I was not intrinsically interested in, and I&#x27;m looking forward to what comes out of this conversation in the years ahead.</div><br/><div id="36564643" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36564643" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">abhishekjha</span><span>|</span><a href="#36563291">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36563298">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36564643">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36564643">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; any attempt to examine your thought changes it--just as the measurement of an electron alters its course.<p>Wait a minute.

This is how I understand Penrose when he addresses this via Gödel&#x27;s <i>incompleteness theorems</i>.<p>In this regard I personally like Feynman&#x27;s pragmatism the most here by acting as a mediator between theoretical-minded and experimental-minded physiscts: 
<i>Are you looking for the ultimate laws of physics?&quot; No, I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m just looking to find out more about the world and if it turns out there is a simple ultimate law which explains everything, so be it; that would be very nice to discover. If it turns out it&#x27;s like an onion with millions of layers and we&#x27;re just sick and tired of looking at the layers, then that&#x27;s the way it is. ... My interest in science is to simply find out more about the world.</i><p>So echoing Bohr&#x27;s reply to Einstein: &quot;Stop telling God what to do&quot; One could reply to Bohm as well: If it is a process let it be a process, it doesn&#x27;t have to be fixed as finite or infinite or whatever.<p>To be fair with Bohm he openly questioned many concepts taken for granted and for the moment tried to deconstruct them in a sincere manner (see: fish tank analogy). In a sense he tried to subject his worldview itself to this flow of procedural thinking.

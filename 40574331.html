The quality bar is somewhat higher than if you are in the academic-industrial complex (like it or not, people can recognize authors by writing style even on blind review), but you are able to do and get through peer review as an independent researcher.<p>Be prepared to be underwhelmed if you are doing it for the publication, though.  Most published papers don&#x27;t lead to anything.  Do the research for fun, and publish to share your results.  Actually, if you are a small &quot;research for fun&quot; shop, you can target tier 2 journals and conferences, and you will run into an enthusiastic community of people in your subfield.<p>Of course, this depends on <i>knowing how</i> to do new research, write research papers, and talk to peer reviewers.

It&#x27;s not even <i>that</i> uncommon, look for people who have a university affiliation (that isn&#x27;t just teaching) as a side gig. And that&#x27;s just one way you could be pursing serious research outside your main job, you don&#x27;t even need a university affiliation - it&#x27;s certainly helpful with access to resources, feedback, ideas (and, let&#x27;s be honest, it probably helps with visibility&#x2F;credibility too), but it&#x27;s not strictly necessary. As a different example, there are some (rare) examples where legitimate mathematical results were discovered by hobbyists going completely on their own. I also remember a documentary about a crew of retirees, including former physics professors and a precision mechanics engineer, who were performing physics experiments of masses at extremely low accelerations to test some limits of special relativity iirc - which in itself was technically the result of &#x27;leisure research&#x27;, like several of Einstein&#x27;s most famous discoveries.<p>If it&#x27;s something you&#x27;re interested in, my suggestion would be to decide on a rough area and then seek out experts to brainstorm ideas for a suitable problem for you to work on, maybe one that leverages your existing skills in a creative way (like the engineer in the above example).</div><br/><div id="40592642" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40592642" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">agonz253</span><span>|</span><a href="#40590782">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40591233">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40591576">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40592642">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40592642">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Since you mentioned Einstein, it reminded me of a comment by Max Born on the subject, from the Born-Einstein letters:<p>“Einstein expressed over and over again the thought that one should not couple the quest for knowledge with a bread-and-butter profession, but 
that research should be done as a private spare-time occupation. He himself wrote the first of his great treatises while earning his living as an employee of the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. He believed that only in 
this way could one preserve one&#x27;s independence. What he did not consider, however, was the organizational rigidity 
of almost all professions, and the importance which individual members of a profession attach to their work. No professional pride could develop 
without it. To be able successfully to practice science as a hobby, one has 
to be an Einstein.”</div><br/></div></div><div id="40591576" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40591576" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gehwartzen</span><span>|</span><a href="#40590782">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40591233">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40592642">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594457">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40591576">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40591576">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; look for people who have a university affiliation (that isn&#x27;t just teaching) as a side gig.<p>Can you expand on this?

I&#x27;ll be a little vague on the topic to keep some anonymity.<p>Without a plan, per se, I nurtured a burgeoning personal research interest that was well outside my field. The initial hobby was very rudimentary but it gave me enough feedback and fuel that over a number of years I built more advanced software and hardware to investigate it more scientifically. Eventually, having reached the limits of the data I had access to, I reached out to a local university to start a collaboration.<p>If you already have an idea, I think, as long as you&#x27;re sufficiently interested in actually doing research, you&#x27;ll be able to find some professor that is as well. On the flip side, I know for a fact that most professors have more research ideas than students, so they can certainly provide you with things to investigate.<p>As a bonus, for the professor, since this is a side gig for you, there isn&#x27;t an cost for them (or much less of one). Access to facilities and resources depend on the university.

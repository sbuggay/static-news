Sorry but I don&#x27;t buy this bs. He&#x27;s doing it to generate income, that&#x27;s all. Altruism is &quot;unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others&quot; but we have quite the opposite here - a selfish way of milking poor people for emotions in order to generate income. Real altruism is hard and done only by a few. Literally EVERY man&#x2F;woman&#x2F;child on this planet will say yes to receiving millions of dollars annually with the sole condition that they have to let go some part of it. The money he spends are just fuel for a marketing engine.<p>While I see he seems like a nice guy overall, his actions do more good than harm. His impact is very low, his &quot;philanthropy&quot; is localised down to the individual level and his impact is absolutely none on the actual problems that people who he targets face. The more negative side of this is that he inspires the next generations to only go by extreme things on Youtube and other social media platforms and these extreme things are, more often than not, on the negative side (stupid and dangerous pranks, throwing stuff at people from 20th floor etc).<p>He chose this path because his viewers were probably reacting to it the most. I&#x27;m not a hater but I feel like the real altruistic people doing good stuff on a much grander scheme don&#x27;t get any recognition at all while this money making business man selling snake oil to children is getting everything from the table.<p>Despite throwing millions and millions, his impact is absolutely ZERO. I find it quite predatory.</div><br/><div id="36305430" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36305430" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Dig1t</span><span>|</span><a href="#36304759">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36305210">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36305430">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36305430">[58 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Man this is such a cynical take.<p>I listened to his interview on the Joe Rogan show and was really impressed.<p>Mr. Beast built his channel by taking all profits from each video and plying it into the next video. Using this approach he was able to produce progressively larger and more expensive videos. He has demonstrated his frugal lifestyle, has publicly given away an incredible amount of money to good causes, and has stated his future goals for his businesses will be for charity. Everything about his actions strikes me as genuinely good, it just seems like the publicity is the best way to get more money to accomplish the charitable goals.<p>You&#x27;re right that what he&#x27;s doing does not conform to the definition of altruism specifically, but that doesn&#x27;t mean what he&#x27;s doing is not good.<p>How can you watch the video where he pays for the blindness surgery for all those people and say that that was anything other than an amazing win for all those nice people?</div><br/><div id="36305528" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36305528" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">guyzero</span><span>|</span><a href="#36304759">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36305430">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36307077">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36305528">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36305528">[41 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Mr. Beast built his channel by taking all profits from each video and plying it into the next video&quot;<p>To me this seems like a semi-obvious minmaxing solution to making popular videos: make essentially zero profit, regardless of revenue. At some point you get so much revenue that you can&#x27;t spend it all so the next logical step is to simply give it away as part of the video. And in this case it&#x27;s a virtuous cycle - apparently giving away money generates more revenue so it just keeps going. But this doesn&#x27;t strike me as being done out of any noble purpose - all he wants is YT view and charity is just a side-effect of that.<p>&quot;How can you watch the video where he pays for the blindness surgery for all those people and say that that was anything other than an amazing win for all those nice people?&quot;<p>My criticism would be that it&#x27;s local change vs trying for structural change. Why don&#x27;t those people already have access to surgery? The counter-argument to this would be that structural change is somewhere between very hard and impossible, so just spend the money locally. A more cynical take is that lobbying for restructuring the US health care system doesn&#x27;t generate YT revenue, so he&#x27;s incentivized to fund the most clickbaity charity projects.</div><br/><div id="36306623" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36306623" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vasco</span><span>|</span><a href="#36304759">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36305528">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36307233">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36306623">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36306623">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; But this doesn&#x27;t strike me as being done out of any noble purpose<p>Money given away doesn&#x27;t have to have a &quot;noble purpose&quot;, the act is good in itself.

Things can be good and bad at the same time.<p>Consider the American trope of &quot;feel good&quot; news reports about, say, an elementary school kid doing a successful fundraiser to pay off his classmate&#x27;s school lunch debt. Yes, it&#x27;s amazing that an elementary school student did that but it&#x27;s also horrifying that this means school lunch debt is just a thing society has come to accept as normal and that society is so dysfunctional a literal child had to take the initiative instead of just getting to be a child.<p>I think Mr Beast is one of the better people when it comes to using their ridiculous wealth and social capital for good, but it&#x27;s horrifying that people have to perform misery for an online audience to get relatively cheap medical treatments and frankly it&#x27;s horrifying that a single person can have access to and control over such an amount of wealth that they can perform this kind of stunts on the regular while at the same time so many people are so desperately poor that their lives can be changed by being gifted mere crumbs in comparison. Mr Beast may be a relatively good person but that he (i.e. his channel&#x2F;brand) can exist at all should be deeply concerning.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36306114" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36306114" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TX81Z</span><span>|</span><a href="#36304759">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36305430">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36306920">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36305210">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36306114">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36306114">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Flywheel.

That&#x27;s advertising money that is spent on worthy causes. Yes, it&#x27;s self serving. But that money also serves the people he helps. It&#x27;s an interesting dynamic. Ceasing to do what he does would actually be bad for the people that are on the receiving end of this. So, why should he?<p>He&#x27;s found a way to funnel of some of the stupid money slushing around on the social media platforms. There are billions of it. And he&#x27;s managing to do something more interesting with it than just squirreling it away. Compare that with the average influencer, viral marketing expert, troll farm or other sources of clickbait that are thriving on these platforms. At least this goes somewhere vaguely useful. Good for him and whoever is on the receiving end. And if he pockets some of that, how much worse is that than all the other nonsense on those platforms where most of the publishers just pocket 100% the revenue? I&#x27;m not judging that either.<p>If you are going to watch stuff on Tik Tok, Youtube, or whatever, you might as well watch his. Best case some random people benefit from this, worst case you watch some silly nonsense and are mildly entertained by that. Either way you feel good and nobody is getting hurt. I don&#x27;t watch this stuff myself but that&#x27;s just because I have other things to watch that I find more interesting.</div><br/><div id="36306659" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36306659" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">NoPicklez</span><span>|</span><a href="#36304759">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36306654">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36305041">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36306659">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36306659">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Couldn&#x27;t agree more</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36305041" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36305041" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Timber-6539</span><span>|</span><a href="#36304759">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36306654">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36305140">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36305041">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36305041">[17 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Despite what you&#x27;ve been taught, every act of charity comes from a selfish need (ego).

There are some public numbers about $10m revenue on feastables in the first few months and over $100m of revenue on beast burger orders sometime last year.<p>He spends a lot, talks about it a lot, $2-4 million per video on each main channel video. He has also talked a lot about re-investing everything back into the channel to grow and grow. Which seems evident by the growth rate if nothing else.<p>That&#x27;s just snippets of info and I&#x27;m not remotely experienced enough in any of these spaces to make any attempt at a real number but between the increased views, feastables and beast burger I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s any less than 100s of millions of revenue at this point. My main point, though, is that he has grown a lot from 2021-2023 where that $54m number came from :)<p>But having said that.. he was still very popular and long on the front page of YouTube back in 2021 perhaps with those much more modest numbers.<p>Something like this is worth a watch. While I&#x27;m sure there is plenty he doesn&#x27;t talk about, he talks about a lot publicly including money spent, strategies, statistics, etc:

The former is transparently good because it can only be done for a good purpose.  The latter may be done for a good purpose.  You might want everyone to know you donated so that you can set an example for others: &quot;I am a popular actor and if I do this it will bring attention to this cause&quot;.

On one hand, I think it&#x27;s great that people in need were able to receive assistance. On the other hand, why is it that it took some rich YouTuber to pay for their surgeries in the first place? As I understand it a lot of these eye surgeries have been fairly standard for decades, so why isn&#x27;t there already a government program that pays for this? No paperwork or other bullshit, you just go to an eye doctor and they give you the surgery. It seems like such obvious low-hanging fruit, and it would be a massive political win. Maybe manufacture one fewer jet to pay for thousands of surgeries?<p>Maybe Medicare For All and these big medical reform programs are too ambitious and unlikely to go through. But maybe we could at least help raise the floor for what medical conditions Americans are treating by default.<p>If you&#x27;re reading this, consider calling up your representative and telling them: &quot;Hey, I think it&#x27;s kinda crazy that we have a safe and proven surgery that lets people see, and I think it should be available for anyone that needs it, figure out how to make it work.&quot;<p>How many people even need these eye surgeries? I bet that raising enough money to pay for this surgery for every single American wouldn&#x27;t even cost that much (in relative terms). So going the charity path would probably also be viable. However if it&#x27;s something that enough people agree is worth doing, why not just use your tax dollars to pay for it?

It might be a net good still, Iâm not sure. Itâs not obvious however.<p>One downside is that it competes for the same âfeel-goodâ feeling which much more effective charities compete for. Someone engages with Mr.Beast, feels like they did good. Later they walk by a food shelter in need of volunteers and thinks âI already did my part.â As we have parasocial relationships, we have paraphilanthropy. I suspect it ultimately makes people less compassionate and caring. This is hinted at here:<p>&gt; For Miller, what makes Donaldson remarkable is that he essentially asks his audience to see themselves as a commodity, and to therefore see their views and likes and shares as a force for good: âMrBeast is actually telling people that theyâre entering a marketplace, by saying, âIf you watch this, this is worth so much money, I can raise this much money and I can spend it on good causes.ââ As Donaldson says in one video for his philanthropic sub-channel: âBeast Philanthropy is literally funded by your eyeballs. Not even joking.â<p>Truth is, watching hours of YouTube <i>isn&#x27;t</i> doing good. At best itâs entertainment, at worst itâs hours of human potential wasted.<p>The other downside is that it normalizes the extrinsic reward to doing good. Kindness done for the âthank youâ breeds resentment. The vulnerable can be thankful, but they can also be angry, frustrated, confused, hurt, mentally ill, etc. Sustainable kindness is done for oneself.</div><br/><div id="36304219" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36304219" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">freddie_mercury</span><span>|</span><a href="#36304110">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36304133">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36304219">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36304219">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; One downside is that it competes for the same âfeel-goodâ feeling which much more effective charities compete for.

For one, a lot of the wealth that&#x27;s generated in a country is due to the collective historical effort of the people which is summed up in the state (for americans, the &quot;government&quot;).<p>So taxation is simply the United States of America, or Norway, or Sweden, taking back some of the resources of the &quot;now&quot; that have been generated thanks to the collective effort of the &quot;past&quot;.<p>Also, there is actual research on the effectiveness of government programs (such as food stamps for example) in increasing quality of life of children who grow up on these; compared to those who grow up without those. In reality, children don&#x27;t choose where they are born, and as much as it is the parent&#x27;s job to raise them it is not the child&#x27;s fault to not have gotten responsible parents.<p>So, in reality, tax payers shouldn&#x27;t be doing charity. Why would they? If charity is needed then the government is obviously not collecting enough or allocating resources efficiently. I would very much say that charity is a systemic failure, and philanthropy is usually spear headed by the very same people who argue <i>against</i> universalist measures such as higher taxation. Why would a billionaire know where resources are needed better than the government, who has much more data on people to properly know where money should go.<p>So, in my opinion, it&#x27;s really easy to argue against philanthropy and in favour of government programs.

It is often implied that hard work will reap benefits, but the benefits are hit or miss and the rewards are sometimes promised salvation or riches in an afterlife. While I wonât comment on the latter, I think the ethic of hard work is often oversold, and benefits those in power rather than those who issue the effort.<p>And before someone cries wolf here, this isnât advocating for laziness or hedonism. I think humans need work. We need to put effort into something whether thatâs tilling a field, painting a canvas, or writing a program for a computer. I think everybody needs to experience real challenges to their understanding of life and how other people live. But I donât think thereâs an obvious measuring stick for what that looks like.<p>As for devaluing money, people need to know how to manage a household, but I think fewer worshippers at the alter of money is a net win.</div><br/><div id="36304746" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36304746" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sparrish</span><span>|</span><a href="#36303935">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36304328">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36304505">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36304746">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36304746">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was told growing up the measure of good work is that you produce more than you consume.

Instead of spamming like a lot of YouTubers do, he invests a lot into each video.</div><br/><div id="36305205" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36305205" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">KeplerBoy</span><span>|</span><a href="#36304097">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36304876">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36305205">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36305205">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">imo cgp grey was a lot better 5-10 years ago, before it got too clickbaity.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36304876" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36304876" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wahahah</span><span>|</span><a href="#36304097">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36307000">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36304876">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36304876">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Altruism really has been getting its name dragged through the mud recently huh</div><br/></div></div><div id="36307000" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36307000" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dimgl</span><span>|</span><a href="#36304876">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36306841">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36307000">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36307000">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This YouTube video from MeatCanyon IMO nails why Mr. Beast is so damn uncomfortable to so many people, including myself: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=n-tQXZCEi54">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=n-tQXZCEi54</a><p>It&#x27;s also pretty hilarious to boot.<p>Edit: he made a follow-up LOL <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3VRKJthNmWw">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3VRKJthNmWw</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36306841" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36306841" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LelouBil</span><span>|</span><a href="#36307000">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36305252">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36306841">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36306841">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In semi-related news, a french twitch streamer, &quot;Zerator&quot;, just learned that he will become &quot;Knight of the National Order of Merit&quot; which is an honorific title that

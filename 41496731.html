The gist: write outlines and recursively write outlines for those outlines until the items are small. I think that method complements the authors post.<p>One thing I&#x27;m doing since a few months is creating a fresh directory for every side project I start. Even if it&#x27;s just &quot;I wonder if I can (easily) extract all course information from this really slow school website that only offers a search bar&quot; (it appeared to be easy). For a bit of structure, each directory starts with YYYYMM and a dash, and a few keywords that remind me what next side project I just started.<p>Inside the directory, there should be at least one text file containing steps I took, ideas I had, or URLs I visited, to provide my future self a nice amount of context whenever I&#x27;m revisiting that side project. For the course information side project, simply documenting the steps I took in the browser while visiting the school&#x27;s website and just pasting the &#x27;Copy as cURL&#x27; command for a certain request inside that file is sufficient! (I&#x27;m aware there&#x27;s a lot of knowledge hidden in that previous sentence; it&#x27;s more an example of writing down <i>what steps you took</i> while tackling the problem)<p>The directory listing, over time, should also give a nice insight of all the things I&#x27;ve discovered, tried, or perhaps even finished.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41517503" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41517503" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tisdadd</span><span>|</span><a href="#41505645">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41518631">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41517503">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41517503">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have found that one of the more useful things for me in most projects is having a readme per folder that has some basic info about each file in the folder, then can add more information as needed. That way when I leave for a while I know what I was thinking in one sentence when I made a file, and additionally might be able to split it to a package if it appears to be forming into a useful stand alone chunk. For larger projects I do a markdown checklist and break up smaller as needed. One of gets overwhelming to see what is done or not, I pull out those not complete yet into another file and wrote a current task from it and why it what it helps get done after. Sometimes my notes asking the way may include consider writing on this, which I totally agree does give a different approach sometimes.

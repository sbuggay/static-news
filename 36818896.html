You have to both look at the time-line of the paper writing and the time-line of the conversations. By my reading, by the time the paper was being written, most of them had indeed come to the conclusion that (1) there was no evidence for an engineered virus, (2) that the data was consistent with both a leak from a lab (without engineering) or from exposure to animals, but that (3) the former was not as a priori likely, given what they knew about the kinds of research being done.<p>You just can&#x27;t take something someone says in Jan. 2020 at the start of their looking at the problem, and what they said in their paper written in Feb. 2020 on the same level.

Is there any reason to believe that they might be onto something, or is it all smoke and mirrors? Eddie Holmes - any insights on the China side? The main things from my perspective:<p>1. Bioweapon and engineered totally off the table<p>2. If there is no engineering and no culturing, then it means that somebody magically found a pre-formed pandemic virus, put it in the lab, and then infected themselves. The prior on that vs somebody coming into contact with an animal source infected with the virus is as close to zero as you can get. Humans come into contact all the time with SARS-like CoVs, but the likelihood of somebody finding exactly that pandemic virus and infecting themselves is very very low (make no mistake - if they did find that pandemic virus. then they would get infected if they grew it in the lab - but the likelihood of them finding it in the first place is exceedingly small (or so one would hope - otherwise, good luck World avoiding future pandemic).<p>3. But here&#x27;s the issue - I&#x27;m still not fully convinced that no culture was involved. If culture was involved, then the prior completely changes - because this could have happened with any random SARS-llke CoV of which there are very many. So are we absolutely certain that no culture could have been involved? What concerns me here are some of the comments by Shi in the SciAm article (&quot;I had to check the lab&quot; etc) and the fact that the furin site 1s being messed with in vitro. Yes, it loses it but that could be context dependent. Finally, the paper that was shared with us showing a very similar phenomenon (exactly 12bp insertion) in other CoVs has me concerned...<p>I really really want to go out there guns swinging saying &quot;don&#x27;t be such an idiot believing these dumb theories - the president is deflecting from the real problems&quot; but I&#x27;m warned that we can&#x27;t fully disprove culture {our argument was mostly based on the presence of the O-linked glycans - but they could likely play a different role... We also can&#x27;t fully rule out engineering (for basic research) - yes, no obvious signs of engineering anywhere, but that furin site could still have been inserted via gibson assembly (and clearly creating the reverse genetic system isn&#x27;t hard - the Germans managed to do exactly that for SARS-CoV-2 in less than a month).&quot;<p>And:<p>&quot;Shi didn&#x27;t do any GOF work that I&#x27;m aware of - but GOF work isn&#x27;t the concern here. She did A LOT of work that involved isolating and culturing SARS-like viruses from bats (in BSL-2) and that&#x27;s my main concerning scenario (we cite several of those in the paper - if you have a look at those original publications, it&#x27;s definitely concerning work, no question about it - and is the main reason I have been so concerned about the &#x27;culture&#x27; scenario).&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think much more needs to be said.

There&#x27;s an incubation period, in which you are not shedding. Then you move around. Epidemiological data only shows where the first human-to-human transmission happened, not where the animal-human jump happened.

The answer is, the vast majority of the biggest cities in China have labs involved in such research.

With SARS-CoV-2, the symptoms are so mild, it&#x27;s unlikely most people would think it was anything but a cold. Whether someone that worked at a virology institute would think that is a matter of some debate, but people have died from laboratory exposures before because they thought they had a benign illness, so it certainly has happened.<p>The problem is, people aren&#x27;t having a genuine discussion. The communication goes something like this: someone says something about lab leak, and gets shut down by saying &quot;the science says animal origin was more likely&quot;. The scientists are saying &quot;the data says this was likely an animal to human transmission&quot;. But if you dig in on either of those points, things get shakier and shakier. The data that the virus evolved in animals, strong. The data that the virus evolved in any one specific species - less strong. The data that the virus evolved in an animal species that was in the wet market, even weaker. The data that the virus evolved in an animal species at the wet market, and then jumped from animals to humans at the wet market? Basically non-existent - circumstantial <i>at best</i>.<p>The only piece of data in that tree that would directly contradict the lab leak hypothesis is that last little bit of data. But it all gets wrapped up and packaged into the wordplay of &quot;the data says the virus jumped to humans from animals&quot;, probably unintentionally by some, intentionally by others. The wet market hypothesis began because SARS had been found to transfer at a wet market in the past. But, that data has never been super convincing to begin with (this type of data never is, it was a full year after SARS-CoV 1 that antibodies were detected in civets), and there was no direct evidence of the wet market with SARS-CoV-2, so the hypothesis started out as pattern matching with an n=1 (SARS-CoV the original). Whereas, pattern matching with n=4 (or more) for lab leak works just as well.<p>Also frustrating is that not being able prove one hypothesis doesn&#x27;t de facto validate the other. The hypotheses aren&#x27;t even totally orthogonal! Only in very specific cases are they orthogonal, and those cases contain the weakest evidence of all the evidence in all categories.<p>The featured article is talking more about the conversation, and the nuances of the conversation, than it is the absolute truth of the matter. There will never be an answer, other than that &quot;both are possible&quot;.<p>Re: the &quot;spirit&quot; of your point, if you will, which I interpret at something like &quot;there are many more species than just humans, therefore most viruses evolve in other species and jump to humans&quot;, I certainly agree, but then we went and tipped the scales pretty badly by rounding up these viruses and putting them in close proximity to humans. And while we&#x27;ve been recording data, there have been far more lab leaks than there have been zoonotic events. So that argues that in the 20th and 21st centuries, we have, artificially, changed that calculation.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36823522" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36823522" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DiogenesKynikos</span><span>|</span><a href="#36820066">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36821490">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36822009">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36821072">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36823522">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36823522">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Historically, there have been far, far more documented lab leaks of SARS-CoV than there have been animal-human jumps<p>No. First of all, there were many jumps of SARS from animals into humans, over a period of months in which the markets containing infected animals were open. Second, while there were a few leaks of SARS-CoV after it had been discovered and was being grown in large quantities (these leaks were recognized immediately, too), there is no precedent for a previously unknown coronavirus leaking.<p>&gt; It is very possible that the virus was both zoonotic in origin, and leaked from the lab.<p>Not really. If the virus is natural in origin (which is a certainty now) and completely unknown before the initial outbreak (also a virtual certainty now), the chance that it somehow entered a lab, unknown, and then exited again are basically zero, compared to the chance that it spilled over in any one of the many millions of daily interactions between humans and wild or farmed animals.<p>They were selling farmed wild animals that we know can carry SARS-CoV-2 at the Huanan market, and that&#x27;s where the initial outbreak was centered.

There&#x27;s simply no evidence that anyone at the Wuhan Institute of Virology had or knew about this virus before the outbreak, and we have a very good idea of what the WIV was researching.</div><br/><div id="36823579" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36823579" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwawaymaths</span><span>|</span><a href="#36820066">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36823522">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36824086">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36823579">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36823579">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re wrong.

I think that scientists are more likely to abuse the trust because it&#x27;s implicit. You can&#x27;t expect to abuse someone&#x27;s trust in you (e.g. as a scientist) if you don&#x27;t expect people to trust you. All the people you listed as untrustworthy are <i>obviously</i> untrustworthy, which is what makes them not a serious risk.  Saying &quot;I really want to trust scientists&quot; is the same as saying &quot;If you want to exploit me, use a scientist to do it.&quot; I don&#x27;t think you need to look any further than the Tobacco industry to see why blindly trusting scientists is not a viable mitigation to propaganda.<p>I don&#x27;t really have a good answer for how to make a good decision when you&#x27;re ignorant (trusting scientists would make this easier), and we&#x27;re all ignorant about most things. Being skeptical doesn&#x27;t give you good knowledge, it just mitigates absorbing bad knowledge.

Truth-seeking is time-consuming and will always be inherently trading off against other local incentives, like writing quickly, writing exciting things, and writing things that your audience will like. If almost all journalists have to bust their ass just to survive, a truth-seeking culture won&#x27;t thrive.<p>I think there are three main ways I can see things getting better:<p>1. Governments and academia have lots of money, but the money gets fed into a system of incentives that make academics not that good at either truth-seeking or popularizing their own work. This could change.<p>2. There is a large population of smart people who collectively can do a lot of truth-seeking and writing in their spare time, without needing to make money from it. However, right now there&#x27;s not a particularly coherent way that those people can work together and produce collective information that is as easy to find and understand as mainstream media outlets. Improving technology to let amateurs work together and aggregate their opinions could be powerful.<p>3. The funding model for journalism could continue to evolve so that people who choose to do so can more directly fund truth-seeking journalism. Crowdfunding and self-publishing platforms are in this direction. This seems to me like it&#x27;s already working fairly well in some cases to fund people&#x27;s work, but then the attention market is not great at highlighting the more reliable voices, which is similar to the problem in point #2.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36819932" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36819932" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ctrlp</span><span>|</span><a href="#36820124">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36819741">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36819932">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36819932">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Nate Silver fundamentally misunderstands his own role in the information ecosystem.

Because people are people, and despite the uncertainty, they started treating lack of evidence as &quot;facts&quot;.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36819800" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36819800" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jxramos</span><span>|</span><a href="#36823874">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36821434">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36819800">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36819800">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Don&#x27;t be incurious, be curious and sensitive to what you understand and what you don&#x27;t follow.

Highly recommended.<p>- don’t plan a trip around a rocket launch. They get scrubbed all the time. Find something else you want to do in the area (even a few hours away, such as Miami) and then make a game time decision to go if the launch is likely to happen. That said, the Kennedy space center visitors complex is fantastic, especially with kids, and is worth a short trip with or without a launch.<p>- The article says to get there early. Personally I wouldn’t fret if watching in Florida. There’s lots of good places to watch from and given that launches happen almost weekly these days (and sometimes multiple times a day!), the crowds are not that crazy.<p>- it’s cool to see, but don’t overinflate expectations. I watched a Falcon 9 launch. It was fun. It was not as loud as expected. I understand that Falcon Heavies are louder (obviously the same goes for Starship). But at the end of the day you are pretty far away from these launches. It’s nothing like what you see on TV where the cameras are nearby.<p>- you need to tune in to a live broadcast to know what is going on during a launch, and if it is going to go ahead. Just keep in mind that there are delays in the broadcast, so by the time they are counting down to ten, the rocket might already have launched.<p>- personally I went to Cape Canaveral for one launch (I live 2.5 hours away by car) and I had fun. It was worth it but I wouldn’t go again, at least until starships launch from Florida. But I live in Miami and you can see the launches that happen at night, very clearly. The rocket is much brighter than any star and has a clear “rocket trail”. Anytime there’s a launch early enough at night, I try to take my kids to see it. It’s fun and definitely worth the five minute drive to a dark clearing. If you are in south Florida, check the launch schedules ahead of time and try to go outside and see one!</div><br/><div id="40912662" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40912662" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tanelpoder</span><span>|</span><a href="#40912633">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40912281">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40912662">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40912662">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Good list!<p>Also, the launch happens fast - if you plan to record it with your phone, set it up on a tripod or something before and not muck with it at all, you’ll miss the first seconds of the launch fast and by then the rocket is already pretty far up.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40912281" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40912281" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">malingo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40912633">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40912077">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40912281">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40912281">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve always loved Penn Jilette&#x27;s account of attending a space shuttle launch:

From beach or short walk back up entrance road for a good view across one of the ponds, depending on pad.<p>Chain of Lakes Park (Titusville) is a nice alternate. Huge park, tons of parking and space to watch. Really good views if you feel like sneaking across the railroad line on the shore. Hint: hide from any white railroad company trucks. Ignore the wooden viewing stand, as it&#x27;s camped out by tourists and photographers who can be territorial.<p>Was easy. Early is key to avoiding all the bullshit.

goods and how people value them. I think it&#x27;s that cargo cults (what
we have) are antithetical to true technological societies (which is
what we say we want)<p>A fault I see in Bruce Schneier&#x27;s article, and the general hypothesis
of &quot;frame&#x2F;baseline shifting&quot; - it&#x27;s not that people have been
conditioned or forgotten the value of privacy, but that we&#x27;re looking
at the world through ever smaller lenses. The story in the article is
that science is guilty of that too. The decline has been around
education and perspective in general, not just attitudes to a small
issue like &quot;privacy&quot;. We thought the internet would widen our
scope. It narrowed it.<p>In the UK we have a great travel and culture show by Romesh
Ranganathan. (I highly recommend it, so get on your VPN to watch BBC
or find it on the torrents). It will cheer you up [0]. He&#x27;s a funny
guy. But also the cultural vista is breath-taking. Looking at life in
central Africa it&#x27;s great to be reminded of the diversity of
humankind. Watch for the little things - like a whole bus queue of
people, none of whom are on mobile phones.<p>What the Internet promised - the great &quot;conversation of mankind&quot; -
never emerged. Instead we got cat memes and social control media that
forced people into ever smaller parochial silos. HN is no different.
Here it&#x27;s cool to have a bleak outlook on humanity and technology.
&quot;Oh it&#x27;s too late...  we&#x27;re doomed... oh woe is me!&quot;  C&#x27;mon
hackers... what happened to the joy of shaping the world? :)<p>Bruce Schneier appeals to a macro systems theory metaphor, and
mentions Daniel Pauly [1]. But he neglects some of the more profound
lessons that Forrester, Meadows and actually Norbert Weiner gave us
about feedback and the empty dream of cybernetic governance. Nothing
as big as humanity will fit in bottle that small unless you&#x27;re willing
to destroy it in the process. And what you&#x27;re destroying is the very
innovative base that gave you the technology in the first place.  This
is why they should teach history, geography and other cultures in
schools.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Romesh_Ranganathan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Romesh_Ranganathan</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oceans.ubc.ca&#x2F;2023&#x2F;05&#x2F;19&#x2F;daniel-pauly&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oceans.ubc.ca&#x2F;2023&#x2F;05&#x2F;19&#x2F;daniel-pauly&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="40594525" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40594525" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">whilenot-dev</span><span>|</span><a href="#40593986">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594137">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594231">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40594525">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40594525">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; We thought the internet would widen our scope. It narrowed it.<p>&gt; What the Internet promised - the great &quot;conversation of mankind&quot; - never emerged. Instead we got cat memes and social control media that forced people into ever smaller parochial silos.<p>The internet economy enabled browsing on a global scale and, because no kind of agency could keep up with its development speed, pushed everything into an &quot;on demand&quot; culture - what evolved with it is the higher responsibility for consumers. I feel the state of economy before the internet was on a scale of &quot;everything is possible&quot; (in the western hemisphere at least), only to discover years later that &quot;our greed has consequences we just couldn&#x27;t see before&quot;. Our cognitive load feels higher than ever to just cover the basics of survival and not get screwed over, or screw someone else over, constantly.<p>&gt; This is why they should teach history, geography and other cultures in schools.<p>I think system thinking should become a thing in schools early on too. Every defined system is a mere conceptual view with artificial boundaries - a system without boundaries isn&#x27;t a system, but a universe. It&#x27;s good to enable new resources to think about new systems, or rethink existing systems, but we also should discuss the boundaries required for its concept to make any sense.

They are one of the few tech companies in the world that actually understands how an Enteprise Organisation wants to buy IT and support, and they’ve only ever gotten better at it. As an example, when I worked for a Danish city, someone from Seattle would call us with updates on major incidents hourly.

Before Trikafta, I usually had a 5+ day stay in the hospital every year, and sometimes I have would very stubborn respiratory infections that just wouldn&#x27;t go away. I was mentally preparing myself for inevitable decline and eventual death.<p>Trikafta changed my situation dramatically. I&#x27;ve had no hospitalizations, and most the classic CF symptoms are either gone or extremely diminished. It can&#x27;t undo a life of damage to things like my pancreas, vas deferens, etc, and I still take medicine to digest my food, but overall, it&#x27;s as close to &quot;normal&quot; as I could hope for at this point.<p>The only real downside: weight gain. With CF the pancreas is blocked, so you lack in digestive enzymes, and it&#x27;s a struggle to maintain a healthy enough weight to battle respiratory infections. After Trikafta, I gained some 30 pounds, and have a big belly on my small frame, and went up some 6 inches in the waist. To add insult to injury, it happened during the spring and summer of 2020, when buying clothes was a challenge due to the pandemic.<p>Speaking of the pandemic, the timing of Trikafta was amazing: it kept the normally full &quot;CF floors&quot; of hospitals empty, opening up those beds for those with COVID and keeping CF patients less exposed.<p>One side effect I should mention: many report extreme anxiety. However, I was starting an anxiety medication for the first time (something I should have done 20 years ago, but alas ...) and so those effects were muted or hidden to me.<p>(copied from the last time Trikafta was mentioned here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37540731">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37540731</a>)</div><br/><div id="39656914" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39656914" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">joney_baloney</span><span>|</span><a href="#39653068">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39653154">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39656914">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39656914">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My younger brother has CF and takes Trikafta and it&#x27;s absolutely made all the difference in the world, it&#x27;s wonderful to see.

My guess is the following:
So with CF your pancreas canât secrete many of the enzymes that are necessary to actually digest food. You can take medications to help with that digestion, but regardless, you arenât actually getting all the calories in your food with CF because it isnât making its way into your body (notably patients with CF have steatorrhea which is fat in their stool because they canât absorb a lot of fat from their foods like a non-CF patient). The med helps the pancreas recover some of its ability to secrete digestive enzymes and so patients can now eat and get more from their food. The issue is that there needs to be a recalibration in terms of how much patients are eating. Previously a 2000 calorie diet may not have gotten them so far because they didnât absorb much of it, but now theyâre absorbing a lot more of it. Plus increased work of breathing with CF expends more calories compared to a non-CF patient (and patients on this drug).</div><br/><div id="39656867" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39656867" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">joney_baloney</span><span>|</span><a href="#39653068">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39655464">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39655455">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39656867">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39656867">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is exactly right.<p>Source: have CF.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39655455" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39655455" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bdcravens</span><span>|</span><a href="#39653068">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39655411">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39655464">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39655565">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39655455">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39655455">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Some of the blockage of the pancreas is due to scarring, some of it to thick mucus.

Like Trikafta, those drugs were not a cure, but they transformed AIDS from a terminal illness into a manageable chronic one. Young men got up from their deathbed, newly strong and hale. 
...
This was a remarkable turn of events. But it elicited a complicated mix of emotions, not all of them joyful. Some patients who were no longer dying grew depressed, anxious, and even suicidal at the thought of living. This phenomenon became known as âLazarus syndrome.â<p>Death is an end, after all. Life comes with problems...the writer Andrew Sullivan, who is HIV-positive, described life after the advent of the HIV drugs in his essay âWhen Plagues Endâ:</i><p><pre><code>   When you have spent several years girding yourself for the possibility of death, it is not so easy to gird yourself instead for the possibility of life. What you expect to greet with the euphoria of victory comes instead like the slow withdrawal of an excuse. And you resist it.
   The intensity with which you had learned to approach each day turns into a banality, a banality that refuses to understand or even appreciate the experience you have just gone through.
</code></pre>

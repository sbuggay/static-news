Before Trikafta, I usually had a 5+ day stay in the hospital every year, and sometimes I have would very stubborn respiratory infections that just wouldn&#x27;t go away. I was mentally preparing myself for inevitable decline and eventual death.<p>Trikafta changed my situation dramatically. I&#x27;ve had no hospitalizations, and most the classic CF symptoms are either gone or extremely diminished. It can&#x27;t undo a life of damage to things like my pancreas, vas deferens, etc, and I still take medicine to digest my food, but overall, it&#x27;s as close to &quot;normal&quot; as I could hope for at this point.<p>The only real downside: weight gain. With CF the pancreas is blocked, so you lack in digestive enzymes, and it&#x27;s a struggle to maintain a healthy enough weight to battle respiratory infections. After Trikafta, I gained some 30 pounds, and have a big belly on my small frame, and went up some 6 inches in the waist. To add insult to injury, it happened during the spring and summer of 2020, when buying clothes was a challenge due to the pandemic.<p>Speaking of the pandemic, the timing of Trikafta was amazing: it kept the normally full &quot;CF floors&quot; of hospitals empty, opening up those beds for those with COVID and keeping CF patients less exposed.<p>One side effect I should mention: many report extreme anxiety. However, I was starting an anxiety medication for the first time (something I should have done 20 years ago, but alas ...) and so those effects were muted or hidden to me.<p>(copied from the last time Trikafta was mentioned here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37540731">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37540731</a>)</div><br/><div id="39656914" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39656914" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">joney_baloney</span><span>|</span><a href="#39653068">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39653154">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39656914">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39656914">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My younger brother has CF and takes Trikafta and it&#x27;s absolutely made all the difference in the world, it&#x27;s wonderful to see.

My guess is the following:
So with CF your pancreas can’t secrete many of the enzymes that are necessary to actually digest food. You can take medications to help with that digestion, but regardless, you aren’t actually getting all the calories in your food with CF because it isn’t making its way into your body (notably patients with CF have steatorrhea which is fat in their stool because they can’t absorb a lot of fat from their foods like a non-CF patient). The med helps the pancreas recover some of its ability to secrete digestive enzymes and so patients can now eat and get more from their food. The issue is that there needs to be a recalibration in terms of how much patients are eating. Previously a 2000 calorie diet may not have gotten them so far because they didn’t absorb much of it, but now they’re absorbing a lot more of it. Plus increased work of breathing with CF expends more calories compared to a non-CF patient (and patients on this drug).</div><br/><div id="39656867" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39656867" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">joney_baloney</span><span>|</span><a href="#39653068">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39655464">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39655455">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39656867">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39656867">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is exactly right.<p>Source: have CF.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39655455" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39655455" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bdcravens</span><span>|</span><a href="#39653068">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39655411">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39655464">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39655565">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39655455">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39655455">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Some of the blockage of the pancreas is due to scarring, some of it to thick mucus.

The US is the least regulated pharmaceuticals market in the world and drugs here usually cost significantly more than drugs in other locals. For example semaglutide&#x2F;ozempic costs like 1300&#x2F;month in the US, but only 100-200&#x2F;month in European countries. Also, the &quot;1300&#x2F;month&quot; cost in the US is  only paid by people who are paying cash and not covered by insurance, if the drug is covered by the patients insurance than the Pharmacy benefits manager usually pays a fraction of the 1300&#x2F;month price as it is a &quot;bulk negotiated discount, so they often pay 200-300 USD, the actuall price in these deals is a closely guarded trade secret.</div><br/><div id="39656843" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39656843" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">glp1guide</span><span>|</span><a href="#39654059">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39655201">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39654506">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39656843">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39656843">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So note that although Semaglutide&#x2F;Ozempic cost that amount retail, most are absolutely not paying that price.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;glp1.guide&#x2F;content&#x2F;glp1-pricing-2024-02" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;glp1.guide&#x2F;content&#x2F;glp1-pricing-2024-02</a><p>Of course, insurers are struggling to not cover the bill, and although it&#x27;s in the medicaid list it&#x27;s up to states to choose whether to cover it or not</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39654506" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39654506" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nwiswell</span><span>|</span><a href="#39654059">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39655201">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39655622">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39654506">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39654506">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In many other countries, patents do not apply to personal use, where there is no sale.<p>Since Trikafta is a blend of 3 small-molecule drugs, is it possibly feasible to publish a do-it-yourself synthesis process?<p>Or perhaps the community could even come together to set up a lab, where individuals could travel and go through the motions to produce their own?<p>I recognize this isn&#x27;t ideal, but it might be legal...</div><br/><div id="39654960" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39654960" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">deadbabe</span><span>|</span><a href="#39654059">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39654506">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39655622">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39654960">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39654960">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you’re going to do all that why bother with legality, just push pills on a black market.</div><br/><div id="39655614" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39655614" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">A_D_E_P_T</span><span>|</span><a href="#39654059">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39654960">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39655622">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39655614">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39655614">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah.<p>In all seriousness, you can buy the APIs directly from China&#x2F;India and compound them yourself.

...
This was a remarkable turn of events. But it elicited a complicated mix of emotions, not all of them joyful. Some patients who were no longer dying grew depressed, anxious, and even suicidal at the thought of living. This phenomenon became known as “Lazarus syndrome.”<p>Death is an end, after all. Life comes with problems...the writer Andrew Sullivan, who is HIV-positive, described life after the advent of the HIV drugs in his essay “When Plagues End”:</i><p><pre><code>   When you have spent several years girding yourself for the possibility of death, it is not so easy to gird yourself instead for the possibility of life. What you expect to greet with the euphoria of victory comes instead like the slow withdrawal of an excuse. And you resist it.
   The intensity with which you had learned to approach each day turns into a banality, a banality that refuses to understand or even appreciate the experience you have just gone through.

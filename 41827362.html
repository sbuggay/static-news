The engineering team at SpaceX is really something. Some thoughts;<p>The &#x27;chopsticks catch&#x27; was amazing to watch. Seems like it adds a lot of risk and clearly the booster needs additional fire suppression systems :-) perhaps the tower could mount something that sprays the booster like the barges have for the F9 boosters.<p>The heatshield held out for a much longer time, the asymmetric heating on the flaps was interesting. I had guessed that all four flaps would have equivalent heating based on an approach that was basically that side of the rocket perpendicular to the flow but it seems like that isn&#x27;t the case. Still it seems like they are close to having something workable here.<p>The detonation at the end was pretty spectacular too, but I suspect that structurally the tanks failed as the rocket hit the water vs anything that was an engineering failure. Engineering it to be strong enough to land on water would presumably compromise the cargo to orbit number.<p>The use of Starlink was really interesting. The ability to get live video for the entire re-entry is pretty game changing for engineering. I&#x27;d guess there are even more &#x27;views&#x27; than they showed (there would be if I were running things :-)) but overall that capability is something that really helps evaluate the changes made.<p>I can easily imagine that flight 6 will be nominal end to end without any unintended damage. That would enable, perhaps, one of their &#x27;massive&#x27; Starlink missions to test cargo delivery. It will also start to give us some better numbers on exactly how much cargo Starship can put in orbit in &#x27;full reuse&#x27; mode  which is essential if they want to create a fueling station on orbit for the Artemis program.<p>Again, hats off to engineering at SpaceX, y&#x27;all did good.</div><br/><div id="41832072" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41832072" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rkagerer</span><span>|</span><a href="#41830516">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41830573">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41832072">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41832072">[35 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>Seems like it adds a lot of risk</i><p>I&#x27;m actually wondering about that.  If I understand correctly, the arms can move up and down, and pivot around the tower.  This allows them to correct for some error in the rocket trajectory and also (presumably) &quot;soften&quot; the final contact.  Between the nozzles and the arms, it gives SpaceX a lot of degrees of freedom in the final seconds (you can see how the booster kind of &quot;hovered&quot; right at the end) and in certain respects might even offer more forgiveness than the hard ground.<p>Could it smash into the tower?

Also you are in the middle of an ocean (Indian in this case) with potential for all kinds of weather on the way.

See when fighter jets land on aircraft carriers? There&#x27;s a cable that decelerates them. That, but for vertical landing.<p>The way these chopsticks are set forces the booster into a dangerous, snake like maneuver (a SnakeX maneuver) at the last second from a vertical setting, to get into the chopsticks. This maneuver is due to the fact chopsticks are short and the booster has to land on one point in space. No degrees of freedom.<p>Now, imagine if the chopsticks were long. The booster wouldn&#x27;t have to land at one specific point, but it could now land on a line. One degree of freedom.<p>Now replace the long chopsticks with cables, and then add another pair of cables perpendicular to them. So you have a pair of parallel cables perpendicular to a second pair of parallel cables. Now the booster doesn&#x27;t have to land on a <i>line</i>, but can land anywhere in the grid that&#x27;s covered by the cables. Two degrees of freedom.<p>Pushing this thought leads to having a sort of iris diaphragm, like the ones in optics, but an iris diaphragm of cables. The diaphragm is open when the booster is about to land, then closes in quickly. Imagine this[1], but it&#x27;s cables cinching in.<p>Now, it&#x27;s a diaphragm of cables, not a diaphragm of rigid beams, so I imagine the deceleration to be even smoother as the cables elongate, and an additional system of springs and dampers to counter the weight of the booster.<p>The booster is vertical and stays vertical. Granted, an unstable equilibrium, but it beats doing the SnakeX maneuver to get to the chopsticks, and that&#x27;s another story.<p>Now, imagine the iris cable diaphragm can move up and down like equipment handling containers, and now you have <i>three degrees of freedom</i>. That&#x27;s less control to worry about on the booster&#x27;s side at the worst possible moment, landing, where you can&#x27;t make adjustments anymore.<p>This not only means being more forgiving on mistakes related to position, but also on speed <i>and</i> angle. The diaphragm catches the booster at any angle, and given that it cinches way above the center of gravity, the booster goes back to a more stable vertical position.<p>For the fire, maybe you just need a big hole down there.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arresting_gear" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arresting_gear</a><p>- [1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Iris_Diaphragm.gif" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Iris_Diaphragm.gif</a></div><br/><div id="41835567" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41835567" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Cthulhu_</span><span>|</span><a href="#41830516">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41833812">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41834135">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41835567">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41835567">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a solution for a problem that&#x27;s already solved, that is, booster maneuverability and accuracy.

This relies on the same time-of-flight principle as GPS but instead of using satellites in orbit to provide the precise time information you rely on various nearby ground stations.

Since drag depends on velocity squared though, it had reduced to just above 10 m&#x2F;s^2 just before the engines lit at 1250 km&#x2F;h, and so would quickly become negligible once the engines lit.<p>Going by Wikipedia, the Super Heavy[1] has 3400000 kg of fuel at launch, so 3% of that is about 102000 kg. For the landing burn, it used 13 Raptor v3 engines[2] to scrub speed. Each Raptor flows about 650 kg&#x2F;s max, so 3% fuel is enough for about 12 seconds for the 13 engines.<p>The empty mass of the Super Heavy is about 275000 kg, so about 377000 kg before the landing burn with 3% fuel.<p>Using the sea-level vs vacuum performance of the Raptor v2 engines, one can estimate that each Raptor v3 produces about 2.45 NM of force at sea-level. So 13 of them would produce about 31.85 MN of force.<p>Using Newton&#x27;s second law, F=ma, this gives an initial deceleration of about 84 m&#x2F;s^2 and about 104 m&#x2F;s^2 when empty. If we do a rough spreadsheet integration, we get that a burn of roughly 4 seconds is needed to scrub the speed assuming no other forces.<p>Now, comparing this with reality, the full 13 engines were lit for a little over 5 seconds.<p>In my simplified calculations I was assuming full throttle the whole way, which obviously isn&#x27;t realistic, and I also assumed 3% fuel. So over all I think that&#x27;s a pretty decent estimation.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SpaceX_Super_Heavy#Engines" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SpaceX_Super_Heavy#Engines</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SpaceX_Raptor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SpaceX_Raptor</a></div><br/><div id="41830292" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41830292" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rsync</span><span>|</span><a href="#41827495">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41829231">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41831034">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41830292">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41830292">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;...

It&#x27;s one of the (several) reasons hydrogen isn&#x27;t quite as good for rockets in practice as it is in theory - while hydrogen has tons of energy per unit mass (120-142 MJ&#x2F;kg for hydrogen vs. 50-55 MJ&#x2F;kg for methane and 43.1-46.2 MJ&#x2F;kg), it has a far lower density (70.85 kg&#x2F;m3 vs. 422.8 kg&#x2F;m3 for liquid methane and 820 kg&#x2F;m3 for kerosene). As a result, you need quite a bit more tankage for a given amount of energy from hydrogen compared to what methane&#x2F;kerosene requires.<p>IIRC there&#x27;s a tradeoff between efficiency and thrust as well. Heavier fuels aren&#x27;t quite as energy-efficient, but it&#x27;s easier for them to develop a lot of thrust, which is important for the initial stages of launch. If I&#x27;m remembering events described in <i>Ignition!</i> correctly this led to &quot;thrust density&quot; being something that was optimized for - to the point that there were experiments with mixing mercury into the fuel!<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;world-nuclear.org&#x2F;information-library&#x2F;facts-and-figures&#x2F;heat-values-of-various-fuels" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;world-nuclear.org&#x2F;information-library&#x2F;facts-and-figu...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kerosene" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kerosene</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41833054" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41833054" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ylere</span><span>|</span><a href="#41827495">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41830605">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41831634">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41830420">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41833054">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41833054">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Correction (can&#x27;t edit the post anymore): As another commenter pointed out, the rocket can carry 3.4M kg of fuel, not 34M kg.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41830420" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41830420" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CrazyStat</span><span>|</span><a href="#41827495">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41830292">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41830605">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41831034">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41830420">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41830420">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">3.4 million, not 34 million.

So<p><pre><code>    v(t+dt) = v(t) + a * dt
</code></pre>
The acceleration comes from F=ma as mentioned, where F is the force of the engines (Newtons), m is the mass of the rocket (kg) and a is the acceleration (m&#x2F;s^2). Solving for a we get a = F&#x2F;m and we get<p><pre><code>    v(t+dt) = v(t) + F&#x2F;m(t) * dt
</code></pre>
To make things easy I assumed the weight of the rocket was constant at each timestep, but if we take dt to be small enough it&#x27;s a decent enough approximation. For each timestep I also updated the mass using the estimated mass flow:<p><pre><code>   m(t+dt) = m(t) - 650 * dt

I started with m(0) = 377000 kg, v(0) = 1250 km&#x2F;h = 347 m&#x2F;s, and a constant -31850000 N force from the engines.<p>Using dt = 0.1 seconds, I got almost exactly 4 seconds until the velocity reached zero.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Euler_method" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Euler_method</a></div><br/><div id="41833777" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41833777" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">magicalhippo</span><span>|</span><a href="#41827495">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41831191">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41834187">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41833777">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41833777">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; 650 * dt<p>That should of course be 13 * 650 * dt.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41834187" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41834187" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nine_k</span><span>|</span><a href="#41827495">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41831034">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41831191">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41831181">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41834187">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41834187">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Newton&#x27;s laws of mechanics are high-school physics IIRC; my son studied them at 8th grade or so.

($591mm and $20,512 in 2024 dollars, respectively [2].) SpaceX’s <i>prices</i> per kg are around $3,170 on Falcon 9 [3] and $1,520 for Falcon Heavy [4]. Starship should bring those costs below $1000.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.nasaspaceflight.com&#x2F;index.php?topic=51959.0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.nasaspaceflight.com&#x2F;index.php?topic=51959.0</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Space_Shuttle_program" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Space_Shuttle_program</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usinflationcalculator.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usinflationcalculator.com&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spacex.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;Capabilities&amp;Services.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spacex.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;Capabilities&amp;Services.pdf</a> <i>LEO</i><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Falcon_Heavy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Falcon_Heavy</a> <i>LEO, theoretical</i></div><br/><div id="41828056" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41828056" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vardump</span><span>|</span><a href="#41827475">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41827982">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41827822">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41828056">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41828056">[23 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Starship should bring those costs below $1000.<p>It might even bring the costs below $100&#x2F;kg.</div><br/><div id="41828255" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41828255" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ben_w</span><span>|</span><a href="#41827475">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41828056">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41827822">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41828255">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41828255">[22 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It might, but it&#x27;s also at a scale where people can dust off the old plans for orbital rings and ask if this time the economics work out.<p>(My guess is the economics are fine, but the politics would kill it on earth, so the moon or mars will get one, but that&#x27;s just an interested amateur opinion).</div><br/><div id="41828330" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41828330" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vardump</span><span>|</span><a href="#41827475">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41828255">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41828513">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41828330">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41828330">[20 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Once you put something <i>big</i> in the LEO, you&#x27;ll have to be able to boost its orbit indefinitely, because the orbit will otherwise slowly decay.</div><br/><div id="41828528" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41828528" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">piombisallow</span><span>|</span><a href="#41827475">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41828330">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41833342">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41828528">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41828528">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you have the infrastructure to build an orbital ring, you have the infrastructure to keep it supplied too</div><br/><div id="41829284" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41829284" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pantalaimon</span><span>|</span><a href="#41827475">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41828528">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41833342">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41829284">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41829284">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is some SciFi story about civilization collapsing and the survivors worrying that the sky will fall on them hidden in there.</div><br/><div id="41831482" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41831482" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Vecr</span><span>|</span><a href="#41827475">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41829284">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41829540">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41831482">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41831482">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Already exists, <i>Chasm City</i> by Alastair Reynolds.

I think the vertical landing is the main difference. Vertical landing was obviously known and done by NASA, this is how the lunar modules landed on the Moon. But doing it on Earth, with vehicles weighing hundreds of times more, I don&#x27;t think the world had that technical readiness a few decades ago, when the space shuttle was designed.<p>And another major difference is the mass manufacturing idea. From the start SpaceX planned for getting to mass manufacture its rockets. The Falcon rockets are much cheaper than any other alternatives even if you remove the reusability.<p>Then it&#x27;s the methane burning engines. This was pure old fashioned engineering progress. SpaceX&#x27;s engines are miracles of rocket engineering. Aside from that, the fuel choice is extremely smart. Methane is better than all other fuels, except for hydrogen. Hydrogen was the fuel of the space shuttle, but it&#x27;s very tricky to work with. It has very low volumetric density, so the tank of the space shuttle was absolutely humongous. Hydrogen needs to be stored at an absurdly low cryogenic temperature, so this adds to the complexity.

I don&#x27;t know how much work was done to the engines between launches, but SpaceX&#x27;s parts and cost reduction on the Raptor engine have to give it an advantage there.<p>StarShip consists of the Super Heavy booster that we saw &quot;caught&quot; today, and the StarShip (orbiter) itself. Having the booster return to launch site vs requiring ocean recovery should potentially increase cadence and reduce cost of reuse. StarShip is also meant to be reusable, although it remains to be seen how that will pan out. On the previous flight there was burn through from inadequate heat shielding - maybe we&#x27;ll see an improvement with today&#x27;s vehicle. I&#x27;d expect SpaceX to iteratively arrive at a quicker and more cost effective orbiter reuse procedure than NASA had with the shuttle, but how quick remains to be seen.

Proposed Falcon and Dragon variants were abandoned as was Dragon propulsive landing. They abandoned carbon fiber construction and multiple concepts for Starship&#x2F;Heavy.<p>The tiles in combination with ablative materials and the insane robustness of a steel vehicle is sufficient to get Starship through re-entry and soft land in the ocean. We know ceramic thermal tiles worked on Shuttle and X37B and presumably will on Dreamchaser so while the success was an awesome achievement it wasn&#x27;t unlikely given time to refine their methods.<p>SpaceX are limited by the properties of real materials, not their ambitions, and we still don&#x27;t know if rapidly reusability is possible with ceramic tiles or if their fragility will require inspections and refurbishment. They can&#x27;t do it with ablatives and there aren&#x27;t many other options. I am optimistic but also realistic about the difficulties of what they are attempting.

People were calling the &#x27;chopstick&#x27; landing system a dumb idea until today.<p>It&#x27;s not like engineers don&#x27;t come up with wild ideas all the time to their leadership, but is the leadership good enough to understand the good ideas from bad ones? Take the risk, spend billions to actually execute?<p>Elon has enough of a physics&#x2F;engineering background to ask the right questions, understand the trades engineers put in front of him, and make the risk&#x2F;reward calculation to make the right decisions the ends up winning.<p>To get what SpaceX has you need strong technical leadership all the way up the chain.

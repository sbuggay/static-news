Nobody&#x27;s doing 4nm fabrication in their garage, I reasoned, but surely we could get to ~10um.<p>As I read more about the dark art of IC fabrication, though, I realized that even this was a faint dream. I had imagined a world of lasers carving troughs, and print heads carefully placing down the lines and doping the silicon, an elegant symphony of modern technology.<p>But the real world is much messier -- every stage involves dangerous and toxic chemicals, processes that are spoiled by a spec of dust in the wrong place, either causing a cascade of reagent failures or a physical impediment to correctness; distressingly analog and oh so messy and built by trial and error and refined by domain experts in ways that are intensely hard to replicate because all the same lessons need to be learned again each time.<p>I&#x27;m glad to see the work being done here for hobbyist fabrication, but barring huge leaps and bounds, the gap between the neat lines in Magic and the shiny silicon discs is a vast chasm owned by the material scientists, not the electrical engineers or the software engineers.</div><br/><div id="42053231" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42053231" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">duped</span><span>|</span><a href="#42052660">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42054151">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42053231">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42053231">[16 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">University labs (with the right funding) can totally do this, it&#x27;s just not cheap.

Even in industry, there are small scale labs that are used to develop the processes before they get built out at scale.<p>&gt; If so how come only a few companies like tsmc and that one Dutch company are able to manufacture microchips?<p>There are thousands of chip manufacturers worldwide. TSMC is just the largest&#x2F;most cutting edge. ASML is the company that makes special tools for IC manufacturing (however, researchers can&#x2F;do experiment with the things that ASML is doing on smaller scales).<p>But keep in mind - no researcher at a university is trying to manufacture millions of 3nm CPUs for next year&#x27;s iPhone. Just as an example, today we have GaN switches in our 100+W USB-C chargers that fit in your pocket.

But as a prototype process, it works fine. There are a few hobbyists doing this.[1]<p>E-beam systems are basically scanning electron microscopes with more power.

It&#x27;s all computer-controlled, of course.<p>This has many advantages. Software can correct for nonlinearities in the scanning. The machine can inspect what it&#x27;s written by scanning at low power.<p>You still have to coat and etch; it&#x27;s not a dry process.

I don&#x27;t think the fixed infrastructure is necessarily the problem (i.e. building the fab) as there&#x27;s enough capacity for cheap chips in volume, meaning each additional wafer isn&#x27;t the cost limiting factor.

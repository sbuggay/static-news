In my case, it&#x27;s months and years. Even a decade for one project. The problem with you and me is that we like the creative part of problem-solving. We like to think about solutions. But once we figure it out, we are bored with it and want to move on to the next challenge. And there is nothing wrong with that, that&#x27;s a role that not many fit and most prefer instructions to do their job. And it can be very lucrative role to play in the industry, if you have the skill and knowledge for big and mid tech companies. So my advice is to do that - become a part of a project where you will be the architect or hire people to help you materialize your projects. That way you take your creativity and problem-solving skills and join them with the skills of people who like to code by the book.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35936476" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35936476" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mdp2021</span><span>|</span><a href="#35936475">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35936456">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35936476">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35936476">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is plenty of literature, especially practical literature: an example can be &quot;Eat that frog ...

If you want a better chance of finishing one them, then start with the parts that you regard as the least interesting and most tedious.
